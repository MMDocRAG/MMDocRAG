However, by 2016, this sentiment had shifted dramatically. Republican and Republican-leaning voters increasingly favored a more conservative direction, with 60% preferring the GOP to move in a conservative direction compared to 36% who favored moderation [7].

After Obama's victories in 2008 and 2012, only about a third of Democratic voters wanted the party to move left [9].

In 2014, 50% held this view, which dropped to 46% by December 2015, as shown in image4. This indicates a slight decrease in the share of the public associating Islam with violence, though the views remain polarized.\n\nPolitically, Republicans have consistently been more likely to associate Islam with violence. In 2015, 68% of Republicans believed Islam encourages violence more than other religions, a slight increase from 67% in September 2014 and a historical high [6]. This is reflected in image5, which shows a steady rise in Republican views associating Islam with violence over the years, peaking at 68% in 2015. In contrast, Democrats have become less likely to hold this view, with 30% in 2015, down from 42% in September 2014 [6].

As stated in [9], a substantial majority of Americans (85%) favor this policy, with nearly half (47%) strongly in favor. This aligns with the image4 data, which shows that 47% strongly favor limiting machines to dangerous or unhealthy jobs, while only 3% strongly oppose it. This indicates a clear preference for reserving certain hazardous tasks for machines.\n\nSecondly, the public is divided on whether businesses should be allowed to replace human jobs with machines. According to [7], 58% of Americans believe there should be limits on how many jobs businesses can replace with machines, while 41% think businesses are justified in replacing humans if machines can do a better job at a lower cost. This division is visually represented in image2, where 58% support limits on job replacement, even if machines are better and cheaper.\n\nPartisan differences are noted in [2] and [3], with Democrats more likely than Republicans to support policies like universal income and national service programs for displaced workers. However, both parties largely agree on limiting machines to dangerous jobs.

This preference has been stable over recent years.\n- **Image2**: Shows that from 2008 to 2016, the percentage of Republicans wanting a more conservative direction remained around 60%, indicating little change in their political orientation.\n- **Image5**: Trump voters overwhelmingly (94%) were happy with the GOP retaining congressional control, reflecting their alignment with conservative policies.\n\n### Democratic Voters:\n- **Text [7] and [9]**: Democratic voters have shifted towards a more liberal stance. In 2016, 49% wanted the party to move left, up from 38% in 2014 and 33% after Obama's victories.\n- **Image3**: Illustrates this shift, with 49% favoring a more liberal direction in 2016, compared to 33% in 2008 and 2012.\n- **Image5**: Clinton voters were largely unhappy (87%) with the GOP retaining control, indicating dissatisfaction with the election outcome and a desire for a more liberal direction.\n\n### Comparison to 2016 Election Reactions:\n- **Text [8]**: The partisan divide was larger in 2016 than in 2008 regarding cooperation between parties.\n- **Image4**: Shows that while 59% of all voters were willing to give Trump a chance, only 35% of Clinton voters felt the same, highlighting deep partisan divisions.\n- **Image5**: Reflects that 52% of all voters were happy with the GOP's control, but this was driven by Trump voters (94% happy), while Clinton voters were predominantly unhappy (87%).\n\n### Conclusion:\nRepublican voters have consistently favored conservatism, with little shift over time, aligning with their positive reaction to the 2016 election outcome. In contrast, Democratic voters have increasingly favored liberalism, especially post-2016, contrasting sharply with their negative reaction to the election results. This"}

In 2008, after Barack Obama's election, there was a strong inclination for cooperation. According to text [9], nearly eight-in-ten (78%) of Obama’s voters and 76% of McCain’s voters believed Democratic leaders should work with Republicans, even if it meant disappointing their supporters. This sentiment is reflected in image1, which shows that in November 2008, 86% of Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters wanted leaders to work with Obama, while only 11% wanted them to stand up to him. Similarly, 59% of Republican and Republican-leaning voters favored cooperation.\n\nIn contrast, by 2016, the sentiment had shifted, particularly among Democratic voters. Text [4] indicates that 65% of Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters wanted their leaders to stand up to Donald Trump, even if less gets done in Washington, compared to only 32% who favored cooperation. Image1 supports this, showing that in November 2016, 65% of Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters wanted leaders to stand up to Trump, while 32% wanted them to work with him. This represents a significant change from 2008, where 86% of Democrats favored cooperation with Obama.\n\nAdditionally, text [8] highlights that Democratic support for cooperation with Trump was substantially lower than GOP support for working with Obama in 2008. Image2 further illustrates this divide, showing that in 2016, 84% of Clinton voters wanted Trump to work with Democratic leaders, while only 26% of Trump voters agreed. This stark contrast underscores the heightened partisan tension in 2016 compared to 2008.\n\nOverall, the data indicates a notable shift towards partisan division and a preference for confrontation over cooperation among Democratic voters in 2016, compared to the more collaborative sentiment observed in 2008. \n\n**Answer:** Voter expectations shifted from a preference for cooperation in 2008 to a preference for confrontation in 2016, particularly among Democrats, reflecting increased partisan tension."}

According to text [7], fully 92% of voters felt there was more \"mudslinging\" or negative campaigning than in past elections, a sentiment echoed in image1, which shows a sharp increase in the percentage of voters perceiving more mudslinging compared to previous elections. This level of negativity is unprecedented, surpassing even the 2004 election, which previously held the highest percentage at 72%.\n\nThis pervasive negativity likely influenced voters' evaluations of political entities. Text [8] highlights that post-election evaluations of the winning candidate, the parties, the press, and pollsters were far more negative than in any previous election since 1988. Image4 provides specific grades: only 30% of voters gave Trump an A or B, while the Republican Party received a 22% approval, and the Democratic Party a 26%. The press and pollsters fared even worse, with only 22% and 21% respectively receiving A or B grades. This widespread dissatisfaction is further underscored by text [3], which notes that just 22% of voters gave the press a high grade, and 38% gave it a failing grade.\n\nMoreover, the negative campaign atmosphere contributed to a lack of confidence in the electoral process itself. Text [4] reveals that only 40% of voters gave \"the voters\" a grade of A or B, the lowest percentage since 1996. This self-criticism suggests that voters felt the negativity impacted their own decision-making, as seen in image5, where 60% of all voters felt the election results should be respected, but a significant 35% did not, indicating a deep-seated distrust.\n\nThe emotional divide between Trump and Clinton voters also reflects this negativity. Text [1] shows stark contrasts: 96% of Trump voters felt hopeful, while 90% of Clinton voters felt uneasy. Image3 quantifies these emotions, with 51% of all voters feeling hopeful and 53% uneasy, illustrating the polarized emotional landscape.

This aligns with the text indicating that 96% of Trump voters felt hopeful and 74% felt proud [6]. In contrast, Clinton voters were overwhelmingly negative, with \"shocked\" being the most common reaction, followed by \"disappointed\" and \"disgusted\" [image3], [8]. This mirrors the text, which notes that 90% of Clinton voters felt uneasy, 77% sad, and 76% scared [6].\n\nThe overall perception of Trump's performance was mixed. While 30% of voters gave Trump an A or B, reflecting some approval, the majority of voters graded other campaign actors, including the Republican and Democratic parties, poorly, with failing grades being the highest share since 1988 [3], [4]. This negative grading is consistent with the image showing that only 22% of voters gave the Republican Party an A or B, and 26% gave the Democratic Party the same [image4].\n\nThe election was also marked by a high level of negativity, with 92% of voters perceiving more mudslinging than in past elections, a 20 percentage point increase from the previous high in 2004 [7], [image1].

According to federal government data, the Hispanic unemployment rate fell from a high of 12.8% in the first quarter of 2010 to 6.4% in the last quarter of 2015, and further to 5.6% in the first quarter of 2016. However, it remains above its pre-recession low of 5% in the fourth quarter of 2006 and is still higher than the non-Hispanic rate of 4.8% in the fourth quarter of 2015. This trend is illustrated in image5, which shows the quarterly unemployment rates for both groups, highlighting that while both have improved since the Great Recession, Hispanics consistently have a higher rate.\n\n### Income\n\nMedian household income for Hispanics has stagnated since the Great Recession. In 2014, it was $42,491, essentially unchanged since 2008. In contrast, the median income for all U.S. households was $53,700 in 2014, also showing little change. Image2 provides a visual comparison, showing that while both groups experienced a decline during the recession, Hispanic incomes have not recovered as much as those of all households. The gap between the two groups has persisted, with Hispanic incomes remaining significantly lower.\n\n### Poverty Rate\n\nThe Hispanic poverty rate in 2014 was 23.6%, down from a peak of 26.5% in 2010 but still above pre-recession levels. This is higher than the overall U.S. poverty rate of 14.8% in 2014. Image2 also highlights this disparity, showing the Hispanic poverty rate consistently higher than the national average over the years.\n\n### Wealth\n\nHispanic households experienced the largest percentage decline in net worth through 2009 among major racial or ethnic groups and continued to lose wealth after the recession, unlike white households. Image2 further illustrates this, showing that while all households saw a decline in wealth during the recession, Hispanic households had a steeper drop and a slower recovery. By 2013, Hispanic household wealth was $13,700, compared to $81,400 for all households.\n\n### Conclusion"}

In contrast, women are slightly more likely to see supportive behaviors, with 24% frequently observing kindness, compared to 17% of men [10]. Both genders, however, predominantly see an equal mix of supportive and bullying behaviors (52% of men and 56% of women) [10], as well as an equal mix of deceptive and corrective behaviors (58% of men and 67% of women) [5].\n\nThis perception aligns with the frequent exposure to dramatic or exaggerated content, with 58% of users seeing such posts frequently [3]. Similarly, 59% frequently encounter people making accusations or starting arguments without all the facts [3].

However, when it comes to requiring government-issued photo identification to vote, there are notable differences. Only a narrow majority of White Democrats (54%) favor this requirement, while larger shares of Black (65%), Hispanic (72%), and Asian Democrats (71%) support it [6]. This suggests that while White Democrats are supportive of broader voting accessibility, they are less enthusiastic about photo ID requirements compared to their non-White counterparts.\n\nIn contrast, Republicans show a stark divide by race. White Republicans are less supportive of easing voting policies than Hispanic Republicans. For instance, 51% of Hispanic Republicans favor automatically registering all eligible citizens to vote, compared to 35% of White Republicans [3]. This indicates that Hispanic Republicans are more aligned with policies that expand voting access than White Republicans.\n\nBlack adults are distinctive in their support for expansive voting policies. They are substantially more likely than other racial groups to favor allowing people convicted of felonies to vote after serving their sentences (85% vs. about 70% for White, Hispanic, and Asian Americans) [7]. Additionally, Black adults show lower support for restrictive policies, such as removing people from registration lists for inactivity or requiring photo ID [5].\n\nOverall, White adults are less likely to favor making Election Day a national holiday and automatic voter registration than Black, Hispanic, and Asian adults [4]. This highlights a broader trend where non-White groups are more supportive of policies that increase voting accessibility.\n\nThe image evidence further illustrates these points. Image1 shows that while 54% of White adults support photo ID requirements, 96% of Black, 90% of Hispanic, and 90% of Asian adults support it, indicating higher support among non-White groups. Image3 and Image4 reinforce this, showing higher support for other voting policies among non-White groups. Image5 indicates that Black and Hispanic adults are more supportive of early or absentee voting options compared to White adults, aligning with their broader support for voting accessibility.\n\nIn summary, racial and political affiliations significantly influence perspectives on voting policies. Non-White Democrats and Republicans are generally more supportive of both accessibility and restrictive measures like photo ID compared to their White counterparts, reflecting deeper divides within parties on voting rights issues."}

By April 2021, this support had declined to 38%, a 19 percentage point drop [5]. This shift is also reflected in image2, which shows a decrease from 57% in October 2018 to 38% in April 2021.\n  - Conversely, the share of Republicans favoring restrictions, i.e., requiring a documented reason, increased from 42% in October 2018 to 62% in April 2021 [2].

According to the data, Palo Alto University saw a 38% increase in ridership from 2012 to 2014, while Mountain View experienced a 16% increase over the same period [3]. This rapid growth is compounded by the fact that trains are already overcrowded, as evidenced by the image of a packed train car ![Train car filled with standing and seated passengers, indicating overcrowding](image1).

The USA has the largest bubble, indicating the highest emissions per capita among the countries listed, followed by Germany, with China having a significantly smaller bubble. This suggests that the USA has the highest CO2 emissions per capita, while China has the lowest among the three.\n- **Image4** provides a pie chart breaking down CO2 emissions by sector. The transportation sector accounts for 24% of global CO2 emissions, which is a significant portion. Given that the USA has high per capita emissions, it implies a substantial contribution from the transportation sector in the USA.\n\n### Motor Vehicle Ownership\n- **Image2** presents a bar chart showing per capita motor vehicle ownership. The USA has the highest ownership at 8080 kg oil equivalent, followed by Germany at 4026 kg, and China at 597 kg. This indicates that the USA has the highest motor vehicle ownership per capita, while China has the lowest.\n\n### Implications for Environmental Impact\n- The high CO2 emissions per capita in the USA, combined with high motor vehicle ownership, suggest a significant environmental impact from transportation. The USA's large bubble in Image3 and high value in Image2 indicate a strong link between vehicle use and emissions.\n- Germany, with moderate emissions per capita and ownership, shows a balance between vehicle use and emissions, possibly due to more efficient vehicles or policies.\n- China, with low emissions per capita and ownership, suggests a lower current environmental impact from transportation. However, **Image1** notes that South Korea is expected to have rising GHG emissions from passenger vehicles, implying that China might follow a similar trend as its vehicle ownership increases.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe USA has the highest CO2 emissions per capita and motor vehicle ownership, leading to a significant environmental impact from transportation. Germany has moderate values, indicating a balanced approach, while China, with low current values, may face increasing emissions as vehicle ownership grows. This implies that the USA needs to focus on reducing emissions from its large vehicle fleet, Germany can serve as a model for balanced growth, and China should implement measures to prevent a rise in emissions as vehicle ownership increases.\n\n![CO2 emissions per"}

In contrast, the USA's total capital invested is not explicitly shown, but **image1** indicates that the USA has a higher total capital invested (82%) compared to Europe (18%) since 2004, suggesting a larger overall investment base in the USA.\n\n**Exit Multiples and Efficiency:**\n\n- **Image3** reveals that the median multiple of cash invested for Europe is 7.2, compared to 4.5 in the USA. This indicates higher capital efficiency in Europe, as noted in **text [7]**, which states that European VC has a 70% higher capital efficiency than the US. Additionally, **text [10]** mentions that Europe produces higher exit multiples despite smaller average exit values, due to lower entry valuations and higher capital efficiency.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nWhile the USA has historically invested more capital, Europe has shown stronger exit multiples and capital efficiency over the last 24 months. The liquidity events in Europe, totaling $15 billion, reflect a robust market, though the USA likely has higher absolute investment volumes. The data suggests that European venture capital is more efficient, yielding better returns relative to investments.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nOver the last 24 months, Europe has demonstrated higher capital efficiency and exit multiples compared to the USA, with venture-backed liquidity events totaling $15 billion.

Initially, the user's input is encoded using a bidirectional LSTM utterance encoder, as shown in ![A diagram illustrating the system architecture, including the Bi-LSTM Utterance Encoder and LSTM Dialogue State](image2). This encoding, along with the previous system action, is fed into a dialogue-level LSTM, which maintains a continuous representation of the dialogue state [4]. The dialogue state is then used by the dialogue state tracker to update the estimated user goals, represented as slot-value pairs [7]. \n\nBased on this state, the system formulates a query command to retrieve information from a knowledge base. The results from the knowledge base are encoded and combined with the dialogue state and user goal tracking outputs to produce a dialogue action via the policy network [4]. This action is then used by the natural language generator (NLG) to create the final system response. The NLG replaces delexicalized tokens in a template with values from the user's goal or the knowledge base results, as described in [6].\n\nThe policy network, which selects the next system action, takes inputs including the dialogue-level LSTM state, log probabilities of candidate values from the belief tracker, and the encoding of query results [1][9].

The study quantifies these costs by estimating the energy required to train various models and converting this to carbon emissions [2][7]. For instance, training BERT on a GPU is roughly equivalent to a trans-American flight [10]. This comparison highlights the substantial carbon footprint of model training.\n\nImage5 provides a direct comparison of CO₂ emissions from training NLP models to everyday activities. It shows that training a model like BERT on a GPU emits approximately 1,984 lbs of CO₂, which is equivalent to a single person's air travel from New York to San Francisco and back. This is a significant amount, especially when considering that a human life, on average, emits 11,023 lbs of CO₂ per year, and an American life emits 36,156 lbs per year. The emissions from training a single model can thus be comparable to a substantial portion of an individual's annual carbon footprint.\n\nAdditionally, image2 and image4 illustrate the energy consumption and costs associated with training different models. For example, training NAS on P100x8 GPUs results in 626,155 kWh of energy consumption, which is a massive amount compared to typical household or personal activities. This underscores the environmental impact of model training.\n\nIn summary, the CO₂ emissions from training NLP models can be comparable to or even exceed the emissions from significant everyday activities like air travel, highlighting the need for more efficient practices in NLP research.\n\n**Answer:** Training NLP models can emit CO₂ equivalent to significant everyday activities, such as a trans-American flight, and can approach a substantial portion of an individual's annual carbon footprint."}

Not using spatial positional encodings leads to a significant drop in AP. However, passing them only in the decoder results in a minor drop. Learned embeddings are shared across layers, and output positional encodings are crucial.\n- [4] and [8] discuss how the model generalizes to unseen numbers of instances and how each decoder slot specializes in predicting certain areas and box sizes, indicating the role of positional encodings in guiding these specializations.\n\n**Image Analysis:**\n- **image4** shows a table comparing different configurations of spatial and output positional encodings. The baseline configuration (sine at attention for both encoder and decoder, learned at attention for output) achieves the highest AP of 40.6.

This aligns with the text's observation that NER tasks may reach a stable or degraded performance with increased demo numbers.\n\n### Comparison with Other Models\nImage1 provides a comparative analysis of F1 scores across different models (e.g., Fine-tuning, FSL-S, UIE, ChatGPT, Codex, InstructGPT, LLaMA, Vicuna) on the FewNERD dataset. It shows that while ChatGPT and Codex perform reasonably well, they are outperformed by fine-tuned models (dashed lines) as the number of shots increases. This is consistent with text [5], which states that SLMs significantly outperform LLMs with more samples, and text [8], which notes that LLMs plateau with modest increases in sample size, whereas SLMs continue to improve.\n\n### Inference Speed and Cost\nText [2] and image4 highlight that LLMs like ChatGPT and Codex are much slower and more costly than SLMs due to their larger parameters and longer input contexts"}

For example, Davinci's Micro-F1 increases from 18.0% to 25.3% with CoT and logical constraints, and LI drops from 53.3% to 37.9%.\n- **image2** illustrates an example where Llama-2-13B-PT correctly identifies event relationships after training with logical constraints, unlike the untrained Llama-2-13B.\n- **image3** shows that using retrieved logical constraints generally improves Micro-F1 and reduces LI compared to using all logical constraints. For instance, Davinci's MAVEN-ERE Micro-F1 increases from 27.0% to 27.8% with retrieved constraints, and LI drops from 25.6% to 28.8%.\n- **image4** graphs demonstrate that adding logical constraints (w.

Initially, the system employs a visual encoder to process the input image and generate embeddings, which are then used to retrieve the top-k similar categories from a pre-constructed memory bank. This retrieval phase is crucial for narrowing down the potential categories based on historical data and semantic similarity. Subsequently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) rank these retrieved categories to make the final prediction, enhancing accuracy and contextual awareness.\n\n### Detailed Process:\n\n1. **Pre-processing for Detection Datasets**:\n   - **Cropping and Blurring**: As shown in `![Pre-processing for object detection datasets](image4)`, the system first crops the image regions based on bounding box coordinates to focus on objects of interest. It then resizes these cropped regions and applies blurring to non-target areas, directing the MLLMs' attention to relevant objects. This step is essential for handling the varied sizes and positions of objects in detection tasks.\n\n2. **Retrieval Phase**:\n   - **Image-to-Text Retrieval**: Unlike image classification, the system uses CLIP's image-text interaction capabilities for retrieval in object detection, as small cropped sub-images may limit feature extraction. The retrieved top-k category information is obtained based on similarity with the image embeddings, as depicted in `![Retrieval and ranking process](image3)`.\n\n3. **Ranking Phase**:\n   - **MLLMs' Role**: The retrieved categories are sent to MLLMs, which rank them using advanced linguistic and semantic analysis.

Specifically:\n\n- **Document Classification**: SPECTER achieves an 86.4 F1 score on the MeSH (MAG) dataset, which is a 2.3 point absolute increase over the best baseline [5]. This indicates superior performance in classifying documents into categories.\n- **Citation Prediction**: SPECTER obtains a MAP score of 91.5 and an nDCG of 92.4, significantly outperforming other models like Citeomatic and SciBERT [5]. This demonstrates its effectiveness in predicting citation relationships.\n\nThe image quotes further support these findings:\n\n- **image3** shows a detailed comparison of various models across different tasks.

These results highlight SPECTER's effectiveness in encoding topical information and its versatility in handling different tasks without task-specific fine-tuning.\n\nIncluding additional metadata such as venue and author has varied effects on SPECTER's performance. Adding the venue slightly improves performance in classification tasks, as seen in image5 where the venue inclusion results in a slight increase in the CLS metric (84.5) compared to the base SPECTER (84.2). However, adding authors as input actually decreases performance, as indicated by the drop in the CLS metric to 82.7 when authors are included, compared to 84.2 without them [3]. This suggests that author names may introduce noise due to their sparsity and suboptimal tokenization in the corpus.\n\nIn summary, SPECTER outperforms other models across various tasks, and while adding venue metadata can enhance performance in specific tasks, including author metadata generally degrades results."}

For instance, in the MAG classification task, SPECTER achieves an F1 score of 82.0, compared to SciBERT's 79.7. In user activity prediction, SPECTER's MAP scores are 91.5 and 84.5 for co-view and co-read tasks, respectively, surpassing SciBERT's 83.6 and 83.8. This performance is attributed to SPECTER's design, which includes hard negative distractors and leverages SciBERT's scientific text pretraining, as noted in [1].\n\nThe visualizations in image2 provide further insights into the embeddings. SPECTER's embeddings, shown in (a), form more compact and distinct clusters compared to SciBERT's in (b). This is quantified by higher homogeneity (0.41 vs. 0.19) and completeness (0.72 vs. 0.63) scores for SPECTER, indicating better topic separation. For example, Engineering, Mathematics, and Computer Science are closely grouped in SPECTER's embedding space, reflecting topical relatedness, whereas SciBERT's clusters are more dispersed. This suggests SPECTER's embeddings are more effective at encoding topical information, as highlighted in [2].\n\nAblation studies in image3 confirm the importance of SPECTER's design choices. Removing the abstract or adding authors degrades performance, while including hard negatives and starting with SciBERT improves results.

For example:\n- **`hotel-type`**: DS-DST improves by +6.05% over DS-Span, while DS-Picklist improves by +6.37%.\n- **`attraction-name`**: DS-DST improves by +2.65%, and DS-Picklist by +2.77%.\n- **`hotel-internet`**: DS-DST improves by +4.50%, and DS-Picklist by +4.28%.\n\nThese improvements are attributed to the categorical slots being directly predicted from candidate-value lists, as noted in text [3] and [4].\n\n### Error Analysis\nText [4] and image5 further illustrate that DS-Picklist reduces errors for slots where span-based methods fail, such as `attraction-type` and `hotel-internet`. This is because DS-Picklist can access the full ontology, allowing it to predict values not present in the dialog context.\n\n### Conclusion\nDS-Picklist generally outperforms DS-DST in both joint and slot accuracy, particularly for categorical slots, by leveraging a full ontology. However, DS-DST also shows significant improvements over DS-Span, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining categorical and non-categorical approaches.\n\n**Answer**: DS-Picklist achieves higher joint accuracy (53.30%) than DS-DST (5"}

For instance, [1] states that both stacking methods outperform previous state-of-the-art models, with fine-tuning yielding the biggest gains.

Additionally, [7] notes that fine-tuning the language model together with task-specific architectures leads to better results.\n\nThe image quotes provide concrete evidence of these improvements.

According to the provided data, several key factors contribute to this:\n\n1. **Model Architecture and Fine-Tuning**:\n   - The cloze-style objective, which predicts the center word given all left and right context, outperforms individual left and right context prediction tasks [2]. This is supported by the results in image1, where models like BERT_LARGE achieve higher F1 scores (92.8) compared to ELMo_BASE (92.2) and CNN Large + ELMo (93.2), indicating the effectiveness of the cloze approach.\n\n2. **Data Quantity and Structure**:\n   - More pretraining data generally improves performance. Image3 and image4 show that increasing the number of training tokens (e.g., from 562M to 18B) leads to higher average GLUE scores, with a notable increase from 80.5 to 81.5 [7][8]. This aligns with the finding that pretraining continues to improve up to 18B tokens and likely beyond [8].\n\n3. **Data Domain and Format**:\n   - Pretraining on corpora retaining paragraph structure (e.g., Common Crawl) performs better than individual sentences. Image3 highlights that Common Crawl data (e.g., 18B tokens) outperforms News Crawl, especially on tasks like RTE, due to multi-sentence training examples [5]. BooksCorpus and Wikipedia data also show strong performance on specific tasks like QNLI and MNLI [9].\n\n4. **Comparison of Loss Types**:\n   - The cloze loss alone performs better than combining cloze and bilm losses. Image5 shows that the cloze approach achieves an average score of 80.9, while combining cloze and bilm results in a lower average of 80.4, suggesting that the learning signals from left and right context prediction are not complementary enough [1].\n\n5. **Model Stacking and Fine-Tuning**:\n   - Fine-tuning provides significant gains over stacking methods.

Specifically, replacing ELMo with GloVe and then removing R-GCN leads to a loss of 8.0 points in accuracy. This highlights the importance of R-GCN in updating mention representations based on their relations to other mentions. The image `![Model performance with and without R-GCN](image1)` shows that the \"No R-GCN\" model has lower scores (62.4 for unmasked and 63.2 for masked) compared to the full model (68.5 for unmasked and 71.6 for masked), confirming the critical role of R-GCN in maintaining high performance.\n\n### Impact of Removing Relation Types\nText [9] indicates that fully connecting all nodes without distinguishing edge types leads to only marginal improvements over using ELMo alone. The image `![Model performance with and without relation types](image1)` shows that \"No relation types\" results in scores of 62.7 for unmasked and 63.9 for masked, which are slightly better than \"No R-GCN\" but still significantly lower than the full model. This suggests that while relation types add value, their absence does not drastically reduce performance compared to removing R-GCN.\n\n### Impact of Removing Specific Relation Types (MATCH, COREF)\nText [1] explains that removing DOC-BASED connections (mentions in the same document) has a more significant impact than removing MATCH or COREF connections. The model relies heavily on DOC-BASED connections because they provide crucial information about mentions appearing closely in a document. The image `![Model performance with and without specific relation types](image1)` shows:\n- Removing MATCH results in scores of 64.3 for unmasked and 67.4 for masked.\n- Removing COREF results in 64.8 for unmasked (masked not reported).\n- Removing DOC-BASED results in 62.9 for unmasked and 65.8 for masked.\n\nThis indicates that DOC-BASED connections are more critical than MATCH or COREF, aligning with the text's assertion that DOC-BASED connections"}

This suggests that the coreference system may struggle with harder test documents, leading to a drop in accuracy. The coreference links, while useful in some contexts, do not provide significant benefits in the unmasked setting due to potential unreliability in out-of-domain scenarios.\n\n- **Coreference Impact in Masked Setting:** In the masked setting, coreference links are more effective because mentions are labeled with the same identifier (e.g., MASK1), simplifying the task. As noted in [2], coreferred mentions are consistently labeled, aiding the model in recognizing entities across documents. This is further supported by [10], which states that the model is more effective in recovering coreference links in the masked version.\n\n- **Ablation Results:** The ablation study in [6] shows that while coreference links play a marginal role compared to document-based connections, they still contribute to the model's overall performance. However, the performance drop when coreference is included in the test set indicates that the coreference system may not generalize well to more challenging data.\n\n**Visual Evidence:**\n\n- **image2** provides a table comparing different model configurations. The \"No COREF\" row shows that removing coreference links slightly improves performance in the masked setting (67.4 vs. 64.8) but does not significantly impact the unmasked setting (64.3 vs. 64.8). This aligns with the textual analysis, indicating that coreference links are less critical in the unmasked setting.\n\n- **image4** compares Entity-GCN with and without coreference. The ensemble model without coreference achieves higher accuracy (71.2) in the unmasked setting compared to the model with coreference (66.4), confirming the negative impact of coreference on the unmasked test set.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe inclusion of coreference information improves performance in the masked setting by simplifying entity recognition but degrades performance in the unmasked setting due to potential unreliability in coreference resolution for harder test documents.

For instance, on the SNLI dataset, SWEM-max achieves a test accuracy of 83.8%, outperforming CNN and LSTM models [1]. This indicates that SWEM-max is effective in capturing semantic information for tasks like natural language inference.\n   - In sentiment analysis tasks, SWEM-hier shows superior performance by abstracting spatial information, as seen in its high accuracy on the Yelp Polarity dataset [4]. This suggests that hierarchical pooling is beneficial for tasks requiring word-order information.\n\n2. **Parameter Efficiency:**\n   - SWEM models are more parameter-efficient compared to CNNs. For example, on the AG News dataset, SWEM achieves higher accuracy with a lower intrinsic dimension \\(d_{\\text{int}}\\) compared to CNN, indicating that SWEM requires fewer parameters to reach a decent solution [3].\n\n3. **Short Text Tasks:**\n   - For short text tasks like sentiment classification, CNNs and LSTMs generally outperform SWEM models. This is because short sentences rely more on word-order features, which SWEM may not capture as effectively as CNNs [10].\n\n4. **Chinese Text Classification:**\n   - SWEM-hier performs comparably to CNNs and LSTMs on Chinese text classification, highlighting its effectiveness in capturing local word-order features, which are crucial for languages like Chinese [8].\n\n**Visual Insights:**\n\n1. **Subspace Dimension Analysis (image1):**\n   - The graphs in image1 show that SWEM consistently achieves higher accuracy than CNN across various subspace dimensions on two datasets.

For instance, Google Translate's accuracy for stereotypical roles is consistently higher across languages like Spanish (ES), French (FR), and Russian (RU), as depicted in image2 and image3. Image2 presents the accuracy (Acc) and bias metrics (ΔG and ΔS) for each system and language, highlighting that Google Translate achieves the highest accuracy in French (63.6%) and German (59.4%), while Microsoft Translator excels in Ukrainian (41.3%). Image3 visually confirms these trends, showing that stereotypical translations (blue bars) have higher accuracy percentages than non-stereotypical ones (red bars) across all languages. Additionally, image4 and image5 provide further evidence, with image4 showing lower bias metrics (ΔG and ΔS) for state-of-the-art models in French and German, and image5 demonstrating improved accuracy when stereotypical adjectives are added to the original dataset. Overall, the findings indicate that MT systems are prone to gender bias, with performance deteriorating significantly for non-stereotypical roles, and German translations being an exception due to language similarity to English.\n\n**Answer:** Machine translation systems exhibit higher accuracy and lower gender bias for stereotypical gender roles across languages, with notable exceptions like German, as shown by metrics and visual data."}

The findings indicate that machine translation systems generally perform better when translating pro-stereotypical gender roles compared to anti-stereotypical ones. For instance, systems like Google Translate show higher accuracy in stereotypical scenarios, as depicted in image1, where languages like French (FR) and German (DE) have significantly higher accuracy in stereotypical contexts (80% and 76%, respectively) compared to non-stereotypical ones (54% and 57%). This trend is consistent across multiple languages, suggesting a reliance on gender stereotypes.\n\nTo mitigate this bias, the study experimented with adding stereotypical adjectives to sentences, as described in [8]. This approach improved accuracy in some languages, notably Spanish (ES), Russian (RU), and Ukrainian (UK), as shown in image2. For example, adding adjectives increased accuracy in Spanish from 53.1% to 63.5%, a 10.4% improvement. Image3 provides specific examples where adding a stereotypically female adjective (\"pretty\") corrected a biased translation, demonstrating the potential of this method to reduce bias.\n\nHowever, the effectiveness varies by language. Image5 shows that while some systems like SYSTRAN achieve high accuracy in certain languages (e.g., 74.1% in Arabic), others struggle, indicating language-specific challenges. The data in image4 further highlights disparities, with French (FR) showing a significant performance gap (ΔS = 16.1) between stereotypical and non-stereotypical roles, whereas German (DE) has a smaller gap (ΔS = 8.4), suggesting German's closer linguistic ties to English might reduce bias.\n\nIn conclusion, stereotype-based adjustments can improve gender bias accuracy, but their effectiveness is language-dependent, and overall, machine translation systems remain prone to gender bias, particularly in non-stereotypical contexts. The study underscores the need for more nuanced approaches to address these biases comprehensively.\n\n**Answer:** Stereotype-based adjustments improve gender bias accuracy in some languages, particularly when adding stereotypical adjectives, but the impact varies, with languages like Spanish and Russian showing significant gains, while others like Italian and Russian still exhibit substantial bias.

The company aims to reduce the short-term negative effects of exchange rate fluctuations on earnings and cash flow, contributing to more predictable financial results [3]. To manage this risk, Novo Nordisk uses financial instruments, including forward exchange contracts and currency options, to hedge forecast transactions, assets, and liabilities, primarily in key currencies [7][9]. The company hedges existing and future cash flows up to 24 months forward, applying hedge accounting to align the impact of hedged items and instruments in the income statement [8].\n\nIn 2020, the immediate impact of a 5% increase or decrease in certain currencies versus EUR and DKK on Novo Nordisk’s operating profit was significant, as shown in image3. For example, a 5% increase in the relevant currencies would result in a DKK 1,893 million decrease in other comprehensive income and a DKK 299 million increase in the income statement, leading to a total impact of DKK (1,594) million. Conversely, a 5% decrease would have the opposite effect, with a DKK 1,893 million increase in other comprehensive income and a DKK 299 million decrease in the income statement, totaling DKK 1,594 million. This highlights the substantial sensitivity of Novo Nordisk’s financial results to exchange rate movements.\n\nImage2 provides a detailed breakdown of the company’s reserve adjustments and other comprehensive income related to exchange rate adjustments and cash flow hedges. In 2020, the reserve at year-end showed a total adjustment of DKK (911) million, with significant contributions from exchange rate adjustments (DKK (2,528) million) and cash flow hedges (DKK 1,802 million). This indicates that while exchange rate fluctuations negatively impacted the reserve, cash flow hedges helped mitigate some of this impact, reflecting the effectiveness of Novo Nordisk’s hedging strategies.\n\nAdditionally, image5 shows the year-end changes in key exchange rates, such as a 9.3% decrease in the USD/DKK rate and a 7.2% decrease in the CAD/DKK rate, which would have influenced the company’s financial performance.

This was a challenging year marked by lower oil prices and operational impacts. However, by 2021, the net income turned positive, reaching $8.14 billion, indicating a substantial recovery and profitability [image3].

This decline can be attributed to several factors, including a negative impact from foreign exchange translation, which reduced the measure by 6 percentage points, and restructuring and impairment charges amounting to 2 percentage points. Additionally, inventory fair value adjustments and merger and integration charges contributed a negative 3.5 percentage points.

This trend is influenced by several factors, including changes in federal, state, and foreign tax provisions, as well as adjustments in deferred income tax assets and liabilities.\n\nFrom 2018 to 2020, the federal tax provision increased significantly from $2,897 million to $4,098 million, while the state and local provision rose from $219 million to $392 million. The foreign tax provision also increased from $404 million to $491 million.

However, the deferred tax provision showed a decrease, moving from a benefit of $42 million in 2018 to a provision of $8 million in 2020, indicating a shift from deferred tax benefits to deferred tax provisions over the period.\n\nThe deferred income tax assets and liabilities provide further insight into these trends. As of 2020, total deferred income tax assets were $3,391 million, up from $2,868 million in 2019, primarily due to increases in non-U.S. tax loss carryforwards and other domestic assets. Conversely, total deferred income tax liabilities increased from $5,861 million in 2019 to $6,758 million in 2020, driven by higher U.S. federal and state intangible assets and non-U.S. goodwill and intangible assets.

This increase is primarily attributed to higher earnings and lower net discrete tax benefits in 2020, as stated in [1] and [8]. Specifically, the net discrete tax benefits in 2020 were $122 million, mainly related to the conversion of employee share-based awards, compared to $475 million in 2019, which included benefits from the resolution of multi-jurisdiction tax examinations and share-based awards [3][5][8].

This decline is directly linked to the firm's compensation structure. In 2020, the firm awarded deferred cash-based compensation to a reduced group of employees and adjusted its compensation deferral formula, leading to less deferred cash-based compensation [4]. Additionally, compensation and benefits expenses increased by 11% in 2020, driven by higher discretionary incentive compensation, formulaic payouts, and expenses related to deferred compensation plans linked to investment performance [9]. These factors collectively influenced the firm's tax provisions and overall compensation expenses.\n\n![Net discrete tax provisions decreased from $475 million in 2019 to $122 million in 2020](image4)\n\nThe total recognized compensation expense also rose from $1,878 million in 2019 to $2,119 million in 2020, as seen in image1.

This acquisition is noted to be the company's largest to date and likely contributed to the growth in revenue. Additionally, the revenue by geography shows a substantial increase in the Americas, from $9,445 million in 2019 to $12,051 million in 2020, as seen in image2. This indicates a strong performance in the company's primary market.\n\n**Unearned Revenue Change:**\n\nThe unearned revenue at the beginning of fiscal 2020 was $8,564 million, and by the end of the period, it increased to $10,662 million, as shown in image4. This represents a significant rise from the previous year's end balance of $6,995 million. The text explains that approximately 50% of the total revenue recognized in fiscal 2020 came from the unearned revenue balance as of January 31, 2019 [1]. This suggests that a substantial portion of the revenue recognized in 2020 was from previously invoiced amounts.\n\n**Implications:**\n\nThe increase in unearned revenue could imply that the company is successfully securing long-term contracts and subscriptions, which are recognized over time. The higher unearned revenue balance at the end of 2020 indicates a strong pipeline of future revenue, which is positive for future financial stability. However, it also means that a significant portion of the revenue recognized in 2020 was from prior commitments, which might not reflect new business growth as strongly as it appears. The company's reliance on unearned revenue could also indicate potential risks if there are cancellations or non-renewals in future periods.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe total revenue increased significantly from fiscal year 2019 to 2020, partly due to acquisitions and strong performance in the Americas. Unearned revenue also grew, suggesting robust contract renewals and new commitments.

This increase was primarily driven by an increase in cash provided by receivables, which rose by $4.795 billion, largely due to sales of receivables, including financing receivables of $3.076 billion [10]. Additionally, payroll tax and value-added tax payment deferrals and exemptions of approximately $600 million due to COVID-19 relief measures contributed to this increase [10].

This decrease was primarily due to reductions in transportation services revenue ($53 million), allowance oil revenue ($12 million), and product revenue ($21 million), partially offset by increases in terminaling services revenue ($63 million) and lease revenue ($1 million). The decrease in transportation services revenue was attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic's impact on the crude and refined products market, lower rates on Zydeco committed contracts, and planned turnaround activities. However, new volumes at NaKika and Odyssey, along with tariff increases on Delta, partially offset these declines.\n\nThe image quote `![Net income and comprehensive income for 2020, 2019, and 2018]()` (image1) shows that net income increased from $546 million in 2019 to $556 million in 2020.

This was partially offset by experience gains and losses of €12 million. The changes in demographic assumptions contributed a loss of €8 million. The negative impact from financial assumptions was largely due to the increase in the discount rate, which decreased the defined benefit obligation. As shown in image2, the discount rate increased from 1.5% in 2020 to 1.7% in 2021. According to image3, a half-percentage-point increase in the discount rate led to a decrease of €242 million in the defined benefit obligation in 2021, compared to a decrease of €227 million in 2020. This indicates that the higher discount rate in 2021 had a more pronounced negative effect on the defined benefit obligation, contributing to the actuarial losses.\n\nIn contrast, fiscal year 2020 saw total actuarial gains of €67 million. Changes in financial assumptions contributed €72 million in gains, while experience gains and losses resulted in a loss of €2 million, and changes in demographic assumptions led to a loss of €3 million. The lower discount rate in 2020 (1.5%) compared to 2021 (1.7%) meant that the decrease in the defined benefit obligation due to the discount rate was less severe, as seen in image3, where a half-percentage-point increase in the discount rate led to a decrease of €227 million in 2020.\n\nThus, the increase in the discount rate from 2020 to 2021 exacerbated the actuarial losses in 2021, while the lower discount rate in 2020 contributed to the actuarial gains that year.\n\n![Total plan assets for 2021 and 2020](image1)\n![Discount rates for 2021 and 2020](image2)\n![Effect of discount rate changes on defined benefit obligation](image3)\n![Actuarial gains and losses for 2021 and "}

This volatility could be due to various factors such as changes in tax laws, repatriation strategies, or the impact of COVID-19 on foreign operations.\n\n3. **Impact on Financial Strategy:**\n   - **Tax Efficiency:** The decrease in foreign tax provision in 2020 might reflect effective tax planning or changes in tax jurisdictions.

[1] highlights that commercial loans increased due to higher demand, while consumer loans decreased due to paydowns and transfers to loans held for sale. [5] and [8] discuss the management of debt securities and their role in liquidity and interest rate risk management. [6] mentions the sale of WFAM and Corporate Trust Services, which affected the balance sheet.\n\n**Image Analysis:**\n- **Image3** shows the selected balance sheet data for 2021 and 2020. Total assets decreased by $25,566 million (11%) from 2020 to 2021, while total loans increased by $7,757 million. This indicates a strategic shift where the company focused on loan growth despite a reduction in total assets.\n- **Image4** provides a detailed breakdown of loans, showing a significant increase in commercial loans ($34,693 million) and a decrease in consumer loans ($26,946 million), aligning with the textual explanation of higher demand in commercial loans and paydowns in consumer loans.\n\n### WFAM Assets Under Management\nThe sale of WFAM is a critical factor in understanding the impact on financial strategy. [6] and [10] mention the sale of WFAM, which was completed on November 1, 2021.

This significant reduction reflects a strategic decision to divest non-core assets, focusing on core banking operations.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe decrease in total assets and the sale of WFAM reflect a strategic pivot by Wells Fargo to streamline operations, reduce non-core assets, and focus on core banking activities. The increase in commercial loans indicates a strategic emphasis on growth in this segment, while the sale of WFAM aligns with efforts to enhance capital management and focus on fee-based income from remaining operations.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe decrease in total"}

This growth was driven by higher demand in the commercial and industrial loan portfolio, as noted in [1].

The Global Banking and Markets segment saw a strong performance, with adjusted revenue increasing due to robust Global Markets results, which offset the impact of lower global interest rates and adverse credit and funding valuation adjustments [4]. This is reflected in the adjusted revenue figures, where Global Markets revenue grew by 27% to $7,290 million, with significant contributions from FICC (up 33% to $6,278 million) and Equities (up 20% to $1,734 million) [image4]. The net operating income for GBM increased by 3% to $15,303 million, driven by these gains [image1].\n\nHowever, the Corporate Centre faced challenges, with a decrease in net operating income of 13% to $156 million, primarily due to a decline in Central Treasury and Legacy portfolios [image2]. The Corporate Centre's adjusted revenue decreased by 13% in Central Treasury and 85% in Legacy portfolios, leading to an overall net operating income decline of 60% to $(262) million [image2]. This was partly due to the reallocation of certain funding costs and hyperinflation impacts in Argentina to global businesses, as mentioned in [3].\n\nThe overall profit before tax for the Group fell by 7% to $4,830 million, with adjusted profit before tax down 7% to $9,264 million, reflecting the mixed performance across segments [image1]. Despite the challenges, the Group maintained strong balance sheets and liquidity, enabling support for customers during and after government restrictions [2]. The Corporate Centre's performance was also impacted by a significant increase in expected credit losses, which rose by over 200% to $(1,209) million, affecting the overall profitability [image1].\n\nIn summary, while Global Banking and Markets demonstrated resilience and growth, the Corporate Centre faced operational challenges, leading to a mixed financial performance for HSBC in 2020 compared to 2019."}

According to text quote [2], interest and other investment income declined by $470 million (44.4%) in 2021 compared to 2020, mainly due to lower income from short-term investments and fixed maturity securities. This decline was exacerbated by low interest rates prevailing throughout 2021, which significantly reduced interest income. Additionally, text quote [10] notes that dividend income increased by $365 million (8.1%) in 2020 compared to 2019 but did not continue this trend into 2021, with only a slight increase of $3.5% in 2021 over 2020. The net effect of these changes resulted in a 5.0% decrease in pre-tax net investment income from 2020 to 2021, as shown in image5.\n\nThe asset allocations reflect these changes, particularly in the substantial holdings of cash, cash equivalents, and U.S. Treasury Bills. Image1 illustrates that the amount of cash, cash equivalents, and U.S. Treasury Bills increased from $67,082 million in 2020 to $90,688 million in 2021. This increase in low-yielding assets, combined with the decline in interest rates, contributed to the reduced interest income. Furthermore, fixed maturity securities decreased from $20,317 million in 2020 to $16,386 million in 2021, indicating a shift towards more liquid but lower-yielding assets. This strategy prioritizes safety over yield, as mentioned in text quote [2], which aligns with the company's focus on maintaining ample liquidity despite the lower returns.\n\nIn summary, the decline in net investment income was driven by lower interest rates and reduced income from short-term investments and fixed maturity securities, reflected in the increased allocation to cash and U.S. Treasury Bills and decreased holdings in fixed maturity securities.\n\n![Cash, cash equivalents, and U.S. Treasury Bills increased from 2020 to 2021](image1)\n![Net investment income decreased from 2020 to 2021](image5)"}

This growth was driven by states easing redetermination requirements due to COVID-19 and an increase in people served via Dual Special Needs Plans [10].\n- **Commercial and Global Decline**: The decrease in individuals served by United Healthcare Global is attributed to increased unemployment and underwriting discipline [10].

The decrease in the expected return on plan assets (from 6.5% to 5.5%) likely contributed to this reduction, as lower returns on assets can increase the net pension liability. Additionally, the increase in the discount rate (from 1.5% to 1.7%) would also impact the present value of future obligations, potentially reducing the net amount recognized.\n- **Other Retiree Benefits**: The net amount recognized for other retiree benefits increased from $2,238 million in 2021 to $3,819 million in 2022, as seen in image5.

This indicates that the valuation of goodwill is closely tied to the financial performance of these companies. Additionally, [4] highlights that the pandemic significantly impacted the Group's operations in 2020, with up to 90% of stores closed in the first quarter and restrictions on store openings in the latter part of the year. This suggests that the pandemic could have affected the valuation and changes in goodwill.\n\nLooking at the image quotes, image1 provides a detailed breakdown of the goodwill components for 2021 and 2020. The opening balance for 2021 is 201, with a foreign exchange translation difference of 1, resulting in a closing balance of 202. For 2020, the opening balance was 207, with a foreign exchange translation difference of (6), leading to a closing balance of 201. This shows a slight increase in the closing balance from 2020 to 2021, primarily due to the positive foreign exchange translation difference in 2021.\n\nImage3 further breaks down the closing balance of goodwill by investee for both years. The closing balance for 2021 is 202, and for 2020, it is 201. The distribution among the investees remains consistent, with no significant changes in the amounts attributed to each entity, indicating stability in the composition of goodwill across the two years.\n\nIn summary, the key differences in goodwill components between 2021 and 2020 are minimal, with a slight increase in the closing balance due to favorable foreign exchange translation differences in 2021. The pandemic's impact in 2020 did not significantly alter the goodwill components, as evidenced by the consistent distribution among investees and the stable closing balances.\n\n**Answer:** The key differences in goodwill components between 2021 and 2020 are a slight increase in the closing balance due to positive foreign exchange translation differences in 2021, with no significant changes in the distribution among investees.\n\n![Closing balance of goodwill increased slightly in"}

This decline was driven by lower loan demand, higher paydowns, and actions taken in 2020 to curtail certain non-conforming residential mortgage originations and suspend home equity originations. Additionally, the decrease in Small Business period-end loan balances was impacted by a decline in PPP loans.

This increase was primarily driven by higher Derivatives exposures due to market volatility, an increase in Investment securities from the E*TRADE acquisition, and higher Equity investments due to market value gains. Additionally, the Advanced Approach saw an increase in Credit Valuation Adjustment (CVA) due to increased Derivatives exposure and credit spread volatility.\n- Image2 provides specific figures: Credit Risk RWA under the Standardized Approach increased from $342,684 million to $387,066 million, and under the Advanced Approach from $228,927 million to $284,930 million. This reflects a significant rise in risk-weighted assets attributed to credit risk.\n\n**External TLAC as a Percentage of RWA:**\n- Text quote [3] explains that External TLAC consists of Common Equity Tier 1 capital and Additional Tier 1 capital, and it is subject to buffer requirements. The institution must maintain these buffers to avoid restrictions on capital distributions.\n- Image5 shows that External TLAC as a percentage of RWA decreased from 49.9% in 2019 to 47.7% in 2020. Despite this decrease, the actual amount of External TLAC increased from $196,888 million to $216,129 million, indicating growth in TLAC but a lower proportion relative to the increased RWA.\n\n**Impact on Capital Structure:**\n- The increase in Credit Risk RWA suggests a higher risk profile, necessitating more capital to absorb potential losses. This would pressure the institution to maintain or increase its capital levels to meet regulatory requirements.\n- The slight decrease in External TLAC as a percentage of RWA, despite an absolute increase in TLAC, indicates that the growth in RWA outpaced the growth in TLAC. This could affect the institution's ability to meet TLAC buffer requirements, potentially impacting its capital distribution capabilities.\n- Image4 shows that the Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio under the Advanced Approach increased from 16.9"}

The company's export earnings for the year were significantly higher, reaching Rs. 52.47 crore, a substantial increase from Rs. 10.99 crore in the previous year [9]. This growth in exports indicates a strong performance in international markets.\n\n![India currently holds only 0.7% share of the USD 30 bn. annual Global Import Export Tobacco Trade.](image3)\n\nImage3 highlights the significant export potential for tobacco, suggesting that India could increase its export earnings sevenfold with just a 5% share of the global market, reaching Rs. 7000 crore. Currently, India's earnings are at Rs. 930 crore, indicating a vast untapped potential.\n\nThe company's focus on improving brand equity and launching new products, such as Piper, Tipper, and Jaisalmer, has contributed to a 19.64% increase in cigarette sales volume and a 14% increase in sales turnover [3]. Despite challenges like the Assam dues issue, which affected net profit [7], the company's strategic investments in product development and market expansion have bolstered its performance.\n\nThe discriminatory taxation against cigarettes, as shown in image2, where cigarettes face a tax burden 21 times greater than bidis, could influence the company's strategy to explore higher-margin products or markets with favorable tax environments. The potential for increased tobacco exports, as illustrated in image3, suggests that the company might prioritize expanding its international presence to capitalize on higher earnings potential.\n\nIn conclusion, the company's financial results reflect solid domestic and export growth, but the significant export potential underscores the need for strategic shifts towards leveraging international markets and possibly diversifying product lines to mitigate domestic tax challenges."}

This decrease is evident in the detailed breakdown in image4, which shows a net decrease in interest income of $19,747 million from 2019 to 2020, mainly due to rate changes affecting various categories such as loans and leases, and interest-bearing deposits. For instance, residential mortgage loans saw a decrease of $313 million due to rate changes, while consumer CDs and IRAs contributed a decrease of $3,449 million due to rate changes.\n\nIn contrast, from 2018 to 2019, the net increase in interest income was $714 million, as shown in image4. This was driven by volume changes in loans and leases, particularly in U.S. commercial loans, which increased by $1,224 million, and rate changes in non-U.S. commercial loans, which added $1,835 million.\n\n### Net Interest Expense Changes\n\nThe net decrease in interest expense from 2019 to 2020 was $5,627 million, primarily due to lower rates on interest-bearing deposits and other liabilities, as seen in image4. For example, U.S. interest-bearing deposits saw a decrease of $5,245 million due to rate changes. This reflects the broader trend of reduced funding costs.\n\nFrom 2018 to 2019, the net increase in interest expense was $2,564 million, driven by higher rates on various liabilities, including U.S. interest-bearing deposits, which increased by $1,581 million due to rate changes.\n\n### Organizational Structure Reflection\n\nThe organizational structure of Bank of America, as depicted in image2, shows a division into segments like Consumer Banking, Global Wealth & Investment Management, Global Banking, and Global Markets."}

This decline is further supported by image2, which shows that interest and other investment income dropped from $1,059 million in 2020 to $589 million in 2021, a significant decrease of 44.4%. Despite this, dividend income increased by 3.5% to $5,060 million in 2021 from $4,890 million in 2020. The pre-tax net investment income decreased by 5.0% to $5,649 million in 2021 from $5,949 million in 2020, and after accounting for income taxes and noncontrolling interests, the net investment income fell to $4,807 million in 2021 from $5,039 million in 2020. This indicates a shift in the sources of investment income, with dividends partially offsetting the decline in interest income.\n\n**Asset Composition Changes:**\n\nImage1 provides a detailed breakdown of the asset composition. In 2021, cash, cash equivalents, and U.S. Treasury Bills increased significantly to $90,688 million from $67,082 million in 2020. Equity securities also rose to $334,907 million from $269,498 million in 2020, reflecting a substantial increase in holdings. However, fixed maturity securities decreased to $16,386 million from $20,317 million in 2020. This shift suggests a strategic reallocation towards more liquid assets and equity investments, possibly in response to low interest rates and a focus on safety over yield, as mentioned in text quote [6].\n\n**Implications:**\n\nThe decline in interest and other investment income, coupled with the increase in cash and equity holdings, implies a conservative investment strategy prioritizing liquidity and capital preservation."}

However, the composition of assets backing these liabilities changed, with a shift from mutual funds to corporate obligations and U.S. government agency and Treasury securities [image5].\n\nIn summary, the balance of uncertain tax positions decreased significantly due to settlements, while the fair value of assets saw a reduction in certain investment categories, though liabilities remained consistent.\n\n**Answer:** The balance of uncertain tax positions decreased from $303 million in 2019 to $89 million in 2020 due to settlements, and the fair value of assets decreased from $3,461 million to $2,482 million, primarily due to reductions in corporate obligations and mutual funds, while liabilities remained stable at $350 million."}

This can affect the ability to ensure supply of key products, transporting to operational facilities and distribution to customers, and lead to increased input prices and costs [2, 5].\n\n**Mitigations for Supply Chain Disruptions:**\n- The report outlines several key mitigations, including policies and procedures to ensure the health and safety of people, products, and sites; business continuity and disaster recovery plans for key sites; and active price risk management on key commodities [2, 5]. Additionally, Nestlé has increased the scope of its Transport Hub technologies to cover 50% of its global logistics network and extended AI-powered network optimization tools to evaluate different product sourcing and delivery scenarios, enhancing responsiveness to demand changes and optimizing schedules [5].\n\n**Nestlé's Factory Distribution:**\n- The images provide a visual representation of Nestlé's factory distribution across different regions. For example:\n  - **Asia, Oceania, and Sub-Saharan Africa (image1):** Countries like India, Indonesia, and Greater China have multiple factories, indicating a significant presence and potential for localized supply chain management.\n  - **Americas (image3):** The United States has a high number of factories (72), suggesting a robust local supply chain capability.\n  - **Europe, Middle East, and North Africa (image5):** Countries like Germany and France have multiple factories, which could help in regional supply chain resilience.\n  - **Global Distribution (image4):** Switzerland and the United States are major hubs, with significant percentages (34.9% and 33.5% respectively), indicating centralized production capacities that might be vulnerable to disruptions but also capable of supporting broader distribution networks.\n\n**Interrelation:**\n- The concentration of factories in certain regions, as shown in the images, aligns with Nestlé's strategy to enhance supply chain resilience. By having multiple factories in key regions, Nestlé can better manage disruptions through localized production and logistics. The use of advanced technologies and risk management tools, as mentioned in the text, further supports this by enabling quick responses to supply chain challenges.\n\n**"}

The issuance of American Express preferred shares brought in $26,906 million in proceeds [image1]. This is a significant inflow of cash, contributing to the net cash provided by financing activities.\n- **Redemption of Preferred Shares:** The company redeemed preferred shares, resulting in a cash outflow of $20,562 million [image1]. This redemption is part of the cash used in financing activities.\n\n**2021:**\n- **Issuance of Preferred Shares:** The company issued $1.6 billion of 3.550% Fixed Rate Reset Noncumulative Preferred Shares, Series D on August 3, 2021 [1]. This issuance is reflected in the cash flows from financing activities as proceeds from long-term debt, amounting to $20,032 million [image1].\n- **Redemption of Preferred Shares:** The proceeds from the issuance were used to redeem the $850 million of 4.900% Fixed Rate/Floating Rate Noncumulative Preferred Shares, Series C and the $750 million of 5.200% Fixed Rate/Floating Rate Noncumulative Preferred Shares, Series B [1].

The increase in total assets suggests that the company has expanded its asset base, which could indicate growth in operations, investments, or acquisitions.\n\n### Cash Flow from Operating Activities\nThe cash flow from operating activities for the consolidated segment is detailed in the text and image quotes:\n\n- **Cash Flow from Operating Activities**:\n  - **2020**: $3,003 million [2]\n  - **2021**: $6,493 million [2]\n\nThis shows a significant increase of $3,490 million in cash flow from operating activities. The text explains that the increase was primarily due to higher profit in 2021 adjusted for non-cash items, including higher accruals for short-term incentive compensation, and lower payments for short-term incentive compensation. However, this was partially offset by increased working capital requirements, particularly changes in inventory and accounts receivable.\n\n### Implications on Business Operations\nThe substantial increase in cash flow from operating activities suggests improved operational efficiency and profitability. Higher cash flow can enhance the company's ability to fund operations, invest in growth opportunities, and reduce debt. The increase in total assets indicates potential expansion or investment in new projects, which could drive future revenue growth. However, the increased working capital requirements highlight a need for better management of receivables and inventory to sustain cash flow improvements.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe consolidated segment experienced a significant increase in both total assets and cash flow from operating activities from 2020 to 2021, indicating growth and improved operational performance. These changes suggest a stronger financial position, enabling the company to invest in future opportunities while maintaining liquidity.\n\n![Total assets increased from 2020 to 2021](image3)\n![Cash flow from operating activities increased from 2020 to 2021](image2)"}

This decrease was primarily driven by lower interest rates, partially offset by reduced deposit and funding costs, the deployment of excess deposits into securities, and an additional day of interest accrual. The net interest yield on a fully taxable-equivalent (FTE) basis decreased by 53 basis points (bps) to 1.90 percent for 2020.\n\n**Image Evidence:**\n\n- **Image2** provides a detailed breakdown of the changes in interest income and expense from 2019 to 2020. It shows that the net decrease in interest income was $19,747 million, mainly due to rate changes, while the net decrease in interest expense was $5,627 million. The net decrease in net interest income was $14,120 million.\n- **Image5** further illustrates the average balances and yields for earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. The net interest spread decreased from 2.03% in 2019 to 1.90% in 2020, reflecting the impact of lower interest rates.\n\n**Main Contributing Factors:**\n\n1. **Lower Interest Rates:** The primary factor was the decline in interest rates, which reduced the income from earning assets more significantly than the expense on interest-bearing liabilities. This is evident from the substantial negative impact on interest income due to rate changes in Image2.\n2. **Deposit and Funding Costs:** Reduced deposit and funding costs helped mitigate some of the decline in net interest income, as mentioned in text [6].\n3. **Deployment of Excess Deposits:** The deployment of excess deposits into securities contributed to offsetting the decrease in net interest income.\n4. **Additional Day of Interest Accrual:** An additional day of interest accrual in 2020 also played a role in partially offsetting the decline.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe net interest spread decreased from 2.03% in 2019 to 1.90% in "}

This was driven by flat Real Internal Growth (RIG) and 0.5% pricing. Despite a sales decline in China, other regions contributed to mid single-digit organic growth [5]. The reported sales decreased by 6.3% to CHF 20.7 billion, primarily due to foreign exchange impacts of 6.7% [1].\n- **Trading Operating Profit Margin:** The underlying trading operating profit margin for Zone AOA decreased by 30 basis points to 22.2% [6]. This decline was attributed to commodity inflation and COVID-19-related costs, which outweighed savings from lower consumer-facing marketing expenses [6].

This growth was despite a 17.6% reduction in sales due to divestitures, particularly the divestment of Nestlé Skin Health, and a 6.3% negative impact from foreign exchange, leading to a 16.0% decrease in reported sales to CHF 9.4 billion [3].\n- **Trading Operating Profit Margin:** The underlying trading operating profit margin for Other businesses increased by 90 basis points to 19.6% [2][4]. This improvement was due to operating leverage and structural cost reductions [2].

This is detailed in [3] and illustrated in image3. The increase is primarily due to current year tax positions adding $416 million, while prior year tax positions added $120 million. However, there were gross decreases of $130 million from prior year tax positions lapses. The company expects a decrease of $39 million in the next twelve months due to audit settlements and statute of limitations expirations [10]. This indicates potential future reductions in liabilities, which could positively affect the effective tax rate and cash flows.\n\n**Common Share Repurchases:**\n- The company repurchased 14 million shares in 2020 at an average price of $300.58 per share, totaling $4,250 million, compared to 22 million shares in 2019 at $245.97 per share, totaling $5,500 million [2][4][5]. This is shown in image1. The reduction in repurchased shares and total cost reflects a strategic adjustment, possibly due to market conditions or capital allocation priorities. The remaining board authorization for share repurchases decreased to 58 million shares from 72 million, indicating ongoing but moderated repurchase activity.\n\n**Implications for Financial Position:**\n- The increase in unrecognized tax benefits suggests potential future tax liabilities, but the expected decrease of $39 million provides some relief. The reduced share repurchases indicate a more conservative approach to capital management, potentially preserving cash for other strategic initiatives or responding to market conditions. These changes reflect a balance between optimizing shareholder returns and managing financial flexibility.\n\nIn summary, the company's gross unrecognized tax benefits rose due to new tax positions, while common share repurchases decreased, reflecting strategic adjustments in capital allocation.

This is further supported by image1, which shows a decrease in net interest income from $11,870 million in 2019 to $12,270 million in 2020, a slight increase of 3%. However, the net interest yield decreased by 53 basis points to 1.90% on a fully taxable-equivalent (FTE) basis, indicating a reduction in profitability despite the nominal increase in income.\n- **Total Revenue**: Image1 also highlights that total revenue, net of interest expense, decreased by 5% from $19,538 million in 2019 to $18,584 million in 2020. This decline is attributed to lower revenue, higher provision for credit losses, and increased expenses as mentioned in text quote [2].\n\n### Wealth Management Sector:\n- **Net Interest Income**: Text quote [1] indicates that MLGWM (Merrill Lynch Global Wealth Management) revenue decreased by 5% to $15.3 billion, primarily due to lower interest rates, partially offset by higher market valuations and positive AUM flows.

The slight decrease in these charges helped improve the non-GAAP measure.\n- **Foreign Exchange Translation:** There was no impact from foreign exchange translation on PBNA's core non-GAAP measure in 2020, as indicated in image5.\n- **Organic Revenue Growth:** From image1, PBNA's organic revenue growth was 2%, which positively influenced both GAAP and non-GAAP measures.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe reported GAAP measure for PBNA increased slightly from 2019 to 2020, while the core non-GAAP measure saw a significant increase due to the exclusion of restructuring and impairment charges, as well as inventory fair value adjustments"}

Excluding unfavorable currency movements of $0.5 billion, net cash provided by operating activities increased by $0.2 billion due to higher net earnings, partially offset by higher working capital requirements and cash payments for asset impairment and exit costs.\n- **Image2**: The net cash provided by operating activities was $9,812 million in 2020, compared to $10,090 million in 2019. This decrease is primarily due to changes in working capital and higher cash payments for asset impairment and exit costs.\n\n### Investing Activities\n- **Text [9]**: Net cash used in investing activities decreased by $0.7 billion in 2020 compared to 2019, mainly due to reduced capital expenditures and the absence of the deconsolidation of RBH, partially offset by higher cash collateral for derivatives.\n- **Image2**: Net cash used in investing activities was $(1,154) million in 2020, compared to $(1,811) million in 2019. The decrease is due to lower capital expenditures and the absence of the RBH deconsolidation.\n\n### Financing Activities\n- **Text [4]**: Net cash used in financing activities increased by $0.4 billion in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to higher payments to noncontrolling interests and dividends, partially offset by debt activity.\n- **Image3**: Net cash used in financing activities was $(8,496) million in 2020, compared to $(8,061) million in 2019.

This is further detailed in image1, which highlights consolidated operating income as an indicator for evaluating Toyota's efforts based on business performance. Image3 provides a specific evaluation method, stating that consolidated operating income is evaluated using a reference value of 1 trillion yen, with an evaluation result of 150% for the current fiscal year, indicating a strong performance.\n- **Volatility of Toyota's Share Price:** Text [1] and image1 also emphasize the volatility of Toyota's share price as a key factor. Image3 explains that the volatility is comparatively evaluated using Toyota's share price and the Nikkei stock average, with a reference value of 6,501 yen for Toyota's share price and 18,917 yen for the Nikkei average. This dual evaluation ensures that remuneration reflects both absolute and relative performance in the market.\n\n**Shareholder Value Indicators:**\n- **Shareholder Return:** Image5 shows Toyota's commitment to shareholder value through dividends and share repurchases. The total shareholder return has fluctuated over the years, with significant payments in 2017/3 and 2018/3, and a notable increase in 2021/3. This reflects Toyota's strategy to maintain and enhance shareholder value, as mentioned in text [7], which states Toyota's focus on a consolidated payout ratio of 30% and investment in growth areas like environmental technologies.\n\n**Individual Performance Evaluation:**\n- **Qualitative Assessment:** Image1 indicates that individual performance evaluation is a qualitative assessment of each director's performance.

Specifically, a decline in the discount rate increases the DBO, while an increase in compensation or pension progression also raises the obligation (quote [8]).\n\nThe image quotes provide quantitative data on these impacts:\n- **Image1** shows the sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to changes in actuarial assumptions:\n  - A 0.5% increase in the discount rate decreases the DBO by €242 million in 2021 (compared to a €227 million decrease in 2020).\n  - A 0.5% increase in compensation increases the DBO by €16 million in 2021 (compared to €11 million in 2020).\n  - A 0.5% increase in pension progression increases the DBO by €158 million in 2021 (same as 2020).\n\nThese sensitivities indicate that the DBO is more sensitive to changes in the discount rate and pension progression in 2021 compared to 2020.\n\n### Impact on Plan Assets\n\nThe text mentions that the funded status of the pension plans is affected by changes in actuarial assumptions and financial market movements (quote [4]).

This suggests that while sales were up, the costs associated with these initiatives impacted overall margins.\n- **Growth Rates**: Image2 shows that the U.S. segment had a 0.4% increase in revenue in 2020 compared to a 5.0% increase in 2019. This indicates a slowdown in growth, likely due to the additional marketing expenses mentioned in [1] and [2].\n- **Image Analysis**: Image3 provides a detailed breakdown of revenues, showing a 4% decrease in U.S. company-operated sales and a 2% decrease in franchised revenues in 2020 compared to 2019. This aligns with the text, indicating that while sales were positive, the growth was tempered by increased costs.\n\n### International Operated Markets Segment:\n- **Revenue Composition**: The International Operated Markets segment experienced significant declines due to COVID-19, with temporary closures and limited operations affecting revenue. [3] highlights that revenue declines were particularly severe in the U.K., France, Germany, Italy, and Spain.\n- **Growth Rates**: Image2 indicates a 15.0% decrease in revenue for the International Operated Markets in 2020, compared to a 6.1% increase in 2019. This stark contrast reflects the severe impact of the pandemic.\n- **Image Analysis**: Image3 shows a 19% decrease in company-operated sales and an 8% decrease in franchised revenues for the International Operated Markets in 2020. This is consistent with the text, which attributes the decline to COVID-19-related closures and operational limitations.\n\n### Influencing Factors:\n- **COVID-19 Impact**: Both segments were influenced by the pandemic, but the International Operated Markets were hit harder due to widespread closures and restrictions, as noted in [3] and [5].\n- **Marketing and Support Costs**: The U.S. segment's growth was moderated by increased marketing expenses to support recovery"}

This decrease is primarily attributed to a reduction in operating earnings due to COVID-19. The image quote `![Cash provided by operations decreased in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to a reduction in operating earnings due to COVID-19](image4)` further supports this, showing a decline in cash provided by operations from $6.025.4 billion in 2019 to $4.730.5 billion in 2020.

Depreciation expense relates to both the Company's manufacturing and operating facilities as well as instrumentation leased to customers under operating-type lease arrangements.\n- [5] mentions the lease balances within the Consolidated Balance Sheets, but specific details are not provided in the text. However, [6] states that total rent expense under ASC 840 for all operating leases was $234 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, which is not directly relevant to 2019 or 2020 but indicates a historical context.\n\n**Image Analysis:**\n- **image4** shows the lease assets and liabilities for 2020 and 2019:\n  - **Operating lease ROU (Right-of-Use) assets** increased from $764 million in 2019 to $942 million in 2020, indicating a growth in leased assets.\n  - **Total operating lease liabilities** also increased from $979 million in 2019 to $974 million in 2020, with a slight decrease in the total amount but a change in the distribution between current and long-term liabilities. The weighted average remaining lease term and discount rate slightly decreased, reflecting adjustments in lease terms or new leases.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe increase in operating lease ROU assets and the slight decrease in total operating lease liabilities suggest that the company expanded its leased assets, likely due to the Cytiva Acquisition, which required additional facilities and equipment. This expansion is reflected in the financial statements as higher lease-related assets and liabilities, impacting the balance sheet and potentially affecting future lease expenses.\n\n### Inventories\n\n**Text Analysis:**\n- [1] mentions that the aggregate of trade accounts receivable, inventories, and trade accounts payable used $160 million in operating cash flows during 2020, compared to $161 million in 2019, indicating a marginal improvement in cash flow management.\n"}

This decline was driven by reduced spending, especially in travel and entertainment, although debit card purchase volumes increased as businesses reopened.\n- **Image2** shows that credit card purchase volumes decreased from $277,852 million in 2019 to $251,599 million in 2020, a reduction of $26,253 million. This aligns with the text, highlighting a significant drop in consumer spending on credit cards.\n\n**Home Equity Metrics:**\n- **Text [5]** and [9] mention that home equity production decreased by $2.8 billion in Consumer Banking and $3.0 billion for the total Corporation in 2020, mainly due to fewer applications. Additionally, outstanding balances in the home equity portfolio decreased by $5.9 billion, with paydowns outpacing new originations.\n- **Image4** provides specific figures: Consumer Banking home equity originations dropped from $9,755 million in 2019 to $6,930 million in 2020, and total home equity originations fell from $11,131 million to $8,160 million. This indicates a notable decline in home equity activity.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe decline in credit card purchase volumes and home equity originations suggests that consumers were more cautious in 2020, likely due to economic uncertainty from COVID-19. Reduced spending on credit cards and lower home equity applications reflect a shift towards saving and reduced borrowing, indicating a more conservative financial approach among consumers during the pandemic.\n\n![Credit card purchase volumes decreased significantly from 2019 to 2020](image2)\n![Home equity originations decreased in both Consumer Banking and total Corporation](image4)\n\n**Answer:** Total credit card purchase volumes and home equity originations both declined in 2020 compared to 2019, reflecting reduced consumer spending and borrowing, likely due to economic uncertainty from COVID-19."}

However, this was partially offset by lower costs and balances of interest-bearing deposits and long-term debt. Additionally, net interest income in 2021 included interest income from PPP loans of $518 million and $1.1 billion from loans purchased from GNMA loan securitization pools.\n- Image1 shows that net interest income decreased from $441 million in 2020 to a negative $1,541 million in 2021, a change of $(1,982) million or (67)%.\n\n**Noninterest Income:**\n- Text quote [7] mentions that noninterest income decreased due to lower lease income from a $268 million impairment of certain rail cars and lower asset-based fees due to the sale of WFAM.

The reduction in gross costs was offset by higher exploration and development expenses, as well as other factors.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nPetroleum production decreased by 6 MMboe from FY2020 to FY2021, while the cost per Boe increased from $9.74 to $10.83. These metrics are represented in Image4 and Image5, which show the production volumes and detailed cost breakdowns, respectively.\n\n![Petroleum production decreased from 109 MMboe in FY2020 to 103 MMboe in FY2021](image4)\n![Cost per Boe increased from $9.74 in FY2020 to $10.83 in FY2021](image5)\n\n**Answer:** Petroleum production decreased from 109 MMboe in FY2020 to 103 MMboe in FY2021, while the cost per Boe increased from $9.74 to $10.83."}

This is evident from quotes [1], [4], [5], and [10], which highlight the rebound in commercial and consumer billed business, as well as worldwide network volumes.\n\n2. **Growth in Network Volumes**: Worldwide network volumes increased by 24%, reaching 2019 levels. Billed business, which accounts for 85% of total network volumes, grew by 25%. U.S. network volumes increased by 27%, while non-U.S. volumes rose by 17% [5][6]. This is supported by image2, which shows a 24% increase in total network volumes from 2020 to 2021.\n\n3. **Increase in Card Member Spending**: Higher Card Member spending, particularly in T&E (Travel and Entertainment) and G&S (Goods and Services), contributed to the growth. T&E spend grew 59% year-over-year, while G&S spend increased by 19% [6]. Image3 further details the significant growth in T&E-related billed business, which rose from 14% to 19% of worldwide billed business.\n\n4. **Average Discount Rate**: The average discount rate increased slightly from 2.28% in 2020 to 2.30% in 2021, primarily due to a shift in spending mix towards T&E-related volumes [7]. Image2 confirms this increase in the average discount rate.\n\n5. **Consumer and Commercial Billed Business**: Both consumer and commercial billed business saw substantial growth. Consumer billed business increased by 29%, and commercial billed business by 21% [1][10]. Image3 shows a 29% increase in consumer billed business and a 21% increase in commercial billed business.\n\n6. **Net Card Fees and Other Revenues**: Net card fees grew by 11% due to higher new card acquisitions and retention, while other revenues benefited from travel-related gains [2][3]. Image4 illustrates the 26% increase in discount revenue and the overall growth in non-interest revenues.\n\nIn summary, the discount revenue increased by 26% from 20"}

Several factors contributed to this increase:\n\n1. **Operating Income**: Operating income rose from $17,493 million in 2020 to $20,817 million in 2021, primarily due to higher revenue and improved operational performance across segments, including the Media and Theme Parks segments [10]. The Media segment benefited from increased distribution and advertising revenue, while the Theme Parks segment saw significant recovery from COVID-19 restrictions [10].\n\n2. **Depreciation and Amortization**: This increased from $13,100 million in 2020 to $13,804 million in 2021, contributing to higher non-cash expenses [3].\n\n3. **Noncash Share-Based Compensation**: This increased slightly from $1,193 million in 2020 to $1,315 million in 2021 [3].\n\n4. **Changes in Operating Assets and Liabilities**: There was a decrease of $1,499 million in 2021 compared to a decrease of $178 million in 2020. This was mainly due to timing differences in amortization and payments for film and television costs, increased production spending, and impacts from the Tokyo Olympics broadcast, partially offset by theme park operations [2].\n\n5. **Payments of Interest**: Interest payments decreased from $3,878 million in 2020 to $3,908 million in 2021, a slight increase, but overall financial management helped maintain cash flow [3].\n\n6. **Payments of Income Taxes**: Income tax payments decreased significantly from $3,183 million in 2020 to $2,628 million in 2021, primarily due to tax deductions from the senior notes exchange, which reduced payments by $1.3 billion [1].\n\n7. **Proceeds from Investments and Other**: There was an increase in proceeds from investments, contributing $1,246 million in 2021 compared to $190 million in 2020, mainly from higher cash distributions from equity method investments [5].\n\nThese factors collectively"}

According to the provided evidence, the percentage of options that can be exercised increases with higher EBIT growth rates. \n\nFrom text [3], it is noted that the actual compound annual growth rate in EPS over the performance period ended 28 June 2020 was 3%, which did not meet the vesting hurdle, resulting in unvested options. This highlights the importance of meeting specific growth targets for incentive exercisability.\n\nImage3 illustrates the relationship between EBIT growth and the exercisable percentage:\n- Less than threshold: Nil\n- 24% compound growth: 10% awarded\n- 25% compound growth: 20% awarded\n- 26% compound growth: 100% awarded\n\nSimilarly, image4 provides another perspective on EBIT growth thresholds:\n- Less than threshold: Nil\n- 17.5% compound growth: 40% awarded\n- 20% compound growth: 60% awarded\n- 22.5% compound growth: 80% awarded\n- 25% compound growth: 100% awarded\n\nThese images show that higher EBIT growth rates lead to a higher percentage of options being exercisable. For example, achieving 25% compound growth results in 100% of the options being awarded, while lower growth rates result in a reduced or nil percentage.\n\nIn summary, the exercisable percentage of incentives increases with higher EBIT growth, with specific thresholds determining the proportion of options that can be exercised.\n\n**Answer:** EBIT growth directly determines the exercisable percentage of incentives, with higher growth rates leading to a higher percentage of options being awarded, as shown in the provided images and text."}

This disparity is likely due to the traditional assumption that maternity leave is primarily for women, while paternity leave is less commonly taken up by men. However, the usage rates show that 1025 female employees availed parental leave, with 967 (94%) returning to work after the leave, and 66 (6%) still employed after 12 months. In contrast, 2023 male employees availed parental leave, with 1,941 (96%) returning to work, and 75 (4%) still employed after 12 months. \n\nThis indicates that while more male employees are entitled to parental leave, a higher percentage of female employees who take the leave return to work, suggesting strong support for women's career continuity post-leave. The bank's policies, such as offering flexi work time and part-time arrangements [10], likely contribute to this retention. Additionally, initiatives like the 'Careers 2.0' program aim to support women returning to work [6], highlighting a proactive approach to gender diversity.\n\nThe images further illustrate the bank's inclusive environment.

This change was primarily driven by several key factors:\n\n1. **Adoption of CECL**: The adoption of the Current Expected Credit Loss (CECL) accounting standard at the beginning of 2020 resulted in an increase of $41 million in the ACL. This standard required the firm to estimate expected credit losses over the lifetime of financial assets, leading to a more forward-looking approach compared to the previous incurred loss model [5].\n\n2. **Provision for Credit Losses**: The provision for credit losses within the Institutional Securities (IS) business segment increased due to the economic impact of COVID-19. This provision was primarily a result of actual and forecasted changes in asset quality trends and uncertainties in sectors like Commercial real estate and Corporate loans [8].\n\n3. **Charge-offs and Recoveries**: Gross charge-offs amounted to $105 million, while recoveries were $8 million, leading to a net charge-off of $97 million. Despite these charge-offs, the overall ACL increased due to the significant provision for expected future losses [4].\n\n4. **Economic Uncertainty**: The base scenario used in ACL models assumed a continued recovery through 2021, supported by fiscal and monetary policies. However, the uncertainty and volatility in economic conditions, particularly in sectors like Commercial real estate, contributed to higher provisions [8].\n\n5. **Loan Modifications**: The firm granted deferrals on approximately $400 million of loans in the IS and Wealth Management (WM) segments, with an additional $2.7 billion of loans exiting deferral arrangements. The substantial majority of these loans were current as of year-end, but the initial impact of deferrals influenced the ACL assessment [2].\n\n6. **Credit Exposure Growth**: Total loans and lending commitments increased by approximately $28 billion in 2020, primarily in securities-based and Residential real estate loans, which also contributed to the higher ACL [6].\n\nIn summary, the ACL increased due to the adoption of CECL, heightened provisions related to COVID-19 impacts, and growth in credit exposure, partially offset by recoveries and charge-offs.\n\n![Loan and lending commitments exposure increased from 2019 to 2020]("}

They have already reduced their location-based GHG emissions by 56% since 2010 and have sourced 100% renewable electricity [2]. They have also erected a platinum LEED skyscraper and continue to make progress in their real estate footprint [2]. Their governance framework includes oversight by the Board and various committees to manage climate risks [3]. They are a key member of global alliances focused on sustainable development, such as the U.N. Global Investors for Sustainable Development and the World Economic Forum Net-Zero Transition Finance Committee [4]. They have issued significant amounts in Green, Social, and Sustainability Bonds to support environmental and social projects [6].\n\n**Air Pollution:**\n- In 2019, Bank of America reported air pollution emissions including nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulfur oxides (SOx), particulate matter, carbon monoxide (CO), volatile organic compounds (VOC), and particulate matter (PM) [image3]. The valued impact of these emissions was estimated to be $146,000, calculated using the World Resources Institute's Transport Emissions & Social Cost Assessment (TESCA) Tool [image3]. They have 8 active U.S. sites that intersect with protected areas, covering 6,900 square meters, indicating their real estate footprint's interaction with biodiversity areas [image3].\n\n**Impact on Operations and Society:**\n- The reduction in GHG emissions and commitment to renewable energy sources directly benefit their operations by lowering environmental impact and aligning with global sustainability goals. Their involvement in global alliances and issuance of sustainability bonds further supports their role in driving industry-wide change. The impact of air pollution, while quantified at $146,000, highlights areas for continued improvement in reducing emissions and their societal costs.

This indicates a focus on later-stage funding, likely due to the perceived lower risk associated with more established companies.\n\nBy 2007, the distribution had dramatically changed. The 2007 fund allocated 56% of its investments to early-stage companies, 24% to mid-stage, and 10% to seed, as illustrated in the same image. This shift towards earlier-stage investments suggests a strategic move to capitalize on the potential for higher growth and returns from startups, aligning with the entrepreneurial boom and improved early-stage ecosystem mentioned in [7].\n\nAdditionally, the median pre-money valuations for initial rounds, as referenced in [5], likely influenced this shift, with lower valuations making early-stage investments more attractive. The scarcity of VC money in Europe, noted in [4], also drove investors to be more selective and focus on early-stage companies with high growth potential.\n\nThe investment amounts over time, depicted in ![Investment amounts over time for 1998, 2000, and 2007 funds](image2), further support this trend.

According to the August 2022 survey, 53% of Latino registered voters support the Democratic candidate for the U.S. House of Representatives, compared to 28% supporting the Republican candidate [1]. This preference is reflected in their party identification, where 64% identify with or lean toward the Democratic Party, while 33% identify with or lean toward the Republican Party [4]. This alignment has remained relatively stable, as indicated by the data from 2019 to 2022, where the Democratic Party's support has slightly fluctuated between 62% and 66%, while the Republican Party's support has remained around 33% to 34% [3][8][image3].\n\nLatino registered voters' perceptions of differences between the parties are significant. A majority (45%) of all Hispanics believe there is a \"great deal of difference\" between the Democratic and Republican parties, with similar views among both Democratic-leaning (47%) and Republican-leaning (48%) voters [image2]. This perception of distinct differences may contribute to their strong alignment with the Democratic Party, as many feel the party cares about their views and works to earn their votes. For instance, 78% of Latino registered voters believe the Democratic Party cares about their views, compared to only 68% who feel the same about the Republican Party [image5]. Additionally, 81% think the Democratic Party works hard to earn their votes, while only 72% feel the same about the Republican Party [image5].\n\nHowever, despite this alignment, Latino voters' future party affiliation remains uncertain. A 2021 study noted that a substantial share of Latino voters have soft ties to the parties, indicating potential shifts in party loyalty [2].

However, while women in STEM jobs are more likely to report experiencing discrimination (50% vs. 41% for non-STEM jobs), the likelihood of experiencing sexual harassment is similar between STEM and non-STEM women [10].\n\nThe image evidence supports these findings. Image3 shows that 36% of women in STEM jobs believe sexual harassment is a problem in their workplace, compared to 28% of men in STEM jobs. Similarly, 55% of women in STEM jobs see it as a problem in their industry, compared to 50% of men [3][image3]. This highlights a gender gap in perceptions of sexual harassment, with women being more concerned about its prevalence in both their workplace and industry.\n\nIn summary, women in STEM jobs are significantly more likely than men to perceive sexual harassment as a problem, both in their workplace and industry, and are more likely to have experienced it themselves.\n\n![Women in STEM jobs are more likely to see sexual harassment as a problem in their workplace](image3)"}

This divergence highlights growing partisan differences in economic perceptions.\n\n![Perception of U.S. as leading economy among Republicans and Democrats from 2008 to 2020](image4)"}

Initially, the population surged dramatically, peaking in the late 19th century, followed by a gradual decline into the mid-20th century, and then a slight recovery towards the end of the century. \n\nFrom 1870 to 1890, Hamilton County's population exploded, growing from 130 to 14,096, as shown in image3. This rapid increase was largely due to the Transcontinental Railroad Act and the Homestead Act of 1862, which facilitated westward expansion and agricultural development [9]. The railroad provided transportation and economic opportunities, while the Homestead Act offered land to settlers, attracting a diverse influx of immigrants and settlers [9]. Ethnic groups such as Germans, Swedes, Danes, and others settled in clusters, establishing communities and churches that became focal points, like the Zion Lutheran Church and the Danish congregation at St. John’s [1][7][8].\n\nHowever, after 1890, the population began to decline, reaching 13,330 by 1900 and continuing to fall to 9,982 by 1940 (image3). This decline was partly due to agricultural challenges and the mechanization of farming, which reduced the need for labor and led to farm consolidation. The average farm size increased from 179.7 acres in 1920 to 577 acres by 2002, as fewer but larger farms operated in the county [4]. This consolidation trend contributed to the depopulation of rural areas, as smaller farms and communities were absorbed or abandoned.\n\nBy the mid-20th century, Hamilton County's population stabilized and slightly increased, with Aurora, the largest town, peaking at 4,225 in 2000 [2]. Despite this, other rural communities struggled, reflecting broader trends of rural depopulation in the Midwest [2][3]. The decline in rural school districts from over 100 in the early 1920s to a handful today underscores the consolidation and migration to larger towns [6].\n\nHistorical factors such as the railroad, homesteading acts, agricultural changes, and ethnic settlement patterns significantly shaped these trends.

Moreover, in Europe, 85% of EVCA listed funds have disappeared since the burst of the bubble, and only 10% of the remaining funds are considered active, yet the bulk of European venture fund managers that are still listed are no longer active, resulting in a long non-contributing tail of European VC funds listed in the Thomson database.\n[8] In addition to highly misleading published historical industry data for European VC which lead to a negative bias in official statistics, there is almost no reported performance of post-bubble vintages (which effectively started only 2004/2005) - these funds are significantly better performing and, as evidenced by recent exits across top-tier funds, are now at the inflection point.

By December 2015, this figure surged to 18%, marking a +17 percentage point increase. This shift reflects a broader trend where terrorism, national security, and ISIS together were cited by 29% of Americans as the most pressing issue, up from just 4% a year earlier [2][8][9][10][image4]. The rise in concern about terrorism is also evident in the perception of ISIS as a major threat to the U.S., with 83% now viewing it as such, up from 67% in August 2014 [2][5].\n\n**Economic Issues:**\n- Conversely, concerns about economic issues declined. In December 2014, 34% of the public named economic issues as the top problem, but this dropped to 23% by December 2015, a -11 percentage point decrease [1][image4]. This represents the lowest share in eight years, with mentions of the economy (9%) and unemployment (7%) specifically falling significantly [1].\n\n**Government Response:**\n- The public's confidence in the government's ability to reduce the terrorist threat also diminished.

This indicates a significant boost in performance in the 'Human & Social Science' category.\n\nIn contrast, the overall performance of these models is lower, reflecting the complexity of tasks in other disciplines. For instance, GPT-4V, which scores 65.3% in 'Human & Social Science', has an overall accuracy of 55.7%. This disparity highlights that while models excel in 'Human & Social Science', they face challenges in integrating and interpreting more complex visual and textual information in other fields.\n\nImage4 further supports this by showing that models like GPT-4V perform better on easier questions (76.1%) compared to medium (55.6%) and hard (31.2%) ones, indicating that simpler reasoning tasks, often found in 'Human & Social Science', are more manageable for current LMMs.\n\nIn summary, LMMs show a marked improvement in the 'Human & Social Science' category compared to their overall performance, likely due to the nature of the tasks and the types of reasoning required.\n\n**Answer:** Large multimodal models perform better in the 'Human & Social Science' category than their overall performance, likely due to the simpler reasoning and more 'natural' image types in this discipline."}

For higher-resource languages, pre-training consistently improves BLEU scores by approximately 3 points [1]. However, for extremely low-resource languages, the gains vary: small for A Z and B E, but substantial for G L, which sees up to 11 BLEU points [1]. This suggests pre-trained embeddings are particularly beneficial for languages on the threshold of producing reasonable translations.\n\nFor G L → E N, pre-training enhances both vocabulary capture and grammatical correctness, as seen in Table 6 [2]. Image4 shows that G L → E N achieves a substantial BLEU increase from 2.2 to 13.2 with pre-training, highlighting its effectiveness for low-resource languages. Similarly, R U → E N improves from 18.5 to 21.2, indicating significant gains for languages with low baseline scores [4].\n\nImage2 illustrates that pre-training boosts BLEU scores more when baseline systems are moderately effective, with the highest gains for languages like R U and H E, which have lower initial BLEU scores [4]. Image3 further shows that pre-training benefits language pairs with less similarity, such as H E → P T, with an 8.9 BLEU point increase, compared to more similar pairs like E S → P T [9].\n\nImage1 indicates that aligning word embeddings can sometimes decrease BLEU scores for high-resource languages (e.g., G L → E N), but improves scores for low-resource pairs like B E → E N and R U → E N [10].

They struggle with IE-related prompts, have limited demonstration capacity, and incur high inference costs. However, LLMs significantly improve the performance on hard samples when combined with SLM. Building on these insights, we propose an adaptive filter-then-rerank paradigm to leverage the strengths of SLMs and LLMs and mitigate their limitations. This approach consistently achieves promising results, with an average 2.4% F1 gain across multiple few-shot IE tasks, while minimizing latency and budget costs.\n\n[4] Few makes big difference Our method selectively reranks hard samples.

This uplift on a small subset significantly enhances the overall performance.\n\n[9] The results in Figure 5 substantiate our assumption.

It starts at the root and selects the top-k most relevant nodes based on cosine similarity to the query embedding. This process is repeated at each subsequent layer, progressively narrowing down to finer details. This method, illustrated in image2, involves a sequential, top-down approach where nodes are evaluated and pruned at each level, maintaining a constant ratio of thematic to granular information regardless of the query's specificity [1][9]. This can be seen in image2, where the tree structure is traversed step-by-step, with selected nodes forming the retrieved context.\n\nIn contrast, Collapsed Tree Retrieval, outlined in [2][3], evaluates all nodes simultaneously by flattening the tree into a single layer. This approach, depicted in image2, allows for a more flexible retrieval process that adapts to the query's detail level by considering all nodes at once. As stated in [1], this method consistently outperforms tree traversal because it retrieves information at the correct granularity for each question, avoiding the fixed ratio of information levels inherent in tree traversal. Image4 further illustrates this by showing how RAPTOR retrieves nodes from different layers based on the question's requirements, unlike Dense Passage Retrieval (DPR), which tends to select nodes from a single layer.\n\nThe performance differences between these methods are evident in image5, where the collapsed tree approach shows higher F1 scores across varying context lengths, indicating its superior adaptability. Additionally, image1 and image3 provide empirical evidence of the collapsed tree's effectiveness, with models using RAPTOR achieving higher accuracy and BLEU scores compared to those without it. Thus, the collapsed tree method's ability to dynamically adjust to the query's needs makes it more effective for complex, multi-step reasoning tasks. \n\nIn summary, Tree Traversal Retrieval follows a structured, layer-by-layer approach, while Collapsed Tree Retrieval offers a flexible, simultaneous evaluation of all nodes, making it more adaptable to varying query complexities."}

The comb layer integrates the outputs from the final blocks of both towers, allowing the model to leverage bidirectional information effectively. This approach is particularly beneficial during fine-tuning for downstream tasks, as it provides a comprehensive representation of each token by considering all surrounding tokens, as noted in [4] and [8].\n\nThe structure of the blocks, including the comb layer, follows architectural choices from Vaswani et al.

The dataset is meticulously curated and balanced across various categories, including Text, Code, Visual Chat, Image Generation, Interleaved Text/Image Generation, and Safety, with specific numbers of samples, tokens, and images for each category [7][5][6][9]. For instance, the dataset includes 1.6 million text samples, 14.1K code samples, 15.6K visual chat samples, 64.3K image generation samples, 16.9K interleaved generation samples, and 95.3K safety samples, totaling 940.0M tokens and 64.3K images [5][7][6][9]. This balanced approach ensures that the model is exposed to a diverse range of modalities and tasks, which is essential for its ability to handle mixed-modal inputs and outputs effectively.\n\nThe Chameleon model's inference strategy leverages this balanced dataset to maintain a stable training approach, avoiding the issue of modality imbalance that could lead to biased generation [5]. By incorporating high-quality, curated data, the model learns to generate relevant and contextually appropriate responses, whether they are text, images, or a combination of both. The inclusion of safety data, with 95.3K samples designed to provoke safe responses, further enhances the model's ability to handle sensitive prompts responsibly [9].\n\nThe image quotes provide visual examples of the types of content the model is trained on, such as aesthetically pleasing images (image3) and varied environments (image1, image2, image4), which align with the dataset's focus on high-quality visual content [6].

According to the text quotes, the object queries are initially set to zero and are transformed through the transformer decoder to produce the final set of predicted class labels and bounding boxes. These queries are added to the input of each attention layer in the decoder, allowing the model to globally reason about all objects together using pairwise relations between them, while leveraging the entire image as context [3][5]. The transformer decoder processes these object queries in parallel, decoding them into box coordinates and class labels through a feed-forward network (FFN) [5]. This parallel processing is a departure from traditional auto-regressive models, which predict outputs sequentially.\n\nThe architecture diagram in image2 illustrates this process, showing how the CNN backbone extracts image features, which are then passed through the transformer encoder-decoder. The decoder receives the object queries and outputs a set of box predictions, which are matched to ground-truth objects using a bipartite matching loss. Image3 provides a more detailed view, highlighting the flow from the CNN backbone to the transformer encoder, where positional encodings are added, and then to the decoder, where object queries are processed and passed through FFNs to generate class and box predictions. This setup ensures that the model can handle the set prediction problem directly, without needing hand-designed components like non-maximum suppression or anchor generation [1][7].\n\nIn summary, object queries in DETR serve as the initial embeddings that are transformed by the decoder to produce detections, enabling the model to process all objects in parallel and leverage global context through self-attention mechanisms.\n\n**Answer:** The DETR model uses object queries as initial embeddings in the transformer decoder, which are transformed to produce class labels and bounding boxes, allowing parallel processing of all objects and leveraging global image context through self-attention."}

Specifically, the setting \\( z = 10 \\) (which should ideally produce 100% questions) only yields 79.67% questions due to the weighted decoding feature `extrep bigram`, which discourages bigrams that have appeared in previous utterances. This feature prevents the model from using common question-forming bigrams like \"do you\" and \"what is\". To mitigate this, an extra setting \\( z = 10 \\) (boost) is introduced, allowing the model to produce necessary question-asking bigrams, resulting in a 99.54% question-asking rate, albeit with slightly increased external bigram repetition.\n\n- **Text [2]** highlights that a question-asking rate of 65.7% (z = 7) maximizes engagingness, surpassing both the repetition-controlled baseline (50.0%) and human-produced gold data (28.8%).

However, when repetition control is applied (dashed lines), the rate is significantly lower, especially at higher control levels. The \"Question-controlled CT w/ rep ctrl\" line shows a reduced slope compared to \"Question-controlled CT,\" indicating that repetition control suppresses question-asking.

This approach is depicted in Figure 3a, where the user embedding is used to set the initial state of the GRU, which then processes the sequence of news encodings to produce the final user representation. This method aims to incorporate long-term preferences by influencing the initial state of the GRU, which processes recent browsing history to capture short-term interests [4].\n\nThe second method, LSTUR-con, concatenates the long-term user representation with the short-term user representation to form a unified user vector. As shown in Figure 3b, the long-term user embedding is combined with the output of the GRU network, which processes the news encodings.

However, when the model is tested in an open-domain setting without gold paragraphs, its performance drops to 38.06 F1 [3], highlighting the challenge of retrieving relevant information without explicit guidance. This is further supported by image3, which shows that the single-paragraph BERT model's F1 score in the distractor setting is 67.08, but it decreases to 38.40 in the open-domain setting.\n\nWhen gold paragraphs are provided in the open-domain setting, the F1 score improves to 53.12 (image5), demonstrating the critical role of gold paragraphs in enhancing model performance. This aligns with text quote [10], which notes that the failure to retrieve gold paragraphs significantly affects performance, as seen in the example of the \"Bonobo apes\" question.\n\nThe type of distractors also influences performance. Using adversarial distractors reduces the F1 score from 67.08 to 46.84, but retraining on these distractors recovers much of the original accuracy, increasing to 60.10 (text [4] and image2). Similarly, filtering distractors by entity type leads to a drop in accuracy to 40.73, but retraining improves it to 58.42 (text [2] and image2). This suggests that while adversarial distractors are challenging, models can adapt with appropriate training.\n\nMulti-hop questions, as shown in image1, are less common (8%) but require more complex reasoning. The model's performance on these questions is lower, indicating that current models struggle with multi-hop reasoning without sufficient distractors. Text [5] and [7] emphasize that standard TF-IDF retrieval is insufficient for multi-hop questions, and better distractor selection methods are needed to induce multi-hop reasoning.\n\nIn summary, gold paragraphs are crucial for maintaining high F1 scores, while the type and quality of distractors significantly affect model performance. Adversarial and entity-matched distractors pose challenges but can be mitigated with retraining."}

When \\( p \\) is too small, the model tends to overfit on the long-term user representation (LTUR), leading to suboptimal performance. Conversely, when \\( p \\) is too large, performance declines.

This extensive coverage is further detailed in Figure 3 [2], which shows the distribution of questions across these disciplines. The benchmark includes 183 subfields and utilizes 30 different image types, such as diagrams, tables, charts, photographs, and medical images, as highlighted in the image1. This variety in image formats tests the perceptual capabilities of large multimodal models (LMMs) more comprehensively than benchmarks that focus on limited image types [5].\n\nIn terms of **depth**, MMMU requires expert-level reasoning and domain-specific knowledge to solve problems, unlike benchmarks that focus on commonsense or basic reasoning [5]. For example, questions in MMMU might involve applying complex concepts like \"Fourier Transform\" or \"Equilibrium Theory\" [10]. This depth is visually represented in image3, which positions MMMU at a higher level of reasoning complexity compared to other benchmarks like VQA, GQA, and MM-Vet, which are more focused on breadth or simpler reasoning tasks.\n\nThe implications for evaluating LMMs are significant. MMMU's design challenges models to integrate advanced multimodal analysis with subject-specific knowledge, as emphasized in [6]. This is crucial for assessing whether models can handle real-world, expert-level tasks that require both nuanced perception and reasoning.

This is achieved by first encoding the dialogue context and each domain-slot pair using a pre-trained BERT model, as described in [3]. The model then utilizes a slot gate to handle different types of slots: for non-categorical slots, it employs a two-way linear mapping to find text spans in the context, while for categorical slots, it selects the most plausible values from predefined picklists based on the contextual representation. \n\nThe architecture of the DS-DST model, as shown in ![DS-DST model architecture](image3), involves using BERT to encode both the candidate-value list and the recent dialog context. The candidate-value list is processed to generate representations \\( y^1, \\ldots, y^c \\), and the dialog context is encoded to produce representations \\( x_1, \\ldots, x_m \\). These representations are then used to compute cosine similarity scores between the dialog context and the candidate values, facilitating the selection of appropriate slot values. For non-categorical slots, the model identifies spans in the context using start and end vector distributions, while for categorical slots, it relies on the picklist values.\n\nThe effectiveness of this approach is supported by experimental results, where the DS-DST model outperforms other BERT-based methods, as evidenced by the joint accuracy scores in ![Joint accuracy comparison](image1) and ![MultiWOZ performance](image2). The comprehensive error analysis in ![Slot-wise accuracy](image4) further demonstrates the model's robust performance across various slots, highlighting the importance of direct interactions between the dialog context and domain-slot pairs. This dual strategy allows the model to flexibly handle both categorical and non-categorical slots, improving overall dialog state tracking accuracy. \n\nIn summary, the DS-DST model determines matching by encoding both the dialog context and slot pairs with BERT and using cosine similarity and span detection mechanisms tailored to slot types, as illustrated in the architecture and validated by performance improvements."}

This involves identifying key entities, facts, and rules present in the problem statement. For example, as shown in image4, different types of logical reasoning problems (e.g., deductive reasoning, first-order logic) are converted into specific symbolic representations (e.g., LP, FOL). The LLM uses in-context learning to map natural language to these symbolic forms, as illustrated in image5, where the Problem Formulator module converts statements into logical rules and constraints.\n\nNext, during the **Symbolic Reasoning** stage, a deterministic symbolic solver performs inference on the formulated symbolic representation. Image5 demonstrates this by showing how a logic programming engine or first-order logic prover processes the symbolic input to derive conclusions. For instance, the solver might use forward/backward-chaining to determine entailments or solve constraint satisfaction problems.\n\nFinally, the **Result Interpretation** stage involves translating the symbolic output back into natural language. The Result Interpreter module, as depicted in image5, explains the solver's output and maps it to the correct answer. This ensures that the final response is understandable and directly answers the original problem.\n\nThe effectiveness of this approach is supported by the performance improvements shown in image3, where LOGIC-LM outperforms standard prompting and chain-of-thought methods across various datasets. For example, on the ProofWriter dataset, LOGIC-LM achieves 71.45% accuracy with GPT-3.5 and 79.66% with GPT-4, compared to 36.16% and 52.67% for standard prompting, respectively. This demonstrates that decomposing the problem into symbolic reasoning significantly enhances logical problem-solving capabilities.\n\nIn summary, LOGIC-LM leverages the strengths of LLMs for natural language understanding and symbolic solvers for logical inference, resulting in more accurate and faithful reasoning."}

In contrast, Microsoft uses 32% renewable energy, 23% natural gas, 31% coal, and 10% nuclear.\n\n**Interleaved Answer:**\n\nThe energy consumption distributions of Amazon-AWS and Microsoft differ notably in their reliance on renewable energy and coal. According to image4, Amazon-AWS derives 17% of its energy from renewable sources, while Microsoft uses 32% renewable energy. This indicates that Microsoft has a higher proportion of renewable energy in its energy mix compared to Amazon-AWS. Conversely, Amazon-AWS relies more heavily on coal, with 30% of its energy coming from coal, whereas Microsoft uses 31% coal. \n\nThe implications of these differences are significant for CO2 emissions. Since coal is a major contributor to CO2 emissions, Amazon-AWS's higher coal usage suggests that it may have a larger carbon footprint compared to Microsoft. However, Microsoft's slightly higher coal usage (31% vs. 30%) is offset by its greater use of renewable energy. The U.S. energy mix, as noted in [4], is comparable to Amazon-AWS, which means that Amazon's energy profile aligns closely with national averages, potentially reflecting broader industry trends. \n\nIn summary, Microsoft's higher renewable energy usage could lead to lower CO2 emissions compared to Amazon-AWS, assuming similar energy consumption levels. This highlights the importance of renewable energy adoption in reducing the environmental impact of cloud services.\n\n**Answer:** Microsoft uses more renewable energy (32%) and slightly more coal (31%) than Amazon-AWS (17% renewable,"}

This is supported by [1], which mentions that a word-level neural network, usually an RNN, consumes word representations to produce context-sensitive hidden representations for each word. This allows the model to understand the word in its syntactic and semantic context.\n\nAt the **character level**, embeddings capture subword information such as morphological variations and capitalization patterns. [1] explains that a character-level neural network (either an RNN or a CNN) allows the model to capture these details, which are important for identifying named entities, especially in languages with rich morphology or when dealing with out-of-vocabulary words. For example, character-level information can help distinguish between different forms of a word (e.g., \"run,\" \"running,\" \"runner\") and recognize proper nouns based on capitalization.\n\n![Model architecture showing both word and character embeddings](image5) illustrates this architecture, where character-level Bi-LSTMs process individual characters before combining with word embeddings. This dual approach ensures that the model benefits from both the semantic context of words and the morphological details of characters, enhancing its ability to accurately identify named entities.\n\nIn summary, using both word-level and character-level embeddings allows the model to leverage contextual semantics and morphological details, improving NER performance."}

These steps are crucial for enhancing the model's ability to focus on relevant objects within an image, thereby improving recognition accuracy.\n\n![Pre-processing for object detection](image2)\n\n**Cropping**: The image is divided into regions based on bounding box coordinates (bbox1, bbox2, bbox3), isolating specific objects of interest. This ensures that the model processes each object individually, addressing the challenge of multiple objects of varying sizes within a single image. By cropping, the system can handle smaller and more varied object positions effectively, which is common in object detection datasets.\n\n**Blurring**: Non-target areas surrounding the cropped objects are blurred. This technique directs the model's attention to the relevant objects, reducing distractions and aiding in the identification of smaller or less prominent objects. Blurring helps the Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) concentrate on the objects of interest, facilitating more accurate recognition.\n\nBy integrating these pre-processing steps, the system enhances the retrieval and ranking phases, as shown in the diagram. The cropped and blurred regions are encoded and indexed, allowing the memory bank to retrieve and rank the most relevant categories accurately. This approach is particularly beneficial for zero-shot recognition, where the model must align regions with textual descriptions without prior training on specific categories.\n\n![Retrieving & Ranking](image1)\n\nIn summary, the pre-processing steps of cropping and blurring are essential for improving the zero-shot recognition system by focusing the model's attention on relevant objects, thereby boosting its performance in identifying and categorizing objects accurately."}

This approach effectively modeled the evolution of word meanings as a tensor, enabling temporal analysis. [1][4]\n\n2. **2011**: Release of the **Google Ngrams corpus**, which significantly impacted the field by providing a large-scale dataset for studying cultural and linguistic changes. Researchers like Mihalcea and Nastase (2012) and Gulordava and Baroni (2011) utilized this corpus to detect differences in word usage and meaning across decades. [9]\n\n3. **2012**: Development of **Word epoch disambiguation**, which improved the accuracy of identifying word senses in historical texts by distinguishing between different temporal contexts. This was crucial for refining the detection of semantic shifts. [10]\n\n4. **2013**: Introduction of **Prediction-based models (word2vec)** by Mikolov et al., which became a cornerstone for creating word embeddings. These models allowed for more nuanced and context-aware representations of words, enhancing the ability to trace semantic changes. [7]\n\n5. **2014**: **Word embeddings with incremental updates** were explored, enabling the continuous adaptation of word vectors as new data became available. Kim et al. (2014) demonstrated the effectiveness of incremental updates using Continuous Skipgram with negative sampling (SGNS), marking a shift towards dynamic embedding models.

This indicates that the abstract is a critical component for the model's understanding and representation of the document.\n- **Author Names**: Adding authors as an input (along with title and abstract) hurts performance. The text suggests that author names are sparse in the corpus, making it difficult for the model to infer document-level relatedness. Tokenization issues with Wordpieces might also contribute to this decline.\n- **Venues**: Adding venues slightly decreases performance, except on document classification, where venues are expected to have high correlation with the document's content.\n- **Hard Negatives**: The use of hard negatives in the citation-based fine-tuning objective is crucial. Without them, performance drops significantly, as shown in [2] and [8].\n\n### Image Analysis:\n- **image4** provides a detailed ablation study showing the impact of different features:\n  - **Without Abstract**: Performance drops across all tasks (Avg. 68.1), highlighting the abstract's importance.\n  - **With Venue**: Slight improvement in classification (Avg. 78.4), aligning with the text's expectation of venue relevance in classification.\n  - **With Author**: Performance decreases (Avg. 77.5), consistent with the text's explanation about author names.\n  - **No Hard Negatives**: Performance decreases (Avg. 78.4), confirming the necessity of hard negatives.\n  - **Starting with BERT-Large**: Performance drops (Avg. 77.5), supporting the text's claim that SciBERT is better suited for scientific text.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe inclusion of the abstract significantly boosts performance across tasks, while adding author names generally harms it.

However, MMMU's focus is on quality and complexity rather than sheer volume. It covers 30 diverse subjects and 183 subfields, ensuring a broad range of topics at a college level, as highlighted in [2] and [10]. This is reflected in image5, which shows MMMU positioned distinctly in terms of breadth and depth compared to other benchmarks.\n\n**Image Types**: \nUnlike other benchmarks that often limit themselves to common image formats like photographs, MMMU includes 30 diverse image types, such as diagrams, tables, charts, chemical structures, and medical images. This variety is crucial for testing advanced visual perception capabilities, as noted in [2] and [10]. Image5 emphasizes MMMU's extensive coverage of image formats, which is significantly broader than benchmarks like ScienceQA, which only includes 5 types.\n\n**Reasoning Depth**: \nMMMU requires expert-level reasoning, often involving complex subject-specific knowledge, such as applying Fourier Transform or Equilibrium Theory. This depth is a significant step up from benchmarks that focus on commonsense or simple reasoning. As stated in [2] and [10], MMMU tasks necessitate deliberate reasoning with college-level knowledge, which is visually represented in image5 by its high position on the reasoning axis.

Head word supervision is particularly helpful for predicting ultra-fine labels. This suggests that removing any of these sources might negatively impact performance, especially for ultra-fine types.\n\nLooking at the image quotes, image1 provides a detailed breakdown of performance metrics when different training data sources are excluded. Specifically, for the Ultra-Fine category:\n\n- When **Crowd** data is excluded, the F1 score drops from **14.6** to **8.4**.\n- When **Head** data is excluded, the F1 score drops from **14.6** to **8.5**.\n- When **EL** (Entity Linking) data is excluded, the F1 score drops from **14.6** to **16.0**.\n\nThis indicates that the exclusion of **Crowd** and **Head** data significantly reduces performance on ultra-fine types, while excluding **EL** data slightly improves it. This aligns with the text's assertion that head word supervision is particularly beneficial for ultra-fine labels.\n\nIn summary, excluding **Crowd** or **Head** data sources substantially decreases the model's performance on ultra-fine types, while excluding **EL** data has a less detrimental effect and even slightly improves the F1 score.\n\n![Performance metrics for different training data exclusions](image1)"}

This metric is crucial for understanding the baseline performance in the industry.\n\n2. **Specific Data**:\n   - Image3 provides specific data showing a conversion rate of **1.50%** from MQLs to SALs. This rate is significantly lower than the industry average.\n\n3. **Implications**:\n   - The lower conversion rate suggests inefficiencies in the lead qualification or handoff process between marketing and sales. This could indicate issues such as:\n     - **Misalignment**: Marketing may be qualifying leads based on criteria that do not align with sales' acceptance criteria.\n     - **Lead Quality**: The MQLs generated might not meet the sales team's standards for further engagement.\n     - **Process Gaps**: There may be gaps in communication or handoff processes between marketing and sales teams.\n\n4. **Additional Context**:\n   - Text [2] mentions that lead scoring and customizing marketing communications based on lead readiness are key practices. If these practices are not effectively implemented, it could contribute to the lower conversion rate.\n   - Text [9] emphasizes tracking the conversion of MQLs to SALs, which is essential for identifying and addressing bottlenecks in the funnel.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe conversion rate of 1.50% from MQLs to SALs is notably below the industry average of 4% to 8%.

{"q_id": 1739, "model": "InternVL3-38B", "in_tok": 11858, "out_tok": 512, "total_tok": 12370, "response": "The concepts of the Analytics Value Chain and Levels of Analytics are complementary in transforming data into actionable insights and value by outlining distinct yet interconnected stages and methodologies. The Analytics Value Chain emphasizes the sequential process from data collection to impact, ensuring that each step—from analysis to action—contributes to measurable outcomes. Meanwhile, the Levels of Analytics provide a framework for understanding the depth and sophistication of analytical activities, from basic reporting to advanced predictive modeling. Together, they ensure a comprehensive approach to data utilization.\n\n### Analytics Value Chain\nThe Analytics Value Chain, as described in [4], involves pushing data through a series of stages: collection, analysis, decisions, action, and finally impact. Each stage is crucial, and only completing the entire chain leads to creditable results. This linear progression ensures that insights are not just generated but also implemented and measured for their effect. For example, in [1], Zynga's emphasis on impact highlights that brilliant insights without actionable outcomes are worthless. The chain underscores the necessity of moving beyond analysis to tangible changes.\n\n![Data to Value Process](image4)\n\n### Levels of Analytics\nThe Levels of Analytics, illustrated in [image2], categorize analytical activities based on their complexity and intelligence. Starting from standard reports (descriptive) to predictive modeling (prescriptive), each level builds on the previous one, increasing the degree of intelligence and business value. This progression aligns with the Analytics Value Chain by providing a roadmap for advancing from basic reporting to strategic decision-making. For instance, statistical analysis (Why is this happening?) and predictive modeling (What will happen next?) are critical for informed decision-making, as shown in [image2].\n\n### Integration\nThe integration of these concepts is evident in how they guide organizations to move from data to value. The Analytics Value Chain ensures that each step, from reporting to action, is completed, while the Levels of Analytics enhance the sophistication of each stage. For example, moving from standard reports (image2) to optimization (image2) aligns with progressing from data collection to strategic action in the value chain.

This is evident from the text [4], which states that during meiosis I, homologous chromosomes separate, and the chromosome number is reduced by half. The alignment ensures that each daughter cell will receive one chromosome from each homologous pair.\n\n2. **Formation of Tetrads**: The chromosomes are in the form of tetrads, as mentioned in text [1], where homologous chromosomes come together as pairs (synapsis), and each pair, with four chromatids, is called a tetrad. This is visually represented in image1, which shows the tetrad stage with paired chromosomes.\n\n3. **Microtubule Attachment**: Microtubules from the spindle apparatus attach to the kinetochores of the chromosomes. This is illustrated in image5, where microtubules are shown attached to the kinetochores, and the chromosomes are aligned at the metaphase plate.\n\n4. **Chromosomal Structure**: The chromosomes are highly condensed, making them visible under a microscope, as described in text [10]. Image5 also depicts this condensation, showing chromosomes in a compact form ready for separation.\n\n5. **Role of Centrosomes**: Centrosomes, with centriole pairs, organize the spindle fibers, as shown in image5. These structures are crucial for the proper alignment and separation of chromosomes.\n\n6. **Crossing Over**: Although crossing over occurs earlier during prophase I, the tetrads formed during metaphase I are a result of this process, as noted in text [1]. Image5 highlights the sites of crossing over, indicating the genetic recombination that occurred earlier.\n\nIn summary, Metaphase I is characterized by the alignment of homologous chromosomes at the metaphase plate, attachment of spindle fibers to kinetochores, and the presence of tetrads, all of which are essential for the proper segregation of chromosomes during meiosis.\n\n![Homologous chromosomes align at the metaphase plate](image5)  \n![Tetrads formed during metaphase I](image1)  \n![Microtubules attached to kinetochores](image5)  \n![Chromosomes highly condensed](image5)  \n![Centrosomes organizing spindle fibers](image5)  \n\n**Answer**: During Metaphase I of meiosis, homologous chromosomes align at"}

Two examples of reflecting surfaces are:\n\n1. **CDs and DVDs**: As mentioned in [2], these discs have microscopic pits that act like the absence of light in Morse code. When a laser hits a shiny surface, it reflects, and when it hits a pit, it doesn't reflect. This reflection and non-reflection pattern is used to send data to computer chips, which then decode the information into visual or audio tracks. This demonstrates how the surface of a CD or DVD acts as a reflecting surface for laser light.\n\n   `![CDs and DVDs use reflective surfaces to read data](image1)`\n\n2. **Mirrors**: While not explicitly mentioned in the text quotes, mirrors are a classic example of reflecting surfaces.

Image3 shows a cell in the final stages of cytokinesis, with the cleavage furrow deeply indenting the cell, leading to the formation of two distinct daughter cells.\n\nThe nucleolus also reappears during telophase, as seen in image5, where it is labeled as \"Nucleolus Forming.\" This structure is essential for ribosome production and re-establishes its function as the cell transitions into interphase.\n\nIn summary, during telophase and cytokinesis, the nuclear envelope reforms, chromosomes decondense, the spindle disassembles, the plasma membrane indents to form a cleavage furrow, and the nucleolus reappears, ultimately resulting in two genetically identical daughter cells.\n\n![Nuclear envelope forming around daughter chromosomes](image5)  \n![Cell undergoing cytokinesis with a deep cleavage furrow](image3)"}

The F1 generation all exhibited purple flowers (Pp), demonstrating the dominance of the purple allele (P) over the white allele (p). This is visually represented in image5, where the P generation (true-breeding parents) shows purple and white flowers, and the F1 generation uniformly displays purple flowers.\n\nWhen the F1 generation (Pp) self-fertilizes, the alleles segregate during gamete formation, producing gametes with either P or p alleles. This segregation is illustrated in image4, where the F1 plants (Pp) produce gametes with a 50% chance of P and 50% chance of p. The resulting F2 generation exhibits a phenotypic ratio of 3:1 (purple to white flowers) and a genotypic ratio of 1:2:1 (PP:Pp:pp), as shown in image4. The phenotypic ratio arises because the dominant allele (P) masks the presence of the recessive allele (p) in heterozygous (Pp) and homozygous dominant (PP) individuals, while only homozygous recessive (pp) individuals express the white phenotype.\n\nImage3 further clarifies the genotypic possibilities: PP (homozygous dominant), Pp (heterozygous), and pp (homozygous recessive). The dominant allele (P) is represented in red, while the recessive allele (p) is in green, emphasizing how only the homozygous recessive genotype (pp) results in the white flower phenotype.\n\nThus, Mendelian inheritance explains the observed ratios by the independent assortment and segregation of alleles, leading to the characteristic 3:1 phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation.\n\n**Answer:** Mendelian inheritance explains the F2 generation's phenotypic and genotypic ratios through allele segregation and dominance, resulting in a 3:1 phenotypic ratio and 1:2:1 genotypic ratio."}

The Defamation Act, 2022, introduces several key provisions aimed at addressing defamation while also considering the protection of public interest and the limitation of certain privileges.\n\n![Belize's Defamation Act, 2022, replaced the previous Libel and Defamation Act](image2)\n\n**Key Changes:**\n\n1. **Section 18(1):** The new law specifies that unless a publication is made with malice, it is not subject to the provisions of the section if it is a report or publication in a news medium mentioned in Part III of the Act. This indicates a shift towards protecting fair reporting and news publications from defamation claims, provided they are not made with malice.\n\n2. **Section 18(2):** The Act clarifies that it is not to be construed as protecting the publication of any matter that is prohibited by law, not of public concern, or not for public benefit, nor is it to protect the publication of blasphemous or obscene matter. This ensures that while freedom of the press is enhanced, it does not extend to harmful or illegal content.\n\n3. **Qualified Privilege:** The Act maintains provisions for qualified privilege, allowing defendants to rely on this defense unless the claimant alleges malice. The claimant must serve particulars of the alleged malice, which is a procedural safeguard to prevent frivolous claims.\n\n4. **Commentary:** According to the US State Department's 2022 Report on International Religious Freedom, the Defamation Act, 2022, is rarely enforced, suggesting that while the legal framework has been updated, its practical application in blasphemy and defamation cases remains limited.\n\n![Belize's Defamation Act, 2022, includes provisions for qualified privilege and public interest](image3)\n\nIn summary, Belize's legal landscape for blasphemy and defamation has evolved to prioritize fair reporting and public interest while retaining protections against malicious publications. The new Defamation Act aims to balance freedom of expression with accountability, though its enforcement appears to be minimal based on available reports."}

Initially, the first hot dog provides a high utility of +10, but this diminishes to +4 for the second, and drops to 0 by the third. Beyond this point, consuming more hot dogs leads to negative utility, with the sixth hot dog resulting in a utility of -10. This pattern illustrates the concept of diminishing marginal utility, where the satisfaction gained from each additional unit of consumption decreases. \n\n![Diminishing marginal utility and differential outcomes](image5) highlights a similar trend, with utility dropping to negative values after the third hot dog. However, it also introduces a unique scenario where consuming an extremely high number of hot dogs (64th and 65th) yields a sudden spike in utility due to a competitive outcome, such as winning a championship. This implies that while general consumption behavior follows diminishing returns, extraordinary circumstances can alter utility significantly.\n\n![A child enjoying a hot dog](image3) visually represents the initial enjoyment, but as consumption continues, the utility decreases, aligning with the data. This suggests that consumers should be mindful of the point at which additional consumption no longer adds value and may even become detrimental, guiding them to moderate their intake for optimal satisfaction. \n\nIn summary, utility decreases with each additional hot dog consumed, indicating that consumption should be moderated to avoid negative outcomes, except in exceptional cases where external factors like competition can alter the utility significantly."}

Government spending on space exploration was high, but healthcare spending also began to rise due to advancements in medical technology and increased demand.\n- **1970s-1980s**: Post-Apollo, space exploration funding decreased, but healthcare spending continued to grow due to demographic changes and medical inflation.\n- **1990s-2000s**: Healthcare reforms and technological advancements further drove spending, while space exploration became more privatized and less government-funded.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe increase in U.S. healthcare spending as a percentage of GDP from 1960 to 2007 reflects broader economic and societal changes, including technological advancements and demographic shifts, rather than direct correlation with the Space Race. However, both sectors experienced significant government investment during the mid-20th century, with healthcare spending continuing to rise post-1970s as space exploration funding stabilized.\n\n![U.S. healthcare spending as a percentage of GDP from 1960 to 2007](image1)"}

In standard consumption, this utility typically decreases with each additional unit consumed, leading to a point where the utility becomes negative, as shown in image4. However, in competitive contexts, such as hot dog eating contests, the utility can remain positive or even increase due to the pursuit of a goal or reward, as illustrated in image5.\n\nIn standard consumption, as seen in image4, the utility from each hot dog decreases significantly after the first few units. The first hot dog provides +10 utility, the second +4, and by the sixth, the utility is -10, indicating that consuming more hot dogs becomes unpleasant. This aligns with text quote [3], which states that variety is important because diminishing marginal utility changes preferences, suggesting that switching activities can maintain enjoyment.\n\nIn competitive contexts, as depicted in image5, the utility from each hot dog can remain positive or even spike at certain points due to the competitive goal. For example, Joey Chestnut's utility from the 64th hot dog is +10000, reflecting the high reward of tying for the championship. This illustrates how focus and competitive mastery, as mentioned in text quote [5], can override the typical diminishing marginal utility, as the competitive outcome (winning) enhances the perceived utility of each additional unit consumed.\n\nText quote [7] supports this by noting that focused practice can result in increased utility due to improved outcomes, which is evident in the competitive context where the cumulative effect of focus leads to significant rewards. Image3 reinforces this by showing a young athlete who finds practice enjoyable and winning likely due to focused effort, paralleling the competitive hot dog eater's experience.\n\nIn summary, while standard consumption sees utility diminish and eventually turn negative, competitive contexts can sustain or even increase utility through focused effort and the pursuit of specific goals, as highlighted by the contrasting utility patterns in image4 and image5.\n\n![Diminishing marginal utility in standard consumption](image4) ![Competitive utility spikes](image5)\n\n**Answer:** Diminishing marginal utility typically decreases with each additional unit in standard consumption, but in competitive contexts, it can remain positive due to the pursuit of goals or rewards, as shown by the contrasting utility patterns in hot dog consumption."}

This indicates a structured lead funnel.\n- **Text [1]** explains that MQLs are leads deemed sales-ready and transferred to the sales team, which aligns with the transition from MQL to SAL.\n\n**Image Analysis:**\n- **Image4** shows a lead funnel with specific conversion rates:\n  - **Lead to MQL Conversion Rate:** 52.07%\n  - **MQL to SAL Conversion Rate:** 1.50%\n  - **SAL to SQL Conversion Rate:** 83.08%\n  - **SQL to SWO Conversion Rate:** 6.67%\n- **Image5** provides benchmarks for different stages:\n  - **MQLs to SALs:** 4% to 8%\n  - **SALs to SQLs:** 45% to 75%\n\n**Comparison and Implications:**\n- **Image4** reports an MQL to SAL conversion rate of **1.50%**, which is significantly lower than the benchmark range of **4% to 8%** provided in **Image5**. This suggests that the current conversion rate is below average, indicating potential inefficiencies in qualifying leads or aligning marketing and sales criteria.\n- The **SAL to SQL conversion rate of 83.08%** in **Image4** is within the benchmark range of **45% to 75%**, showing a strong progression from SAL to SQL.\n- The low MQL to SAL conversion rate implies that many MQLs may not meet the sales team's acceptance criteria, possibly due to misalignment between marketing and sales definitions of lead readiness or issues in lead quality.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe observed conversion rate from MQL to SAL is lower than the benchmark, suggesting a need to improve lead qualification processes or enhance communication between marketing and sales teams to better align expectations and criteria for lead readiness.\n\n![MQL to SAL conversion rate is 1.50%](image4) ![Benchmark MQL to SAL conversion rate is 4% to 8%](image5)\n\nThe conversion rate from MQL to SAL"}
