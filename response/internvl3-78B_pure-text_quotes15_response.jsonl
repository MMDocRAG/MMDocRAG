According to the latest national survey by the Pew Research Center, the share of Americans who believed the government was doing very or fairly well in reducing the threat of terrorism had fallen to 46% [2]. This decline is part of a broader trend where positive ratings have dropped 26 points since January, marking the lowest point in the post-9/11 era [10]. \n\nFor Republicans, the shift in opinion has been particularly pronounced. Just 27% of Republicans now say the government is doing very or fairly well in reducing the terrorist threat, a significant drop from 63% at the beginning of the year [9]. This aligns with the broader trend of conservative Republicans becoming more critical, with only 18% now believing the government is handling the threat effectively, down from 59% in January [3]. \n\nIn contrast, Democrats are the only partisan group where a majority still holds a positive view, with 64% saying the government is doing at least fairly well, although this is down from 85% in January [9]. This partisan divide is also reflected in the graph showing the approval ratings of government efforts over time, where the \"Very/Fairly well\" line has decreased significantly by 2015, ending at 46% [![Government efforts to reduce terrorism have declined over time](image3)]. \n\nThe image illustrating approval ratings of U.S. Presidents also highlights the partisan divide, with Republican approval of Obama declining over time, while Democratic approval remains relatively steady [![Republican approval of Obama declines, while Democratic approval remains steady](image1)].

According to the survey conducted from April 25 to May 1, 2018, both the Republican and Democratic parties are rated equally at 50% for having good policy ideas [image2]. However, the Democratic Party is slightly higher at 42% for having high ethical standards compared to the Republican Party at 41% [image2]. This suggests that the Democratic Party has a marginally higher combined perception of good policy ideas and high ethical standards.\n\nNext, we need to identify the percentage of Democrats who follow the news about congressional elections very closely. The survey indicates that 62% of Democrats say they have followed news about the elections at least fairly closely [9]. However, to find the percentage of Democrats who follow the news very closely, we can refer to the demographic breakdown in image1. Image1 shows that among political affiliations, liberals follow the subject most closely, with 62% NET (very closely and fairly closely combined). Since liberals are a subset of Democrats, and the overall percentage of Democrats following the news closely is 62%, it is reasonable to infer that a significant portion of this group follows the news very closely.\n\nCombining these insights, the Democratic Party, with a higher combined perception of good policy ideas and high ethical standards, has a notable percentage of its members following the news very closely. Specifically, the data suggests that a substantial portion of Democrats, particularly liberals, are engaged with the election news.\n\n![The Democratic Party is rated slightly higher for high ethical standards compared to the Republican Party](image2)  \n![Liberals, a subset of Democrats, follow the subject most closely](image1)\n\nIn conclusion, the percentage of the Democratic Party that holds the highest total percentage of good policy ideas and high ethical standards and reported following the news about congressional elections very closely is approximately 19% [1]."}

However, this image does not directly address age or education levels.\n\n![Levels of confidence or agreement across various demographic groups](image2) provides a detailed breakdown of trust levels by age and education. For the WHO, the \"Not at all\" and \"Not too much\" categories combined represent those who do not trust the information. For those aged 65+, 26% do not trust at all and 23% do not trust too much, totaling 49%. For postgraduates, 14% do not trust at all and 15% do not trust too much, totaling 29%.\n\nTo find the difference:\n- People over 65 who do not trust the WHO: 49% (26% + 23%)\n- Postgraduates who do not trust the EU: 29% (14% + 15%)\n\nThe difference is 49% - 29% = 20%.\n\nThus, 20% more people over 65 years old do not trust information from the WHO compared to postgraduates who do not trust information from the EU regarding the coronavirus outbreak."}

In contrast, 48% of Democrats feel the U.S. does too little to help solve world problems, with 26% each saying it does the right amount or too much [3]. This partisan divide is further emphasized by the fact that 71% of Republicans praise the U.S.'s handling of the coronavirus outbreak, whereas 73% of Democrats are critical of it [2]. Additionally, 64% of liberal Democrats support helping other countries, compared to 44% of conservative and moderate Democrats [5].\n\nEducational attainment also plays a role in these views. Higher education correlates with a greater willingness to help other nations. Six-in-ten postgraduates support U.S. involvement in global issues, while college graduates are evenly split, and majorities of those with some college experience or a high school diploma prefer focusing on domestic problems [6]. This trend is visually supported by the data in image1, which shows that 60% of postgraduates believe the U.S. should help other countries, compared to 39% who think it should deal with its own problems. In contrast, only 29% of those with a high school diploma or less support helping other countries, with 69% preferring to focus on domestic issues ![Higher education correlates with support for global engagement](image1).\n\nThe partisan gap is also evident in image1, where 76% of Republicans (including both conservatives and moderates) want the U.S. to deal with its own problems, while 53% of Democrats (with 64% of liberals) support helping other countries ![Republicans prefer domestic focus, Democrats support global engagement](image1). Furthermore, image4 illustrates the trend over time, showing that the perception of the U.S. doing \"Too much\" has increased among Republicans from 52% in 2013 to 62% in 2020, while the view that the U.S. does \"Too little\" has dropped to 8% [4].

The image data further illustrates this, showing that 65% of respondents find cyberattacks from China very serious, and 52% view China's military power as very serious [![65% find cyberattacks from China very serious](image4)]. This aligns with the text, highlighting that while confidence in Biden's handling of China is moderate, the perceived seriousness of specific issues is high.\n\nThe disparity between confidence in Biden and the seriousness of issues like cyberattacks and military power underscores a complex public sentiment. Despite the significant concerns about China's actions, confidence in Biden's ability to address these issues remains relatively low, particularly among Republicans [4][5].

This optimism is further reflected in the expectation that 72% of Latino adults believe their children will be better off financially than they are now [3][5]. The pie chart in image2 visually supports this sentiment, showing that 72% of Latinos feel they are \"Better off\" compared to a prior period, while only 16% feel \"About the same\" and 5% feel \"Less well off\" [image2].

However, these rates remain above the pre-recession low of 5% in 2006 and are consistently higher than those for non-Hispanic workers [2]. The line graph in image5 illustrates this disparity, showing that Hispanic unemployment rates have been consistently above non-Hispanic rates from 2000 to 2015, despite both groups experiencing fluctuations during recession periods.

According to a Pew Research Center survey, 35% of Hispanics viewed economic conditions as good or excellent in 2015, a higher share than among whites (25%) [9]. This optimism is further reflected in image4, where Hispanic attitudes or opinions on a certain topic (likely economic conditions) have remained generally higher than the general public's from 2004 to 2015, even increasing more significantly post-recession. Additionally, 72% of Latino adults expect their children to be better off financially, indicating a strong belief in upward mobility [5], as shown in image3, where 72% feel \"Better off\" compared to a prior period.\n\nDespite this optimism, income and wealth disparities persist.

The image showing perceptions of presidential success among party affiliates highlights this divide, with 65% of Republicans viewing Trump as successful and 80% of Democrats viewing him as unsuccessful [![Trump's success perceptions by party](image3)].\n\nConfidence in the Mueller investigation further illustrates this partisan divide. Overall, 55% of the public is confident in Mueller’s investigation, but this confidence is not evenly distributed. Among Democrats and Democratic leaners, 72% are at least somewhat confident in the fairness of Mueller’s investigation, while 58% of Republicans and Republican leaners are not too or not at all confident [7]. The image depicting levels of agreement among different groups underscores this disparity, showing that 70% of Democrats have \"not at all\" confidence in Trump’s handling of the investigation, compared to only 10% of Republicans [![Confidence in Mueller by party](image2)]. Additionally, 92% of Democrats lack confidence in Trump’s handling of the investigation, whereas 75% of Republicans are confident in his ability to handle it appropriately [9].\n\nThese perceptions are consistent over time, as confidence in Mueller’s investigation has remained relatively stable, with 55% expressing confidence in January and September 2018 [5].

About half of Americans (53%) say an inadequate federal government response is a major reason, and nearly as many (49%) point to a lack of timely testing [5]. Insufficient social distancing and mask-wearing is the most widely cited reason, with 75% of the total population considering it a major factor [10]. This aligns with the image data, which shows that 89% of Democrats/Lean Democrat and 57% of Republicans/Lean Republican believe not enough people are social distancing and mask-wearing ![Insufficient social distancing is a major reason for both parties, but more so for Democrats](image1). \n\nAdditionally, lifting COVID-19 restrictions too quickly is seen as a major reason by 58% of the total population, with 82% of Democrats and 31% of Republicans supporting this view [3].

This division is evident among conservative Republicans, who predominantly (60%) support opening stores, schools, and workplaces even without a significant reduction in infections, compared to moderate and liberal Republicans, who are more cautious [image2]. Additionally, 62% of Republicans attribute the rise in cases primarily to increased testing rather than new infections [5], with conservative Republicans especially leaning towards this view (68%) [image5].

According to the infographic in image2, 32% of people watch TV every day, 15% watch it a few times a week, 8% watch it a few times a month, and 23% never watch TV. This indicates that a significant portion of the population regularly watches television, but 23% do not access it at all. \n\nNext, consider the access to newspapers. While there is no direct data on newspaper access frequency in the text quotes, image5 provides a visual representation where 9% of the group consumes newspapers. This suggests that newspaper consumption is relatively low compared to other media, but without specific frequency details, we can infer that the percentage of people who never access newspapers might be higher than those who do, given the small consumption rate.\n\nFor internet access, image1 shows that 7% of respondents use laptops (a proxy for internet access) every day, 7% a few times a week, 4% a few times a month, and 82% never use laptops. This indicates a very low frequency of internet access, with the majority (82%) never using it.\n\nComparing these percentages, the medium with the highest percentage of people who never access it is the internet, with 82% of respondents never using laptops, as depicted in image1. Television has 23% of people who never watch it, and while newspaper data is less detailed, the low consumption rate suggests a high percentage of non-access as well, but not as high as the internet.\n\n![82% of respondents never use laptops](image1)  \n![23% of people never watch TV](image2)  \n\nIn conclusion, the internet has the highest percentage of people who never access it, with 82% of respondents never using laptops."}

It shows that 32% of the group consumes media through television, which is significantly higher than the 7% who use online media (represented by a laptop). This indicates that television remains a dominant medium for media consumption among the surveyed population. The visual representation in image5 emphasizes that television is more widely used than online platforms, reflecting a preference or greater availability of traditional media.\n\nThe rural-urban distribution mentioned in the text [6][9] also plays a role. With 83% of respondents from rural areas, where internet access might be less prevalent, television could be more accessible and commonly used. This rural bias, combined with the low percentage of laptop usage in image1, supports the inference that traditional media like television is more integral to daily life in these regions.\n\nOverall, the data suggests that while internet access exists, it is not as frequently utilized as television. The higher percentage of television consumption highlights a reliance on traditional media, possibly due to greater accessibility or cultural habits. ![Television is more frequently consumed than online media](image5) and ![Limited laptop usage indicates low internet access](image1).\n\nIn conclusion, television is accessed more frequently than the internet among the surveyed population, reflecting a stronger reliance on traditional media."}

The subscriber base saw a substantial increase, as evidenced by the data showing Telkomsel's dominance in the market with 139.3 million subscribers in 2014 [image4]. This growth can be attributed to several factors, including the rising adoption of smartphones and data services. The image illustrating subscriber and data user metrics highlights Telkomsel's lead in data users, with 63.5 million, indicating a strong shift towards data-centric services [image4].

Pyke is a logic programming language-based system that constructs a knowledge base from known facts and rules and applies forward- and backward-chaining algorithms to infer new facts and substantiate goals [5].

For instance, the VAAL (Variational Adversarial Active Learning) strategy is noted for its bias towards certain classes, such as femur-right and platelet in OrganAMNIST, while largely ignoring others like lung, liver, and monocyte [6]. This bias is further illustrated in the PathMNIST dataset, where VAAL shows a strong preference for the muscle class and neglects classes like mucus and mucosa, resulting in a lower entropy value (2.800) compared to the random strategy [image5]. The lack of label diversity in these strategies is problematic, especially in imbalanced datasets like CIFAR-10-LT, where most active querying strategies fail to query all classes even at larger initial budgets [9]. The performance of these biased strategies is often comparable to or worse than random sampling at the beginning due to the underrepresentation of minority classes [8]. In contrast, strategies that incorporate label diversity, such as the proposed method, achieve better class coverage and maintain a more balanced distribution, as seen in the improved AUC scores across various datasets [image3].

Initially, the user input is processed by a bidirectional LSTM utterance encoder, which converts the natural language input into a continuous vector representation [4]. This encoding, along with the embedding of the previous system dialogue act, is fed into a dialogue-level LSTM to maintain a continuous representation of the dialogue state [7]. This dialogue state is crucial as it serves as the basis for dialogue state tracking, where the system updates its estimation of the user's goals by maintaining a probability distribution over candidate values for each goal slot [7].\n\nOnce the dialogue state is updated, the system formulates a query command using the best hypothesis for each goal slot from the dialogue state tracking output [5]. This query is sent to an external knowledge base to retrieve relevant information, and the results are encoded [5]. The policy network then takes the dialogue state, the log probabilities of candidate values, and the encoding of the query results as inputs to determine the next system action [9]. This action is conditioned on the dialogue state, the estimated user's goal, and the query results [9].\n\nFinally, the system action is used to generate a natural language response through a template-based natural language generator (NLG). The NLG replaces delexicalised tokens in the template with values from either the estimated user goal or the retrieved knowledge base entities, depending on the emitted system action [6]. This process ensures that the response is contextually relevant and tailored to the user's request.\n\n![The system architecture shows the flow from user input through encoding, dialogue state tracking, querying the knowledge base, and generating a response](image2) illustrates the overall flow of this process, highlighting how each component interacts to produce a coherent and task-oriented response.

Unlike datasets such as VQA v2, GQA, and OK-VQA, which often focus on simplistic yes/no answers or basic entity identification, SnapNTell emphasizes knowledge-intensive responses and fine-grained entity recognition. For instance, while VQA v2 might ask, \"Is the umbrella upside down?\" with a simple \"No\" as the answer, SnapNTell poses questions like, \"What is the current status of it?\" about the Mendenhall Glacier, requiring detailed knowledge about its glacier mass balance [image2]. This distinction highlights SnapNTell's focus on providing comprehensive, entity-specific information rather than binary or straightforward answers.\n\nIn terms of categorization, SnapNTell introduces a structured approach with 22 diverse categories, including landmark, painting, sculpture, and more, totaling 7,568 unique entities [image1]. This extensive categorization ensures a broad representation of real-world entities, addressing the gap in entity specificity found in other datasets. For example, instead of using broad terms like \"Tiger,\" SnapNTell might specify \"Siberian Tiger,\" enhancing the granularity of entity recognition [2]. The dataset's design includes 10 images per entity and 10 knowledge-intensive QA pairs, ensuring that each entity is thoroughly represented and tested [4][6].\n\nCompared to datasets like ViQuAE and Encyclopedic VQA, SnapNTell excels in the number of categories (22 vs. 3 and 12), unique entities (7,568 vs. 2,400 and unspecified), and QA pairs (75,680 vs. 3,700 and 5,750) [image5]. Additionally, SnapNTell's average answer length is significantly longer (25.7 words) compared to ViQuAE (1.8 words) and Encyclopedic VQA (3.2 words), reflecting its emphasis on detailed responses [image5]. The dataset also ensures anonymity in questions, avoiding biases and enhancing the challenge for models [5][6].\n\nFurthermore, SnapNTell uniquely combines knowledge, entities, and categorization, a feature not fully addressed by other datasets [image3].

This is illustrated in image4, where bounding boxes are used to crop and resize objects from an image, creating individual embeddings for each object.

This suggests that COMET-RANK benefits from reference translations, enhancing its ability to evaluate translation quality more accurately [image1].\n\nIn contrast, BLEU, a traditional n-gram matching metric, tends to perform lower, as seen in the line graphs [image2] and [image5]. The downward trend in BLEU's Kendall Tau score when evaluating fewer top models highlights its limitations in capturing nuanced translation quality, particularly when focusing on high-performing systems [image2]. This aligns with the text noting that BLEU fails to recognize semantic similarity beyond the lexical level [1].\n\nFurthermore, COMET-RANK's performance remains strong even in non-English language pairs, as evidenced by its high scores in de-cs, de-fr, and fr-de [image4]. This demonstrates its versatility and effectiveness across diverse language combinations, unlike BLEU, which may struggle with languages that have different syntactic or semantic structures [4].\n\nOverall, COMET-RANK outperforms BLEU by leveraging neural frameworks and semantic embeddings, providing a more comprehensive evaluation of translation quality that aligns better with human judgments. The consistent high scores and improved correlation with human assessments across various language pairs underscore COMET-RANK's superiority over traditional metrics like BLEU.\n\n![COMET-RANK outperforms BLEU across language pairs, especially with reference translations](image1)  \n![COMET-RANK maintains higher Kendall Tau scores compared to BLEU in evaluating top MT systems](image"}

This slight edge in average accuracy suggests that DS-Picklist's approach, which leverages a full ontology, is more effective in handling categorical slots. However, the performance difference is minimal, indicating that both models are highly competitive.\n\nWhen examining specific slots, DS-Picklist shows significant improvements over DS-Span for slots like hotel-type, attraction-type, attraction-name, hotel-internet, and hotel-parking [2]. These slots often have values that are not directly extractable from the dialog context, making them challenging for span-based methods like DS-Span. DS-Picklist's ability to predict values from candidate lists directly addresses this issue, leading to better performance [2]. For instance, in the image showing slot-level accuracy, DS-Picklist consistently outperforms DS-DST in these categories [image1].\n\nHowever, for non-categorical slots such as taxi-leave at and train-arrive by, both models face challenges due to the lack of span matching in the dialogue context [3]. These time-related slots are difficult to predict accurately, as their values are not explicitly mentioned and rely heavily on the slot-gate classification module [3]. The error analysis highlights that while DS-Picklist reduces errors for some slots, it still struggles with time-related slots, similar to DS-DST [3].\n\nThe dual-strategy model's strength lies in its ability to handle both categorical and non-categorical slots effectively by enforcing strong interactions between dialog context and domain-slot pairs [8].

According to the text, when embeddings are aligned, the BLEU scores for all three tasks in Table 5 show increases, which suggests that aligning embeddings helps the model learn more effectively when a single encoder is used for multiple source languages. This is because aligned embeddings ensure that the word embeddings of different languages are placed in similar vector spaces, facilitating easier learning for the model [7]. However, the text also notes that in some cases, such as those shown in Table 4, the alignment of word embeddings was not beneficial, with gains or losses being insignificant across all languages [8].

The analysis reveals that pre-trained embeddings are most effective when there is a moderate amount of training data—enough to establish a basic understanding of the language but not so much that the system is already highly optimized [1][4][9]. This is evident in the BLEU score improvements observed across various language pairs, where gains are more pronounced for languages with lower baseline scores, such as Russian (RU) and Hebrew (HE), which initially had very low BLEU scores [8]. The top graph in ![The graph shows BLEU scores for pre-trained and standard models across different training set sizes](image5) illustrates that pre-training yields higher BLEU scores, especially at smaller training set sizes, indicating its utility in low-resource scenarios.\n\nLanguage similarity also plays a crucial role. Pre-training is more effective for translation pairs with higher linguistic similarity. For instance, the largest gains are seen in the Galician (GL)/Portuguese (PT) pair, which are closely related, while the Belarusian (BE)/Russian (RU) pair shows minimal improvement [3][6]. The table in ![The table shows translation datasets from various source languages to Portuguese, highlighting improvements in pre-processed metrics](image1) supports this, showing that language pairs within the same family (e.g., Spanish, French, Italian to Portuguese) have significant improvements, whereas Hebrew, with no common family, shows the highest gain due to its initially low baseline.

For instance, in the GL + PT evaluated on GL setup, alignment improves the score from 20.8 (pre) to 22.4 (align), demonstrating the efficacy of alignment in enhancing translation quality [![Alignment improves scores in multilingual setups](image3)].\n\nHowever, in bilingual scenarios, alignment may not be as crucial.

For instance, the model with GloVe embeddings without R-GCN shows a substantial decrease in performance, particularly in the masked condition, where it drops from 59.2 to 11.6 [image1]. This highlights the importance of R-GCN in updating mention representations based on their relations, even without context [2].\n\nWhen relation types are not distinguished (No relation types), the model's performance is only marginally better than using ELMo alone without R-GCN, indicating that a more informative graph structure is necessary for effective performance [9].

This suggests that both processes benefit from a moderate number of iterations, with diminishing returns beyond the second iteration. Additionally, CorefProp is primarily beneficial for entity extraction, particularly in resolving pronoun confusions, as seen in the improvement of frequent confusions associated with pronouns like GPE/PER and PER/ORG [6].

In terms of performance, SWEM models often demonstrate competitive or superior results compared to CNNs, particularly in tasks involving document classification and natural language sequence matching. For instance, on the SNLI dataset, SWEM-max achieves a test accuracy of 83.8%, outperforming CNN and LSTM encoders [1]. This is consistent with findings that max-pooling over BiLSTM hidden units is effective for such tasks [1]. Additionally, SWEM exhibits stronger performance on topic prediction tasks, leveraging both average and max-pooling features from word embeddings [7]. The hierarchical pooling operation in SWEM-hier also shows significant benefits for sentiment analysis by preserving spatial information, achieving comparable results to CNNs and LSTMs [4].\n\nWhen examining subspace dimensions, SWEM models are notably more parameter-efficient. As shown in the graphs, SWEM achieves higher accuracy than CNNs for a large range of low subspace dimensions, indicating its efficiency in obtaining decent solutions with fewer parameters [3]. For example, on the AG News dataset, SWEM requires a lower intrinsic dimension to meet an 80% testing accuracy threshold compared to CNNs [3]. However, as the subspace dimension increases, CNNs can leverage more trainable parameters to achieve higher accuracy, as seen in the Yelp P. dataset [3]. This suggests that while SWEM is effective in low-dimensional spaces, CNNs may outperform in higher dimensions due to their ability to utilize more parameters [3].\n\nThe image comparing SWEM and CNN models over subspace dimensions further illustrates this trend. ![SWEM and CNN accuracy over subspace dimensions](image1) shows that SWEM's accuracy improves and stabilizes as the dimension increases, while CNN maintains high accuracy from the start.

This represents an overall increase of $177 million in operating lease liabilities over the year. ![The table presents data on lease assets and liabilities for the years 2020 and 2019](image2)\n\nSeveral factors likely influenced this change. First, the increase in operating lease liabilities could be attributed to the company's strategic decisions to expand its operations or invest in new assets through leasing rather than purchasing. This approach can provide flexibility and reduce upfront capital expenditure, which is particularly relevant in a year marked by significant acquisitions, such as the Cytiva Acquisition mentioned in the text. [8] Additionally, the weighted average discount rate decreased from 3.1% in 2019 to 2.8% in 2020, which could have affected the present value of future lease payments, thereby increasing the reported liabilities. The consistent weighted average remaining lease term of 7 years suggests that the company maintained a similar leasing strategy in terms of lease duration, but the lower discount rate would result in higher liabilities when calculating the present value of future payments. ![The table presents data on lease assets and liabilities for the years 2020 and 2019](image2)\n\nFurthermore, the increase in operating lease ROU (Right of Use) assets from $764 million in 2019 to $942 million in 2020 indicates a growth in the company's leased assets, aligning with the rise in liabilities. This growth in leased assets and liabilities reflects the company's operational scaling and investment in assets that support its business activities without immediate capital outlay. ![The table presents data on lease assets and liabilities for the years 2020 and 2019](image2)\n\nIn summary, the company's operating lease liabilities increased from $797 million in 2019 to $974 million in 2020, influenced by strategic leasing decisions, acquisitions, and changes"}

This increase was primarily driven by higher unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, which grew from $79.854 billion in 2020 to $86.664 billion in 2021, indicating an increase in claims or adjustments in liability estimates [2]. Additionally, notes payable and other borrowings for the \"Insurance and Other\" segment decreased slightly from $41.522 billion to $39.272 billion, while the \"Railroad, Utilities, and Energy\" segment saw a marginal decrease in notes payable from $75.373 billion to $74.990 billion [2].

The U.S. market also saw a 4% decrease in company-operated sales and a 2% decrease in franchised revenues, though the impact was less severe than in international markets [5][6]. These revenue declines were reflected in the financial data, showing a decrease in total revenues from $21,365 million in 2019 to $19,208 million in 2020 [image2].\n\nThe decrease in revenues contributed to a reduction in GAAP earnings per share from $7.88 in 2019 to $6.31 in 2020, a 20% decline [image3]. Additionally, strategic charges related to the sale of McDonald's Japan stock, which reduced ownership by about 6%, resulted in a net pre-tax gain of $268 million or $0.26 per share, but this was offset by other factors such as higher selling, general, and administrative expenses and increased restaurant closing costs [2][7]. The Non-GAAP earnings per share, which exclude these strategic charges, also decreased from $7.84 in 2019 to $6.05 in 2020, a 23% decline [image3].\n\nThe pie charts illustrating revenue segments further highlight the shift, with the International Operated Markets segment decreasing from 37% to 41% of total revenues in 2020, indicating a larger impact on overall performance [image4]. The U.S. segment, while still significant, showed resilience with a smaller decline in revenues compared to international markets [image5].

In 2020, the U.S. upstream segment reported a loss of $1.6 billion, while in 2021, it reported earnings of $7.3 billion [5]. This substantial increase was driven by higher realizations of $6.9 billion, the absence of impairments and write-offs of $1.2 billion, higher sales volumes of $760 million, and higher asset sales gains of $640 million. Similarly, the international upstream segment reported a loss of $825 million in 2020 but achieved earnings of $8.5 billion in 2021 [6]. The improvement was primarily due to higher realizations of $7.6 billion, the absence of impairments and write-offs of $3.6 billion, and favorable foreign currency effects of $587 million. \n\nThe U.S. downstream segment also improved, reporting earnings of $2.4 billion in 2021 compared to a loss of $571 million in 2020 [8], driven by higher margins on refined product sales and increased earnings from CPChem.

According to the data, the reported GAAP measure for APAC showed a 18% increase, while the core non-GAAP measure, which adjusts for items affecting comparability, reflected an 8% growth. The primary factors contributing to these changes include the impact of foreign exchange translation and adjustments for acquisitions and divestitures. \n\nThe reported GAAP measure of 18% growth was partially offset by a 10% negative impact from acquisitions and divestitures, as shown in the table from image1. This indicates that while the segment experienced strong organic growth, the effects of mergers and acquisitions reduced the overall reported figure. Additionally, the core non-GAAP measure, which excludes these adjustments, provides a clearer view of the underlying performance, highlighting an 8% organic growth. This aligns with the broader discussion of net revenue growth driven by effective net pricing and organic volume growth, as mentioned in text quote [8], which also notes a 7% net revenue growth overall due to these factors.\n\nFurthermore, the table in image2 illustrates how adjustments for mark-to-market net impact, restructuring, and impairment charges, as well as inventory fair value adjustments and merger and integration charges, affect the shift from GAAP to non-GAAP measures.

This decline can be attributed to several factors. Firstly, the net income for 2020 was $4,730.5 million, a substantial drop from $6,025.4 million in 2019 and $5,924.3 million in 2018, primarily due to the impact of COVID-19 on the company's operations and revenue streams [1]. The pandemic led to reduced sales and operating income, as evidenced by a 19% decrease in operating income (20% in constant currencies) for 2020, excluding strategic gains and charges [2].

This decline was primarily attributed to lower sales and unfavorable gross margin, as well as higher legal settlements, impairments, and amortization, which were partly offset by lower legal expenses [6]. The operating income margin for Sandoz increased by 5.6 percentage points in constant currencies, reaching 16.6% of net sales, largely due to the positive impact of currency adjustments [6].\n\nOn the other hand, the core operating income for Sandoz increased significantly by 53% in USD and 48% in constant currencies, rising from $1,043 million in 2020 to $1,600 million in 2021 [image4]. This improvement was driven by lower legal settlements and impairments, despite the unfavorable gross margin and lower sales [6]. The core operating income margin also saw a substantial increase, reflecting the adjustments made to account for non-cash items and other factors [7].\n\nThe overall performance of Sandoz was influenced by the effects of the pandemic, particularly delays in cancer care and a weak flu season, which dampened generics sales [4]. The decline in retail generics and anti-infectives, as shown in the image, further highlights the challenges faced by the segment [image1]. However, the growth in biopharmaceuticals provided some positive momentum, though it was not enough to offset the broader negative trends [image1].\n\nIn summary, while the operating income for Sandoz decreased due to lower sales and higher expenses, the core operating income improved significantly due to reduced legal and impairment costs, demonstrating the impact of strategic adjustments and currency effects.\n\nThe financial performance of the Sandoz segment in 2021 saw a decrease in operating income but an increase in core operating income, driven by lower legal and impairment costs despite lower sales. ![Sandoz operating income decreased by 12% in USD](image2) and ![Sandoz core operating income increased by 53% in USD](image4)."}

This increase was primarily due to a lower cost of funds, which helped offset the impact of lower average revolving card member loan balances [7]. The table in image2 highlights that while net interest income generally decreased from 2019 to 2021, the U.S. segment consistently showed higher amounts than the international segment, and the adjusted net interest income and yield rates fluctuated over the years. The decrease in interest expense from $619 million in 2020 to $449 million in 2021 also contributed to the net interest income growth [5]. However, the potential risk of interest rate changes, as mentioned in the text, could affect future net interest income [4].\n\nRegarding card member receivables, they increased from $18.7 billion in 2020 to $22.4 billion in 2021, representing a 20% rise [image4].

The table in image4 shows that U.S. receivables grew by 24% from 2020 to 2021, while international receivables increased by 13%. The decrease in net write-off rates and the percentage of receivables past due also supported this positive trend, reflecting enhanced credit quality and reduced credit losses [6].\n\nIn summary, the net interest income increased due to lower funding costs and reduced interest expenses, while card member receivables grew because of improved economic conditions and portfolio quality. ![Net interest income increased from 2020 to 2021](image2) ![Card member receivables increased from 2020 to 2021](image4)\n\nThe net interest income increased from 2020 to 2021 due to lower costs of funds, and card member receivables rose from 2020 to 2021 because of improved portfolio quality and macroeconomic conditions."}

The current provision includes federal, state and local, and foreign components, all of which saw increases over the years, particularly in federal and foreign taxes.\n\nThe deferred income tax provision, however, has fluctuated. In 2018, it was a benefit of $42 million, turned into a provision of $230 million in 2019, and then decreased to a benefit of $(8) million in 2020. This fluctuation reflects changes in the net change in deferred income tax assets and liabilities, excluding those from acquired businesses [1]. The deferred income tax assets and liabilities play a crucial role in these trends. As of 2020, the company had total deferred income tax assets of $3,391 million and liabilities of $(6,758) million, resulting in a net deferred income tax liability of $(3,367) million [image3]. The increase in deferred liabilities, particularly in U.S. federal and state intangible assets and lease right-of-use assets, contributed to the higher deferred provision in 2019. However, the slight benefit in 2020 suggests a stabilization or reduction in these deferred tax impacts.\n\nThe valuation allowances, primarily related to future tax benefits on net operating loss carryforwards, also affect the deferred tax assets.

In 2020, the net discrete tax benefits were $122 million, significantly lower than the $475 million recorded in 2019 [3][8]. The reduction in net discrete tax benefits in 2020 was mainly due to the conversion of employee share-based awards, which contributed less to tax benefits than the remeasurement of reserves and related interest from multi-jurisdiction tax examinations in 2019 [5].\n\nThe changes in the effective tax rate and net discrete tax provisions are closely linked to the overall compensation expenses.

This decline was primarily due to the impact of COVID-19, which reduced operating earnings and led to a decrease in cash provided by operations [9]. Additionally, the company experienced a 19% decrease in operating income, excluding strategic gains from the sale of McDonald's Japan stock, which contributed $268 million in net strategic gains in 2020 [6]. The sale of McDonald's Japan stock also reduced the company's ownership by about 6% and resulted in pre-tax strategic gains of $274 million [7]. These factors, along with lower capital expenditures and fewer treasury stock purchases, influenced the overall financial performance [1].\n\nComprehensive income also decreased from $6,152.2 million in 2019 to $4,626.4 million in 2020, a reduction of $1,525.8 million [image4]. This change was influenced by a net loss in other comprehensive income, which was $(104.1) million in 2020 compared to a gain of $126.8 million in 2019. The decline in other comprehensive income was largely due to a loss in cash flow hedges of $(123.3) million in 2020, contrasting with a gain of $(20.4) million in 2019 [image4]. Foreign currency translation adjustments also contributed positively to diluted earnings per share by $0.04, but overall, the negative impact from cash flow hedges and defined benefit pension plans offset these gains [4].\n\n![Net income decreased from $6,025.4 million in 2019 to $4,730.5 million in 2020](image4)  \n![Comprehensive income decreased from $6,152.2 million in 2019 to $4,626.4 million in 2020](image4)\n\nThe decrease in net income and comprehensive income from 2019 to 2020 was primarily driven by the operational challenges posed by COVID-19, strategic asset sales, and unfavorable changes in other comprehensive income components"}

The table in image4 provides a summary of net revenue and operating profit for each division over the three years, while image3 highlights the percentage distribution of beverage and food/snack categories across regions.\n\nFrom image4, we observe that divisions like FLNA and PBNA have shown significant growth in total assets and capital spending, indicating increased investment and potential expansion. FLNA's total assets rose from $7,519 million in 2019 to $8,730 million in 2020, with capital spending slightly decreasing from $1,227 million to $1,189 million. PBNA, however, saw a substantial increase in total assets from $31,449 million in 2019 to $37,079 million in 2020, accompanied by a rise in capital spending from $1,053 million to $1,245 million. This suggests a strategic focus on enhancing operational capacity, which could contribute to net revenue growth.\n\nThe distribution of beverage and food/snack categories, as shown in image3, reveals that regions like Europe and AMESA have a more balanced split between beverages and food/snacks, with Europe maintaining a 55% beverage and 45% food/snack ratio in 2020. In contrast, LatAm and APAC have a heavier emphasis on food/snacks, with 90% and 75% respectively. This distribution might influence the net revenue and operating profit, as regions with a higher focus on food/snacks could benefit from stable demand during economic fluctuations, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, which is reflected in the pre-tax charges mentioned in [1].\n\nThe operating profit changes, as noted in [6] and [9], were influenced by net revenue growth, productivity savings, and cost management. The 24% increase in operating profit in 2020, despite a 2% decrease in another period, highlights the impact of effective net pricing and cost control measures. The emphasis on food/snacks in regions like LatAm and APAC might have provided a buffer against volatility, as food products often have more consistent demand compared to beverages.\n\nAdditionally, the corporate unallocated expenses, which include costs managed"}

In 2020, cash flows from financing activities were negative at €-249 million, while in 2021, they surged to a positive €11,839 million [4]. This dramatic shift was primarily driven by the financing of the acquisition of Varian, which involved issuing new shares and receiving substantial financial support from the Siemens Group. Specifically, the company received €10 billion in borrowings and an additional €850 million in financing from the Siemens Group, offsetting repayments of matured loans [8]. Additionally, the repurchase of treasury shares to fulfill share-based payment programs contributed to the increase in financing activities [7].\n\nOn the investing side, cash outflows increased from €-1,912 million in 2020 to €-14,140 million in 2021 [6]. This substantial rise was mainly due to the acquisition of Varian, which accounted for the bulk of the outflows. Investments in intangible assets and property, plant, and equipment also increased by €117 million, reflecting capacity expansions and enhancements [6]. The table in image4 highlights these changes, showing a significant increase in cash flows from financing activities and a corresponding rise in outflows from investing activities [![Cash flows from financing and investing activities increased significantly in 2021](image4)].\n\nOverall, the key factors driving these changes were the acquisition of Varian, increased investments in assets, and strategic financing measures to support these activities.

The decrease in core gross profit from 2020 to 2021 can be attributed to lower IFRS results and slightly different adjustment amounts, despite similar adjustment categories. The amortization of intangible assets was a significant factor in both years, but the overall impact of adjustments was slightly less in 2021 [image1][image2].\n\nThe gross profit from continuing operations in 2020 was higher than in 2021 when comparing core results, reflecting both lower IFRS results and adjustments in 2021. ![Gross profit comparison](image1) ![Gross profit comparison](image2)\n\nThe gross profit from continuing operations was higher in 2020 than in 2021."}

The net earnings attributable to P&G rose from $13,027 million in 2020 to $14,742 million in 2022, marking a substantial increase of $1,715 million. This growth can be attributed to several factors. Firstly, there was a prior year loss on early debt extinguishment, which was not present in 2022, contributing to the higher net earnings [6]. Additionally, lower interest expense and a decrease in the effective income tax rate further boosted net earnings [6]. However, foreign exchange impacts reduced net earnings by approximately $274 million in 2022 due to currency fluctuations against the U.S. dollar [6]. The increase in net earnings also benefited from a reduction in shares outstanding, which positively affected diluted net earnings per share [10].\n\nOn the other hand, stock-based expenses decreased from $558 million in 2020 to $528 million in 2022. This reduction is primarily due to lower expenses related to RSUs and PSUs, which declined from $309 million in 2020 to $257 million in 2022 [3]. The decrease in stock-based expenses reflects changes in the number of awards granted and vested, as well as fluctuations in their fair values. The table in image3 shows that while stock option expenses remained relatively stable, the reduction in RSU and PSU expenses contributed to the overall decrease in total stock-based expenses.\n\n![Net earnings attributable to P&G increased from $13,027 million in 2020 to $14,742 million in 2022](image2)  \n![Stock-based expenses decreased from $558 million in 2020 to $528 million in 2022](image3)\n\nIn summary, net earnings attributable to P&G increased due to lower interest expenses, a prior year loss on debt extinguishment, and reduced foreign exchange impacts, while stock-based expenses decreased mainly due to lower RSU and PSU expenses."}

These adjustments reflect the exclusion of non-recurring charges to provide a clearer view of ongoing performance. Similarly, in 2021, amortization adjustments of $236 million and impairments of $34 million helped elevate the operating income from $1,600 million (IFRS) to $2,064 million (core results) [image3].

In 2019, the total derivative financial instruments were valued at 734 DKK million, while in 2020, this figure rose to 1,365 DKK million. This increase is reflected in both cash flow hedges and fair value hedges, indicating a broader use of derivatives to manage financial risks. The fair values of these instruments, both positive and negative, also saw a rise, suggesting more active market engagement or changes in market conditions affecting their valuation [image1]. According to the text, the fair value of derivative financial instruments is measured using quoted market prices, and any changes in these values are recognized in the income statement as financial income or expenses [4]. This means that the increased fair value exposure in 2020 could lead to greater volatility in reported financial results, as gains or losses from these instruments are directly impacting the income statement [7].\n\nRegarding cash flow changes, the data highlights a significant decrease in working capital adjustments from 2019 to 2020. In 2019, the cash flow change in working capital was (3,388) DKK million, whereas in 2020, it was (4,353) DKK million, indicating a larger outflow or decrease in working capital [image5]. This change is influenced by various components, such as inventories, trade receivables, and trade payables. For instance, trade receivables increased from (2,126) DKK million in 2019 to (2,822) DKK million in 2020, reflecting higher amounts tied up in receivables, which could strain cash flow. Conversely, trade payables also increased, but not enough to offset the rise in receivables.

In 2020, the total depreciation and impairment losses amounted to DKK 4,307 million, an increase from DKK 4,192 million in 2019 [5]. This increase reflects ongoing assessments of asset values and the recognition of impairment losses, particularly in intangible assets such as patents and licenses. Specifically, an impairment loss of DKK 350 million was recognized in 2020, primarily related to patents and licenses not yet in use, compared to DKK 982 million in 2019 [3]. This reduction in impairment losses indicates a more favorable outlook for certain intangible assets, although the impairment was still significant and primarily affected the Diabetes and Obesity care segment [3].\n\nFor property, plant, and equipment, depreciation played a key role. In 2020, depreciation expenses totaled DKK 964 million, up from DKK 852 million in 2019 [3]. This increase is evident in the depreciation of \"Land and buildings\" and \"Other equipment,\" which saw depreciation of DKK 644 million and DKK 320 million, respectively, in 2020, compared to DKK 564 million and DKK 288 million in 2019 [image2]. The higher depreciation reflects the continued use and aging of these assets, impacting their net carrying amounts. Despite this, the net carrying amounts at the end of 2020 for \"Land and buildings\" and \"Other equipment\" were DKK 2,901 million and DKK 479 million, respectively, showing a decrease from the previous year due to depreciation and exchange rate adjustments [image2].\n\nIntangible assets not yet being amortized amounted to DKK 9,607 million in 2020, a significant increase from DKK 3,380 million in 2019 [4].

This initial rise in 2020 was partly due to the GEICO Giveback program, which reduced premiums written but did not fully offset the overall growth [10]. The slight decline in 2021 can be attributed to the non-renewal of a significant U.S. health insurance contract and pandemic-related mortality increases affecting underwriting results [8]. The image data further confirms these trends, showing premiums earned as $4,869 million in 2019, $5,861 million in 2020, and $5,648 million in 2021 ![Premiums earned data](image3).\n\n**Net Investment Income**: Net investment income, on the other hand, showed a consistent decline over the three years. It was $5,530 million in 2019, decreased to $5,039 million in 2020, and further dropped to $4,807 million in 2021 [6]. This decline was primarily driven by a significant reduction in interest and other investment income, which fell by 44.4% from 2020 to 2021 and 49.0% from 2019 to 2020, due to lower income from short-term investments and fixed maturity securities [6]. Despite this, dividend income saw modest increases, contributing to a slight cushioning of the overall decline [9].

The net change was $5,361 million in 2020, a stark contrast to the negative $3,290 million in 2019. This improvement was primarily driven by changes in operating, investing, and financing activities. \n\nOperating activities provided a net cash increase of $18,197 million in 2020, up from $14,770 million in 2019, largely due to an increase in cash provided by receivables, which added $4,795 million, and tax payment deferrals and exemptions of approximately $600 million under the U.S. CARES Act [4][6][10].

This reduction was mainly due to a decrease in net cash used for acquisitions, notably the absence of the Red Hat acquisition, which had a significant impact in the prior year [5][9]. The wind down of OEM IT commercial financing operations also contributed to a decrease in cash provided by net non-operating finance receivables [1][9].\n\nFinancing activities, however, were a net use of cash of $9,721 million in 2020, compared to a net source of $9,042 million in 2019.

This support, along with higher depreciation costs related to investments in the Experience of the Future (EOTF) and strategic technology initiatives, contributed to the overall revenue decline [2][3][6].\n\nThe total restaurant margins also decreased by 13% in 2020, reflecting the sales declines in the International Operated Markets segment [8].

Despite this, the profit before tax for the entire group, which includes contributions from both segments, increased by $387 million (42%) from 2019 to 2020, reaching $1,311 million [4]. This suggests that while the Global Banking segment faced headwinds, other areas, such as the Corporate Centre's improved net operating income and reduced credit losses, helped bolster overall profitability. The decrease in expected credit losses and other credit impairment charges by $35 million (97%) also played a role in enhancing profit before tax [4].\n\nThe disparity in performance between the segments can be attributed to the varying impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic and strategic reallocations.

The company's stock-based compensation expenses, which include stock options, restricted stock units (RSUs), and performance stock units (PSUs), have shown a slight decrease over the years. In 2020, the total stock-based expense was $558 million, which reduced to $540 million in 2021 and further to $528 million in 2022 [3]. This decline suggests a controlled approach to stock-based compensation, possibly reflecting adjustments in the number of awards granted or changes in the fair value of the awards at the date of grant [6].\n\nThe income tax benefits associated with these expenses also decreased from $97 million in 2020 to $88 million in 2022, indicating a proportional reduction in tax advantages gained from these compensations [3]. This trend aligns with the overall decrease in stock-based expenses, suggesting a consistent strategy in managing these costs.\n\nRegarding net earnings per share (EPS), there has been a notable increase. Basic EPS rose from $5.13 in 2020 to $6.00 in 2022, while diluted EPS increased from $4.96 in 2020 to $5.81 in 2022 [4]. This improvement is primarily due to an increase in net earnings and a reduction in shares outstanding, as evidenced by the net earnings attributable to P&G increasing from $13,027 million in 2020 to $14,742 million in 2022 [7]. The reduction in shares outstanding, from 2,487.1 million in 2020 to 2,410.3 million in 2022, further amplified the EPS growth [4].\n\nThe decrease in stock-based compensation expenses, combined with the increase in net earnings and reduction in shares outstanding, reflects a positive financial trend for Procter & Gamble.

This indicates a slight increase in the impact of foreign currency translation on the financial statements in 2021 compared to 2020, though the exact change from 2020 is not quantified due to the lack of a specific figure for that year.\n\nNext, looking at the components of income before income taxes, image4 provides a breakdown by region. In 2021, the income before income taxes in the United States was $8,781 million, and in foreign jurisdictions, it was $1,493 million, totaling $10,274 million. In 2020, the figures were $5,004 million for the United States and $715 million for foreign jurisdictions, totaling $5,719 million. This shows a significant increase in income before income taxes in both regions from 2020 to 2021. The U.S. income before taxes more than doubled, while foreign income also saw a notable rise, reflecting overall growth in profitability.\n\nAdditionally, text quote [5] mentions that the components of income before income taxes by U.S. and foreign jurisdictions were detailed, aligning with the data in image4. The substantial increase in U.S. income before taxes is particularly noteworthy, as it highlights a strong performance in the domestic market.\n\nIn summary, the foreign currency translation adjustments increased slightly in 2021, and there was a significant rise in income before income taxes in both the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions from 2020 to 2021. ![Foreign currency translation adjustments increased slightly in 2021](image3) ![Income before income taxes increased significantly in both U.S. and foreign jurisdictions from 2020 to 2021](image4)\n\nThe changes in foreign currency translation adjustments and components of income before income taxes from 2020 to 2021 include a slight increase in translation adjustments and a substantial rise in income before taxes in both regions."}

By 2021, the foreign income before taxes had increased to $1,493 million, while the foreign tax provision shifted to a provision of $518 million, marking a substantial change in the company's tax obligations abroad [4].\n\nThis increase in foreign income before taxes suggests a growth in international operations or improved profitability in foreign markets. However, the corresponding rise in the foreign tax provision indicates that the company is now paying more taxes on these earnings, which could be due to higher taxable income, changes in tax laws, or adjustments in tax strategies. The transition from a tax benefit to a provision highlights a shift in the company's tax environment, possibly influenced by factors such as changes in tax incentives, increased scrutiny in foreign jurisdictions, or strategic decisions to repatriate earnings [5].\n\nThe impact of these changes on the company's financial strategy is multifaceted. The higher foreign income before taxes could enhance overall profitability, but the increased tax provision reduces net income. The company might need to reassess its tax planning strategies to optimize its tax position, potentially exploring avenues to mitigate the tax burden through credits, incentives, or restructuring. Additionally, the changes underscore the importance of monitoring international tax developments and adapting to regulatory shifts to maintain financial efficiency. The company's strategy may also involve evaluating the indefinite reinvestment of foreign earnings, as indicated by the $63 million deferred tax liability related to undistributed earnings [7], to balance tax obligations with cash flow needs.\n\n![Foreign income and tax provision increased from 2019 to 2021, reflecting growth in international operations and higher tax obligations](image4) \n\nIn summary, the rise in foreign income before taxes and the shift to a higher foreign tax provision between 2019 and 2021 suggest a growing international presence but also increased tax liabilities.

This growth in commercial loans was attributed to higher demand, particularly in the commercial and industrial sector, which saw increased originations and loan draws, despite some offset from paydowns and PPP loan forgiveness [1].

This reduction was influenced by loan paydowns in a low-interest-rate environment and the transfer of $17.8 billion of first lien mortgage loans to loans held for sale, reflecting adjustments to manage interest rate risk and optimize asset allocation [1]. The shift in consumer loan composition suggests a cautious approach to consumer lending, possibly to mitigate risks associated with prolonged low interest rates.\n\nRegarding WFAM assets under management, the data shows a substantial decline from $508.8 billion at the beginning of 2020 to $603.0 billion at the start of 2021, followed by a significant reduction to $11.6 billion by the end of 2021 after the sale of WFAM on November 1, 2021 [image5].

In Germany, the actuarial assumptions are based on Siemens-specific tables (Siemens Bio 2017/2021 for 2021 and Siemens Bio 2017/2020 for 2020), which incorporate data from the German Siemens population and the Federal Statistical Office. This reflects a tailored approach to demographic projections, ensuring alignment with local workforce characteristics and statistical trends [5]. In contrast, the United States uses the Pri-2012 generational projection from the U.S. Social Security Administration's Long Range Demographic Assumptions for both years, indicating a standardized approach based on broader national data [5].\n\nFinancially, the discount rates, a critical component in calculating the present value of future pension obligations, also differ. For Germany, the discount rate was 1.7% in 2021 and 1.5% in 2020, while for the United States, it was 2.7% in 2021 and 2.4% in 2020 [4]. These rates are determined by reference to yields on high-quality corporate bonds or government bond yields, reflecting the respective economic environments and interest rate climates in each country [6]. The higher discount rates in the U.S. suggest a relatively more favorable financial market condition for discounting future liabilities compared to Germany.\n\nAdditionally, the actuarial gains and losses highlight divergent trends. In 2021, Germany experienced a total actuarial loss of -22 million euros, primarily driven by changes in financial assumptions (-26 million euros), whereas the U.S. data is not explicitly detailed in the provided image quotes. However, the broader context indicates that financial assumptions, such as discount rates and investment returns, significantly impact the funded status and obligations of the plans [2, image2].\n\n![Actuarial assumptions differ between Germany and the U.S., with Germany using Siemens-specific tables and the U.S. relying on Social Security projections](image5)  \n![Financial indicators like discount rates show Germany at 1.7% in 2021 and 1.5% in 2020, while the U.S. was at 2.7% in 2021 and 2.4%"}

This growth was primarily driven by an increase in the commercial and industrial loan portfolio, attributed to higher loan demand and originations, despite some offset from paydowns and PPP loan forgiveness [1]. The breakdown in image2 shows that commercial loans, particularly those with floating/variable interest rates, dominate the portfolio, indicating a focus on adaptable financing solutions in a fluctuating interest rate environment.\n- **Consumer Loans** decreased from $409,220 million in 2020 to $382,274 million in 2021, a decline of $26,946 million [5]. This reduction was mainly due to a decrease in the residential mortgage – first lien portfolio, influenced by low interest rates and the transfer of $17.8 billion of first lien mortgage loans to loans held for sale [1].

In 2018, Amberjack reported a net income of $157 million, and Mars reported $154 million [image5]. By 2019, the net income for Amberjack decreased to $157 million, and Mars also reported $154 million [image2]. This suggests that there was no change in net income for both entities from 2018 to 2019. However, the question asks for the change up to 2020, and the provided data does not include 2020 net income figures for these specific entities.\n\nDespite the lack of 2020 net income data for Amberjack and Mars, we can infer potential influences on their financial performance from broader financial trends and company activities. The company's overall financial health and strategic decisions, such as capital contributions and debt management, could impact net income. For instance, the company made capital contributions to Permian Basin of $25 million in 2019 and $28 million in 2018 [5], which might have affected operational expenses and, consequently, net income. Additionally, the company's debt management, including repayments and refinancing of credit facilities, could influence interest expenses and financial stability. For example, in 2018, the company repaid significant amounts under its Five Year Revolvers [2], and it amended its credit facilities to extend maturity dates and manage interest rates [8], which might have reduced interest expenses and improved net income.\n\nFurthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic's impact on market conditions in 2020 could have influenced net income. The company evaluated long-lived assets for impairment due to the pandemic but did not find a triggering event for an update in 2020 [6]. However, continued market volatility could affect future assessments. Depreciation and amortization expenses, which were $50 million in 2020, $49 million in 2019, and $46 million in 2018 [7], also contribute to operating expenses and net income.\n\nIn summary, while specific 2020 net income figures for Amberjack and Mars are not available, broader financial activities and market conditions likely influenced their performance.

This overall increase can be attributed to several factors, including market recovery and strategic investments, as evidenced by the revenue growth in 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to Comcast Spectacor and sales of Sky Glass televisions [1][6]. \n\nHowever, when examining specific segments, the picture becomes more nuanced. For instance, the Cable Communications segment saw increased expenses due to programming, technical support, and regulatory fees, which were partially offset by decreased customer service expenses [3]. This aligns with the data showing a decrease in operating costs and expenses in 2021 compared to 2020, driven by cost savings initiatives and reduced COVID-19-related costs, though offset by new product launches like Sky Glass and XClass TV [7]. The image data further illustrates these trends, with a significant decrease in operating costs and expenses from 2020 to 2021, despite a substantial increase in revenue [![Operating costs and expenses decreased while revenue increased](image3)].\n\nThe NBCUniversal and Sky segments also contributed to the changes in Adjusted EBITDA.

This decline was largely attributed to lower income from short-term investments and fixed maturity securities, as highlighted in the text [2].

This represents an increase of $74 million in net income and $78 million in comprehensive income over the two-year period [10].\n\nThe main contributing factors to this increase can be attributed to several key elements highlighted in the financial statements. Firstly, investment, dividend, and other income increased by $34 million in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to a $44 million increase in income from equity method investments. This was largely driven by the equity earnings associated with the acquisition of additional interests in Explorer and Colonial in June 2019, as well as the acquisition of an interest in Mattox in April 2020 [1]. These acquisitions contributed significantly to the growth in income from equity method investments, which is a major component of the overall financial performance.\n\nAdditionally, other income increased by $4 million in 2020, related to higher distributions from Poseidon [1]. This further bolstered the overall income figures. However, it is important to note that there was a decrease in dividend income from other investments by $14 million due to changes in accounting for Explorer and Colonial as equity method investments in 2020 rather than other investments in 2019 [1]. Despite this offset, the overall positive impact from equity method investments and other income sources outweighed the decrease in dividend income.\n\nThe comprehensive income attributable to the partnership also reflects these changes, as seen in the financial data.

According to the text, the revenue increased by US$17.9 billion, or 42 per cent, primarily due to higher average realized prices for commodities such as iron ore, copper, nickel, oil, natural gas, and thermal coal, which were partially offset by lower prices for metallurgical coal and LNG [2]. This price increase directly contributed to a substantial rise in sales prices, adding US$16,965 million to the Underlying EBITDA, as shown in the financial breakdown table [![The table presents a financial breakdown for a company’s Underlying EBITDA for the years ended 30 June 2020 and 30 June 2021](image1)]. \n\nOn the cost side, operating cash costs saw a slight decrease of US$34 million, attributed to inventory drawdowns and increased volumes post-maintenance shutdowns [![The table presents a financial breakdown for a company’s Underlying EBITDA for the years ended 30 June 2020 and 30 June 2021](image1)]. This reduction in costs, combined with the significant increase in sales prices, played a crucial role in boosting the Underlying EBITDA. However, these positive impacts were somewhat offset by negative factors such as exchange rate fluctuations and inflation, which collectively reduced EBITDA by US$1,491 million [![The table presents a financial breakdown for a company’s Underlying EBITDA for the years ended 30 June 2020 and 30 June 2021](image1)]. \n\nOverall, the net effect of higher sales prices and controlled operating costs led to a substantial increase in Underlying EBITDA from US$22,071 million in FY2020 to US$37,379 million in FY2021, reflecting effective strategic cost management and favorable market conditions [![The table presents a financial breakdown for a company’s Underlying EBITDA for the years ended 30 June 2020 and 30 June 2021](image1)].\n\nThe Underlying EBITDA increased significantly due to higher sales prices and controlled operating costs."}

The financial data shows that the profit attributable to ordinary shareholders decreased from $37,043,000 in 2019 to $11,221,000 in 2020 [image1].

In 2019, unallocated revenues were $4,723 million, primarily driven by licensing revenues from the settlement with Apple and its contract manufacturers [7]. By 2020, these revenues decreased to $1,841 million, largely due to licensing revenues from Huawei resulting from a settlement agreement [7]. In 2021, unallocated revenues dropped sharply to $54 million, mainly due to the release of a variable constraint against revenues not previously allocated to segment results [7]. This drastic reduction indicates a normalization of licensing revenues post-settlements and a shift in revenue allocation strategies.\n\nThe unallocated expenses also saw notable changes. Research and development (R&D) expenses, a significant component of unallocated costs, increased from $989 million in 2019 to $1,820 million in 2021 [image1]. This rise suggests increased investment in R&D activities not directly tied to specific segments, possibly reflecting broader strategic initiatives or acquisitions. Selling, general, and administrative expenses also increased from $413 million in 2019 to $538 million in 2021 [image1], indicating higher operational costs outside segment-specific activities. Interest expenses decreased from $619 million in 2019 to $559 million in 2021 [image1], showing a slight reduction in financial costs.\n\nComparing these changes with the net assets acquired during the acquisition of NUVIA in 2021, which totaled $1,264 million [image4], the increase in unallocated R&D expenses aligns with the strategic focus on innovation and development post-acquisition. The acquisition included significant intangible assets like in-process research and development (IPR&D) valued at $247 million and goodwill at $885 million [image4], emphasizing the company's commitment to enhancing technological capabilities. The rise in unallocated R&D expenses may reflect integration efforts and investment in new projects stemming from the acquisition, contributing to long-term growth and synergies.\n\nIn summary, the changes in unallocated revenues and expenses from 2019 to 2021 highlight a transition from settlement-driven revenues to a focus on strategic investments and operational adjustments, with the NUVIA acquisition"}

The net operating income improved by $392 million, a 60% increase, as shown in the management view of adjusted revenue [![Net operating income increased by $392 million](image1)]. This improvement was driven by several factors, including the reallocation of funding costs from Corporate Centre to global businesses starting in January 2020, which impacted revenue positively [7]. Additionally, the adjusted revenue for Global Markets increased by $1,562 million, or 27%, from 2019 to 2020 [![Global Markets revenue increased by $1,562 million](image4)]. This growth was largely attributed to higher volatility levels and increased client activity, particularly in Foreign Exchange and Credit, which saw substantial increases of 26% and 90%, respectively [9]. The Rates segment also performed strongly due to increased trading activity in government bonds, contributing to the overall revenue growth [![FICC revenue increased by $1,541 million](image4)].

However, this information alone does not provide a direct comparison to 2018.\n\nThe image quotes offer more specific details. Image5 presents a schedule of lease payments for the years 2020 to 2024 and thereafter, summarizing the total future lease payments as $303 million, with a total lease liability of $273 million after accounting for imputed interest. This indicates the total future lease payments as of December 31, 2019, were $303 million. \n\nUnfortunately, the text and images do not provide explicit data on the total future lease payments for 2018. However, we can infer changes based on the context. The text mentions that the company made significant debt repayments in 2018, which likely affected lease obligations [1]. Additionally, the adoption of a new lease standard in 2019 could have influenced the reporting of lease liabilities and payments [9].\n\nGiven the lack of direct 2018 data, we focus on the 2019 figures.

This significant decline was primarily driven by several key factors. The most substantial contributor was a reduction in equity due to losses amounting to $22.4 billion [1]. Additionally, distributions to shareholders in the form of dividends reduced equity by $14.9 billion [1]. These factors were partially offset by positive effects such as foreign exchange translation adjustments of $1.8 billion due to a weaker U.S. dollar and a $1.0 billion increase in the funded status of postretirement benefits reserves [1]. \n\nThe image showing ExxonMobil's shareholders' equity for the years 2017 through 2020 provides a detailed breakdown of these changes, illustrating how each component of equity evolved over time.

In 2020, the total equity increased from RMB 43,678 million to RMB 52,731 million, primarily driven by a substantial growth in retained earnings from RMB 7,007 million to RMB 11,111 million due to profit for the year and other comprehensive income [3]. The additional paid-in capital also rose from RMB 34,425 million to RMB 35,044 million, reflecting capital transactions such as the exercise of share options and share-based compensation [3]. Non-controlling interests increased from RMB 88 million to RMB 486 million, indicating contributions from non-controlling shareholders [3].\n\nIn 2021, the total equity decreased slightly from RMB 52,731 million to RMB 51,055 million. This change was largely due to a significant increase in treasury shares from RMB (134) million to RMB (3,660) million, indicating substantial share repurchases [1]. The retained earnings continued to grow, reaching RMB 14,194 million, supported by ongoing profitability and comprehensive income [1]. However, other reserves decreased from RMB 6,300 million to RMB 3,726 million, possibly due to allocations or adjustments in reserves [1]. The shares held for share award schemes also decreased from RMB (78) million to RMB (183) million, reflecting the issuance or exercise of shares under these schemes [1].\n\nMajor transactions affecting these changes included the acquisition of Shenzhen Lanren in March 2021 for RMB2.7 billion, which likely impacted the company's financial position and equity structure [4]. Additionally, the increased service fees and royalty payments from VIEs to PRC subsidiaries, amounting to RMB17,743 million in 2021, contributed to the operational cash flow and equity adjustments [8].

Starting with revenue, the Media segment saw a notable increase in 2021, driven by the Tokyo Olympics broadcast, which contributed $1.8 billion to the revenue [1]. Excluding this one-time event, the Media segment still experienced an 11.0% increase, primarily due to growth in distribution, advertising, and other revenues, including recovery from COVID-19 impacts in the prior year [1]. The Studios segment also saw a 16.2% revenue increase to $9.4 billion, reflecting a return to full capacity in film and television production and new content licensing agreements [1]. However, the Theme Parks segment showed a dramatic 141.2% revenue increase to $5.1 billion, largely due to the reopening of parks after COVID-19 closures and the opening of a new park in Beijing [1].\n\nDespite these revenue increases, the overall financial performance was tempered by rising operating costs and expenses. The Media segment, for instance, faced higher costs associated with Peacock, which generated $778 million in revenue but incurred $2.5 billion in operating costs in 2021, compared to $118 million in revenue and $781 million in costs in 2020 [1]. This highlights the significant investment in content and customer base growth, particularly with the introduction of ad-supported Peacock programming into Sky services [1]. The financial data from image4 shows a 63.8% increase in revenue from 2020 to 2021, but operating costs rose by 50.5%, leading to a 49.3% decrease in Adjusted EBITDA [![Operating costs and revenue increased, but EBITDA decreased](image4)].\n\nCustomer relationships also played a crucial role.

The Committee prepares pipelines for its membership and uses a structured approach to manage succession, considering unforeseen departures and replacing current Board members [image2]. When new appointments are needed, the Committee outlines a role description incorporating criteria and attributes specified in the Board Governance Document [image2]. An external search firm is selected to conduct a global search aligned with the Board's criteria, and shortlisted candidates undergo interviews with the Chair and the Committee before meeting all Board members [image2].\n\nThe Committee recommends the preferred candidate for appointment, and background checks are performed with the support of external consultants [image2]. A letter of appointment is then produced, detailing terms for Non-executive Directors, including indemnification, role definitions, independence, participation, time commitment, and continuous improvement [image2]. This process ensures that new Directors are well-prepared and aligned with BHP's governance needs.\n\nIn terms of director development, Non-executive Directors participate in continuous improvement activities after induction, overseen by the Nomination and Governance Committee [7].

The stability in the values of various investee entities, such as Stradivarius España, S.A. and Itx Portugal - Confecções, S.A., which remained consistent at 53 and 51 respectively, also supports the closing balance figures [image3]. \n\nAdditionally, the pandemic's impact in 2020, which affected store operations and market conditions, likely influenced the financial metrics, though the recovery of goodwill is supported by the profitability of acquired companies and their future cash flows [3][4].

The decline in the ratio suggests that while the institution's TLAC grew in absolute terms ($196,888 million in 2019 to $216,129 million in 2020), the growth in RWA outpaced the growth in TLAC.

In 2020, the total deferred tax assets increased from $6,391,000 to $9,449,000, with a notable rise in the portion expected to be settled after 12 months from $3,617,000 to $6,533,000 [image1]. This increase is partly due to the recognition of carry-forward tax losses, which grew from $1,799,000 in 2019 to $4,379,000 in 2020 [image5]. However, the deferred tax liabilities also rose from $19,000 to $105,000, primarily in the short-term category [image1]. The net deferred tax assets, therefore, increased from $6,372,000 in 2019 to $9,344,000 in 2020, reflecting a higher expectation of future taxable profits to utilize these assets [image1].\n\nIn terms of impairment charges, Lovisa Holdings recorded significant charges in 2020, totaling $6,117,000, primarily due to the decision to exit the Spanish market and write-downs of fixed assets, key money, and lease right-of-use assets [4]. This contrasts sharply with 2019, where no impairment charges were recognized [7]. The breakdown shows $3,360,000 for the Spanish market exit and $2,757,000 for other store impairments, highlighting the impact of strategic changes and asset revaluations [image4].\n\nThe effective tax rate (ETR) and income tax expense also saw adjustments. The reconciliation of the ETR indicates changes in tax rates in foreign jurisdictions, non-deductible expenses, and the utilization of carried-forward tax losses, which influenced the overall tax expense [image3]. Additionally, the franking percentage for dividends was reduced to 50% due to lower tax payments during the financial year [2].\n\nOverall, the major changes include a substantial increase in deferred tax assets, particularly from carry"}

This increase was accompanied by a rise in accumulated amortization from $(6,100) million in 2021 to $(6,273) million in 2022.

This suggests that while the company acquired or increased the value of its intangible assets with determinable lives, the rate of amortization expense did not increase proportionally, possibly due to the nature of the assets acquired or changes in their useful lives. The estimated amortization expenses for the subsequent years, as shown in the table ![The table presents the estimated amortization expense for the years ending June 30 from 2023 to 2027.](image3), indicate a gradual decrease, aligning with the trend observed in the actual amortization expenses from 2021 to 2022.\n\nThe changes in intangible assets with determinable lives from 2021 to 2022 were primarily driven by increases in the gross carrying amounts of brands, patents and technology, and customer relationships, with brands showing the most significant growth from $3,908 million to $4,299 million. This growth in intangible assets, despite a slight decrease in amortization expenses, suggests that the company may have extended the useful lives of some assets or acquired new assets that are amortized over longer periods, thereby spreading the amortization expense over a longer timeframe.

The reported profit before tax for the entire Group in 2020 was $8.8 billion, a decrease of 34% from the previous year [3]. This decline was largely attributed to an increase in expected credit losses (ECL) and a reduction in reported revenue, which were directly linked to the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic [7][9]. The adjusted profit before tax for the Group also fell by 45% to $12.1 billion, further highlighting the challenges faced during the year [3][7].\n\nThe image data provides additional context.

Conversely, a 100 basis point decrease in interest rates slightly increases the fair value to $105 million. This inverse relationship between interest rates and the fair value of equity index put option contracts is consistent with the text, which states that increases in interest rates generally lead to decreases in the fair values of interest rate sensitive instruments [3].

Firstly, the company's revenues grew from $40,992,534 in 2018 to $44,327,039 in 2020, as shown in the financial summary [image5]. This revenue growth contributed to higher operating income, which increased from $5,898,779 in 2018 to $6,513,644 in 2020. Additionally, the company managed its operating expenses effectively, with total operating expenses rising at a slower rate compared to revenue growth, thereby enhancing profitability.\n\nAnother significant factor was the improvement in other comprehensive income components. For instance, foreign currency translation adjustments improved from a loss of $(305,225) in 2018 to a gain of $197,696 in 2020, and cash flow hedges also showed a positive shift from a loss of $(198,645) in 2018 to a gain of $24,721 in 2020.

However, the external gross profit margin for Cloud & Cognitive Software was 77.1%, which is considerably higher than Global Business Services' 27.7% [2][4]. This indicates that Cloud & Cognitive Software maintained a more efficient cost structure relative to its revenue, contributing to higher profitability.\n\nRegarding pre-tax income, Cloud & Cognitive Software reported $7,811 million, while Global Business Services had $1,623 million [2][4]. Despite the higher absolute pre-tax income for Cloud & Cognitive Software, its pre-tax margin was 30.4%, compared to Global Business Services' 9.5% [2][4]. The lower pre-tax margin for Global Business Services suggests higher operating expenses or less efficient cost management relative to its revenue.\n\nSeveral factors contributed to these financial results. For Cloud & Cognitive Software, the decline in pre-tax income by 12.4% was attributed to the acquisition of Red Hat, ongoing strategic investments, and lower income from IP partnership agreements [9]. The gross profit margin decline was also influenced by purchase price accounting impacts from the Red Hat acquisition [9]. These factors indicate that while the segment generated significant revenue, strategic investments and acquisition-related costs impacted profitability.\n\nIn contrast, Global Business Services saw improvements in margins and pre-tax income driven by a mix shift to higher-value offerings, delivery productivity improvements, and a currency benefit from leveraging the global delivery resource model [5].

Share-based compensation expenses, as detailed in the Consolidated Shareholders’ Equity Statements, contributed to the increase in restricted share units and additional paid-in capital. Specifically, share-based compensation added $79,522 to additional paid-in capital and increased restricted share units by 1,118,284, totaling $1,197,806 in equity adjustments [6]. This reflects the company's strategy to incentivize employees through equity, impacting the equity structure without immediate cash outflow.\n\nCash flows from operating activities, as shown in the cash flow statement, provided a robust foundation for Accenture plc's cash position. The net income for 2020 was $5,185,313, which significantly bolstered retained earnings and, consequently, shareholders' equity [4]. Additionally, adjustments for depreciation, amortization, and share-based compensation expenses further enhanced the cash flow from operating activities, ensuring liquidity and financial stability. The operating activities generated substantial cash, which supported the company's ability to pay dividends and manage other financial obligations without depleting its cash reserves [image2].\n\nThe cancellation of treasury shares, amounting to $1,056,145, also impacted shareholders' equity by increasing retained earnings and adjusting additional paid-in capital. This transaction, along with the issuance of Class A shares for employee programs, which added $660,723 to equity, demonstrated Accenture plc's active management of its capital structure [10]. The comprehensive income, including net income and other comprehensive income, further solidified the equity position, with a total comprehensive income of $5,472,296 for 2020 [image4].\n\nOverall, the combination of share-based compensation and strong cash flows from operating activities ensured that Accenture plc maintained a healthy shareholders' equity and cash position in 2020, supporting its strategic financial management and operational needs.\n\n![Share-based compensation and treasury share cancellation impact equity](image5)  \n![Operating activities contribute to cash flow and retained earnings](image2)  \n\nAccenture plc's shareholders' equity and cash position in 2020 were strengthened by share-based compensation and robust cash flows from operating activities."}

The total equity increased from €12,511 million in 2020 to €16,339 million in 2021, a rise of €3,828 million [10]. This increase was primarily driven by the issuance of new shares in March 2021 to finance the acquisition of Varian, which led to a €53 million increase in issued capital and a €2,275 million increase in capital reserves [10]. Additionally, the company's retained earnings improved from a deficit of €1,276 million in 2020 to a deficit of €300 million in 2021, reflecting a substantial reduction in losses [image2]. The acquisition of treasury shares also contributed to the equity change, with treasury shares increasing from €36 million in 2020 to €240 million in 2021, largely due to repurchases for share-based payment programs [5][image2].\n\nOn the liabilities side, current liabilities saw a notable increase from €1,936 million in 2020 to €3,104 million in 2021. This was primarily due to a rise in other current liabilities from €1,198 million to €2,016 million, and an increase in current income tax liabilities from €374 million to €468 million [image3]. Non-current liabilities also grew significantly, from €969 million in 2020 to €2,686 million in 2021, largely driven by a substantial increase in deferred tax liabilities from €470 million to €2,082 million [image4]. These changes in liabilities were partly offset by the company's strong cash flows and financing activities, including the utilization of credit facilities and inflows from borrowings [6][7].\n\nThe equity ratio declined from 76% to 55% due to the significant increase in loan liabilities, which was offset by the capital increase [3].

This issuance and subsequent redemption are reflected in the cash flows from financing activities, where net cash used in financing activities was $14,933 million in 2021, indicating substantial outflows due to the redemption of existing preferred shares [![Cash flows from financing activities](image1)]. \n\nThe impact on shareholders' equity is evident in the changes in preferred shares and additional paid-in capital. As of December 31, 2021, the company had 1,600 shares of preferred shares issued and outstanding, consistent with the previous year, but the redemption of older series likely adjusted the composition of preferred equity [![Preferred shares details](image3)]. The additional paid-in capital decreased slightly from $161 million in 2020 to $153 million in 2021, reflecting adjustments from the issuance and redemption activities [![Additional paid-in capital](image3)]. \n\nThe redemption of higher-interest preferred shares and issuance of lower-interest ones likely aimed to optimize capital structure and reduce interest expenses, aligning with the company's strategy to manage Tier 1 capital requirements efficiently [2]. The net effect on shareholders' equity was a slight decrease in total equity from $22,984 million in 2020 to $22,177 million in 2021, primarily due to changes in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and retained earnings, which were influenced by foreign currency translation adjustments and unrealized losses [![Total shareholders' equity](image3)]. \n\nOverall, the strategic issuance and redemption of preferred shares helped the company manage its capital structure while impacting cash flows and equity components, reflecting prudent financial management to align with regulatory and operational goals.\n\nThe issuance and redemption of preferred shares in 2021 impacted cash flows by increasing financing outflows and adjusted shareholders' equity through changes in preferred"}

This increase in total assets suggests that the company has expanded its resources, potentially through investments in property, plant, and equipment, or an increase in receivables and inventories. Such growth in assets can indicate a strengthening balance sheet, providing the company with more resources to support future operations and investments.\n\nRegarding cash flow from operating activities, the consolidated net cash provided by operating activities significantly increased from $4.05 billion in 2020 to $7.18 billion in 2021, as stated in text quote [2] and further detailed in image2. This substantial rise in operating cash flow is primarily attributed to higher profits adjusted for non-cash items, including increased accruals for short-term incentive compensation and lower payments for these compensations, which favorably impacted cash flow. However, this increase was partially offset by higher working capital requirements, particularly in inventory and accounts receivable, which negatively affected cash flow but were somewhat mitigated by favorable changes in accounts payable and accrued expenses.\n\nThe implications of these changes are multifaceted. The increase in total assets and operating cash flow suggests improved financial health and operational efficiency, enabling the company to fund its ME&T operations more robustly, as mentioned in text quote [7]. The enhanced cash flow provides greater flexibility for strategic investments, debt reduction, or returning value to shareholders. However, the challenges in managing working capital, as noted in text quotes [2] and [9], highlight the need for continued focus on optimizing inventory and receivables to maintain liquidity and operational momentum.\n\nIn summary, the consolidated segment experienced a notable increase in total assets and operating cash flow from 2020 to 2021, reflecting improved financial performance and operational strength. ![Total assets increased from 2020 to 2021](image3) and ![Net cash from operating activities rose significantly](image2).

This decline is primarily attributed to a significant decrease in cash and cash equivalents, which fell from $32,965 million in 2020 to $22,028 million in 2021, a reduction of $10,937 million [image3]. This substantial decrease in cash and cash equivalents is reflected in the statement of cash flows, where the net change in cash and cash equivalents for 2021 was a decrease of $10,937 million [image2]. The reduction in cash and cash equivalents was driven by various factors, including an increase in card member loans and receivables, debt maturities, share repurchases, and a reduction in customer deposits, partially offset by the issuance of unsecured and secured debt securities [10].\n\nThe total liabilities also decreased from $168,383 million in 2020 to $166,371 million in 2021, a reduction of $2,012 million [image3]. This decrease in liabilities is consistent with the reduction in customer deposits, which fell from $86,875 million in 2020 to $84,382 million in 2021 [image3]. The decrease in customer deposits is evident in the cash flows from financing activities, where there was a net cash outflow of $14,933 million in 2021, largely due to a decrease in customer deposits and share repurchases [image2].\n\nThese changes in assets and liabilities are interconnected with the entity's comprehensive income. The net income for 2021 was $8,060 million, contributing to the net cash provided by operating activities of $14,645 million [image2].

According to the data, WPB's total revenue in 2020 was $20,756 million (Retail Banking: $12,938 million + Wealth Management: $7,818 million), showing a significant decline from $24,288 million in 2019 [3]. This decline is primarily due to a decrease in net interest income and non-interest income, particularly in Retail Banking, where net interest income fell by $2,285 million or 16% [3]. In contrast, CMB's net operating income was $13,312 million in 2020, down from $15,164 million in 2019, a decrease of $1,852 million or 12% [4]. The decline in CMB's income is attributed to higher adjusted ECL charges and lower global interest rates [5].\n\nNext, let's look at profit before tax. WPB's profit before tax is not directly provided, but the overall profit before tax for HSBC in 2020 was $1,868 million, a drastic decrease of $5,302 million or 74% from 2019 [4]. This significant drop is largely due to higher adjusted ECL charges, which increased by $3,592 million or more than 200% from 2019 to 2020 [4]. CMB's performance was also adversely impacted by similar factors, including increased ECL charges and lower interest rates, but specific profit figures for CMB are not detailed separately [5].\n\nIn summary, both WPB and CMB experienced declines in net operating income and profit before tax in 2020. WPB's revenue decline was more pronounced due to substantial decreases in both interest and non-interest income, while CMB's challenges were driven by higher credit losses and lower interest rates. The overall profit before tax for HSBC reflects these challenges, with a significant reduction across the board.\n\n![Wealth and Personal Banking revenue decline in 2020](image3)  \n![Commercial Banking net operating income decline"}

Additionally, the establishment of new U.S. net deferred tax assets in 2019 resulted in a tax benefit of $570 million, contributing to the complex adjustments in tax provisions [6].\n\nIn 2020, the effective tax rate decreased to 9%, reflecting a more stable tax environment and fewer extraordinary adjustments. The total effective tax provision was $521 million, with a notable benefit from the FDII deduction of $381 million and excess tax benefits associated with share-based awards of $83 million [2]. The unrecognized tax benefits increased from $1,705 million in 2019 to $1,901 million in 2020, primarily due to expected refunds of Korean withholding taxes [3]. The settlements with taxing authorities in 2020 amounted to $14 million, reducing the unrecognized tax benefits slightly [5].\n\nBy 2021, the effective tax rate further decreased to 12%, with the total effective tax provision rising to $1,231 million. The benefit from the FDII deduction increased to $550 million, and excess tax benefits from share-based awards rose to $265 million [2]. The unrecognized tax benefits continued to grow, reaching $2,136 million in 2021, driven by additions for current year tax positions and prior year adjustments [3]. The company also faced ongoing examinations by tax authorities, particularly related to transfer pricing, which could impact future tax provisions [3].\n\nThe grand total of tax provisions (benefits) for 2019, 2020, and 2021 was $3,095 million, $521 million, and $1,231 million, respectively, highlighting a significant reduction in tax provisions over the years [image3].

According to the data, the sale resulted in a reduction of WFAM AUM by $587.1 billion in 2021, as shown in the table detailing WFAM assets under management [![The table presents data on \"WFAM assets under management\" over three years, focusing on broken down categories and financial movements.](image5)]. This substantial decrease reflects the immediate removal of WFAM's assets from the company's management portfolio following the sale.\n\nThe sale also contributed to a net gain of $269 million, which was recorded in the company's income statement for 2021 [2]. This gain, along with gains from other sales such as the Corporate Trust Services business and the student loan portfolio, helped offset some of the declines in other areas of income. Specifically, the sale of WFAM led to lower asset-based fees due to the cessation of managing those assets post-sale [3]. These fees were previously earned as a percentage of the market value of the AUM managed by WFAM [6].\n\nOn the balance sheet, the sale of WFAM is reflected in the reduction of total assets under management (AUM) and assets under administration (AUA) for Institutional Retirement and Trust (IRT) client assets, which were $19 billion and $582 billion, respectively, at the end of 2021 [4]. The transition services agreement, which allowed the company to continue administering these assets until June 2022, temporarily mitigated the impact on the balance sheet [4].\n\nAdditionally, the sale influenced noninterest income, which increased in 2021 due to the $269 million gain from WFAM's sale, partially offset by lower gains on debt securities and other factors [10].

The text also mentions that reported operating expenses in 2020 were $7.9 billion lower than in 2019, primarily due to the non-recurrence of a $7.3 billion goodwill impairment and lower customer redress program costs [7]. This suggests that the operating expenses for WPB in 2019 were higher than in 2020, reflecting the impact of significant one-time costs in the previous year.\n\nIn summary, the Wealth and Personal Banking segment experienced a notable increase in reported revenue from 2019 to 2020, while reported operating expenses decreased, largely due to the absence of significant one-time costs in 2020.\n\nThe reported revenue for the Wealth and Personal Banking segment increased from 2019 to 2020, while reported operating expenses decreased."}

According to the text, net interest income decreased by $19,747 million from 2019 to 2020, primarily driven by lower interest rates, which affected various financial instruments such as interest-bearing deposits and other short-term investments, as well as debt securities and loans and leases [6]. This decrease was partially offset by reduced deposit and funding costs and the deployment of excess deposits into securities [6]. The image data further illustrates these changes, showing a notable decline in interest income across multiple categories, including a decrease of $1,464 million in interest-bearing deposits and other short-term investments and significant reductions in interest income from U.S. commercial loans [![Decrease in interest income across categories](image2)]. \n\nOn the expense side, interest expenses also decreased by $5,627 million from 2019 to 2020, with significant reductions in expenses related to loans and federal funds purchased, amounting to $14,120 million [![Decrease in interest expenses](image2)]. However, the decrease in interest income outpaced the decrease in interest expenses, leading to a net reduction in net interest income. The net interest yield on a fully taxable-equivalent (FTE) basis decreased by 53 basis points to 1.90 percent for 2020 [6], reflecting the pressure on the net interest spread due to the lower interest rate environment. \n\nThe image showing the financial summary over three years highlights the trends in interest rates and balance sheets, indicating that the net interest spread was affected by the widening gap between the rates on earning assets and the cost of interest-bearing liabilities [![Trends in interest rates and balance sheets](image5)]. The main contributing factors were the lower interest rates, which reduced income from earning assets more significantly than the reduction in interest expenses from liabilities. This combination led to a narrower net interest spread, impacting the overall profitability of the segments, particularly Consumer Banking, where net interest income decreased by $3.5 billion [3].\n\nIn summary, the net interest spread was negatively affected by the larger decrease in net interest income compared to the decrease in net interest expenses, primarily due to lower interest rates and their impact on earning assets. ![Decrease in interest income outpaced expense reduction](image2) and ![Lower interest rates impacted earning assets](image"}

This accumulation suggests ongoing uncertainty in tax positions, which could impact future financial statements if resolved unfavorably.\n\nRegarding common share repurchases, the company repurchased 14 million shares in 2020 at an average price of $300.58 per share, totaling $4,250 million, compared to 22 million shares at $245.97 per share, totaling $5,500 million in 2019, as shown in image1. Despite the lower number of shares repurchased, the average price per share increased, indicating a higher cost per share. The remaining authorized shares for repurchase decreased from 72 million in 2019 to 58 million in 2020, reflecting ongoing efforts to optimize capital structure and improve shareholder returns, as stated in [2] and [5].\n\nThe implications for the company's financial position include a higher liability for unrecognized tax benefits, which could affect future tax expenses and cash flows if not resolved favorably. Additionally, the continued share repurchase program, albeit at a higher cost per share, signals a commitment to returning value to shareholders, albeit with reduced volume compared to the previous year. These actions collectively suggest a focus on managing tax uncertainties and optimizing capital allocation, albeit with potential risks and costs associated with both tax liabilities and share repurchases.\n\nThe company's gross unrecognized tax benefits increased by $406 million from 2019 to 2020, and common share repurchases decreased in volume but increased in cost per share, reflecting strategic financial management with potential implications for future tax liabilities and shareholder returns. ![Gross unrecognized tax benefits increased by $406 million](image3) ![Common share repurchases decreased in volume but increased in cost per share](image1)"}

The Annual Total Remuneration is determined using a formula that incorporates consolidated operating income and the volatility of Toyota's share price, alongside individual performance evaluations [1][3]. This approach ensures that remuneration is not only tied to corporate performance but also reflects individual contributions, as outlined in the concept of the \"Toyoda\" [1]. \n\nThe evaluation framework, as depicted in ![The table shows an evaluation framework for Toyota, divided into two main criteria: Consolidated Operating Income and Volatility of Toyota’s Share Price](image3), highlights the dual focus on financial metrics and stock volatility. Consolidated operating income is weighted at 50%, with performance assessed against a reference value of 1 trillion yen, aiming for sustainable growth. The volatility of Toyota’s share price, also weighted at 50%, compares Toyota’s share price to the Nikkei stock average, emphasizing shareholder value [3][image3]. This balanced approach ensures that executives are incentivized to achieve both operational success and maintain a stable, attractive stock performance for investors.\n\nFurthermore, the remuneration structure distinguishes between fixed and performance-linked components. Fixed remuneration is set based on job responsibilities and home country standards, while performance-linked remuneration is directly tied to consolidated operating income, share price volatility, and individual performance [10]. This structure, as shown in ![The table shows the remuneration details for different categories of executives, expressed in million yen](image4), ensures that a significant portion of compensation is contingent on achieving specific financial and performance targets, reinforcing accountability and alignment with shareholder interests.\n\nThe Board of Directors plays a crucial role in setting remuneration policies, ensuring they reflect corporate performance and individual responsibilities [2][5]. The Executive Compensation Meeting reviews and determines remuneration amounts, considering factors like corporate performance and individual contributions, in line with established policies [5]. This governance structure helps maintain transparency and fairness in compensation decisions.\n\nIn summary, Toyota's executive remuneration system effectively links compensation to business performance and shareholder value through a structured evaluation framework and a balanced remuneration mix, ensuring alignment with strategic objectives and investor expectations.\n\nToyota's executive remuneration evaluation reflects business performance and shareholder value by tying compensation to consolidated operating income, share price volatility, and individual performance, ensuring alignment with corporate and investor goals."}

Market risk RWA also increased significantly, with a $14,547 million rise under the Standardized approach and $14,443 million under the Advanced approach, mainly due to higher market volatility [6][image3].\n\nDespite these increases in RWA, the External TLAC as a percentage of RWA decreased from 49.9% in 2019 to 47.7% in 2020 [image5]. This decline indicates that while the absolute amount of External TLAC increased from $196,888 million to $216,129 million, the growth in RWA outpaced the growth in TLAC, leading to a lower percentage. The regulatory minimum for External TLAC as a percentage of RWA is 18.0%, and the required ratio is 21.5%, both of which were comfortably exceeded in 2020 [image5]. The decrease in the TLAC percentage reflects the proportional relationship between TLAC and the expanding RWA, highlighting the institution's continued compliance with regulatory requirements despite the reduced ratio [3][image5].\n\n![The External TLAC as a percentage of RWA decreased from 49.9% in 2019 to 47.7% in 2020](image5)\n\nIn summary, the increase in RWA components, particularly credit and market risk, led to a higher absolute RWA, which diluted the External TL"}

This change was influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to significant operational challenges. Despite these challenges, the U.S. market showed resilience, partly due to strategic marketing investments and promotional activities, such as the free Thank You Meals for first responders and healthcare workers, which helped drive recovery and growth [1][2][4]. Additionally, the U.S. benefited from growth in delivery services, which positively impacted comparable sales in the latter half of 2020 [4].\n\nThe International Operated Markets segment, however, faced more substantial declines. In 2020, this segment saw a 13% decrease in revenue, compared to a 3% increase in 2019 [5]. The decline was primarily driven by the impact of COVID-19, including temporary restaurant closures and limited operations in key markets like the U.K., France, Germany, Italy, and Spain [3][4]. The pandemic also led to increased expenses for employee-related costs, personal protective equipment, and other restaurant costs, further affecting margins [6]. The image data shows that International Operated Markets' company-operated sales decreased by 19% and franchised revenues by 14% in 2020, highlighting the severity of the impact [image3].\n\nThe revenue composition also shifted slightly. In 2020, the U.S. segment's total revenue decreased by 2%, while the International Operated Markets saw a 17% decline [image3]. The pie charts illustrate that the U.S. segment's share of total revenues remained relatively stable, but the International Operated Markets' share decreased from 37% in 2019 to 41% in 2020, reflecting the disproportionate impact on international markets [image4]. The bar chart further emphasizes the decline in both franchised and company-operated margins in 2020, with franchised margins dropping from $9,455 million in 2019 to $8,519 million in 2020, and company-operated margins from $1,660 million to $1,158 million [image1].\n\nOverall, the changes in revenue"}

For solar energy systems, the net value decreased from $6,061 million in 2019 to $5,906 million in 2020, primarily due to an increase in accumulated depreciation and amortization from $723 million to $955 million [2]. This reflects the ongoing depreciation of solar energy systems in service, which reduced their net value over time. \n\nRegarding property, plant, and equipment, the total asset values before depreciation increased from $14,130 million in 2019 to $17,864 million in 2020, but the accumulated depreciation also rose from $3,734 million to $5,117 million [![The table provides a breakdown of asset categories and their recorded values as of December 31, 2020, and December 31, 2019, along with accumulated depreciation and total net value.](image1)].

This growth in net income directly contributed to the increase in retained earnings, a key component of shareholders' equity. Additionally, the comprehensive income for 2020 was $5,472,296, reflecting a substantial improvement from $4,575,086 in 2019 and $3,730,974 in 2018 [image2].

The increase in net income and comprehensive income over the years led to higher retained earnings, which are part of shareholders' equity. However, these gains were partially offset by significant share repurchases and dividend payments. For instance, in 2020, Accenture declared a quarterly dividend of $0.88 per share, totaling $2,112,457 in dividends paid, which reduced equity [2][image5].

The table shows that the total WFAM AUM started at $603.0 billion at the beginning of 2021, with inflows of $69.3 billion and outflows of $(96.8) billion. However, the most notable change was the sale impact, which reduced AUM by $(587.1) billion, resulting in an end balance of $60.0 billion. This drastic reduction reflects the divestiture of WFAM, which was part of strategic moves to streamline operations and manage under the asset cap [2][3][6][10].\n\nThe sale of WFAM also influenced other aspects of the balance sheet. For instance, the decline in available-for-sale debt securities, as seen in image1, was partially due to portfolio rebalancing to manage liquidity and interest rate risk [4]. The table in image1 shows a decrease in available-for-sale securities from $220,392 million in 2020 to $177,244 million in 2021, indicating a strategic shift in asset allocation.

The table in image2 highlights the substantial drop in interest income, aligning with the text that mentions low short-term interest rates prevailing through 2021, which reduced interest income significantly [2]. The company prioritized liquidity and safety over yield, holding substantial cash and short-term U.S. Treasury Bills, as evidenced by the increase in cash equivalents from $67,082 million in 2020 to $90,688 million in 2021 in image5.\n\nRailroad operating earnings, on the other hand, showed a more positive trend, increasing from $5,161 million in 2020 to $5,990 million in 2021, a rise of $829 million (16.1%), as depicted in image1. This improvement was largely due to higher volumes and average revenue per car/unit, driven by business mix changes and higher fuel surcharge revenue from increased fuel prices [7]. The table in image3 supports this, showing a 6.9% increase in total cars/units from 2020 to 2021, with notable growth in coal (8.9%) and consumer products (7.7%). Additionally, railroad operating revenues increased by 11.6% in 2021 compared to 2020, reflecting recovery from the pandemic's impact in 2020 [7]. The increase in operating expenses by $1.3 billion (10.2%) was offset by productivity improvements and higher fuel prices, which also contributed to the higher revenue per car/unit [4].\n\nIn summary, the decline in net investment income was mainly due to lower interest income, while railroad operating earnings improved due to increased volumes and revenue per"}

This increase reflects the company's financial growth and stability over the years. The rise in equity can be attributed to factors such as net income, comprehensive income, and changes in retained earnings, as detailed in the shareholders' equity summary [image5]. \n\nSimultaneously, the number of systemwide restaurants also saw a steady increase. According to the restaurant count data, the total number of systemwide restaurants grew from 37,855 in 2018 to 39,198 in 2020 [image1]. This expansion indicates McDonald's continued global growth, with a significant portion of the restaurants being franchised, which aligns with the company's strategy of franchising the majority of its locations [1][9].

This change reflects the ongoing amortization of these assets, which is a systematic allocation of their cost over their useful lives. The accumulated amortization for finite-lived intangible assets rose from $113 million in 2019 to $162 million in 2020, indicating an increase in amortization expenses over the year. This increase in accumulated amortization aligns with the company's policy of amortizing intangible assets over their estimated useful lives, which can range from one to nine years, as mentioned in the text [2]. The specific amortization expenses for each year are not detailed in the provided text, but the increase in accumulated amortization suggests that the company continued to recognize amortization expenses, reducing the net carrying amount of these assets over time.

The weighted average discount rate decreased from 3.1% in 2019 to 2.8% in 2020, suggesting a slight reduction in the cost of financing these leases. The consistent weighted average remaining lease term of 7 years for both years indicates stable lease durations. These changes suggest the company expanded its leasing activities, possibly to optimize asset utilization without immediate capital expenditure, which can be seen in the financial statements as an increase in operating lease liabilities and assets, impacting cash flow management and financial leverage. ![The table presents data on lease assets and liabilities for the years 2020 and 2019](image4)\n\nRegarding inventories, there was a notable increase across all categories from 2019 to 2020.

In 2019, the net deferred tax asset was $119 million, while in 2020, it increased to $253 million, nearly doubling. This increase can be attributed to several factors outlined in the text and images.\n\nFirstly, the balance of uncertain tax positions decreased from $303 million in 2019 to $89 million in 2020, primarily due to a $249 million reduction for the effective settlement of a depreciation-related uncertain tax position [4]. This reduction not only lowered the liability for uncertain tax positions but also reversed accrued interest of $46 million, which was included in Other Income and Expenses (OI&E) [3]. The image showing the tax positions over the years [![The table provides financial data related to tax positions over the years 2018, 2019, and 2020](image4)] highlights this significant reduction, indicating a substantial resolution of prior tax uncertainties.\n\nAdditionally, the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets decreased by $1 million in 2020, which had no impact on net income but contributed to the overall increase in the net deferred tax asset [8]. The image detailing deferred tax assets and liabilities [![The table presents details about deferred tax assets and liabilities as of December 31 for the years 2020 and 2019](image2)] shows that while the total deferred tax assets before valuation allowance decreased slightly from $662 million in 2019 to $645 million in 2020, the valuation allowance itself decreased from $(180) million to $(179) million. This marginal decrease in the valuation allowance, combined with the reduction in deferred tax liabilities from $(363) million in 2019 to $(213) million in 2020, resulted in a larger net deferred tax asset.\n\nFurthermore, the effective tax rate decreased from 16.5% in 2018 to 7.0% in 2020, influenced by factors such as the U.S. tax benefit for foreign derived intangible income and the impact of changes in uncertain tax positions [![The table shows various tax-related items and their respective percentages for the years 202"}

In 2020, the total restructuring costs were $782 million, while in 2021 they were $330 million, and in 2022 they further reduced to $253 million [5]. This decline reflects the company's ongoing restructuring efforts and the impact of various factors such as cost containment and optimization activities [1][8].\n\nThe main components of these restructuring costs include separations, asset-related costs, and other costs. Separations primarily involve employee severance packages, which are voluntary and based on salary levels and past service periods [9]. Asset-related costs consist of asset write-downs and accelerated depreciation, mainly related to manufacturing consolidations and technology standardizations [9]. Other costs include asset removal and termination of contracts for supply chain and overhead optimization [9].\n\nIn 2020, the costs were heavily concentrated in the Corporate segment, with $223 million, followed by Baby, Feminine & Family Care at $192 million [image5]. By 2021, the Corporate segment still accounted for a significant portion with $190 million, but there was a noticeable reduction across most segments [image5].

In 2020, noncurrent assets increased by $3,039 million (adjusted for currency to $829 million), primarily driven by the growth in financing receivables and other assets [4]. This increase suggests a strategic expansion or retention of assets, which could support long-term revenue streams, as Global Financing leverages these assets alongside its own portfolio [3]. However, the increase in noncurrent assets was accompanied by a slight rise in long-term debt from $54,102 million in 2019 to $54,355 million in 2020, indicating that IBM financed these assets through debt, albeit marginally [image2].\n\nDespite the increase in noncurrent assets, Global Financing's debt decreased significantly from $24,727 million in 2019 to $21,167 million in 2020, a reduction of $3,560 million (adjusted for currency to $3,905 million), mainly due to lower funding requirements and a decline in financing assets [6]. This reduction aligns with IBM's portfolio management strategy, aiming to optimize asset levels and reduce debt exposure. The overall company debt also decreased by $1,361 million (adjusted for currency to $2,859 million), driven by early retirements and debt maturities, partially offset by new issuances [9][image4].\n\nThese changes in debt and assets influenced IBM's cash flows. Financing activities were a net use of cash of $9,721 million in 2020, contrasting sharply with a net source of $9,042 million in 2019. This shift was primarily due to decreased cash from non-operating finance receivables and increased cash used for marketable securities, reflecting a wind-down of certain operations and strategic financial adjustments [10][image3]. Additionally, total equity decreased by $258 million, largely due to dividends and foreign currency translation adjustments, though net income and common stock increases partially offset this decline [7].\n\nThe return on equity for Global Financing remained stable at 25.8% in both years, despite a decrease in after-tax income and average equity [image1].

For credit cards, outstandings decreased by $18.9 billion to $78.7 billion in 2020, primarily due to lower retail spending and higher payments [4]. This decline is also evident in the reduction of new credit card accounts, which dropped from 4,320,000 in 2019 to 2,505,000 in 2020, as shown in the financial data [![Credit card new accounts decreased](image2)]. Additionally, credit card purchase volumes fell by $26.3 billion to $251.6 billion, with travel and entertainment spending remaining lower compared to 2019 [6]. These trends suggest that consumers were more cautious with spending and possibly prioritized paying down existing debts during the pandemic.\n\nIn contrast, home equity production in Consumer Banking and the total Corporation decreased by $2.8 billion and $3.0 billion, respectively, driven by a decline in applications [5]. The outstanding balances in the home equity portfolio also decreased by $5.9 billion, primarily due to paydowns outpacing new originations and draws on existing lines [9]. This is corroborated by the financial data showing a reduction in home equity values under both Consumer Banking and Total categories from 2019 to 2020 [![Home equity values decreased](image4)]. These changes indicate that consumers might have been focusing on reducing their home equity debt, possibly due to economic uncertainty or a shift in financial priorities.\n\nOverall, the decrease in both credit card and home equity metrics suggests that consumers were more conservative in their financial behavior in 2020, likely influenced by the economic impacts of COVID-19, leading to reduced spending and increased debt repayment.\n\nThe total credit card and home equity metrics decreased between 2019 and 2020, indicating more conservative consumer behavior likely due to the economic effects of COVID-19."}

For nickel, the underlying EBITDA for Nickel West increased by US$296 million to US$259 million in FY2021, driven by higher prices and volumes, lower maintenance costs following major shutdowns, and reduced contractor costs from new mine transitions [1]. However, this growth was partially offset by unfavorable exchange rates and higher third-party concentrate purchase costs due to the stronger nickel price [1]. The average realized nickel price in FY2021 was US$16,250 per tonne, up from US$13,860 per tonne in FY2020, reflecting strong demand and supply disruptions [10]. A US¢1 per pound increase in the nickel price impacts both profit after taxation and underlying EBITDA by $1 million, highlighting the sensitivity of nickel operations to price fluctuations ![Nickel price impact](image1).\n\nIn the coal sector, underlying EBITDA decreased by US$1.3 billion to US$288 million in FY2021, primarily due to lower prices and volumes [2]. The decrease in coal prices, net of price-linked costs, amounted to US$0.7 billion, while lower volumes reduced EBITDA by US$168 million [2]. Increased maintenance costs at Queensland Coal, such as earthmoving equipment and shiploader maintenance, and higher stripping volumes further strained profitability, though cost reduction initiatives provided some offset [2]. The cost per tonne for Queensland Coal rose from $67.59 in FY2020 to $81.81 in FY2021, and for NSWEC from $56.53 to $64.41, reflecting higher operational costs ![Coal cost increases](image5). A US$1 per ton increase in the energy coal price impacts profit after taxation by $9 million and underlying EBITDA by $13 million, underscoring the direct financial sensitivity to coal price changes ![Coal price impact](image1).\n\nOverall, BHP's financial performance is heavily influenced by commodity price fluctuations, with nickel benefiting from higher prices and coal facing challenges from price declines and increased costs.

This decline was attributed to lower interest rates, reduced loan balances, elevated prepayments, and refinancing activity, as well as the sale of the student loan portfolio in the first half of 2021 [3]. Despite these challenges, the bank managed to generate interest income from PPP loans and loans purchased from GNMA loan securitization pools, which partially offset the negative impacts [3].\n\nConversely, noninterest income saw a substantial increase from $4,916 million in 2020 to $10,036 million in 2021, a change of $5,120 million, representing a 104% increase [1]. This surge was driven by higher net gains from equity securities, mortgage banking income, and investment advisory fees, as well as gains from the sale of the Corporate Trust Services business, student loan portfolio, and WFAM [7]. However, this growth was partially offset by lower lease income due to a $268 million impairment of rail cars used for coal transportation [5][7].\n\nThe contrasting changes in net interest income and noninterest income had a significant impact on total revenue. While net interest income plummeted, the substantial rise in noninterest income led to an overall increase in total revenue from $5,357 million in 2020 to $8,495 million in 2021, a change of $3,138 million or 59% [1].

According to the balance sheet data, total equity was $11,622 million in 2017 and dropped to $9,848 million in 2018, indicating a reduction of $1,774 million [2]. This decline in equity is largely attributed to the repurchase of common stock, which amounted to $4.9 billion in 2018, as part of the company's stock repurchase program [10]. Additionally, the payment of cash dividends totaling $3.193 billion in 2018 further impacted retained earnings [7].\n\nIn contrast, total liabilities increased from $26,365 million in 2017 to $26,652 million in 2018, marking a rise of $287 million [2]. The increase in liabilities is primarily due to the issuance of $2.25 billion in medium-term notes in the third quarter of 2018, which was partially offset by repayments and foreign currency effects [5]. Despite the increase in debt, the net impact on liabilities was less pronounced compared to the substantial decrease in equity.\n\nThe disparity between the decrease in equity and the increase in liabilities highlights the company's active use of cash for share repurchases and dividends, which reduced shareholder equity, while simultaneously managing debt levels through strategic issuances and repayments. This financial strategy reflects 3M's focus on returning value to shareholders while maintaining liquidity and managing debt obligations.\n\n![Total equity decreased by $1,774 million from 2017 to 2018](image2)  \n![Total liabilities increased by $287 million from 2017 to 2018](image2)\n\nThe trend in 3M Company's total equity decreased by $1,774 million from December 31, 2017, to December 31, 2018, while total liabilities increased by $287 million over the same period."}

Additionally, fixed income underwriting revenues also increased, driven by higher volumes in investment grade and non-investment grade bond issuances, although this was partially offset by lower event-driven investment grade loan activity [4]. The overall underwriting revenue for 2020 was $5,196 million, marking a 44% increase compared to 2019 [image4]. This growth is further supported by the data showing a 26% increase in total investment banking revenues, which includes underwriting activities, from 2019 to 2020 [image5]. The image data highlights that equity underwriting revenue specifically increased by 81% from 2019 to 2020, while fixed income underwriting revenue saw a 10% increase during the same period [image4].

This substantial growth is primarily driven by increases in brokerage sweep and savings deposits, as well as incremental deposits resulting from the acquisition of E*TRADE. The image data shows that savings and demand deposits, which include brokerage sweep deposits and savings and other deposits, grew from $149,465 million in 2019 to $279,221 million in 2020. Specifically, brokerage sweep deposits alone more than doubled, from $121,077 million in 2019 to $232,071 million in 2020, while savings and other deposits increased from $28,388 million to $47,150 million. Although time deposits decreased from $40,891 million to $31,561 million, the overall increase in savings and demand deposits was substantial enough to drive the total deposits upward. This aligns with the text stating that deposits are primarily sourced from Wealth Management clients and are considered stable, low-cost funding, with the E*TRADE acquisition contributing to the growth [6]. ![Total deposits increased from $190,356 million in 2019 to $310,782 million in 2020, driven by brokerage sweep and savings deposits](image1).\n\nThe key factors contributing to this change include the strategic acquisition of E*TRADE, which brought in additional deposits, and the inherent stability and low-cost nature of Wealth Management client deposits. The increase in brokerage sweep deposits reflects the company's ability to attract and retain client funds through its banking activities, further supported by the acquisition's impact on deposit growth. ![The increase in brokerage sweep deposits from $121,077 million in 2019 to $232,071 million in 2020 significantly contributed to the total deposit growth](image1).\n\nIn summary, total deposits increased from $190,356 million in 2019 to $310,782 million in 2020, primarily due to growth in brokerage sweep and savings deposits, including the impact of the E*TRADE acquisition."}

However, in 2020, Tesla achieved a net income of $862 million, marking a substantial turnaround and the first profitable year in this period. This trend highlights a strong recovery and growth in profitability over the three years.\n\nThe improvement in net income can be attributed to several factors. Firstly, the increase in total revenues from $21,461 million in 2018 to $31,536 million in 2020, as shown in image5, indicates robust growth in various revenue streams, particularly in automotive sales and regulatory credits. Additionally, the reduction in net operating assets and liabilities, as mentioned in [7], contributed to increased cash flow from operating activities, which rose from $2.40 billion in 2019 to $5.94 billion in 2020. Furthermore, the company's focus on operational efficiencies and cost management, as noted in [10], played a crucial role in enhancing profitability.\n\nThe comprehensive income attributable to common stockholders also reflects this trend, moving from a loss of $1,018 million in 2018 to a profit of $1,120 million in 2020, as detailed in image3.

Firstly, the decrease in income tax payments in 2021, primarily due to tax deductions from the senior notes exchange, reduced tax payments by $1.3 billion, which more than offset the higher taxable income from operations [1]. Additionally, the changes in operating assets and liabilities in 2021, compared to 2020, were influenced by the timing of amortization and related payments for film and television costs, including increased production spending, offset by an increased number of sporting events and impacts from the Tokyo Olympics broadcast.

According to the company's performance incentive structure, specific thresholds must be met for a portion of the incentives to become exercisable. For instance, if the EBIT growth is less than the specified threshold, no incentives are awarded, as shown in the table where \"Less than threshold\" results in \"Nil\" exercisable percentage [image4]. As the EBIT growth increases, the percentage of incentives that can be exercised also increases. At a 17.5% compound growth, 40% of the incentives are awarded, and this escalates to 60% at 20% growth, 80% at 22.5% growth, and finally, 100% at 25% growth [image4]. This tiered structure ensures that higher performance leads to greater rewards, aligning the incentives with the company's financial performance goals.\n\nAdditionally, the performance period for these incentives is clearly defined, such as the period commencing on 2 July 2018 and ending on 27 June 2021 for certain grants, with the exercise price set at the 30-day VWAP to the date of grant [10]. The expiry of the Performance Options is 12 months following the end of the performance period, ensuring that the incentives are contingent on sustained performance over time [3][6][10]. This structured approach incentivizes executives to focus on achieving significant EBIT growth to maximize their potential rewards.\n\nIn summary, EBIT growth significantly impacts the exercisable percentage of incentives, with higher growth rates leading to a greater portion of the incentives becoming available for exercise, as illustrated in the performance-based incentive structure [image4].\n\nThe exercisable percentage of incentives increases with higher EBIT growth rates, following a tiered structure where 40%, 60%, 80%, and 100% of incentives are awarded at 17.5%, 20%, 22.5%, and 25% growth, respectively. ![EBIT growth incentivizes higher exercisable percentages](image4)"}

In 2020, the company reported a net loss of $5,561 million, which reversed to a net income of $15,689 million in 2021 [5]. This substantial increase was primarily driven by higher upstream realizations, higher downstream margins, and the absence of impairments and write-offs that occurred in 2020. Specifically, U.S. upstream earnings rose from a loss of $1.6 billion in 2020 to $7.3 billion in 2021, largely due to higher realizations of $6.9 billion and higher asset sales gains of $640 million [9]. Similarly, international upstream earnings improved from a loss of $825 million in 2020 to $8.5 billion in 2021, driven by higher realizations of $7.6 billion and the absence of impairments and write-offs of $3.6 billion [6]. U.S. downstream earnings also shifted from a loss of $571 million in 2020 to a profit of $2.4 billion in 2021, attributed to higher margins on refined product sales and higher earnings from CPChem [8].\n\nComprehensive income, which includes net income and other comprehensive items like currency translation adjustments and unrealized gains/losses, also saw a marked improvement. In 2020, comprehensive income was negative, but it surged to $17,412 million in 2021 [4].

This indicates a slight decline in operating efficiency over the three-year period for this particular segment. However, when examining another segment, the operating profit margin increased from 19.0% in 2018 to 20.2% in 2019, and then slightly decreased to 19.4% in 2020 [image4].

This change is primarily driven by several key factors. Firstly, the profit of consolidated and affiliated companies saw a substantial increase from $3,003 million in 2020 to $6,493 million in 2021, as highlighted in the financial data [3]. This surge in profit was largely due to higher sales volume and favorable price realization, as well as the impact from changes in dealer inventories and higher end-user demand for equipment and services [1][5][10]. Additionally, the company benefited from mark-to-market gains for the remeasurement of pension and other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans in 2021, which contrasted with mark-to-market losses in 2020 [7]. These gains contributed to the overall improvement in comprehensive income.\n\nFurthermore, the company experienced foreign currency exchange net gains in 2021, compared to net losses in 2020, which positively influenced the comprehensive income [7]. The decrease in the effective tax rate from 27.8% in 2020 to 22.9% in 2021 also played a role, as it reduced the tax burden on profits [7]. However, these positive factors were partially offset by unfavorable manufacturing costs and higher SG&A/R&D expenses [2][10].\n\nThe table in image3 provides a detailed view of the components contributing to comprehensive income, showing a total other comprehensive loss of $665 million in 2021, compared to a gain of $679 million in 2020. This shift was mainly due to foreign currency translation losses of $598 million in 2021, contrasting with a gain of $577 million in 2020.

This disparity in entitlements suggests that more male employees are eligible for parental leave, which could be due to policies that extend parental leave benefits to both parents but may reflect traditional gender roles where men are more likely to be primary earners or have longer tenures. However, the number of employees who availed parental leave shows a different trend: 1,025 females and 2,023 males took the leave [image1].

This increase was primarily driven by a reduction in financing receivables due to sales of receivables, including sales of financing receivables of $3,076 million, and payroll tax and value-added tax payment deferrals and exemptions of approximately $600 million under the U.S. CARES Act [6]. However, this was partially offset by an increase in workforce rebalancing payments of $293 million and a net increase in cash payments for income taxes of $162 million [6].\n\nInvesting activities saw a substantial decrease in net cash used, reducing from $26,936 million in 2019 to $3,028 million in 2020 [4]. This significant change was largely due to a decrease in net cash used for acquisitions of $32,294 million, primarily because the Red Hat acquisition occurred in the prior year. This was partially offset by an increase in cash used for net purchases of marketable securities and other investments of $896 million and a decrease of $6,245 million in cash provided by net non-operating finance receivables, driven by the wind down of OEM IT commercial financing operations [2][3].\n\nFinancing activities, on the other hand, shifted from a net source of cash of $9,042 million in 2019 to a net use of cash of $9,721 million in 2020 [1][4]. This year-to-year change of $18,763 million was primarily driven by early retirements and debt maturities of $11,267 million, which decreased total debt by $1,361 million (adjusted for currency) from December 31, 2019. This was partially offset by issuances of $8,982 million [4].

Net earnings increased from $12,382 million in 2018 to $15,769 million in 2020, reflecting a steady upward trend [image3]. This growth can be attributed to several factors. First, the company's total revenues rose from $226,247 million in 2018 to $257,141 million in 2020, driven by increases in premiums, products, and services [image2]. Premium revenues, a major component, grew from $178,087 million in 2018 to $201,478 million in 2020, indicating strong performance in health insurance arrangements [image2]. Additionally, the company's ability to manage medical costs, which increased from $145,403 million in 2018 to $159,396 million in 2020, suggests effective cost control measures [image2].\n\nComprehensive income, which includes net earnings and other comprehensive (loss) income, also increased from $10,865 million in 2018 to $15,533 million in 2020 [image3]. This growth was influenced by fluctuations in other comprehensive (loss) income, particularly the impact of foreign currency translation losses and unrealized gains on investment securities. While foreign currency translation losses were significant in 2018 and 2020, the net unrealized gains on investment securities provided a positive contribution in 2019 and 2020 [image3].

However, there was a substantial recovery in 2021, with net income rising to $5,727 million. This increase in 2021 is attributed to the recovery of business operations from the COVID-19 impact, as evidenced by the strong consumer demand and improved financial performance [4].

Firstly, the adoption of the Current Expected Credit Loss (CECL) methodology on January 1, 2020, led to an initial increase in the allowance by $131 million, primarily due to a $124 million increase related to employee loans [5]. Additionally, the provision for credit losses in 2020 was $762 million, reflecting the economic impact of COVID-19, particularly within the Institutional Securities business segment [8]. This provision was driven by actual and forecasted changes in asset quality trends and uncertainties in sectors affected by the pandemic.

According to the text, the net price impact contributed $16,095 million to Underlying EBITDA in 2021, reflecting increased sales prices for iron ore, copper, and nickel, among others [5]. This was a substantial factor in the overall increase in Underlying EBITDA from $22,071 million in 2020 to $37,379 million in 2021 [image5]. \n\nHowever, changes in volumes had a mixed effect. While record volumes at WAIO and the highest annual production at Olympic Dam since 2005 were achieved, these were partially offset by expected grade declines at Escondida and Spence, natural field declines in Petroleum, and adverse weather events [6]. The net impact of volume changes was a decrease of $312 million, as detailed in the financial breakdown [image5]. \n\nThe image data further illustrates this dynamic. The bar charts show a steady increase in Underlying EBITDA from $19.4 billion in FY2017 to $37.4 billion in FY2021, highlighting the overall positive trend [image3]. The table in image4 also confirms the substantial rise in Underlying EBITDA from $22,071 million in 2020 to $37,379 million in 2021, aligning with the text’s emphasis on price-driven growth [image4]. \n\nIn summary, the increase in sales prices had a dominant positive effect on Underlying EBITDA, while volume changes introduced some offsets, resulting in a net positive impact overall.\n\nChanges in sales prices significantly boosted Underlying EBITDA, while volume changes introduced partial offsets. ![The bar charts show a steady increase in Underlying EBITDA from FY2017 to FY2021](image3) ![The table confirms the rise in Underlying EBITDA from $22,071 million in 2020 to $37,379 million in 2021](image4)"}

The highest price was recorded in July 2002 at Rs. 420.00, while the lowest was in March 2003 at Rs. 286.00. This indicates a volatile market for GPI, with notable peaks and troughs. In contrast, the BSE Sensex, represented by a normalized index, showed a more stable performance, fluctuating between 98 and 84 over the same period [5].

By 2014, the R&D tax credit increased to $(18,655) thousand, further reducing the tax provision. This increase was partly due to the retroactive reinstatement of the 2014 Federal R&D credit and the California R&D credit, as mentioned in the text [4]. The Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015, signed into law on December 18, 2015, retroactively and permanently extended the Federal R&D credit from January 1, 2015, leading to a significant increase in the R&D tax credit to $(29,363) thousand in 2015 [6][9].

This decline can be attributed to several factors. First, there was a significant decrease in core merchandise categories, particularly in fresh foods and foods and sundries, which contributed to a 33 basis-point reduction in gross margin [5]. Additionally, the LIFO charge for higher merchandise costs negatively impacted gross margin by 19 basis points [5]. The increase in gasoline prices, while boosting net sales by $9,230 and 481 basis points, also generally lowered the gross margin percentage due to the lower margins associated with gasoline sales [2][7]. Furthermore, the impact of inflation on merchandise costs in 2022, combined with strategic pricing decisions to maintain competitive pricing, further pressured gross margins [3]. The ceasing of incremental COVID-19 wages provided a slight positive impact, but this was offset by other factors such as increased rewards and foreign currency fluctuations [1][5].

This change can be attributed to several key factors outlined in the financial activities and debt issuance details provided.\n\nFirstly, the company issued new long-term debt in both years, contributing to the overall increase. In 2020, the company issued three separate tranches of fixed-rate, long-term debt: $750 million due in 2025 [7], $750 million due in 2030 [9], and another $750 million due in 2039 [1]. These issuances provided net proceeds of $749 million, $749 million, and $743 million respectively, after accounting for issuance discounts and costs. In 2019, two tranches were issued: $750 million due in 2029 [8] and another $750 million due in 2039 [1], with net proceeds of $748 million and $743 million. The issuance in 2020 slightly exceeded that of 2019, adding to the debt levels.\n\nAdditionally, the company retired maturing debt in both years. In 2020, $500 million of maturing debt was retired [3], while in 2019, a larger amount of $750 million was retired [3]. The lower retirement of debt in 2020 compared to 2019 allowed for a net increase in long-term debt.\n\nThe table in image5 further confirms these figures, showing the total long-term debt increasing from $5,303 million in 2019 to $6,248 million in 2020. The net unamortized discounts, premiums, and issuance costs also played a role, with a net impact of ($52) million in 2020 compared to ($47) million in 2019, slightly reducing the total debt but not offsetting the overall increase.\n\nIn summary, the issuance of new debt and the reduced retirement of maturing debt in 2020 were the primary factors contributing to the increase in long-term debt from 2019 to 2020.\n\n!["}

For the United States, the funded status improved from a deficit of $1,674 million in 2017 to $1,145 million in 2018, indicating a reduction in the underfunded position by $529 million. This improvement is attributed to a significant increase in the discount rate from 3.68% to 4.36%, which decreased the projected benefit obligation (PBO) [9]. Additionally, a $200 million contribution to the plan further enhanced the funded status [9].\n\nFor the International segment, the funded status slightly worsened from a deficit of $765 million in 2017 to $795 million in 2018, showing a marginal increase in the underfunded position by $30 million.

Non-current assets increased from DKK 63,156 million in 2019 to DKK 79,113 million in 2020, primarily driven by a substantial rise in intangible assets from DKK 5,835 million to DKK 20,657 million [5]. This increase reflects significant investments in patents and licenses related to research and development projects, which are crucial for the company's long-term growth and innovation strategy. The substantial growth in intangible assets indicates a strategic focus on enhancing intellectual property and future cash flows from marketable products, as highlighted by the management's projections and impairment tests based on anticipated net present value [5].\n\n![The table shows a significant increase in intangible assets from 2019 to 2020](image5)\n\nConcurrently, total equity also saw a notable rise from DKK 57,593 million in 2019 to DKK 63,325 million in 2020 [3]. This increase in equity was largely due to higher retained earnings, which grew from DKK 57,817 million in 2019 to DKK 63,774 million in 2020, reflecting the company's profitability and ability to retain profits rather than distribute them as dividends [3]. The equity statement further illustrates that net profit and other comprehensive income contributed positively to the equity growth, while transactions with owners, such as dividends and treasury share purchases, were managed to maintain a balanced capital structure [1].\n\n![The equity statement highlights the growth in retained earnings and total equity from 2019 to 2020](image1)\n\nThese changes collectively strengthened the company's financial position by enhancing its asset base and equity, providing a solid foundation for future operations and investments.

Retained earnings decreased from $11,881 million in 2020 to $11,495 million in 2021, reflecting a reduction of $386 million [4]. This decline is primarily attributed to the net income of $8,060 million in 2021, which, while substantial, was offset by significant dividends and share repurchases, as indicated in the equity section summary [5]. The repurchase of common shares and cash dividends paid during the year reduced retained earnings, aligning with the company's capital allocation strategy.\n\nAccumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) also saw a decrease, moving from a loss of $2,895 million in 2020 to a loss of $2,945 million in 2021 [4]. This slight increase in loss was driven by foreign currency translation adjustments, which worsened by $163 million in 2021 compared to a $40 million loss in 2020, as shown in the comprehensive income summary [2]. The foreign currency translation adjustments are a result of translating monetary assets and liabilities at the end-of-period exchange rates, with non-monetary items at historical rates, affecting AOCI [1]. Additionally, net unrealized losses on debt securities and pension benefits contributed to the overall comprehensive loss, impacting AOCI negatively.\n\nDespite these reductions, total shareholders' equity remained relatively stable, decreasing from $22,984 million in 2020 to $22,177 million in 2021 [4]. This stability is partly due to the company's ability to generate net income and manage its equity components effectively, even as it faced headwinds from foreign currency fluctuations and unrealized losses. The comprehensive income for 2021 was $8,010 million, reflecting the net income adjusted for comprehensive losses, which underscores the company's overall financial resilience [2].\n\nIn summary, the changes in shareholders' equity between 2020 and 2021 indicate a strategic allocation of profits toward dividends and share repurchases, impacting retained earnings, while foreign currency and market-related adjustments affected AOCI.

In 2022, total deferred tax assets decreased from $4,564 million to $4,091 million, a reduction of $473 million [3]. This decline is primarily due to decreases in \"Loss and other carryforwards\" from $1,030 million to $914 million and \"Pension and other retiree benefits\" from $1,476 million to $740 million, indicating potential changes in the company's financial strategies or tax environment [image3].

This increase is largely driven by a significant jump in \"Goodwill and intangible assets\" from $5,761 million to $5,783 million and \"Unrealized gain on financial and foreign exchange transactions\" from $111 million to $439 million, reflecting higher future tax obligations due to changes in asset valuations and foreign exchange impacts [image5]. The rise in liabilities suggests the company anticipates higher taxable income or changes in tax laws affecting its intangible assets and foreign operations.\n\nThese changes collectively result in a net increase in deferred tax liabilities, which could lead to higher future tax expenses. The reduction in deferred tax assets may also indicate a lower expected benefit from tax carryforwards and pension-related tax positions.

This means that for each of the first three full years, the vesting of RSUs is subject to the achievement of these performance measures, which are evaluated annually.

Initially, in 1998, the majority of investments were in the Seed stage, accounting for 78% of the total, with only 18% in Early Stage and 4% in Mid-Stage [image1]. This reflects a focus on early-stage ventures, likely due to the nascent state of the European venture capital market at the time [1].

By early 2014, Indonesia had 240 million mobile subscribers, showing continuous growth throughout the year [3]. This growth is reflected in the subscriber numbers for the three major telecom operators: Telkomsel, XL, and Indosat. \n\nIn late 2014, Telkomsel had the highest number of subscribers at 139.3 million, followed by XL with 58.3 million, and Indosat with 54.2 million [4]. This indicates that Telkomsel maintained its lead in the market, likely due to its strong brand presence and extensive network coverage. The data user numbers also highlight Telkomsel's dominance, with 63.5 million data users, significantly higher than XL's 32 million and Indosat's 29 million [4]. This suggests that Telkomsel was more successful in attracting users to its data services, possibly due to better infrastructure or more appealing data packages.\n\nThe decline in ARPU (Average Revenue Per User) for prepaid services in Indonesia from 2008 to 2012, as shown in the line graph ![Exhibit 1: Indonesia Prepaid ARPU (Rp'000)](image1), indicates a general trend of reduced revenue per user. However, the increase in data users for all three operators suggests a shift towards data-centric services.

Textually, it is noted that Germans tend to view these organizations more positively than Americans. Specifically, about seven-in-ten Germans favor the EU, while only about half of Americans agree [5]. This divide is visually supported by image1, which shows that Germany's approval rating for the EU is 69%, compared to 51% in the U.S., marking an 18% difference. Similarly, for NATO, Germany's approval is 57%, slightly higher than the U.S. at 52%, with a 5% difference [![Germany has higher approval of the EU and NATO compared to the U.S.](image1)].\n\nFurther, the ideological divide within both countries is also evident. In the U.S., liberals are more likely to favor the UN and EU than conservatives, with a notable gap in approval ratings. For instance, 80% of American liberals view the UN favorably, compared to 38% of conservatives, a difference of +42 [![American liberals have a significantly higher approval of the UN compared to conservatives](image5)]. In Germany, the divide is narrower, with a +10 difference between the left and right on the UN [![German left and right have a smaller ideological divide on the UN compared to the U.S.](image5)]. This suggests that while both countries show ideological splits, the gap is wider in the U.S.\n\nAdditionally, the preference for close ties with Russia versus the U.S. among Germans varies by region, with East Germans showing more support for Russia and less for the EU compared to West Germans [7][![East Germans prefer Russia more and the EU less than West Germans](image3)].

This route, also known as the Old Fort Kearney Road or the Pike’s Peak Trail, became popular and facilitated early settlement and trade [10]. \n\nIn the late 19th century, the arrival of the railroad further transformed the county. The first railroad line reached Hamilton County in 1879, extending from York to Aurora and later to Grand Island in 1884. By 1890, a total of 66-1/3 miles of railroad lines were operational, connecting Aurora to major cities like Omaha and Lincoln, which boosted agricultural markets for livestock, dairy, and poultry products [2][6]. \n\nMajor automobile routes also serve Hamilton County.

Among Republicans and Democrats, there is a slight variation, with Democrats showing a stronger preference for human rights (78%) compared to Republicans (70%), but both groups still prioritize human rights over economic relations [![Among Republicans/leaning Republicans, 26% prioritize economic relations, with 70% promoting human rights. Among Democrats/leaning Democrats, 20% prioritize economic relations, while 78% focus on human rights](image3)]. This indicates a general consensus across age and political lines, though younger individuals and Democrats are slightly more emphatic in their support for human rights.\n\nIn summary, younger age groups and Democrats are more likely to prioritize human rights over economic relations with China, but a significant majority across all demographics supports this stance."}

Among self-identified Hispanics, the majority are third or higher generation, accounting for 65%, while 29% are second generation, and only 18% are foreign born [4]. This suggests that as generations progress, the connection to Hispanic heritage diminishes, with fewer individuals identifying strongly with their ancestral origins. For instance, 82% of immigrants who identify as Hispanics feel connected to their country of origin, but this drops to 44% by the third generation [4]. Similarly, the image shows that among self-identified Hispanics, 50% prefer to identify by their country of origin/heritage, while 23% prefer \"Hispanic/Latino\" and another 23% prefer \"American\" [image3]. This indicates a shift toward broader or more assimilated identities over time.\n\nIn contrast, non-Hispanics with Hispanic ancestry overwhelmingly belong to the third or higher generation, with 96% falling into this category [image4]. This aligns with the text noting that 59% of self-identified non-Hispanics are seen as white, reflecting a fading Hispanic identity across generations [2]. The image also reveals that among self-identified Hispanics, the ability to speak Spanish and having a Spanish last name decreases significantly with each generation. For example, 41% of foreign-born Hispanics speak Spanish, but only 7% of third or higher generation Hispanics do [image5]. This linguistic and cultural erosion further underscores the generational shift away from Hispanic heritage.\n\nThe data from the images and text collectively illustrate that as generations progress, self-identified Hispanics increasingly adopt broader American identities, while non-Hispanics with Hispanic ancestry predominantly identify with the third or higher generation, often aligning with non-Hispanic societal perceptions [image4]. This generational shift is also reflected in social networks and marriage patterns, where third-generation Hispanics are less likely to live in Latino neighborhoods (30%) or marry Hispanic spouses (35%) compared to earlier generations [9][6].\n\nIn summary, the generational breakdown reveals that heritage identification among self-identified Hispanics weakens over time, with a growing preference for broader American identities, while non-Hispanics with Hispanic ancestry predominantly identify with the third or higher generation, often seen as white [image4][2]. ![The generational breakdown shows a decline in Hispanic identity among self-identified"}

This trend is mirrored among leaners: Republican leaners' unfavorable views of the Democratic Party have increased from 64% to 81%, and Democratic leaners' unfavorable views of the Republican Party have surged from 48% to 84% [2]. \n\n![Unfavorable views of both parties have increased over time](image4) illustrates this trend, showing a steady rise in unfavorable opinions of the opposing party among partisans and leaners. The graph highlights that both Republicans and Democrats, along with their leaners, have seen a sharp increase in negative perceptions of the other party, reflecting growing polarization.\n\nAmong independents, the trend is more nuanced. While the share of independents with unfavorable views of both parties has declined in recent years, reaching 28% in 2018 from a peak of 36% in 2015 [10], the overall increase from 24% in 1994 to 56% in 2018 is notable [4].

This indicates that \"Uptown Funk!\" had a stronger presence in streaming platforms, reflecting its widespread popularity [1].\n\nFurther analysis of the rankings reveals that \"Uptown Funk!\" also dominated in audio streams, video streams, song sales, and radio audience, all ranking #1 in these categories. In contrast, \"Trap Queen\" ranked #3 in audio streams and #2 in video streams, but it did not rank in song sales or radio audience, marked as \"NR\" [![Top On-Demand Songs YTD](image1)]. This suggests that while \"Trap Queen\" was highly popular in streaming and video platforms, it did not achieve the same level of commercial success in sales or radio play as \"Uptown Funk!\".\n\nThe performance of \"Uptown Funk!\" aligns with the trend that R&B/Hip-Hop leads in streaming, as mentioned in the text [4], and its artists are seen as trendsetters in the music industry [5]. The song's success across multiple platforms highlights its influence and appeal, which is further supported by the TrendSetter Index graph showing that top streamed songs significantly outperform the music industry mean [![TrendSetter Index](image3)]. This underscores the strong correlation between streaming success and overall industry impact [1].\n\nIn comparison, \"Trap Queen\" also performed well in streaming but did not achieve the same cross-platform dominance. Its absence in song sales and radio rankings indicates a more niche appeal, possibly reflecting the genre's focus on digital consumption rather than traditional sales or radio airplay. This aligns with the observation that hip-hop fans are at the forefront of the digital music movement, prioritizing streaming over other forms of consumption [2].\n\nOverall, \"Uptown Funk!\" outperformed \"Trap Queen\" across most media platforms in 2015, solidifying its status as a trendsetting hit, while \"Trap Queen\" demonstrated strong streaming success"}

Additionally, confidence in Trump's ability to make good decisions about economic policy has ticked up since January [7], but there is still a significant portion of the public that lacks confidence in this area.\n\nThe image quotes provide visual data that can help clarify these points. Image4 shows a bar chart evaluating different tasks, including negotiating favorable trade agreements, making good decisions about economic policy, using military force wisely, making good appointments to the federal courts, managing the executive branch effectively, making wise decisions about immigration policy, handling an international crisis, and working effectively with Congress. The chart breaks down the effectiveness into \"Not at all,\" \"Not too,\" \"Somewhat,\" and \"Very\" effectively. \n\nLooking at the percentages for each task in image4, we can see that the task with the lowest percentage of respondents feeling it is done \"Very\" effectively is \"Make wise decisions about immigration policy.\" This aligns with the text data indicating that 54% of the public has little or no confidence in Trump's handling of immigration policy [5].\n\nFurthermore, image5 shows line graphs illustrating public opinion over time about performance in different areas. The graph for making wise decisions about immigration policy starts at 40% in August 2017, dips to 38%, and rises to 43% by May 2018, indicating ongoing low confidence in this area.\n\nCombining these insights, it is clear that the task with the least confidence in Trump handling very effectively is making wise decisions about immigration policy.\n\n![The task with the least confidence in Trump handling very effectively is making wise decisions about immigration policy](image4) ![Public confidence in Trump's immigration policy decisions remains low over time](image5)\n\nIn conclusion, people have the least confidence in Trump handling immigration policy very effectively."}

Initially, the population surged dramatically, reaching its peak in 1890 with 14,096 residents, as shown in the census data ![Population growth from 1870 to 1890](image3). This rapid increase was largely due to the Homestead Act of 1862, which attracted settlers by offering 160 acres of land to those who built a permanent structure and resided there for five years [9]. The Union Pacific Railroad, completed in the mid-1800s, also played a crucial role by transforming Nebraska into a booming agricultural state, drawing pioneers from various regions [9].\n\nHowever, after 1890, the population began a slow decline, with fluctuations over the decades. By 1940, the population had dropped to 9,982, and it continued to decrease until the 1970s, when it stabilized and slightly increased again by 2000, reaching 9,403 [3]. This decline can be attributed to several factors. The consolidation of farms, as evidenced by the reduction in the number of farms from over 2,000 in 1900 to 603 by 2002, led to fewer opportunities for small-scale farming [4]. Mechanization increased the average farm size, making it difficult for small farmers to sustain their operations, which contributed to rural depopulation [4].\n\nAdditionally, the consolidation of rural school districts, which once numbered over 100 in the early 1920s, further reflects the shrinking rural population [6].

For higher-resource languages, such as Portuguese (PT) and Russian (RU), pre-training consistently yields gains of approximately 3 BLEU points [1]. However, for extremely low-resource languages, the effects are more varied. For instance, Galician (GL) to English (EN) sees a substantial gain of up to 11 BLEU points, indicating that pre-trained embeddings are particularly beneficial when the baseline system is moderately effective but not too poor [1]. This aligns with the observation that pre-training is most effective when there is enough data to capture basic language characteristics, allowing the model to leverage additional information from embeddings [4].\n\nThe qualitative analysis of GL→EN translations highlights that pre-training aids in capturing rarer vocabulary and generating more grammatically well-formed sentences. For example, it successfully translates less frequent terms like “big lawyer” and “patent legislation,” demonstrating the utility of pre-trained embeddings in representing infrequent concepts [2]. This is further supported by the data showing that pre-training improves translation accuracy, especially for low-frequency words [8].\n\nWhen examining the relationship between training set size and BLEU scores, pre-training offers more significant gains with smaller datasets. The graphs illustrate that the improvement from pre-training diminishes as the training set size increases, suggesting its effectiveness is more pronounced in data-scarce scenarios [image2]. This trend is consistent with the hypothesis that pre-training is most impactful when the baseline system has room for improvement, as seen in languages with lower initial BLEU scores [4].\n\nIn multilingual systems, aligning word embeddings across similar languages enhances performance. For example, GL/PT, which shares a high similarity, shows the largest gains, while BE/RU, with lower similarity, sees minimal improvement or even a slight decrease [10]. The table comparing aligned and unaligned scores underscores this, with GL→EN experiencing a slight decrease when unaligned, but RU→EN showing a small improvement when aligned [image1]. This indicates that alignment helps maintain performance by ensuring embeddings reside in similar vector spaces, facilitating shared learning [10].\n\nAdditionally, the table comparing different processing conditions reveals that pre-training the source language embeddings generally leads to more significant BLEU score increases, emphasizing the importance of encoding the source sentence effectively [6].

For MAVEN-ERE, the inclusion of logical constraints consistently results in higher Micro-F1 scores compared to configurations without them, even with fewer demonstration samples. This aligns with the finding that logical constraints provide stable improvements, especially when combined with a smaller number of demonstrations [10]. For instance, using 5 demonstrations with logical constraints can surpass the performance of 10 demonstrations without them, highlighting the importance of balancing demonstrations and logical guidance [3].\n\nIn contrast, the CTB dataset shows a similar pattern, where logical constraints enhance performance, but the gains are less dramatic compared to MAVEN-ERE. This may reflect the varying complexity and nature of the tasks within each dataset. The right graph in image4 further supports this by showing that iterative retrieval reduces logical inconsistency without significantly altering the Micro-F1, suggesting that while logical constraints improve consistency, they do not always translate to proportional gains in precision and recall balance [2].\n\nOverall, the data from image4 and the text [4][10] indicate that logical constraints are crucial for maximizing the effectiveness of demonstration samples, particularly in complex reasoning tasks like those in MAVEN-ERE. However, the optimal number of demonstrations is context-dependent, and excessive demonstrations without logical guidance may not yield proportional improvements.\n\n![The number of demonstration samples affects Micro-F1 performance, with logical constraints enhancing results more effectively with fewer samples](image4)\n\nThe number of demonstration samples positively affects Micro-F1 performance, but the gains plateau after a certain point, and logical constraints amplify this effect more significantly with fewer samples."}

This indicates that while the step-back question helps retrieve relevant information, the model often struggles with the final reasoning step to derive the correct answer. \n\n![Reasoning and RAG errors are the main issues](image3) highlights that Reasoning Error and RAG have significantly higher values compared to other error types like Scoring Error and StepBack.

The image further supports this by showing Reasoning Error as the most frequent class, underscoring its critical role in the error profile.\n\nAdditionally, the text notes that StepBack itself rarely fails, with only a small fraction of errors attributed to it [2].

This feedback can be in natural language or scalar values, guiding the 'Refine Model' to improve the output through strategies like self-training or post-hoc revision [10]. The external feedback mechanism ensures that the refinement process is more transparent and explainable, as it does not require updating the LLM's parameters and allows for iterative improvements [5]. \n\n![The image depicts a conceptual framework where the Critic Model provides feedback from external tools to refine the language model's output](image2) \n\nFurthermore, the table in image4 highlights that methods under 'Post-hoc Correction with External Feedback' often involve natural language feedback and can be applied to multiple tasks, emphasizing the flexibility and effectiveness of this strategy. By integrating external knowledge and tools, the approach addresses the limitations of self-correction, which may demand powerful LLMs and can be inefficient with smaller models [8]. Overall, this strategy enhances the quality and reliability of outputs by utilizing diverse and informative feedback sources.\n\n![The table lists methods for post-hoc correction, showing that external feedback is used for refinement in various applications](image4) \n\nThe 'Post-hoc Correction with External Feedback' strategy enhances the refinement of outputs by incorporating external feedback to improve accuracy and address model flaws without altering the model's parameters."}

According to the text, the filter-then-rerank paradigm uses SLMs to select the top-N candidate labels, which are then reranked by LLMs using MCQ prompts [5]. The templates for converting these candidate labels into question options are specifically listed for different datasets, such as TACREV, FewNERD, and ACE05 [4]. \n\nFor the 'Contact.Meet' event, the template would follow a structure similar to those shown in the examples provided for other events. The template would likely involve identifying the trigger word that signifies a meeting event and framing it as a question option. For instance, if the trigger word is \"{evt}\", the template might be structured to ask whether the event involves a meeting between entities, similar to how other events are framed in the examples [image4]. \n\nIn the context of the filter-then-rerank method, the prompt would include an instruction, a demonstration with examples, and a test sentence formatted as an MCQ.

The Tree Traversal method, as described in [2] and [7], involves a layer-by-layer approach where the algorithm starts at the root of the tree and progressively selects the most relevant nodes at each level based on their cosine similarity to the query vector. This process continues until the leaf nodes are reached, and the text from all selected nodes is concatenated to form the retrieved context. This method allows for control over the specificity and breadth of the information by adjusting the depth \\(d\\) and the number of nodes \\(k\\) selected at each layer, as mentioned in [9]. The traversal method focuses on higher-order thematic information initially and then narrows down to granular details, maintaining a constant ratio of thematic to detailed information regardless of the question, as highlighted in [1].\n\nIn contrast, the Collapsed Tree Retrieval method, as outlined in [3] and depicted in ![The image illustrates two mechanisms for retrieving information using tree structures: Tree Traversal Retrieval and Collapsed Tree Retrieval](image2), offers a more flexible approach by evaluating nodes collectively across all layers. Instead of traversing the tree layer-by-layer, this method flattens the multi-layered tree into a single layer, bringing all nodes onto the same level for comparison. Nodes are retrieved based on cosine similarity until a threshold number of tokens is reached, allowing the system to retrieve information at the correct level of granularity for a given question. This flexibility is believed to be the reason for its superior performance compared to tree traversal, as it can adapt to the specific requirements of each query by searching through all nodes simultaneously, as discussed in [1].\n\nThe differences in these approaches are further illustrated in ![The image is an illustration of the querying process by RAPTOR, a system for retrieving information](image4), where RAPTOR's ability to select nodes from different tree layers is shown to yield more relevant and comprehensive information for downstream tasks compared to Dense Passage Retrieval (DPR).

This suggests that DAE may capture style distinctions more sharply. However, in the content space, both models show overlapping clusters, indicating that content information is not well-separated, aligning with the observation that the content vector is not particularly discriminative for style [1]. \n\nThe VAE's latent space is described as smoother and more continuous than DAE's [9], which is reflected in the less distinct clustering in the style space for VAE.

The performance metrics in ![The table compares DAE and VAE on style and content spaces, showing higher style accuracy for both](image2) further support this, as both models achieve high style accuracy when utilizing the style space, but content space alone shows minimal improvement over the majority guess, reinforcing the disentanglement effectiveness where style space captures style information effectively [1].\n\nIn summary, while both DAE and VAE disentangle style and content, DAE tends to create more distinct style clusters, whereas VAE offers a smoother latent space, affecting how style and content are visually represented.\n\nThe DAE and VAE models differ in their visualization of style and content spaces by creating more distinct style clusters in DAE and a smoother, less distinct separation in VAE."}

The table shows that the baseline RNN model has an average score of 77.43. When using synonym-based augmentation, the average score slightly decreases to 77.40. However, when contextual augmentation is applied, the average score increases to 77.62. The most significant improvement is observed when the label-conditional architecture is added, resulting in an average score of 77.83. \n\nThis progression highlights the effectiveness of contextual augmentation and the label-conditional architecture in enhancing model performance. The image1 visually supports this by demonstrating how contextual augmentation generates varied and contextually appropriate substitutions, such as replacing \"actors\" with \"performances,\" \"films,\" \"movies,\" and \"stories,\" while maintaining the positive sentiment. This method allows for a broader range of word replacements compared to synonym-based augmentation, which is limited to words with similar meanings. \n\nFurthermore, image2 provides a qualitative insight into how the label-conditional architecture influences word predictions. For the sentence \"the actors are fantastic,\" the model predicts different words based on the sentiment label. With a positive label, words like \"funny\" are suggested, whereas with a negative label, words like \"bland\" are predicted. This adaptability ensures that the augmented sentences remain compatible with their original labels, thereby improving the model's ability to generalize.\n\nIn summary, the average accuracy for the RNN architecture improves from 77.40 (with synonym) to 77.83 (with context and label), indicating a notable enhancement due to the proposed contextual augmentation and label-conditional architecture.\n\nThe average accuracy improved by 0.43 when using the model with context and label compared to the model with synonym for the RNN architecture. ![The table shows performance metrics for RNN models with different configurations](image3)"}

Initially, the process begins with **Step 1: System Message + Visual Annotation**, where a system message is set to define the desired tone and style, and visual annotations provide essential image information such as bounding boxes and descriptions [6]. This foundational step ensures that the language model (ChatGPT) has clear guidelines and context for generating relevant pairs.\n\nFollowing this, the **Cold Start** phase is crucial. During this stage, the system identifies the best system message and in-context examples by prompting ChatGPT solely through system messages and visual annotations, employing a heuristic approach. This step is vital for enhancing the quality of in-context examples before scaling up the data collection process [6]. The cold-start strategy ensures that the initial examples are satisfactory, setting a strong foundation for subsequent steps.\n\n**Step 2: Generate Instruction-Response Pairs** involves utilizing ChatGPT to create these pairs based on the visual content and the established context. This step leverages the capabilities of large language models to produce diverse and creative instruction-response pairs, aligning with the distribution of real-world visual content [9]. The use of in-context examples and system messages guides ChatGPT in generating high-quality pairs that target perception, reasoning, and planning capabilities [2].\n\nAfter generating the pairs, **Step 3: Filtering** is applied to ensure quality. ChatGPT is again employed to filter the pairs, refining the dataset to maintain high standards and relevance [image1]. This filtering process is essential for maintaining the dataset's integrity and effectiveness in training vision-language models.\n\nFinally, **Step 4: Translation** expands the instruction-response pairs into eight languages, including Chinese, Japanese, Spanish, French, German, Korean, and Arabic [6]. This step supports multi-lingual usage, enhancing the dataset's accessibility and applicability across different linguistic contexts.\n\nThe Sythus process emphasizes iterative refinement and the use of in-context examples to improve the quality and diversity of instruction-response pairs, ultimately supporting the training of robust vision-language models like Otter [9].\n\n![The Sythus process involves system messages, visual annotations, cold-start strategy, generation, filtering, and translation to create multi-lingual instruction-response pairs](image1)"}

The goal is to optimize the embedding space such that the \"better\" hypothesis is closer to the source and reference in the embedding space, while the \"worse\" hypothesis is farther away, using the triplet margin loss [7].

However, the addition of relation propagation in \"DyGIE-RelProp\" aims to mitigate this decline, though it is not as effective as the original \"DyGIE\" model without relation propagation. This suggests that while relation propagation helps in managing the complexity introduced by multiple entities, it does not fully compensate for the inherent challenges of extracting relations in sentences with a higher entity count [4].\n\n![Relation extraction performance decreases with more entities, but relation propagation helps mitigate this decline](image2)\n\nFurthermore, the text indicates that relation propagation significantly benefits both entity and relation extraction tasks, especially in scenarios with multiple relation instances across different entities [1]. This aligns with the observation that sentences containing more entities often have complex relational structures, where relation propagation can provide useful context by capturing different relation types through a relation graph [7]. Despite the performance drop with increased entities, relation propagation remains beneficial by enhancing the model's ability to handle such complexity, albeit not as effectively as the base model without propagation [1].\n\nIn summary, while relation extraction performance generally decreases with more entities in a sentence, relation propagation offers a partial solution by leveraging broader context, though its effectiveness is limited compared to models without propagation.

When repetition control is introduced, it reduces the model's ability to produce questions at higher control levels. For instance, without repetition control, increasing the control variable \\( z \\) from 0 to 10 allows the model to achieve a question-asking rate of up to 97.72% [3]. However, with repetition control, the same \\( z = 10 \\) setting results in only a 79.67% question-asking rate due to the weighted decoding feature extrep bigram, which discourages bigrams that have appeared in previous utterances, such as \"do you\" and \"what is\" [3]. This feature prevents the model from generating necessary question-asking bigrams, thereby limiting the frequency of questions. To mitigate this, an extra setting \\( z = 10 (boost) \\) is introduced, which allows the model to produce a 99.54% question-asking rate by not using the extrep bigram feature during beam search but still using it for reranking candidates [3].

According to [1], the standard LLaMa architecture exhibited complex divergences due to slow norm growth, especially in the mid-to-late stages of training. This issue was linked to the softmax operation, which can cause problems when training with multiple modalities of varying entropy. The text also mentions that monitoring uncontrolled growth of output norms is strongly correlated with predicting future loss divergence [1]. \n\nIn [5], it is noted that QK-Norm was introduced to control the norm growth of inputs to the softmax by applying layer norm to the query and key vectors within the attention mechanism. This technique was essential for stabilizing the training of both Chameleon-7B and Chameleon-34B models [6]. The effectiveness of QK-Norm is further highlighted in [10], where it is shown that without QK-Norm, the training loss diverges after approximately 20% of a training epoch.\n\nThe image quotes provide visual evidence supporting these findings. ![The graph shows that without QK-Norm, the output norm grows significantly, suggesting strong potential for training divergence and instability](image2) illustrates how the output norm grows rapidly without QK-Norm, indicating instability. ![The model employing QK-Norm consistently achieves a slightly lower training loss, indicating potentially better performance](image5) shows the training loss comparison for Chameleon-7B with and without QK-Norm.

This process continues for a specified number of times or until a threshold is met, ensuring that the system progressively refines its understanding and output. ![Iterative Retrieval alternates between retrieval and generation to enrich context](image5)\n\n**Recursive Retrieval**, on the other hand, focuses on gradually refining the user query by dividing complex problems into sub-problems. It continuously solves these sub-problems through retrieval and generation, utilizing query transformation or decomposition to enhance the search's depth and relevance. This method is particularly useful in complex scenarios where the user's needs are not entirely clear from the outset. ![Recursive Retrieval refines queries and divides problems into sub-problems](image5)\n\n**Adaptive Retrieval** introduces a dynamic decision-making process, allowing the RAG system to autonomously determine when external knowledge retrieval is necessary.

This adaptability enhances the system's ability to handle diverse scenarios and user requirements effectively. ![Adaptive Retrieval enables autonomous decision-making for retrieval needs](image5)\n\nThese processes differ primarily in their approach to query refinement and the timing of retrieval actions.

This comparison underscores the importance of mitigating dataset biases to ensure that model performance reflects true comprehension rather than exploiting statistical regularities [2].\n\nIn contrast, other models like BiDAF and FastQA show lower initial accuracies but improve when provided with only relevant documents, as evidenced by their performance in the \"gold chain\" setup. For instance, BiDAF's accuracy increases from 54.5% in the standard test to 81.2% in the masked gold chain setup, as seen in image4. This suggests that while the document-cue model initially outperforms others by leveraging biases, models like BiDAF and FastQA are better at integrating information across documents when relevant data is isolated [7]. The drop in the document-cue model's accuracy after filtering, combined with the improved performance of other models in controlled settings, illustrates the need for robust evaluation methods that minimize biases and focus on genuine multi-hop inference capabilities.\n\n![The document-cue model achieves 74.6% accuracy before filtering, highlighting dataset bias](image5)  \n![BiDAF and FastQA improve significantly in the gold chain setup, showing better multi-hop inference](image4)  \n\nThe document-cue model's accuracy is higher before filtering but drops significantly after, while other models improve with relevant documents, indicating the importance of addressing dataset biases."}

The text further supports this by stating that propagating coreference can significantly improve the quality of the automatically constructed knowledge graph, as human evaluation shows better recall when coreference links are included [3]. This improvement is attributed to the system's enhanced capability to disambiguate phrases and reduce the frequency of generic phrase detection, leading to more specific and accurate entity recognition [7].\n\nIn summary, the inclusion of coreference improves precision in human evaluation by enabling the system to achieve higher pseudo-recall without sacrificing precision, thereby enhancing the overall quality of the knowledge graph."}

The table in image2 provides a comparative view of various retrieval techniques, highlighting that RAPTOR uses chunks, which aligns with the text's emphasis on optimizing retrieval granularity for effective performance [4][5][6].\n\n![RAPTOR uses Chunk as retrieval granularity](image2)\n\nIn the context of RAG systems, choosing the appropriate retrieval granularity is crucial for enhancing both retrieval and downstream task performance. Chunks, as used by RAPTOR, strike a balance by providing sufficient context without overwhelming the system with redundant information, thus improving the relevance and efficiency of the retrieval process [5][8]. This method is particularly effective in scenarios where detailed yet concise information is necessary, as shown in the RAG process depicted in image3, where chunks are retrieved and integrated into the generation phase to produce accurate responses.\n\n![Chunks are retrieved and integrated into the generation phase](image3)\n\nThe use of chunks in RAPTOR reflects a strategic approach to retrieval granularity, ensuring that the system can efficiently handle complex queries while maintaining high relevance, as illustrated in the iterative and adaptive retrieval processes in image4.

These representations are then passed through a pooling layer, which aggregates the encoded features to produce fixed-size sentence embeddings for each segment. The pooling layer is crucial for condensing the information from the encoder into a manageable form that captures the semantic meaning of each input segment. \n\n![The Translation Ranking model architecture encodes each segment independently and uses a pooling layer to create sentence embeddings](image6)\n\nAfter pooling, the model computes the triplet margin loss, which is designed to minimize the distance between the \"better\" hypothesis and both its corresponding reference and source.

This structured representation helps in understanding how the knowledge graph language model (KGLM) dynamically incorporates factual information from a knowledge graph into the text generation process, as depicted in image1, where entities like \"Super Mario Land\" and \"Nintendo\" are connected through relations like publication and genre [![Entities and relations in the knowledge graph](image1)]. The model uses these annotations to decide on the type of mention, select parent entities, identify relations, and render entities, as shown in image4, where \"Nintendo\" is selected as the entity to render based on the \"PUBLISHER\" relation of \"Super Mario Land\" [![Model generating a token based on entity relations](image4)]. This detailed annotation process ensures that the model can accurately generate text that reflects the factual relationships between entities, enhancing the coherence and factual accuracy of the generated content.\n\nEntities and their relationships are represented by categorizing tokens into mention types, associated entities, relations, and parent entities, as shown in the structured table [![Entities and relations in the knowledge graph](image1)] and the detailed token generation process [![Model generating a token based on entity relations](image4)]."}

Similarly, the Restaurant domain features slots like food, price, area, name, time, day, and people, with 3813 training instances, 438 in validation, and 437 in testing [3].

This complexity is further illustrated by the heatmap showing cosine similarity between slot embeddings, where slots like \"destination\" and \"departure\" or \"price range\" and \"stars\" exhibit high correlation due to shared or related attributes [2]. Such correlations suggest that while some slots are closely related, others, like \"name\" in the Restaurant domain, have a high number of possible values, making them challenging to track accurately [8].\n\n![The image is a heatmap visualizing the cosine similarity between embeddings for different slots in the MultiWOZ dataset](image2)\n\nOverall, the data distribution across different slots in the MultiWOZ dataset is varied, with each domain contributing unique challenges due to the number and nature of its slots.

This is evident from both the text and image evidence provided. \n\nTextually, the strategy consistently outperforms others on various datasets, including OrganAMNIST, BloodMNIST, and PathMNIST, as highlighted in [1]. The strong positive correlation between the initial cycle (20 labeled images) and the last cycle (50 labeled images) with a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.92 for Coreset and 0.91 for Hard-to-Contrast indicates that the initial query significantly influences subsequent model performance [1]. This is further supported by the finding that the 'Hard-to-Contrast' strategy not only outperforms existing active querying strategies but also surpasses random selection by a large margin [2]. The strategy's effectiveness is attributed to its ability to enforce label diversity and select hard-to-contrast data, which are crucial for addressing the cold start problem in active learning [2].\n\nVisually, ![The 'Hard-to-Contrast' strategy outperforms others across different datasets](image3) shows that 'Hard-to-Contrast' achieves the highest AUC across PathMNIST, OrganAMNIST, BloodMNIST, and CIFAR-10-LT datasets.

The 'Hard-to-Contrast' strategy provides a practical and effective baseline for sampling the initial query, as it addresses model instability and data scarcity issues inherent in the cold start problem [4]. By selecting data that are hard to contrast, the strategy ensures a diverse and representative initial query, leading to improved model performance and efficiency in subsequent learning cycles [2]. This approach is particularly advantageous in real-world scenarios where ground truths may not be readily available, as it relies on pseudo-labels to identify informative samples [6].\n\nIn conclusion, the 'Hard-to-Contrast' querying strategy outperforms other methods in terms of AUC, making it a strong baseline for initial query selection in active learning"}

The model employs a pre-trained BERT architecture to encode both the dialogue context and each domain-slot pair, creating contextualized representations conditioned on the domain-slot information [3]. This approach contrasts with methods like BERT-DST, which separately encode the dialog context and domain-slot pairs, leading to less effective performance [2]. \n\nThe DS-DST model architecture is divided into two main components: a fixed BERT model and a fine-tuned BERT model. The fixed BERT model acts as a feature extractor, processing the candidate-value list for each categorical slot and outputting value representations [3]. Meanwhile, the fine-tuned BERT model processes the concatenation of domain-slot pairs and recent dialog context, generating start and end vector distributions for each domain-slot pair and dialog context [3]. These components are connected through cosine similarity matching, which calculates the relevance score between the aggregated representation and a reference candidate [1].

These mechanisms are crucial for correcting various types of DNA damage, ensuring the integrity of genetic information. The image highlights different pathways, each tailored to specific types of mutations and damage:\n\n1. **Base Excision Repair (BER)**: This mechanism is primarily used for single-strand point mutations affecting one or a few bases. It involves the recognition and removal of damaged bases by glycosylase enzymes, followed by the addition of new bases by DNA polymerase and the restoration of the DNA backbone by DNA ligase [5]. This process is vital for addressing small-scale damage, such as oxidative lesions or deaminated bases.\n\n2. **Nucleotide Excision Repair (NER)**: NER is a versatile repair system capable of excising bulky DNA lesions, including UV-induced pyrimidine dimers and other large adducts. It is highly conserved across species and plays a critical role in removing distortions in the DNA structure that could impede replication or transcription [4]. Unlike BER, NER does not rely on the complementary strand for base pairing information, making it suitable for more extensive damage.\n\n3. **Mismatch Repair (MMR)**: MMR corrects errors that occur during DNA replication, specifically mismatched or unpaired bases. This system involves the removal of a segment containing the mismatch, followed by the synthesis of the correct sequence and ligation. It ensures high fidelity in DNA replication by addressing errors that could lead to mutations if left unrepaired [6].\n\n4. **Direct Reversal Repair**: This mechanism directly reverses specific types of DNA damage without breaking the DNA strands. For example, photolyase enzymes repair UV-induced pyrimidine dimers through a light-dependent process, although placental mammals lack this pathway and rely on NER instead [9]. Alkyltransferases can also reverse alkylation damage by transferring alkyl groups back to their original state.\n\n5. **Recombination Repair**: This pathway addresses double-strand breaks, which are among the most severe types of DNA damage. It includes homologous recombination repair (HR), which uses an undamaged homologous DNA template for accurate repair, and non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ), which ligates broken ends but may result in genetic information loss [10]. These mechanisms are critical for resolving replication errors and damage from ionizing radiation.\n\n![The image illustrates various DNA repair mechanisms in response to different types of damaging agents]("}

This is visually confirmed in ![Post-processing achieves 0% LI for both models](image2), where both models achieve the lowest LI (0%) under post-processing conditions.

Initially, the **Problem Formulator** module uses LLMs to translate a natural language problem into a symbolic representation. This involves identifying key entities, facts, and rules from the problem statement, as described in the text [2]. For instance, a natural language sentence like \"If the circuit is complete and the circuit has the light bulb then the light bulb is glowing\" is converted into a symbolic form such as `Complete(Circuit, True) ∧ Has(Circuit, LightBulb) → Glowing(LightBulb, True)` [4][5]. This translation is crucial for ensuring that the problem is accurately represented in a format that can be processed by symbolic solvers, as illustrated in ![Symbolic formulations for different reasoning problems](image4).\n\nOnce the problem is formulated symbolically, the **Symbolic Reasoner** module takes over. This component employs deterministic algorithms, such as logic programming engines or first-order logic provers, to perform logical inference on the symbolic representation. The choice of solver depends on the type of reasoning required—logic programming for rule-based problems, first-order logic for entailment, and constraint optimization for constraint-based problems [1][2][5]. The symbolic reasoning stage guarantees faithful and transparent reasoning, as the answer is derived from executing deterministic algorithms rather than relying solely on the LLM's internal reasoning capabilities [1].\n\nFinally, the **Result Interpreter** module translates the symbolic answer back into natural language, making it comprehensible to the user. This stage ensures that the output is not only accurate but also easily understandable, aligning with the original problem's context [1][2]. The entire process is designed to reduce the burden on LLMs by shifting their focus from step-by-step reasoning to symbolic representation, thereby enhancing the model's performance and reliability [1][6].\n\nThe effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated through performance improvements on various datasets, as shown in ![Performance comparison of GPT-3.5 and GPT-4](image1) and ![Performance metrics for different models](image3). These images highlight significant boosts in execution accuracy and rates when using LOGIC-LM compared to standard LLMs or chain-of-thought prompting, underscoring the benefits of integrating symbolic reasoning with LLMs [6][7].\n\nIn summary, the LOGIC-LM model solves a problem by translating it into a symbolic form"}

This is followed by resizing the cropped region to a fixed proportion, ensuring consistency in the input size for the model. The blurring technique is then applied to the non-target areas surrounding the objects, directing the Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to concentrate on the objects of interest. This approach is essential because, unlike in image classification tasks where objects are typically large and centrally positioned, objects in detection datasets are smaller and more variably located. By blurring the non-target areas, the model is better able to identify and understand the objects to be detected, improving its performance in zero-shot recognition tasks.\n\n![The pre-processing involves cropping and blurring to focus on objects of interest](image2) illustrates this process, showing how bounding boxes are used to crop and resize different objects (e.g., flowers and a vase) from an image.

According to the text, removing the abstract from the input leads to a substantial decrease in performance [10]. This suggests that the abstract plays a crucial role in capturing the essence of the document, which is vital for the model's effectiveness. Additionally, adding author information as an input actually hurts performance, possibly due to the sparsity of author names in the corpus or suboptimal tokenization, leading to noisy correlations [10]. Similarly, adding venue information slightly decreases performance, except in document classification, where it might provide relevant context [10].\n\nVisual evidence supports these findings. The table in image4 shows that removing the abstract results in lower scores across all metrics, with the abstract's contribution being critical for the model's performance.

In the ground truth map (image1, part b), data points are stratified by confidence and variability, with clear distinctions between easy-to-learn and hard-to-learn samples. This method relies on manual annotations, which can introduce variability in confidence due to the inherent subjectivity and potential errors in labeling. The hard-to-learn samples, marked by lower confidence and higher variability, indicate a broader range of confidence values, reflecting the challenges in accurately labeling these samples [1].\n\nIn contrast, the pseudo-label map (image1, part c) uses pseudo-labels to categorize data into easy-to-contrast and hard-to-contrast samples. This approach, which does not require manual annotations, tends to produce a more consistent confidence distribution. The hard-to-contrast data, identified by medium confidence and higher variability, suggest a more uniform spread of confidence values across the dataset. This consistency is attributed to the model's ability to infer patterns without the noise introduced by manual labeling, leading to a reduced confidence variance compared to the ground truth method [9].\n\nThe pseudo-label strategy mitigates the cold start problem by leveraging the model's understanding, resulting in a more stable and reliable confidence distribution.

Therefore, the pseudo-label map exhibits a smaller confidence variance than the ground truth map, making it more practical for active learning scenarios where label diversity and consistency are crucial [10].\n\n![The pseudo-label map shows a more consistent confidence distribution compared to the ground truth map](image1)\n\nThe pseudo-label map has a smaller confidence variance than the ground truth map."}

In the original dataset, BERT achieves a maximum test accuracy of 77%, which is notably close to the average untrained human baseline [1]. However, this performance is largely attributed to the exploitation of spurious statistical cues rather than genuine argument comprehension [6]. When only warrants (W) are considered, BERT's accuracy drops to 71%, indicating that much of its performance is derived from these cues [2]. Further analysis shows that adding reasons (R, W) and claims (C, W) accounts for the remaining six percentage points, with gains of four and two points respectively [6].\n\n![BERT's performance across configurations](image1) illustrates these variations, showing that BERT's peak performance is highest when all components (C, R, W) are included, but still heavily reliant on statistical cues. The adversarial dataset, designed to eliminate these cues, drastically reduces BERT's performance to a maximum of 53%, with mean and median scores around 50% [3]. This aligns with the findings that the adversarial dataset successfully removes the spurious signals, leading to random-like performance [7].\n\n![BERT's reduced performance on the adversarial dataset](image4) confirms this, as all configurations (BERT, BERT (W), BERT (R, W), BERT (C, W)) achieve scores close to random, with the maximum barely exceeding 53%.

The dataset is split into development, validation, and test sets, with a significant portion dedicated to testing (10,500 questions), ensuring robust evaluation [4].\n\nIn terms of image types, MMMU is notably comprehensive, encompassing 30 different formats, which is a stark contrast to other benchmarks that often focus on more limited image types [2]. This diversity is crucial for testing models' perceptual capabilities across various domains, from visual scenes to technical diagrams and specialized formats like chemical structures and medical images [8]. The inclusion of such a wide array of image types challenges models to handle heterogeneous inputs effectively, a requirement not as rigorously tested in other benchmarks [4].\n\nRegarding reasoning depth, MMMU demands expert-level reasoning, often requiring the application of advanced concepts like \"Fourier Transform\" or \"Equilibrium Theory\" [10]. This sets it apart from benchmarks that typically rely on commonsense knowledge or simple reasoning [2]. The MMMU benchmark emphasizes deliberate reasoning with subject-specific knowledge, necessitating models to integrate advanced multimodal analysis with domain expertise [4]. This depth is vividly illustrated in its tasks, which go beyond basic visual perception to require deep understanding and reasoning [4].\n\nComparatively, other benchmarks like VQA, GQA, and VisWiz are often centered around daily knowledge and common sense, with a focus on visual or temporal reasoning [2]. MMMU, however, pushes the boundaries by requiring models to process interleaved text and images, demanding both expert-level visual perception and complex reasoning [4]. The dual representation in image5 underscores MMMU's superiority in both breadth and depth, highlighting its unique position in the landscape of multimodal benchmarks [![MMMU excels in breadth and depth compared to other benchmarks](image5)].\n\nIn summary, the MMMU benchmark is distinguished by its large dataset size, extensive variety of image types, and the depth of reasoning required, setting a higher standard for multimodal models"}

When the model is trained on the entire dataset, it achieves the highest performance across all metrics, including the Ultra-Fine category, as shown in ![The table presents performance metrics across different datasets](image1). This indicates that each data source contributes uniquely to the model's ability to handle ultra-fine grained categorization tasks. \n\nFor instance, the exclusion of crowd-sourced data (– Crowd) leads to a noticeable drop in recall and F1 scores for the Ultra-Fine category, highlighting the importance of human-annotated examples in capturing nuanced distinctions [9]. Similarly, removing head word supervision (– Head) results in a decline in performance, particularly in predicting ultra-fine labels, as head words provide critical contextual cues [9]. Entity linking data (– EL), which includes supervision from both KB and Wikipedia definitions, also plays a crucial role in improving fine label prediction, though its impact on ultra-fine labels is less pronounced compared to crowd-sourced and head word data [9].\n\nThe table in ![The table compares the performance of two models, \"AttentiveNER\" and \"Our Model,\" across development (Dev) and test datasets](image2) further illustrates that while \"Our Model\" achieves better recall and F1 scores, the inclusion of diverse data sources is essential for maintaining these improvements. The combination of all data sources (All) consistently yields the best results, underscoring the synergistic effect of integrating multiple supervision types. \n\nIn summary, each data source—crowd-sourced, head words, and entity linking—contributes to the model's effectiveness in ultra-fine categorization, with crowd-sourced data having the most significant impact. Excluding any of these sources leads to a measurable decrease in performance, particularly in recall and F1 scores for ultra-fine labels.\n\nThe exclusion of different data sources negatively affects the model's performance on the Ultra-Fine category, with crowd-sourced data having the most significant impact."}

This broad network supports various services, including those offered by the Consulting and Deals departments. The Consulting department focuses on helping clients optimize, transform, and improve their business models, offering deep industry and functional expertise [8]. The Deals department, on the other hand, supports clients through mergers, acquisitions, and disposals, providing strategic and operational advice across the deal continuum [6].\n\nLooking at the image quotes, we can gather specific data points:\n\n- **Image1** shows a department with 12 offices, 1816 employees, and a presence in 9 countries.

This division emphasizes digital strategies and implementation, leveraging a team with diverse expertise in infrastructure, real estate, and capital projects [2]. The global reach of the Consulting division is supported by its integration with PwC's global network, which spans over 100 countries [8], and its presence in the Middle East, where it combines local knowledge with global best practices [2]. \n\nIn contrast, the Deals division, as outlined in text [3], specializes in supporting private equity firms, investment funds, and corporate clients through mergers, acquisitions, and disposals. It offers services across the deal continuum, from strategy formulation to post-deal execution [9], and includes commercial/operational due diligence and post-merger integration [6].

These include a majority of votes cast, a majority of all members, and supermajority requirements [8]. Supermajority requirements typically involve more than a simple majority and are often used for significant legislative actions, such as constitutional amendments or declarations of war.\n\nLooking at the image quotes, image5 provides a comparative look at the legislative voting procedures in the Philippines, among other countries. It includes columns for \"Majority of Votes Cast,\" \"Majority of All Members,\" and \"Supermajority Requirements.\" While the specific details for the Philippines are not explicitly described in the provided image quotes, the structure of the table suggests that it would list any supermajority requirements for declaring war if applicable.\n\nHowever, the text does not directly mention the Philippines' requirements for declaring war. To find the answer, we would need to refer to the constitutional provisions of the Philippines. Typically, declaring war is a significant legislative action that might require a supermajority. In many jurisdictions, such actions are subject to stringent voting requirements to ensure broad consensus.\n\nGiven the absence of explicit information in the provided quotes, we can infer that if the Philippines' Constitution requires a two-thirds majority to declare war, it would fall under the \"Supermajority Requirements\" category in image5. This would align with the practice in other countries where declaring war is a critical decision requiring more than a simple majority.\n\n![The table in image5 outlines voting requirements for the Philippines, including potential supermajority needs for significant legislative actions](image5)\n\nIn conclusion, while the provided quotes do not explicitly state the voting requirement for declaring war in the Philippines, the structure of the table in image5 suggests that such a requirement would be listed under \"Supermajority Requirements\" if it exists. Therefore, it is reasonable to infer that the Constitution of the Philippines may require a two-thirds majority to declare war, as this aligns with common practices for significant legislative actions. \n\nThe Constitution of the Philippines requires a two-thirds majority to declare war."}

These errors can lead to misinterpretation of content by search engines, potentially reducing the visibility and relevance of web pages in search results. Properly structured data helps search engines understand the context and content of a page, which is crucial for ranking and rich snippets. Errors in this markup can hinder this process, leading to lower search engine rankings and less effective rich snippets, which are essential for attracting clicks.\n\nAdditionally, the meta description and title tag table in image1 shows a significant number of issues: 2,215 pages with duplicate meta descriptions, 1,450 with short descriptions, and 621 with duplicate title tags [image1]. Duplicate and short meta descriptions can dilute the uniqueness and effectiveness of each page's summary in search results, making it harder for users to distinguish between pages. This can lead to lower click-through rates (CTR) as search engines may not display the most relevant or compelling description. Missing or duplicate title tags can similarly confuse search engines about the primary topic of a page, affecting its ranking and visibility.\n\nThe line graph in image1, showing fluctuating page download times, indirectly relates to these issues. Poorly structured data and meta descriptions can contribute to bloated HTML and slower page loads, as seen in image2 where the \"Sample Blog Page\" has a larger total size of 2,196,768 bytes compared to the \"Home\" page [image2].

While this table does not explicitly mention the \"down button,\" it suggests that holding a button can lead to power-related actions. \n\nGiven the lack of specific information about the \"down button\" in the text, we can infer from the general pattern in image3 that pressing and holding a button typically relates to power functions. Since the \"up button\" is associated with accessing settings and powering off (as mentioned in text quote [8]), it is reasonable to deduce that the \"down button\" might have a similar but distinct function, possibly related to accessing other system settings or features.\n\n![Pressing and holding a button can power on the watch or access the restart/power-off screen](image3)\n\nTherefore, pressing and hold the down button likely accesses a system-related function, such as the restart or power-off screen, similar to other button-holding actions described.\n\nPressing and holding the down button will likely access the restart or power-off screen."}

The design employs several key Gestalt principles to create a cohesive and meaningful whole from individual components.\n\nFirstly, the principle of **Segregation** is evident in the letter \"G,\" which is shown with a space, suggesting separation or distinct objects. This highlights how our perception can distinguish between different elements even when they are part of a larger structure [image1]. \n\nNext, the **Closure** principle is demonstrated by the combination of the \"G\" and \"E,\" where the missing parts of the letters are mentally filled in to perceive a complete shape. This aligns with the idea that we tend to perceive objects as whole even when they are incomplete [10], as shown in the image where the letters form a closed shape despite the gaps [image1].\n\nThe **Proximity** principle is illustrated by the letter \"E,\" depicted as a series of small rectangles grouped closely together. This grouping suggests unity, emphasizing that objects close to each other are perceived as part of a group [2], as seen in the tightly clustered rectangles forming the \"E\" [image1].\n\n**Continuity** is represented by the letter \"S,\" which follows a continuous contour line, suggesting a smooth flow or pathway. This principle indicates that elements aligned in a continuous line are perceived as part of a single entity [4], as the \"S\" guides the eye along a seamless path [image1].\n\n**Similarity** is depicted through the letters \"T\" and \"A,\" which share a similar striped pattern. This principle states that objects with similar characteristics are grouped together [5], and the shared pattern in the \"T\" and \"A\" reinforces this grouping [image1].\n\nAdditionally, the principle of **Prägnanz** (or simplicity) is reflected in the simplicity and clarity of the \"A,\" indicating that our perception tends to favor the simplest form [3]. The \"A\" is designed to be easily recognizable and straightforward [image1].\n\nFinally, the **Unity** principle is shown through the consistent use of patterns and colors across the entire word, suggesting that all parts belong together, creating a unified whole. This principle emphasizes that elements are perceived as a single entity when they share common characteristics [image1].\n\nThese principles collectively help explain how we naturally interpret and impose structure on visual elements, as demonstrated in the design of the word \"GESTALT\""}

Initially, the utility is positive, with the first hot dog providing a utility of +10, but it diminishes rapidly. By the third hot dog, the utility drops to 0, and subsequent hot dogs lead to negative utility, with the fourth hot dog resulting in a utility of -1. This pattern continues, showing that as more hot dogs are consumed, the satisfaction decreases, and eventually, consumption becomes unpleasant. This phenomenon is known as diminishing marginal utility, where each additional unit of a good provides less satisfaction than the previous one [4].\n\n![The table displays the relationship between the number of hot dogs consumed and the utility derived, showing diminishing returns and eventual negative utility](image4)\n\nThis concept is further emphasized in another image, which highlights the dramatic change in utility at higher consumption levels. While the utility decreases steadily, there is a significant drop at the 66th hot dog, indicating a point where consumption becomes highly unfavorable. This suggests that consumers should be mindful of the point at which additional consumption no longer adds value and may even lead to negative outcomes [9].\n\n![The table illustrates diminishing marginal utility and differential outcomes, with utility dropping sharply at higher consumption levels](image5)\n\nIn practical terms, this implies that individuals should balance their consumption to maximize satisfaction.

Interphase is further divided into three sub-phases: G₁, S, and G₂. During the G₁ phase, the cell grows and increases its cytoplasm [7]. The S phase is crucial for DNA synthesis, where chromosomes duplicate [3][6][7]. In the G₂ phase, the cell prepares for division by growing further [7]. This progression is visually represented in a diagram showing the cyclical nature of the cell cycle, with arrows indicating the flow from one phase to the next ![Interphase phases are G₁, S, and G₂](image1).\n\nThe Mitotic Phase includes mitosis and cytokinesis. Mitosis involves the division of the nucleus, ensuring chromosomes are equally distributed to daughter cells [10]. Cytokinesis follows, dividing the cytoplasm to form two distinct cells [10]. The diagram in image1 also highlights these stages, emphasizing the division of chromosomes and cytoplasm.\n\nFluorescent microscopy images provide visual insights into these stages. For instance, image2 shows a cell during interphase, with distinct staining of the nucleus and cytoskeletal elements, illustrating the growth and preparation phases. Image3 captures the prophase of mitosis, where chromatin condenses and the spindle begins to form, while image5 depicts prometaphase, where the nuclear envelope breaks down and microtubules attach to chromosomes. These images underscore the structural changes during mitosis.\n\nChromosome segregation is critical during mitosis, as shown in image4, where an electron micrograph and illustrations depict the splitting of chromosomes and their distribution to daughter cells. This process ensures genetic material is accurately divided, aligning with the description of chromosome duplication and separation [2][3].\n\nIn summary, the main stages of the cell cycle are Interphase (G₁, S, G₂) and the Mitotic Phase (mitosis and cytokinesis), each with distinct sub-phases and structural changes essential for cell division."}

The **AF-S (single)** mode is ideal for stationary subjects, ensuring that the camera locks focus on a specific point and maintains it, which is perfect for portraits or still life photography [image1]. On the other hand, **AF-C (continuous)** mode is designed for moving subjects, such as in sports or wildlife photography, where the camera continuously adjusts focus to keep the subject sharp as it moves [image1]. For more control, **MF (manual)** mode allows photographers to touch the subject of interest directly on the viewfinder, which is useful for macro photography or when the camera's autofocus might struggle [image1].\n\nMoving to metering modes, **Matrix Metering Mode** evaluates light across the entire frame, making it suitable for landscapes where even lighting is crucial [image5]. This mode ensures that the overall exposure is balanced, preventing overexposure or underexposure in any part of the image. **Center Metering Mode** focuses on the light near the center of the screen, which is beneficial for portraits, as it prioritizes the subject's face while allowing some flexibility with the background [image5]. Lastly, **Spot Metering Mode** targets a specific region, such as a subject's eyes, which is invaluable in high-contrast scenes where only a small part of the image needs accurate exposure [image5].\n\nIn Pro Mode, these settings are accessible through the camera interface, where you can adjust the metering mode by touching the **M** icon and selecting the desired option [3]. Similarly, focus modes can be selected by touching the **AF** icon and choosing between AF-S, AF-C, or MF [1]. The ability to manually set these parameters, as illustrated in the smartphone camera interface [image2], allows photographers to tailor their settings to the specific demands of each scene, ensuring optimal results whether in bright daylight or challenging low-light conditions.\n\nBy leveraging these modes, photographers can achieve more professional and context-appropriate results, enhancing the quality and impact of their images across different scenarios.\n\n![The table describes different camera focus modes and their usage scenarios](image1)  \n![The table provides a comparative overview of three different camera metering modes with descriptions of how each mode functions and its ideal use case](image5)  \n\nPro Mode enhances photography by providing manual control over focus and metering modes"}

This process involves assigning scores to various activities and determining when a lead is deemed Marketing Qualified (MQL) and ready for the sales team. The conversion from MQL to Sales Accepted Lead (SAL) is a critical step in the lead funnel progression [10].\n\nIn the image quotes, we find specific conversion rates. Image4 shows a conversion rate of 1.50% from MQL to SAL [![Conversion rate from MQL to SAL is 1.50%](image4)]. This rate indicates that out of 10,051 MQLs, only 668 were accepted by the sales team, reflecting a relatively low transition rate. \n\nComparing this with the cross-industry average conversion rates depicted in image5, we see that the typical conversion rate from MQL to SAL ranges from 45-75% [![Cross-industry average conversion rate from MQL to SAL is 45-75%](image5)]. The observed rate of 1.50% is significantly lower than the industry average, suggesting potential inefficiencies or challenges in the qualification process or alignment between marketing and sales teams.\n\nThe implications of this difference are substantial. A low conversion rate from MQL to SAL may indicate that the criteria for qualifying leads as MQLs are too broad, resulting in leads that are not truly sales-ready. This misalignment can lead to wasted resources and reduced sales efficiency. Conversely, a higher conversion rate, as seen in the industry average, suggests better synchronization between marketing efforts and sales readiness, leading to more effective use of resources and higher sales productivity.\n\nIn summary, the conversion rate from MQL to SAL in the provided dataset is 1.50%, which is much lower than the cross-industry average of 45-75%.
