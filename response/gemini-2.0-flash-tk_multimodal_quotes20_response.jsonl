While the title of the study mentions \"BY COUNTRY\", the image itself categorizes data by issues, not countries directly in the x-axis, but it is implied that the data is collected across countries to compare concern levels for each issue. Issues like \"Living standards\" and \"Unemployment\" are listed, which relate to text quotes [6] and [7].\n    - **image3**: `![Concern level about issues across different countries](image3)` - This image explicitly shows concern levels \"BY COUNTRY\" for general issues. This directly supports text quotes [6] and [7] as it visualizes concern about issues across different countries.\n    - **image4**: `![Entrepreneurship levels across different countries in 2014](image4)` - This image visualizes \"ENTREPRENEURSHIP BY COUNTRY\" for the year 2014, directly supporting text quote [8].\n    - **image6**: `![Support for energy subsidies across different countries](image6)` - This image shows support for \"ENERGY SUBSIDIES BY COUNTRY\", directly supporting text quote [12].\n    - **image8**: `![Influence on values and beliefs by different sources in 2013 and 2014](image8)` - This image shows influences on values and beliefs, but categorized by sources of influence (Parents, Family, Religion etc.), not countries.

For example, the level of concern about issues across different countries is visualized in  ![Concern level about issues across different countries](image3), and entrepreneurship levels across different countries in 2014 are shown in ![Entrepreneurship levels across different countries in 2014](image4).  Similarly, support for energy subsidies across countries is depicted in ![Support for energy subsidies across different countries](image6).

[11]\n![Line chart showing unfavorable views of China increasing over time, especially post-2018](image8)\n\nA key factor driving this negative perception is the widespread belief that China mishandled the COVID-19 outbreak.

[7] Moreover, this perception of blame is linked to considering China not just as a competitor, but as an enemy of the United States.

Conversely, when it comes to early or absentee voting, Black adults are more inclined to support 'no excuse' options compared to White, Hispanic, and Asian adults [10].

About half of women in STEM (48%) perceive gender discrimination in these areas as a major reason for the underrepresentation of women, while only 29% of men in STEM share this view [1].  This perception is further supported by the fact that women in STEM are more likely than men to report experiencing discrimination at work due to their gender [3].

However, we can analyze the general trends in subscriber growth and ARPU (Average Revenue Per User) during this period and infer potential changes for Telkomsel.\n\nThe reports are from the period of 2013-2014 [1, 11]. Indonesia's mobile subscriber base was experiencing continuous growth, with an annual growth rate of 31.9% between 2006 and 2010 [8]. This suggests a generally expanding market.\n\nHowever, ARPU was under pressure.  ![ARPU of Indosat, Telkomsel, XL and Smartfren in 2008 and 2012](image1) shows a decline in ARPU for major operators including Telkomsel between 2008 and 2012.

This is because users were shifting away from traditional voice and SMS to data-based services [2, 9].  The rise of data-based Instant Messaging (IM) and VoIP services led to reduced usage of SMS and voice calls [9], with IM becoming the primary communication method for mobile users [10].\n\nOne significant factor contributing to reduced ARPU was a massive price war, possibly initiated by government actions [7].  Furthermore, the increased adoption of smartphones would eventually lead to a decrease in SMS ARPU, though data consumption was expected to rise and potentially compensate for the decline in voice and SMS revenues in the longer term [5].\n\nIn conclusion, while subscriber numbers likely continued to grow in 2013-2014 in Indonesia, Telkomsel's ARPU probably decreased due to price wars and a shift in user behavior towards data-based services and away from traditional voice and SMS."}

During this period, the overall mobile subscriber base in Indonesia was also expanding, reaching 240 million by early 2014 and continuing to grow [10]. The increasing adoption of smartphones is further highlighted by the growing e-commerce traffic from smartphones and tablets in Asia Pacific, and Indonesia specifically [9].\n\nThe Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) trends during this time were complex.  Voice ARPU was expected to flatten, and SMS ARPU to decrease, while Data ARPU was predicted to fall in the short term but increase later as data consumption grew [5].

Firstly, the saturation of tariffs meant that price wars were no longer a primary driver for ARPU reduction [2]. Instead, the shift in user behavior towards data-based services like IM and VoIP led to reduced usage of traditional SMS and voice calls [4, 7]. This shift is a key factor in the changing ARPU landscape and the increasing importance of data services.\n\n![Users are shifting towards data-based services like IM and VoIP](image4)\n\nIn conclusion, between 2013 and 2014, both Telkomsel and XL saw an increase in smartphone users, reflecting the growing mobile subscriber base and smartphone adoption in Indonesia, while ARPU trends were shifting towards data and away from voice and SMS due to changing user preferences and service usage patterns."}

[6]\n\nSupporting this, Figure 7 visually demonstrates the class distribution for different querying strategies on OrganAMNIST and BloodMNIST datasets.  ![Figure 7 shows that VAAL has a very uneven distribution across classes, indicating poor label diversity.](image3)  As seen in image3, under the VAAL column, the bar lengths are inconsistent across different classes for both OrganAMNIST and BloodMNIST, with some classes having very short or no bars at all, indicating a lack of selection from those classes and thus poor label diversity.\n\nIn conclusion, **VAAL querying criteria generally exhibits the worst label diversity across the datasets** due to its tendency to bias selection towards specific classes and neglect minority classes."}

[6]\n\nFor instance, verifying a claim might require a 'Simple lookup' to retrieve a value from a specific cell within a table, as illustrated in the reasoning graph where \"A's productivity is 57.5%\" is obtained through a simple lookup. ![A reasoning graph shows a simple lookup operation to get \"A's productivity is 57.5%\" from the table.](image1)\n\nNumerical reasoning is a significant aspect, as demonstrated by the example involving calculating the difference between 57.5% and 50% [2]. This is also reflected in the error analysis where 'Calculation errors' constitute 20% of the errors in Program-of-Thoughts (PoT) model predictions, and 'incorrect calculation results' account for 41.7% of refuted claims. [8, 12]\n\nThe complexity of reasoning in SciTab is further highlighted by the distribution of reasoning steps, where a substantial portion of claims require multiple steps to verify.  The dataset exhibits a range of reasoning steps, peaking at 5 steps which account for 20% of the claims, indicating that many claims demand intricate reasoning processes. ![A histogram shows the distribution of reasoning steps needed for claim verification in SciTab, with a peak at 5 steps.](image2)\n\nError analysis reveals that 'Grounding errors', where programs incorrectly associate data with table cells, are the most common error type, accounting for 50% of incorrect predictions. [8] This suggests that accurately identifying and referencing the correct cells in tables is a major challenge in table-based fact-checking, especially given the complexity and ambiguity inherent in scientific claims [8, 6].\n\nIn summary, the SciTab dataset features diverse reasoning types like simple lookups and numerical computations, with simple lookups being the most common.  These reasoning processes often involve multiple steps and are prone to grounding errors, reflecting the dataset's complexity and the challenges in scientific table-based fact-checking."}

Common causes for refutation in SciTab include incorrect calculation results and wrong approximation words, reflecting the complexities of real-world scientific claims [10].  In contrast, the Sci-Fact dataset's refuted claims are often generated by simply negating original true claims, with 85% just adding negation words [10, 6]. Reasons for refuted claims in the SciTab dataset, along with their proportions, are detailed in ![Table showing reasons for refuted claims and their proportions](image7). Image7 shows that the most common reason for refuted claims is \"The calculation result is wrong\" at 41.7%.\n\nLarge Language Models (LLMs), including open-source models, generally do not achieve promising results on the SciTab dataset and lag significantly behind human performance [2].  Specifically, open source LLMs like Vicuna-7B and FLAN-T5-XL achieve only moderate improvements over random guessing in both 2-class and 3-class settings, while human annotators achieve much higher F1 scores [2]. Table-based LLMs do not outperform models pre-trained on pure texts, which might be due to the differences in table structures between scientific literature and public corpora [8].  Furthermore, models struggle more in the 3-class setting, particularly in distinguishing between 'refuted' and 'NEI' (Not Enough Information) claims [5]. The performance of various models, including both zero-shot and in-context results, is summarized in ![Table showing performance of different LLMs in zero-shot and in-context settings](image5).

Additionally, \"incorrect approximation words\" and cases where \"the claim is partially right\" [3] further contribute to refuted claims, highlighting nuances beyond simple negation.\n\nNEI (Not Enough Information) claims, on the other hand, arise from different reasoning patterns. Common reasons for NEI claims include \"insufficient evidence in the table and the lack of background knowledge\" [5].  The NEI reasons table shows that \"The claim does not have enough matching evidence\" accounts for 33.3% and \"The claim lacks open-domain knowledge\" for 25.0% of NEI reasons ![NEI reasons involve insufficient evidence and knowledge gaps.](image6).  Furthermore, \"the lack of closed-domain knowledge\" and ambiguous language, such as \"vague pronouns,\" also lead to claims being classified as NEI [5].\n\nThese diverse reasons for refuted and NEI claims pose unique challenges for models, especially in zero-shot 3-class classification. The difficulty in distinguishing between ‘refuted’ and ‘NEI’ claims is inherent in SCI-TAB [10], and even trained human annotators struggle with this distinction. This is reflected in the performance of models in the 3-class setting, which is \"notably poorer than those in the 2-class setting\" [10].

These errors are particularly challenging in zero-shot settings where models lack specific training data for SCI-TAB [6, 9], and even in-context learning with chain-of-thought prompting does not consistently improve performance for models like InstructGPT and GPT-4 [4].\n\nIn summary, the primary reasons for refuted claims in SCI-TAB involve calculation and approximation errors, while NEI claims are due to insufficient evidence and knowledge gaps, and these complexities significantly diminish model performance, particularly in zero-shot 3-class classification due to challenges in distinguishing NEI claims and handling grounding and ambiguity errors."}

This effectiveness in improving accuracy is visually represented in ![Step-Back prompting significantly improves accuracy on TimeQA compared to baseline and other prompting methods](image2), where Step-Back prompting outperforms baseline models and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting on TimeQA.\n\nError analysis reveals that Step-Back prompting is effective in fixing errors made by baseline models.

This is visually represented in performance tables across different NER datasets, where BERT-MRC+DSC consistently shows higher F1 scores compared to other methods.

For accuracy-oriented tasks like text classification, specifically on the Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST) datasets, DSC does not provide improvement and even performs slightly worse than the Cross-Entropy (CE) objective [12]. On SST-5, BERT with CE achieves 55.57 accuracy, while BERT with DSC reaches 55.19 accuracy. ![BERT performance with CE, DL, and DSC on SST datasets, showing DSC is not better for accuracy-oriented tasks](image7).

However, for accuracy-focused tasks like sentiment classification, DSC is not beneficial, suggesting its objective alignment with F1 score optimization rather than accuracy. The Dice-based loss effectively narrows the gap between training objective and the F1 score evaluation metric, making BERT and XLNet variants with DSC a potent combination for relevant NLP tasks."}

The '-negative' augmentation, despite creating a balanced dataset, leads to performance decrease due to the reduction in training data size [1]. The '+negative' data augmentation technique involves selecting negative training examples as templates, resulting in a training set with a significant negative class imbalance (79% negative vs. 21% positive in one instance) [5].\n\nThe impact of these augmentation techniques and the choice of loss function can be observed in the performance metrics across different tasks.  For sentiment classification on SST-2 and SST-5 datasets, BERT fine-tuned with cross-entropy (CE) achieves higher accuracy compared to Dice Loss (DL) and DSC, indicating that dice loss is not optimized for accuracy-oriented tasks [2].  Table 9 shows the accuracy of BERT with CE, DL and DSC on SST-2 and SST-5 datasets. ![Table showing that BERT with CE achieves better accuracy than DL and DSC on SST datasets.](image6)\n\nHowever, when considering tasks sensitive to data imbalance, such as Named Entity Recognition (NER), DSC loss demonstrates superior performance.

Table 9 shows that BERT+DSC achieves an F1 score of 92.11 on QQP, which is higher than BERT+FL (91.86) and BERT+DL (91.92) [Image3]. This indicates that DSC is effective in handling data imbalance in paraphrase identification as well.\n\n```markdown\n![Table showing the F1 scores of BERT with different loss functions on MRPC and QQP datasets.](image3)\n```\n\nThe Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) loss is particularly effective in situations with data imbalance because it is a soft version of the F1 score and helps to mitigate the dominating influence of easy-negative examples, which is a common problem in imbalanced datasets [8].  While Dice loss (DL) may offer some improvements, DSC consistently performs best across various datasets and augmentation scenarios, especially on more imbalanced datasets [9].\n\nIn summary, different data augmentation techniques impact BERT model performance by altering dataset balance.  DSC loss consistently improves performance, especially on imbalanced datasets and across NER and paraphrase identification tasks, as measured by F1 score, while for accuracy-oriented sentiment classification tasks, cross-entropy loss may be more suitable."}

Conversely, augmenting with negative examples (`+negative`) can lead to inferior performance because it creates a more imbalanced dataset [4].

The Dice-based loss (DSC) is proposed to bridge the gap between the training objective and the evaluation metric, particularly the F1 score [3]. Experimental results demonstrate that DSC loss provides a significant performance boost with both BERT and XLNet models on MRC tasks [2]. For instance, on SQuADv1.1, DSC outperforms XLNet by +1.25 in F1 score, and on QuoRef, it surpasses XLNet by +1.46 in EM [2].

This is because in multilingual systems with a shared encoder, aligning embeddings ensures that \"word embeddings of the two source languages are put into similar vector spaces, allowing the model to learn in a similar fashion as it would if training on a single language\" [4].\n\nTo visualize the impact of alignment on BLEU scores in bilingual translation, consider the results presented in the table below.\n\n| Dataset | unaligned | aligned |\n|---|---|---|\n| GL → EN | 12.8 | 11.5 (-1.3) |\n| PT → EN | 30.8 | 30.6 (-0.2) |\n| AZ → EN | 2.0 | 2.1 (+0.1) |\n| TR → EN | 17.9 | 17.7 (-0.2) |\n| BE → EN | 3.0 | 3.0 (+0.0) |\n| RU → EN | 21.1 | 21.4 (+0.3) |\n\n![BLEU score changes with alignment for bilingual translation.](image4)\n\nThis table `image4` illustrates that the effect of alignment on BLEU scores in bilingual translation is not uniform; some language pairs experience a slight decrease in BLEU score (GL-EN, PT-EN, TR-EN), while others see a slight increase (AZ-EN, BE-EN, RU-EN).\n\nIn contrast, for multilingual translation, alignment consistently improves performance, as shown in the following table:\n\n| Train | Eval | bi | std | pre | align |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| GL + PT | GL | 2.2 | 17.5 | 20.8 | **22.4** |\n| AZ + TR | AZ | 1.3 | 5.4 | 5.9 | **7.5** |\n| BE + RU | BE | 1.6 | **10.0** | 7.9 | 9.6 |\n\n![BLEU scores for multilingual translation with and without alignment.](image8)\n\nAs shown in `image8`, the \"align\" column, representing multilingual systems with pre-training and alignment, generally achieves the highest BLEU scores compared to \"std\" (standard multilingual system) and \"pre\" (multilingual system with pre-training but without alignment), particularly for GL and AZ evaluation sets.\n\nRegarding the F-measure scores for target words based on their frequency, pre-training enhances translation accuracy across the vocabulary, especially for low-frequency words. According to text quote [10], \"pre-training manages to improve the accuracy of translation for the entire vocabulary, but particularly for words that are of low frequency in the training corpus\" [10]. This is visually confirmed in Figure 2.\n\n![F-measure of target words by frequency in training corpus, comparing standard and pre-trained embeddings.](image6)\n\nFigure 2 `image6` clearly demonstrates that pre-trained embeddings (\"pre\") consistently yield higher F-measure scores than standard embeddings (\"std\") across all frequency buckets, with a more pronounced improvement for words with lower frequency counts in the training corpus.\n\nIn conclusion, while a priori alignment of word embeddings may not be strictly necessary or universally beneficial in bilingual NMT scenarios, it demonstrably improves translation quality in multilingual systems; furthermore, pre-training word embeddings boosts translation accuracy, especially for less frequent words, across both bilingual and multilingual setups."}

Removing the Relation-GCN (R-GCN) component leads to a notable performance decrease; for example, with GloVe embeddings, removing R-GCN causes an 8.0-point drop in accuracy, even falling below the Coref-GRU baseline [4]. This demonstrates the crucial role of R-GCN in enhancing model performance, even without contextual embeddings like ELMo [11, 12]. Table 3, depicted in Image4, corroborates this by showing the performance reduction when R-GCN is absent. ![Table 3 shows the ablation study results for different model components.](image4).  Moreover, employing a basic graph that doesn't differentiate relation types (\"No relation types\") yields only minor improvements over ELMo alone, emphasizing the necessity of informative graph construction and refined parameterization [1].\n\nRegarding the ablation of specific relation types, document-based (DOC-BASED) connections are shown to be the most critical; their removal causes the most substantial performance decline [7]. This underscores the importance of connections between mentions within the same document. While removing MATCH or COREF connections has a less severe impact, they still contribute to the model's overall effectiveness [7].  Table 3 in Image4 also illustrates the performance fluctuations when \"No DOC-BASED,\" \"No MATCH,\" and \"No COREF\" settings are applied in both unmasked and masked scenarios. The effects of these component removals are consistent across both unmasked and masked conditions, as evidenced in Table 3 [Image4].\n\nIn conclusion, the removal of R-GCN, relation types, and particularly DOC-BASED connections, generally diminishes the model's performance in both unmasked and masked settings, highlighting their essential contributions to effective relation extraction."}

In fact, there can be performance degradation when coreference is used, especially in more challenging test documents [8].  This is partly because simpler heuristics like exact matching (MATCH) already capture many coreference cases [8].  Furthermore, external coreference systems might not be reliable, especially in out-of-domain scenarios [8].\n\nAs shown in the ablation study, removing coreference (No COREF in ![Table showing performance of different Entity-GCN configurations and ablations](image6)) from the model does not drastically reduce performance compared to the full model.

However, in the masked setting, the 'full (ensemble)' model reaches 71.6% accuracy, whereas the 'GloVe with R-GCN' model drastically drops to 11.1% accuracy [image3]. This substantial difference in masked conditions highlights the importance of contextual embeddings like ELMo, which are used in the 'full (ensemble)' model but replaced by context-insensitive GloVe vectors in the 'GloVe with R-GCN' model [9].\n\n![The table shows that the 'full (ensemble)' model has a much higher accuracy than 'GloVe with R-GCN' in the masked setting.](image3)\n\nThe table showing relation-specific accuracy reveals that performance varies across different relation types [image6].

This approach overcomes limitations of models like MDBT, GLAD, and GCE that require a predefined domain ontology [10].\n\nIn domain expansion scenarios, fine-tuning the TRADE model on a new domain demonstrates better performance compared to training a new model from scratch on that domain [3, 5]. For instance, fine-tuning TRADE with just 1% of new domain data achieves a 59.83% joint accuracy, significantly outperforming training from scratch with the same amount of data, which yields 44.24% joint accuracy [3]. Different fine-tuning strategies impact the model's ability to retain knowledge from previously learned domains. GEM fine-tuning outperforms Naive and EWC fine-tuning in mitigating catastrophic forgetting [2, 5].

Fine-tuning this model with strategies like GEM and EWC shows varied effectiveness in domain adaptation. GEM, specifically, outperforms naive fine-tuning by better maintaining performance on original domains while adapting to new ones [1, 4].  For example, when fine-tuning the hotel domain, GEM leads to a smaller performance drop compared to naive fine-tuning, which significantly deteriorates tracking ability [1].  ![GEM fine-tuning on new domain achieves higher joint accuracy compared to Naive and EWC fine-tuning methods](image3). This table demonstrates that GEM consistently achieves superior joint accuracy compared to Naive and EWC fine-tuning when adapting to new domains.\n\nFurthermore, the success of knowledge transfer is influenced by slot similarities across domains. Common slots like 'people', 'area', 'price range', and 'day' are more effectively transferred, indicating that shared semantic knowledge aids in adaptation [2].  ![Bar charts comparing slot tracking performance in Hotel and Restaurant domains, showing variations in slot importance and transferability](image4). This image highlights that while some slots are common and potentially transferable across domains like Hotel and Restaurant (e.g., 'area', 'price range'), domain-specific slots ('parking' in hotel, 'food' in restaurant) pose a greater challenge for tracking [2]. The architecture of TRADE, shown below, supports this transfer through shared components like the utterance encoder and state generator [3, 9]. ![TRADE model architecture with utterance encoder, slot gate, and state generator components](image1). This diagram illustrates the TRADE model's architecture, which is designed to share parameters across domains to facilitate knowledge transfer.\n\nIn conclusion, GEM fine-tuning is a more effective strategy than naive fine-tuning and EWC for adapting the TRADE model to new domains by mitigating catastrophic forgetting, and the transfer of knowledge is more effective for slots that exhibit similarities across different domains."}

However, even in languages with better overall accuracy, significant gender bias persists.\n\nFor example, performance significantly differs between stereotypical and non-stereotypical gender role assignments, with systems showing better accuracy for pro-stereotypical roles and worse performance for anti-stereotypical roles [11].  This trend is visually represented in the bar chart, showing accuracy for stereotypical and non-stereotypical translations across different languages. ![The bar chart shows that for each language, the accuracy is higher for stereotypical translations compared to non-stereotypical translations, indicating a bias.](image1)\n\nTable 2 provides a detailed performance comparison of commercial MT systems across languages, highlighting overall gender accuracy and the performance difference between masculine and feminine genders ($\\Delta_{G}$) and between stereotypical and anti-stereotypical gender roles ($\\Delta_{S}$) [1].

Adding adjectives like \"pretty\" to female entities and \"handsome\" to male entities can influence translations. For instance, prepending \"pretty\" to \"doctor\" in the sentence \"The doctor asked the nurse to help her\" can shift the translation towards a feminine inflection, even when \"doctor\" might typically be translated with a male inflection due to stereotypes [9].\n\n![Adding \"pretty\" adjective to \"baker\" changes the Spanish translation from male \"panadero\" to female \"panadera,\" correcting the gender bias.](image5)\n\nThis approach of adding stereotypical adjectives to balance gender signals has shown to improve translation accuracy and reduce gender bias, particularly in languages like Spanish, Russian, and Ukrainian [9].

Initially, BERT showed surprising performance on the original ARCT dataset, achieving a peak performance of $77\\%$, which was close to human baseline [1].

Specifically, BERT was found to rely on \"cue words\" like \"not\" in the warrant to make classifications [2].\n\nTo address this issue, an adversarial dataset was constructed by negating the claim and inverting the label for each data point, effectively mirroring the distribution of statistical cues across labels [8].

Notably, most divisions experienced net revenue growth from 2018 to 2020. However, observing operating profit, we see a more nuanced picture. While overall operating profit saw an increase from 2018 to 2020, there was a slight decrease from 2019 to 2020.  This is further explained by the pre-tax charges related to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, which affected the operating profit of all divisions [5].\n\n![Percentage of net revenue from beverage and food/snack businesses by division.](image6)\n\nImage6 shows the approximate percentage of net revenue generated from beverage and food/snack businesses within each division. LatAm, for instance, consistently derives 90% of its net revenue from food and snacks, with only 10% from beverages. In contrast, Europe has a more balanced distribution, with beverage contributing 55% and food/snack 45% to its net revenue in 2020.\n\nExamining the operating profit changes in relation to these distributions, we can observe that divisions like PBNA, which has a significant beverage component, experienced a decrease in operating profit in 2020 [7], despite overall net revenue growth across divisions. This decrease in PBNA's operating profit was partially offset by net revenue growth and productivity savings but impacted by operating cost increases [7].  Conversely, FLNA, which is primarily focused on food and snacks, showed an increase in operating profit, reflecting net revenue growth and productivity savings even amidst operating cost increases [6].  It's also stated that charges from the COVID-19 pandemic reduced operating profit growth [9, 11], suggesting that the pandemic's impact varied across divisions and potentially affected beverage and snack categories differently.\n\nThe changes in net revenue and operating profit across divisions from 2018 to 2020 are likely related to a combination of factors including the distribution of beverage and food/snack categories, general economic conditions, and specific impacts from events like the COVID-19 pandemic."}

Upstream operations are focused on crude oil and natural gas exploration, development, production, and transportation. Downstream operations are primarily involved in refining crude oil into petroleum products, marketing these products, and manufacturing petrochemicals and lubricants [4].\n\nRegarding earnings, the performance of these segments varies significantly.  The earnings of the company are heavily influenced by the upstream business, which is largely dependent on crude oil prices [3].  Conversely, downstream earnings are closely linked to the refining and marketing margins of products like gasoline and jet fuel, which are affected by global supply and demand and crude oil prices [5].\n\nLooking at the segment earnings, we can see a clear difference in performance between 2021 and 2020.\n\n![Upstream segment earnings significantly increased in 2021 compared to 2020, while Downstream segment earnings also increased.](image6)\n\nIn **Upstream**, the segment earnings dramatically improved from a loss of $\\$(2{,}433)$ in 2020 to a profit of $\\S15{,}818$ in 2021.

Comprehensive income reflects the total change in equity from transactions and other events from non-owner sources, encompassing net income and other comprehensive income.  Analyzing these trends provides insights into the overall financial health and equity changes within Accenture.\n\nIn fiscal year 2020, Accenture's comprehensive income reached $5,472,296, increasing from $4,575,086 in 2019 and $3,730,974 in 2018, demonstrating a positive upward trend in overall comprehensive income over these years.  ![Comprehensive income shows an increasing trend from 2018 to 2020](image5) This positive trend in comprehensive income is primarily supported by the consistent growth in net income and fluctuations in other comprehensive income. Net income increased from $4,214,594 in 2018 to $4,846,241 in 2019 and further to $5,185,313 in 2020.  ![Net income increased steadily from 2018 to 2020](image5)\n\nOther comprehensive income (loss) experienced variability across the years.

For instance, foreign currency translation moved from a significant loss in 2018 to income in 2020.  ![Foreign currency translation fluctuated from loss to income](image5)\n\nThese income trends are directly reflected in the Consolidated Shareholders’ Equity Statements. The increase in net income each year adds to the retained earnings, a significant component of shareholders' equity.

The Committee also recognises the evolving nature of climate change risks and ensures that climate change is appropriately considered in management's judgements and disclosures [1, 9].  This includes considering greenhouse gas emissions reduction commitments and climate change scenarios in financial statements [2].\n\nTo ensure directors are well-equipped, BHP provides briefings and development sessions, including specific climate change sessions, to enhance their understanding of key issues and policy considerations [Image5].  These sessions are part of a broader induction, training, and development program for the Board and Committee members [Image1, image2].  The Board also values the diverse experience of its members and seeks input from management and advisors to consider the implications of climate change and understand international policy responses [11]. This commitment to training and development is further reinforced by the inclusion of \"Board evaluation and Director development\" and a \"2021 training and development program\" as key aspects of corporate governance practices [Image8].\n\nIn conclusion, BHP's governance framework in FY2021 effectively addresses climate change risks through dedicated committee oversight and integrates director training through structured development programs and briefings."}

Adjusted EBITDA serves as the primary metric for evaluating the operational strength of Comcast's businesses and for comparing its performance against industry peers [4].\n\nIn the Sky segment, Adjusted EBITDA saw a decrease from 2019 to 2020, and then an increase in 2021, although it remained below the 2019 level.\n\n```markdown\n![Sky segment Adjusted EBITDA decreased in 2020 and increased in 2021 but remained lower than 2019.](image1)\n```\nThis fluctuation can be attributed to a mix of factors. Revenue in 2021 increased due to sales of Sky Glass televisions [8]. Simultaneously, expenses in Sky decreased primarily due to lower programming and production costs, although increases in direct network costs partially offset this decrease [11, 10].\n\nAt the consolidated level, Adjusted EBITDA followed a similar trend, decreasing from 2019 to 2020 before increasing in 2021 to surpass the 2019 value.\n\n```markdown\n![Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA decreased in 2020 and increased in 2021, exceeding 2019 value.](image4)\n```\n\nThis consolidated increase in 2021 was supported by overall revenue growth, particularly within Comcast Spectacor and due to Sky Glass sales [8, 12].  Expense reductions in 2021, stemming from prior-year COVID-19 response costs, also contributed to this improvement, despite new costs associated with Sky Glass and XClass TV [7].\n\nConversely, the Corporate and Other segment's Adjusted EBITDA increased from 2019 to 2020 but then became negative in 2021.\n\n```markdown\n![Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA increased in 2020 and became negative in 2021.](image5)\n```\n\nThe decrease in Corporate and Other expenses in 2021, primarily due to the absence of severance charges related to COVID-19 as incurred in the previous year, suggests that the negative Adjusted EBITDA in 2021 might be related to other corporate adjustments or allocations not directly specified in the provided quotes [7, 11].\n\nIn the Theme Parks segment, Adjusted EBITDA remained negative across all three years but showed improvement from 2020 to 2021.\n\n```markdown\n![Theme Parks Adjusted EBITDA remained negative but improved from 2020 to 2021.](image8)\n```\n\nThe improvement in Theme Parks' Adjusted EBITDA in 2021 is linked to increased revenue as Comcast Spectacor recovered from COVID-19 impacts [8]. Reduced capital expenditures in Theme Parks due to COVID-19 also likely played a role in moderating losses [9]. However, increased expenses within NBCUniversal, which includes Theme Parks, partially offset these gains [11].\n\nIn summary, Adjusted EBITDA for Comcast Corporation segments showed varied performance from 2019 to 2021, influenced by factors like COVID-19 impacts, strategic initiatives such as Sky Glass and XClass TV, and segment-specific revenue and expense dynamics. Overall, consolidated Adjusted EBITDA decreased in 2020 due to widespread impacts but recovered and slightly increased in 2021 because of market recovery and strategic revenue initiatives coupled with cost management."}

From 2018 to 2019, there was a notable increase in both net interest income and net interest expense, with net interest income increasing by $4,452 million and net interest expense increasing by $3,738 million [image6]. However, the trend reversed sharply from 2019 to 2020, with net interest income decreasing by $5,627 million and net interest expense decreasing significantly by $14,120 million [image6].\n\nThis dramatic shift from an increase to a decrease in net interest income in 2020 is primarily attributed to lower interest rates and the economic downturn caused by COVID-19 [3, 5]. As stated, \"Net interest income decreased \\$5.5 billion to \\$43.4 billion in 2020 compared to 2019. …The decrease in net interest income was primarily driven by lower interest rates...\" [5]. The increased allowance for credit losses, driven by the deteriorated economic outlook due to COVID-19, further impacted net income [2, 3].\n\nBank of America operates through four main business segments: Consumer Banking, Global Wealth and Investment Management (GWIM), Global Banking, and Global Markets, with remaining operations in \"All Other\" [1, 4].  ![Bank of America is divided into five business segments: Consumer Banking, Global Wealth & Investment Management, Global Banking, Global Markets, and All Other.](image1) This structure [4] is designed to manage and report operational results on a Full-Time Equivalent (FTE) basis, allowing for segmented performance evaluation [4, 6, 7, 11].  The decrease in net interest income and net income overall in 2020 [3, 5] reflects a broad impact across these segments, particularly in Consumer Banking, which saw a significant decrease in net income [9]. This impact across segments underscores how macroeconomic factors like interest rate changes and economic downturns permeate through the entire organizational structure of Bank of America, affecting each business segment's contribution to the overall financial performance.\n\nIn conclusion, the major difference is the shift from an increase in both net interest income and expense between 2018 and 2019 to a decrease in both from 2019 to 2020, largely due to lower interest rates and the economic impact of COVID-19. This change reflects the bank's organizational structure as these macroeconomic factors impact all segments, leading to an overall decline in net interest income and net income for the entire Bank of America."}

Despite the lower yields, the company maintained substantial balances in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term U.S. Treasury Bills, prioritizing liquidity and safety over higher returns in short-term investments [4].  This emphasis on liquidity is reflected in the increased holdings of cash, cash equivalents, and U.S. Treasury Bills, which rose from approximately $67.1 billion in 2020 to $90.7 billion in 2021. ![Cash, cash equivalents and US Treasury Bills increased from 2020 to 2021.](image3)\n\nHowever, fixed maturity securities saw a decrease from $20.3 billion in 2020 to $16.4 billion in 2021. ![Fixed maturity securities decreased from 2020 to 2021.](image3) This shift in asset composition, with a greater proportion in cash and a smaller proportion in fixed maturity securities, combined with sustained low interest rates, contributed to the decreased after-tax earnings from insurance investment income, which fell by $4.6\\%$ in 2021 compared to 2020 [1].  The implications of these changes are that while the company maintained a strong liquidity position by increasing cash holdings, the lower interest rate environment and shift in asset allocation towards lower-yielding assets negatively impacted the investment income of the insurance business in 2021.\n\nIn summary, the net investment income of the insurance business decreased from 2020 to 2021 due to lower interest rates and a shift towards more liquid but lower-yielding assets like cash and U.S. Treasury Bills, impacting overall earnings despite prioritizing financial safety."}

In fiscal year 2019, the effective tax rate was significantly higher at 41%, primarily due to the derecognition of a deferred tax asset on distributed intellectual property, which resulted in a \\$2.5 billion charge to income tax expense [8]. This derecognition is also evident in the income tax provision table, where \"Derecognition of deferred tax asset on distributed intellectual property\" is listed as \\$2,472 million in 2019, contributing to a total income tax provision of \\$3,095 million and a 41% effective tax rate.\n\n```markdown\n![Income tax provision items significantly impacting the 2019 effective tax rate.](image2)\n```\n\nConversely, fiscal year 2020 saw a dramatic decrease in the effective tax rate to 9%, and further down to 12% in fiscal year 2021, indicating a lower tax burden compared to 2019. This reduction can be partly attributed to the \"Benefit from FDII deduction\" and \"Benefit related to research and development tax credits,\" which consistently provided tax benefits across all three years, as shown in the income tax provision table.\n\n```markdown\n![Breakdown of income tax provision (benefit) for fiscal years 2021, 2020, and 2019, highlighting the changes in effective tax rates.](image7)\n```\n\nFurthermore, the tax benefits from share-based awards have consistently increased from \\$237 million in 2019 to \\$567 million in 2021 [1].

Total sales and revenues saw a substantial rise of $2.563 billion, or 23 percent, reaching $13.798 billion in Q4 2021, up from $11.235 billion in Q4 2020 [3]. This surge in sales was primarily fueled by heightened end-user demand for both equipment and services, along with shifts in dealer inventories [3].  ![Consolidated sales and revenues increased in Q4 2021 compared to Q4 2020 due to sales volume, price realization and financial product revenues.](image8) As depicted in the \"Consolidated Sales and Revenues Comparison\" image, sales volume notably contributed to this increase.\n\nThe increase in sales volume was a geographically broad trend. North America experienced a 29 percent sales increase, attributed to changes in dealer inventories and stronger end-user demand [2]. Similarly, EAME sales grew by 24 percent, and Asia/Pacific sales increased by 9 percent, both driven by similar factors of end-user demand and dealer inventory adjustments [4, 6].  In contrast to the inventory reductions in Q4 2020, dealer inventories remained relatively stable in Q4 2021 [2, 3, 6], suggesting a change in dealer expectations or supply chain dynamics.  Specifically, dealers decreased inventories by about $1.1 billion in Q4 2020, but only by about $100 million in Q4 2021 [8].\n\nRegarding operating profit, the fourth quarter of 2021 also saw an improvement, although the operating profit margin slightly decreased. Operating profit for Q4 2021 was $1.611 billion, a 17 percent increase from $1.380 billion in Q4 2020 [12].  ![Consolidated operating profit increased in Q4 2021 compared to Q4 2020 due to sales volume, price realization and other revenues, despite increases in manufacturing costs and SG&A/R&D expenses.](image4) As shown in the \"Consolidated Operating Profit Comparison\" image for the fourth quarter, sales volume and price realization were significant positive factors.  While higher manufacturing costs, along with increased SG&A and R&D expenses, partially offset these gains [12], the positive impacts from increased sales volume, favorable price realization, and net restructuring income were more substantial [12]. Resource Industries also saw a profit increase of 12 percent, reaching $305 million in Q4 2021, despite rising manufacturing costs and SG&A/R&D expenses, which were compensated by higher sales volume and favorable pricing [1].\n\nIn summary, both sales volume and operating profit increased in the fourth quarter of 2021 compared to 2020, primarily driven by higher end-user demand and changes in dealer inventory strategies, although increased costs partially moderated the gains in operating profit margin."}

This growth in comprehensive income can be attributed to several factors, primarily driven by the changes in net earnings and other comprehensive income components as shown in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.\n\nNet earnings, a significant component of comprehensive income, consistently increased over these years. Net earnings were $\\S12,382$ million in 2018, $\\S14,239$ million in 2019, and $\\S15,769$ million in 2020 [7].

In 2018, other comprehensive income was a loss of $\\S(1,517)$ million, which turned into a gain of $\\S582$ million in 2019, and then reverted to a loss of $\\S(236)$ million in 2020 [7].  ![Other comprehensive income components over the years](image7).\n\nThe volatility in other comprehensive income was largely influenced by two key components: gross unrealized gains (losses) on investment securities and foreign currency translation losses. Gross unrealized losses on investment securities were $\\S(294)$ million in 2018, but turned into significant gains of $\\S1,212$ million in 2019 and remained high at $\\S1,058$ million in 2020 [7].

These fluctuations in unrealized gains on investments and foreign currency translation losses contributed to the changes observed in other comprehensive income and, consequently, in the overall comprehensive income.\n\nIn conclusion, UnitedHealth Group's comprehensive income increased from 2018 to 2020, primarily driven by increasing net earnings, with fluctuations in other comprehensive income components, particularly unrealized gains on investments and foreign currency translation losses, also playing a significant role."}

However, in 2021, it became a significant benefit of $1,122 million, and for 2022 expected, it is a benefit of $121 million [4].  This fluctuation is closely related to the mark-to-market losses and gains, which are included in Other income (expense) [8].\n\nIn 2019, there was a mark-to-market loss of $468 million [10], contributing to a net periodic benefit cost of $638 million. This loss was primarily due to lower discount rates at the end of 2019 compared to 2018 [10].\n\nIn 2020, the trend reversed with a mark-to-market loss of $383 million [9], again driven by lower discount rates at the end of 2020 compared to 2019 [9]. Despite this loss, the total net periodic benefit became a benefit of $239 million, suggesting other factors were at play, possibly a higher actual return on plan assets compared to the expected return [9].\n\nHowever, 2021 saw a significant net mark-to-market *gain* of $833 million [5], primarily due to higher discount rates at the end of 2021 compared to 2020 [5].

The expected increase in net periodic benefit cost (excluding mark-to-market) in 2022 is $168 million due to changes in assumptions, such as higher discount rates and lower expected return on plan assets [1].\n\nIn conclusion, the Total Net Periodic Benefit Cost (Benefit) trend from 2019 to 2022 shows significant fluctuation, shifting from a cost to a substantial benefit and then decreasing benefit. This trend is strongly correlated with mark-to-market gains and losses, which are significantly influenced by discount rates and returns on plan assets. The overall trend reflects a shift towards net periodic benefit *benefit* in 2020-2022 compared to a net periodic benefit *cost* in 2019, although the benefit is expected to decrease in 2022 compared to 2021."}

The population surged from a mere 130 residents in 1870 to 8,267 by 1880, and further climbed to its peak of 14,096 in 1890 [1]. This rapid growth is visually represented in the population data.\n\n![Hamilton County population data from 1870 to 2000.](image2)\n\nThis population explosion was fueled by national policies like the Transcontinental Railroad Act and the Homestead Act of 1862 [5]. The Homestead Act, in particular, attracted pioneers by offering 160 acres of land to those who settled and cultivated it, initiating a \"great tide of emigration for the west and especially Nebraska\" [5]. The railroad also played a crucial role in transforming Nebraska into an agricultural powerhouse [5]. This era of rapid settlement led to the establishment of numerous rural school districts across Hamilton County to accommodate the growing population [1], reflecting the decentralized nature of settlement at the time.\n\nAs settlers moved into Nebraska, Hamilton County became a melting pot of diverse ethnic groups, including those from Missouri, Iowa, and European countries such as Germany, Sweden, and Denmark [2]. These groups often formed distinct geographical clusters within the county, contributing to a rich cultural landscape [2, 7].\n\n![Map of Hamilton County, Nebraska, showing towns and roads.](image3)\n\nHowever, after reaching its peak in 1890, Hamilton County's population began a slow decline [1].  While agriculture remained central to the economy, advancements in mechanization and increased operational costs led to farm consolidation [6].  This meant fewer, larger farms replaced many smaller ones, impacting rural life and likely contributing to population shifts away from rural areas.\n\n![A grain elevator in Giltner, Nebraska, representing agricultural infrastructure.](image1)\n\nDespite the overall population decline from its 1890 peak, some towns in Hamilton County, like Aurora, have shown recent population gains, suggesting a shift in population concentration towards certain urban centers even as rural areas face challenges due to farm consolidation [8].\n\nIn conclusion, Hamilton County's population trend from 1870 to 2000 shows an initial explosion due to westward expansion and agricultural opportunities, followed by a gradual decline after its peak as agricultural practices evolved and rural areas experienced shifts due to farm consolidation."}

For higher-resource languages, pre-training consistently yields moderate gains in BLEU scores, approximately 3 points for various language pairs [2]. In contrast, the effect is more pronounced for extremely low-resource languages, where gains can be either minimal or substantial. For instance, Galician to English (GL$\\to$EN) translation experiences a significant increase of up to 11 BLEU points, suggesting that pre-trained word embeddings are particularly beneficial for bootstrapping translation models in low-resource scenarios [2].\n\n```markdown\n![BLEU score improvements with pre-training for different language pairs, showing substantial gains for GL-EN.](image3)\n```\n*BLEU score improvements with pre-training for different language pairs, showing substantial gains for GL-EN.*\n\nAs illustrated in the table, the GL$\\to$EN language pair shows a dramatic increase in BLEU score from 2.2 to 13.2 when pre-training is applied, while higher-resource pairs like Portuguese to English (PT$\\to$EN) also benefit, albeit to a lesser extent, improving from 26.2 to 30.3 [image3]. This is further supported by qualitative analysis showing that pre-training aids in capturing rarer vocabulary and generating grammatically improved sentences, particularly in low-resource settings [1].  As shown in the example, the pre-trained system successfully translates named entities and multi-word phrases, indicating enhanced representation of less frequent concepts [1].\n\n```markdown\n![Example of improved translation quality with pre-training, correctly translating names and multi-word phrases.](image8)\n```\n*Example of improved translation quality with pre-training, correctly translating names and multi-word phrases.*\n\nFurthermore, the similarity between source and target languages plays a role in the efficacy of pre-training. When pre-trained embeddings are applied in multilingual translation, the gains tend to align with language similarity [10]. Pairs with higher similarity, such as GL/PT, exhibit larger improvements, while pairs with lower similarity, like BE/RU, show smaller gains or even decreases without embedding alignment [10]. However, aligning embedding spaces between source and target languages can enhance BLEU scores across tasks, suggesting that bringing embedding spaces closer improves translation quality, especially in multilingual systems [10].\n\nPre-training boosts BLEU scores for various language pairs, especially low-resource languages and when embedding spaces are aligned."}

The pipeline consists of several key components working in synergy to achieve this goal.\n\nFirstly, the **Multimodal Retriever** acts as the initial stage for fetching relevant information. This component is crucial for querying a large external memory or database to locate information pertinent to the input query [9].  As illustrated in the diagram, the Multimodal Retriever module comprises several sub-components:\n\n![The Multimodal Retriever module creates and stores multimodal embeddings, optimizing retrieval speed using index construction techniques.](image1)\n\nThe Multimodal Retriever utilizes an **Image Encoder** to process input images and generate image embeddings. These embeddings are then used to query the **Database Image Feature Embeddings**, which is efficiently indexed by the **Feature Index** for quick retrieval.  The indexed embeddings and associated labels are stored in the **Memory M**, which serves as the external knowledge base [9]. Retrieval from memory can be performed using **Image-Image k-NN** or **Image-Text k-NN** methods, depending on the query type, to find the top-k most similar items [11].\n\nFollowing the retrieval phase, the **Retrieving & Ranking** pipeline comes into play. This stage integrates the retrieved information with the MLLM to refine the initial retrieval results and make a final prediction.\n\n![The Retrieving & Ranking pipeline integrates retrieved category labels with image embeddings and uses MLLMs for ranking to achieve accurate classification.](image1)\n\nIn this pipeline, an input image is again processed by the **Image Encoder** to produce embeddings. These embeddings, along with the **Retrieved Top-K Categories** from the Multimodal Retriever, are then fed into the **MLLM**.  The MLLM's role is to **rank** these retrieved categories, leveraging both its internal knowledge and the context provided by the retrieved information to make a more accurate and contextually aware prediction [2, 5].\n\nFor object detection tasks, the RAR pipeline incorporates **pre-processing steps** to better focus the MLLM's attention on the objects of interest.\n\n![Pre-processing steps for object detection datasets include cropping image regions based on proposal bounding boxes and blurring non-target areas to focus MLLM's attention on relevant objects.](image3)\n\nAs shown, pre-processing involves **cropping** image regions based on bounding box coordinates and applying a **blurring** technique to non-target areas. This strategy helps to direct the MLLMs’ focus toward the relevant objects, thereby improving their identification in object detection tasks [4].\n\nIn summary, the RAR pipeline for multimodal retrieval is composed of a Multimodal Retriever for efficient information retrieval from external memory and a Retrieving & Ranking pipeline that uses MLLMs to refine retrieved results, enhanced with pre-processing techniques for object detection tasks, to improve perception tasks."}

This approach is particularly useful for enhancing the quality of open-ended text generation, such as improving narrative quality or refining dialogue responses [5]. Post-hoc correction with external feedback leverages resources beyond the model itself to evaluate and improve outputs.\n\nFor instance, external knowledge can be used to ensure the factual accuracy of the output. Models like RARR, REFEED, and FACTOOL use external retrievers to search for relevant evidence, which is then used to refine the outputs [2].  This process is visually represented in ![Post-hoc Correction with External Feedback involves a Language Model, Critic Model, Refine Model, and external resources to improve output quality.](image3). The image depicts a Language Model generating outputs, which are then evaluated by a Critic Model. This Critic Model utilizes \"External Models/Tools\" such as knowledge bases, trained models, code interpreters, search engines, and other tools to provide feedback. This feedback is then used by a Refine Model to improve the initial outputs.\n\nFurthermore, post-hoc correction permits diverse natural language feedback, ranging from specific diagnostic reports to broader writing suggestions [9]. This allows for a more transparent and explainable self-correction process [6]. The use of external feedback, as opposed to relying solely on the language model itself, is often necessary to achieve superior performance and better align language models [12].\n\nIn summary, 'Post-hoc Correction with External Feedback' enhances output refinement by incorporating external resources like knowledge bases and tools to provide comprehensive feedback, leading to improved factual accuracy and overall quality of the generated text."}

Then, it proceeds to the children of these selected nodes in the subsequent layer, again selecting the top-k most relevant nodes from this pool. This process continues until the leaf nodes are reached, and the text from all selected nodes is combined to form the retrieved context [8].

In contrast, **Collapsed Tree Retrieval** simplifies the search by considering all nodes in the tree simultaneously, as shown in **Figure 3B** [10].  This approach flattens the multi-layered tree into a single layer, enabling the method to compare all nodes at once to find the most relevant information [10].\n\n![Collapsed tree retrieval generally performs better than tree traversal, offering more flexibility in node selection.](image4)\n\nThe collapsed tree approach is considered superior due to its flexibility in searching across all nodes simultaneously, allowing it to retrieve information at the most appropriate level of granularity for a given question [3].

Thus, while tree traversal methodically navigates the hierarchy, collapsed tree offers a more direct, comprehensive search across all levels of abstraction within the RAPTOR tree.\n\nIn summary, Tree Traversal Retrieval methodically navigates the tree layer by layer, while Collapsed Tree Retrieval conducts a simultaneous search across all nodes."}

In settings with distractors, single-paragraph BERT achieves a higher F1 score compared to open-domain settings, indicating that the presence and nature of distractors play a crucial role in model performance [7]. For instance, in the distractor setting of HOTPOT QA, a single-paragraph BERT model achieves 67.08 F1, which is comparable to state-of-the-art multi-hop models [7].\n\n![Single-paragraph BERT achieves varying F1 scores across different settings, with the highest score in the distractor setting and a significant increase when gold paragraphs are added in the open-domain setting.](image4)\n\nHowever, in open-domain question answering, where models must retrieve relevant paragraphs from a large corpus, the F1 score decreases.  As shown in Table 5, the F1 score of single-paragraph BERT is 39.12 when given 500 retrieved paragraphs, but it increases to 53.12 when additional gold paragraphs are provided [5]. This highlights the importance of retrieving the correct gold paragraphs for achieving higher accuracy [5]. The failure of TF-IDF retrieval to find gold paragraphs for multi-hop questions contributes to this performance drop [1].\n\n![F1 scores of single-paragraph BERT in distractor and open settings, and the impact of adversarial and type distractors on model accuracy.](image2)\n\nFurthermore, the type and quality of distractors are also critical. When adversarial distractors or type-matched distractors are used, the accuracy of the model can decline [3], [8].  For example, the accuracy decreases from 67.08 F1 to 46.84 F1 with adversarial distractors [2]. However, if the model is re-trained on these new distractors, it can recover some of its accuracy [2], [3], [8].  Despite using even 500 distractors, performance may still be limited, suggesting that simply increasing the number of distractors is not sufficient; the distractors' relevance and difficulty in inducing multi-hop reasoning are important factors [11].\n\n![Comparison of Distractor F1 and Open F1 scores across different models, showing a consistent performance gap between the two settings.](image7)\n\nUltimately, the difficulty in retrieving gold paragraphs and the nature of distractor paragraphs significantly affect the F1 scores and overall performance of multi-hop question answering models, indicating that better retrieval methods and more challenging distractor sets are needed to truly evaluate and advance multi-hop reasoning capabilities. The inclusion of gold paragraphs boosts performance by ensuring relevant evidence is available, while the strategic selection of distractors can make the task more challenging and reflective of true multi-hop reasoning requirements."}

For instance, on PathMNIST, Organ AM NIST, and BloodMNIST, the 'Hard-to-contrast' strategy significantly outperforms random selection by querying only a small fraction (0.1%) of the entire dataset [11]. Figure 5 also visually confirms that 'Hard-to-contrast' data (red lines) leads to better performance in every cycle on Organ aM NIST compared to other initial queries [4].\n\n![Hard-to-contrast data outperforms other initial queries in every cycle of active learning on Organ aM NIST](image3)\n\nThis consistent outperformance is not just limited to later stages of learning; the performance achieved in the initial cycle with a small number of labeled images (e.g., 20 images) is strongly correlated with the performance in the final cycle (e.g., 50 images) [1, 2, 4].  This strong positive correlation (r=0.79 - 0.92 across different strategies) suggests that a superior initial query, like 'Hard-to-Contrast', sets the stage for more effective and efficient subsequent learning [2, 5].  The 'Hard-to-Contrast' strategy is effective because it selects \"typical data\" and reduces outliers, leveraging contrastive learning to identify data that is hard to discriminate from others [8]. This approach contrasts with other active learning strategies that may suffer from biased queries or rely on a trained classifier, which is not available at the beginning of active learning [8, 10].\n\n![Performance comparison of map-based querying strategies where hard-to-contrast shows higher AUC](image4)\n\nIn conclusion, the 'Hard-to-Contrast' querying strategy consistently achieves higher AUC compared to other strategies across different numbers of labeled images, highlighting its crucial role in selecting effective initial queries for active learning and mitigating the cold start problem."}

Initially, in the **Problem Formulation** stage, a Large Language Model (LLM) is employed to translate a natural language problem into a symbolic language representation [2, 12]. This involves identifying key entities, facts, and rules from the problem statement and converting them into a task-specific symbolic language [12].\n\nFor example, as depicted in Image 5, for a natural language problem about electrical conductivity, the Problem Formulator module generates rules and facts in symbolic form.\n\n![The Problem Formulator module in LOGIC-LM translates natural language problems into symbolic representations, as exemplified by the conductivity problem.](image5)\n\nFollowing problem formulation, the **Symbolic Reasoning** stage takes over [12]. Here, a deterministic symbolic solver, like a logic programming engine, is used to perform inference on the symbolic formulation obtained in the previous stage [2]. Different types of symbolic solvers can be used depending on the nature of the logical reasoning problem, such as Logic Programming, First-order Logic Prover, or Constraint Optimization, as shown in Image 5.\n\nFor instance, Image 6 shows that for deductive reasoning problems, a Logic Programming (LP) formulation can be used with a Pyke solver, while for first-order logic problems, a First-Order Logic (FOL) formulation can be used with a Prover9 solver.\n\n![Examples of symbolic formulations and solvers used for different types of logical reasoning problems, including Deductive Reasoning and First-Order Logic.](image6)\n\nFinally, the **Result Interpreter** stage translates the symbolic answer back into natural language [2]. This module, which can be either LLM-based or rule-based, explains the output of the symbolic solver and maps it to a comprehensible answer in natural language [12]. As illustrated in Image 5, the Result Interpreter takes the output from the symbolic reasoner and provides the final answer in natural language, such as determining whether the statement \"Nails cannot conduct electricity\" is false.\n\nBy using symbolic language as the basic unit of reasoning, LOGIC-LM shifts the complex reasoning burden from LLMs to reliable symbolic solvers, while still leveraging the flexibility of LLMs for problem formulation [9].\n\nIn summary, the LOGIC-LM model solves a problem by first **formulating** it into a symbolic representation using an LLM, then using a deterministic symbolic solver for **reasoning**, and finally **interpreting** the symbolic result back into natural language."}

[5] highlights that D1 has \"much more neutral examples in the training set\" compared to D3 and D4, suggesting that classifiers might find it easier to learn neutral-related features in D1 even without external knowledge [10]. In contrast, learning from D3 and D4 is much harder due to the scarcity of neutral examples [5]. This unbalanced label distribution in D3 and D4, as also mentioned in [4] and [7], affects the performance, especially the macro-F1 scores [5].

On the original Argument Reasoning Comprehension Task (ARCT) dataset, BERT achieves a peak performance of $77\\%$, which is close to the untrained human baseline [1]. Table 1 in Image 3 shows BERT (Large)'s maximum test accuracy of $0.770$ and a median of $0.712$ [4, image3].  However, this high performance is attributed to BERT exploiting spurious statistical cues present in the original dataset [1, 5, 7, 10].\n\nThe probing experiments, shown in Table 3 in Image 4, reveal that BERT's performance on the original test set is heavily influenced by different input features.  Using warrants (W) alone, BERT achieves $71\\%$ accuracy, and adding reasons (R, W) or claims (C, W) only marginally improves the performance [5, 10, image4]. This indicates that BERT relies on surface-level cues rather than genuine argument comprehension.\n\nTo eliminate these spurious cues, an adversarial dataset was created [1, 12]. When evaluated on this adversarial dataset, BERT's performance drops drastically.  As shown in Table 4 in Image 5, BERT's peak performance on the adversarial test set reduces to $53\\%$, with the mean and median accuracies around $50\\%$ [9, image5]. This near-random accuracy demonstrates that BERT fails to generalize when the statistical cues are removed [9].\n\nIn conclusion, BERT's test performance is high on the original dataset due to the exploitation of spurious cues, but it dramatically decreases to near-random levels on the adversarial dataset, indicating a lack of true argument comprehension."}

Generally, OpenAI models, including GPT-4 and ChatGPT, outperform models like LLaMA across various metrics [1].  For instance, GPT-4 typically achieves the best performance, except in recall, as it tends to generate shorter, more precise answers, whereas LLaMA models often produce longer responses with more citations, leading to higher recall scores [1].\n\nWhen comparing performance on general versus specific questions, a notable trend emerges.  As text quote [3] explains, \"the same model’s answers on specific questions outperform those on general questions in almost all metrics.\" This is because specific questions provide clearer instructions to the models, guiding them to use the most relevant knowledge effectively [3].  This is further illustrated in the table below, showing the citation and text evaluation metrics for GPT-4 and ChatGPT under both general and specific question settings.\n\n![Table showing citation and text evaluation metrics for GPT-4 and ChatGPT under general and specific settings](image6)\n\nAs shown in the table `![Table comparing detailed micro and macro citation and text evaluation metrics for GPT-4 and ChatGPT under general and specific settings](image8)`, GPT-4(0.5) achieves an alignment score of 90.9 in general settings and significantly improves to 92.0 in specific settings.  Similarly, ChatGPT(0.5) shows an increase in alignment from 82.7 to 84.5 when moving from general to specific questions. The F1 score for citation evaluation also improves for both models in specific settings, with GPT-4 reaching 39.4 and ChatGPT achieving 37.2, compared to 35.6 and 32.9 respectively in general settings.  These improvements across the board indicate that more focused questions allow both models to better utilize their knowledge for citation and answer generation.\n\nHowever, it's also important to note the trade-off discussed in text quote [3]: \"The specific questions target the knowledge more explicitly in the question context, and hence cover the scope of the paragraph better. It stands for an upper bound for knowledge cover- age and a lower bound for question naturalness. The general questions implicitly target the knowledge in the question context, and there loosely cover the scope of the paragraph. It stands for an upper bound for question naturalness and a lower bound for knowledge coverage.\"  This implies that while specific questions enhance performance metrics by improving knowledge coverage, they might sacrifice the naturalness of the questions themselves.\n\nIn conclusion, both GPT-4 and ChatGPT demonstrate enhanced performance in citation and text evaluation when responding to specific questions compared to general questions, suggesting that question specificity plays a crucial role in guiding these models to produce more accurate and aligned outputs. This has implications for evaluation design, as the naturalness and specificity of questions can influence the measured performance of LLMs."}

Finer labels, especially ultra-fine types, are inherently more challenging to predict compared to coarser labels [10].  However, all sources of supervision generally contribute positively to the model's performance, with crowdsourced examples having the most significant impact, and head word supervision being particularly beneficial for predicting ultra-fine labels [10].\n\nExamining the performance breakdown in the development set across different type granularities and supervision data sources, we can see the impact of excluding each source individually.\n\n![Table showing performance on development set with different supervision data.](image3)\n\nAs shown in the table [12], removing crowdsourced data (\"- Crowd\") leads to a significant drop in F1 score for ultra-fine types, decreasing from 14.6 to 8.4. Similarly, excluding head word supervision (\"- Head\") also reduces the F1 score to 8.5.  This highlights the importance of both crowdsourced data and head word supervision for achieving higher performance in ultra-fine entity typing.  Interestingly, removing entity linking supervision (\"- EL\") results in a slight *increase* in the F1 score for ultra-fine types, improving it to 16.0 from 14.6 when all sources are used.\n\nIn conclusion, crowdsourced data and head word supervision are crucial for ultra-fine category performance, while entity linking's exclusion surprisingly leads to a slight improvement in performance for this specific category."}

This table illustrates how recruiter performance, particularly in response rates, can vary, suggesting that certified professionals, equipped with validated skills, are likely to achieve higher levels of effectiveness in engaging and managing talent.\n\n![A table shows the profiles and InMails statistics for Recruiter A and Recruiter B, with Recruiter B having a higher response rate.](image4)\n\nIn conclusion, the LinkedIn Certified Professional-Recruiter credential validates a recruiter's ability to find, engage, and manage talent by testing and confirming their comprehensive skills in utilizing LinkedIn Recruiter effectively across the entire recruitment lifecycle, leading to improved efficiency and better talent acquisition outcomes."}

However, we can infer some distinctions from the provided quotes and images.\n\nPwC Middle East operates across a significant geographical area, as indicated by the number of offices and countries it serves. For example, one image shows PwC operating in **9 countries with 12 offices and 1816 employees** ![PwC operates in 9 countries with 12 offices and 1816 employees](image1). Another image suggests an even larger scale, with **12 countries and 20 offices, and 1914 employees** ![PwC operates in 12 countries with 20 offices and 1914 employees](image3). These images indicate a broad regional presence for PwC in general.\n\nWhile the images give an overview of PwC's overall distribution, text quotes offer insights into the nature of the Consulting sector.  Consulting services are described as being delivered across various industries and functional areas [7], with a focus on providing tailored solutions to clients' strategic ambitions [1].  The Technology Consulting team, specifically, is mentioned as **\"shaping the Digital and IT market in the GCC\"** [12], suggesting a regional focus within the Gulf Cooperation Council countries for this part of the Consulting sector.\n\nOn the other hand, the text quotes describing services that might fall under Assurance, such as internal audit and financial advisory, highlight work across diverse sectors including government, public sector, private sector, and family businesses [4, 8].  PwC Legal, which could be related to both Assurance and Consulting through regulatory and compliance aspects, is noted as having a vast global network, being **\"the largest legal network in the world with over 4000 lawyers in over 100 countries\"** [10]. This implies a potentially broader geographical reach for legal services, which could support both Assurance and Consulting engagements.\n\nTo visually differentiate between Assurance and Consulting, we can see that they are presented as distinct service lines within PwC ![PwC Service Lines: Assurance, Consulting, Deals, Tax and Legal Services](image7), alongside Deals and Tax and Legal Services. This segmentation suggests that while both sectors contribute to PwC's overall geographical and personnel distribution, they likely have different focuses and possibly varying scales of operation within the Middle East region depending on client needs and service demands.\n\nIn conclusion, while specific numerical breakdowns for Assurance and Consulting sectors' geographical and personnel distribution are not provided, the evidence suggests that both sectors contribute to PwC Middle East's wide regional presence, with Consulting showing a clear focus on the GCC market, and Assurance and related legal services potentially leveraging a broader global network to serve diverse client needs across various sectors."}

'Needs Exploration' and 'Elicitation Methods' are two such strategies, each playing a distinct but complementary role in gathering and managing stakeholder requirements.\n\n'Needs Exploration' is positioned within the 'Inception' phase of DAD, focused on broadly understanding the initial scope and direction of the project.  As visualized in ![Needs Exploration is part of the Inception phase in Disciplined Agile Delivery](image6), 'Explore initial scope' is a key activity during inception. This phase employs strategies to define high-level requirements and ensure active stakeholder participation from the outset, as shown in ![Needs Exploration includes active stakeholder participation and high-level requirements specification](image2).  The goal here is to establish a foundational understanding of stakeholder needs before moving into detailed development.\n\n'Elicitation Methods', in contrast, are more focused on the ongoing and iterative process of gathering and refining requirements, particularly during the 'Construction' phase and as stakeholder needs evolve.  As highlighted in ![Elicitation Methods are used to address changing stakeholder needs through techniques like JIT model storming and demos](image4), 'Address Changing Stakeholder Needs' is a key objective during construction.  'Elicitation Methods' provide a toolkit of techniques like 'Just-in-time (JIT) model storming', 'Look-ahead modeling', and 'demos' to actively engage stakeholders and uncover detailed requirements throughout the development process [Image4].  These methods are designed to be flexible and adaptable, allowing for continuous feedback and adjustments based on stakeholder input.\n\nBoth 'Needs Exploration' and 'Elicitation Methods' are essential for effectively addressing stakeholder requirements in agile management. 'Needs Exploration' sets the stage by establishing initial understanding and broad scope, while 'Elicitation Methods' provide the continuous mechanisms to delve deeper, refine, and adapt to evolving stakeholder needs throughout the project.  This iterative approach ensures that the final product remains aligned with stakeholder expectations and delivers value, reflecting the 'solution focused' and 'people-first' nature of DAD [3].\n\nIn essence, 'Needs Exploration' initiates the journey of understanding stakeholder needs, while 'Elicitation Methods' guide the ongoing exploration and refinement of these needs throughout the agile development process. They both contribute to answering the question of \"How does agile analysis work?\" [9, Image5] by providing structured and iterative ways to engage with stakeholders and translate their needs into actionable development steps.\n\nIn conclusion, 'Needs Exploration' and 'Elicitation Methods' are complementary strategies; 'Needs Exploration' broadly defines initial stakeholder needs, while 'Elicitation Methods' provide ongoing, iterative techniques to refine and adapt to stakeholder needs throughout the agile project."}

This implies that valid markup is crucial for SEO. Image7, titled \"Structured Markup,\" reveals a table detailing structured markup data types and errors.  ![Structured markup errors are present in blog and article data types.](image7)  Notably, for \"Blog\" and \"Article\" data types using `schema.org` markup, there are a substantial number of \"Items with Errors\" (72,441 and 49,222 respectively).  These errors in structured markup can prevent search engines from properly understanding and indexing the content, potentially leading to reduced visibility in search results.\n\nSecondly, meta description issues also play a critical role. Image3 provides insights into \"Meta description\" problems.  ![Duplicate meta descriptions are a significant issue.](image3)  As depicted, \"Duplicate meta descriptions\" are prevalent, with 2,215 pages affected.  Additionally, there are \"Short meta descriptions\" (1,450 pages) and \"Missing title tags\" (10 pages) and \"Duplicate title tags\" (621 pages). These meta description and title tag issues can negatively impact click-through rates (CTR) from search engine results pages (SERPs). If meta descriptions are duplicate, missing, or poorly written, they fail to entice users to click on the link, even if the page ranks well.\n\nIn conclusion, both structured markup errors and meta description issues can negatively impact SEO performance by hindering search engine understanding and reducing user engagement, respectively."}

Gestalt psychology itself is about understanding how we acquire and maintain meaningful perceptions [6], focusing on the idea of conciseness and global regularity in perception [4].\n\nOne key principle is **Closure**, where our minds perceive incomplete objects as whole.  As text quote [11] states, \"We tend to perceive objects such as shapes, letters, pictures, etc., as being whole when they are not complete. Specifically, when parts of a whole picture are missing, our perception fills in the visual gap.\" This is exemplified in the design of the letter 'G' in \"GESTALT,\" as seen in the image where the 'G' appears to be formed even with missing parts. ![The letter 'G' in \"GESTALT\" utilizes closure principle by appearing whole despite missing parts.](image2)  Similarly, we can observe the closure principle in basic shapes where even with gaps, we perceive complete forms. ![Incomplete circle and rectangle shapes that are perceived as whole due to closure.](image1)\n\nAnother principle is **Proximity**, which suggests that elements close together are seen as belonging to a group [1]. In the \"GESTALT\" design, the elements within each letter are positioned closely to form a distinct shape, separating them from other letters.  For example, the components of the '$' symbol in \"GESTALT\" are grouped together due to proximity. ![The '$' symbol in \"GESTALT\" demonstrates proximity by grouping close elements.](image2)  This principle is also evident when we see groups of dots arranged closely, and we naturally perceive them as clusters. ![Circles grouped into columns and rows due to proximity.](image6)\n\n**Continuity** is also at play, where elements are grouped based on their alignment [3].  The design of the '$' in \"GESTALT\" also demonstrates continuity, as the curved lines are perceived as continuous even when they are slightly broken. ![The '$' symbol in \"GESTALT\" showcases continuity through its curved line elements.](image2)\n\nFinally, **Similarity** helps in grouping objects that share similar visual attributes like shape and color [10].  In \"GESTALT,\" while not explicitly about color in this design, similar visual components are used to construct each letter, contributing to the overall unity of the word.  For instance, the similar diagonal lines in the letters 'T', 'A', and 'L' contribute to a visual similarity within the word. ![The letters 'T', 'A', and 'L' in \"GESTALT\" exhibit similarity through their diagonal line components.](image2)  We can also see how similar shapes are grouped together based on color. ![Circles of the same color are grouped together based on similarity.](image7)\n\nThese Gestalt principles in combination allow for immediate and meaningful perception of the word \"GESTALT\" as a unified shape or form, perfectly embodying the German meaning of \"Gestalt\" as \"shape, form\" [7].\n\nThe design of the word 'GESTALT' effectively uses Gestalt principles like Closure, Proximity, Continuity, and Similarity to create a unified and easily perceivable visual form."}

As text quote [1] mentions, navigational search may mask the impact of other advertising media because of last-click attribution.  This means that if a customer ultimately converts after clicking a paid search ad, the paid search gets all the credit, even if other marketing efforts earlier in the customer journey played a significant role [5].  In fact,  $71\\%$ of paid search clicks are navigational, suggesting that a large portion of paid search conversions are from people already looking for the brand, potentially due to prior exposure to other forms of marketing [5].  This leads to a situation where other impactful marketing channels, such as banner ads which may have initially exposed the customer to the brand, receive no attribution at all [5].

The ECU controls the opening of injectors to manage this fuel delivery [3, 7].\n\n![ECU as part of a control system within the fuel system](image2)\n\nThe ECU also optimizes engine performance and economy by adjusting the ignition timing, which is the precise moment a spark is initiated in the combustion chamber [5]. Furthermore, the ECU manages the engine's idle speed, utilizing the crankshaft position sensor to monitor RPM and employing a programmable throttle stop or idle air bypass control motor to maintain stable idling [6]. Each block in these diagrams represents a component of the system [10].\n\n![Physical representation of an ECU circuit board](image3)\n\nIn essence, the Engine Control Unit (ECU) functions as the brain of the engine management system, monitoring sensor data and controlling fuel injection, ignition timing, and idle speed to ensure optimal engine operation."}

While enjoyment may decrease in standard consumption [2], focused practice in a competitive setting can lead to increased utility through improved skill and outcome [11].  This is illustrated in image1, where despite the general diminishing marginal utility, there's a significant spike in utility at hot dog 64, the point where Joey Chestnut ties Kobayashi in a competition, showcasing a \"differential outcome.\" ![The image shows a table contrasting diminishing marginal utility with a differential outcome in hot dog consumption, highlighting a massive utility spike at hot dog 64 when Joey Chestnut ties Kobayashi in a competition, alongside a picture of Joey Chestnut holding many hotdogs.](image1)  This suggests that in competition, focus and cumulative experience can override typical diminishing returns.
