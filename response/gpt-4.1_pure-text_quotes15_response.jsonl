For Trump supporters, \"happy\" was the sentiment most frequently expressed, with \"surprised\" also being prominent, clearly demonstrating a combination of satisfaction and unexpectedness in the result. In contrast, Clinton voters most commonly described themselves as \"shocked\" and \"disappointed,\" with surprise and disbelief also frequently mentioned [7][8]. This contrast is further highlighted in the breakdown of emotional responses, where positive emotions were far more prevalent among Trump voters, while negative emotions like shock and disappointment dominated for Clinton supporters.\n\n![Trump voters feel mostly happy or surprised, while Clinton voters are mostly shocked or disappointed.](image3)\n\nThe sense of surprise at the election outcome was shared by both groups. An overwhelming 87% of Clinton voters reported being surprised by Trump’s win, and even among Trump supporters, a notable 60% said they were surprised, although 40% were not. Among all voters, 73% experienced surprise, underscoring just how unexpected Trump’s victory was for most Americans.\n\n![The majority of voters, including Trump and Clinton supporters, were surprised by the election results.](image2)\n\nFrom an emotional perspective, broad feelings of unease (53%), sadness (41%), and fear (41%) were reported, but about half of voters (51%) also expressed hopefulness. This combination suggests a nation feeling both anxious and tentatively optimistic after such an unforeseen outcome.\n\n![Voters felt a mix of unease, hope, sadness, and fear after Trump’s victory.](image1)\n\nThese findings indicate that while both Trump and Clinton voters were surprised by the results, their emotional reactions reflected sharply different perspectives: Trump voters combined happiness with shock, whereas Clinton voters experienced mostly negative emotions such as shock and disappointment. This shared sense of surprise reveals that expectations of a Trump victory were generally low across the electorate, even among his own supporters.\n\nIn summary, Trump and Clinton voters had starkly different emotional reactions—Trump voters felt mostly happy yet surprised, while Clinton voters felt shocked and disappointed—showing that most voters, regardless of candidate preference, did not expect Trump to win the presidency."}

Initially, there was a stronger concern that anti-terrorism policies went too far in restricting civil liberties, especially after Edward Snowden’s revelations in 2013, when 47% felt such policies were excessive in this regard compared to 35% who believed the government had not gone far enough to protect the country[8]. However, by 2015, the majority view had flipped, with 56% more worried that anti-terror policies had not gone far enough, and only 28% believing they had been too restrictive, an increase in concern about insufficient protection since early 2015[10]. This evolution can be clearly seen in the trends over time, where public opinion crosses over from prioritizing civil liberties to prioritizing protection.\n\n![By 2015, a majority believe anti-terror policies have not gone far enough, with concern about civil liberties declining since 2013.](image3)\n\nPolitical affiliation plays a major role in shaping these perceptions. Republicans, in particular, have exhibited a pronounced increase in concern that anti-terrorism policies do not go far enough. In July 2013, only 38% of Republicans were concerned policies hadn't gone far enough, rising to 57% in January 2015 and reaching 71% by later that year. This increase is much sharper than among Democrats or Independents, though all groups have seen a rise in such concerns[4]. In 2015, 71% of Republicans, 74% of moderate/liberal Republicans, and 67% of conservative/moderate Democrats expressed this view, while liberal Democrats were divided, with only 41% prioritizing tougher anti-terror efforts and an equal share worried about civil liberties[1]. This partisan difference is visualized through the widening gap in the graph across political affiliations, with Republicans leading the rise in concern for stronger anti-terrorism policies.\n\n![The Republican line rises sharply, showing a substantial spike in concern inadequate anti-terror efforts among Republicans between 2013 and 2015.](image1)\n\nAge also factors significantly into these attitudes. Older Americans are notably more likely to say the government’s anti-terror policies haven't gone far enough compared to younger adults. For example, among those aged 65 and older, 71% feel policies have not gone far enough, while only 15% believe civil liberties are being overly restricted. By contrast, among those 18–29, 44% think policies have not gone far enough, but 43% still worry more about protection of civil liberties, showing a much narrower gap and greater concern for civil liberties among youth.\n\n![Older Americans most likely say anti-terror policies haven’t gone far enough, while younger adults are more split, with many still concerned about civil liberties.](image2)\n\nIn summary: Public concern has shifted from restricting civil liberties to desiring stronger anti-terror policies, with Republicans and older individuals most likely to say government efforts do not go far enough, while younger adults and liberal Democrats are more evenly divided."}

For example, 53% of adults aged 18-29 rate the government’s performance positively, compared to just 42% of those 50 and older[10]. Educational attainment also interacts with age, with those who have postgraduate degrees giving the highest positive ratings (58%), while those with less education are more critical[9].\n\nPolitical affiliation strikingly shapes these perceptions. Democrats are consistently more positive about government anti-terrorism efforts. As recent survey data shows, 64% of Democrats say the government is doing fairly well—substantially higher than among Independents (44%) or Republicans (27%), the latter showing a dramatic loss of confidence since earlier in the year[7]. Trends over the past decade reveal that partisan divides have widened, with Republicans’ and Independents’ approval dropping significantly, while Democratic approval has remained relatively steady. This is clearly illustrated by the historical patterns of presidential approval segmented by party, which shows Democrats consistently supporting Obama at high rates and Republicans showing steep declines under both Bush and Obama as political alignment shifted through the presidencies. ![Presidential approval ratings by political affiliation over time reveal resilient Democratic support and sharp declines among Republicans and Independents, especially during shifts in administration.](image1)\n\nShifts over time also affect public attitudes about the nature and effectiveness of government actions. Following national security scandals and evolving foreign threats, concern over government restrictions on civil liberties has sharply receded compared to earlier years. Initially, more Americans worried about overly broad curbs on civil liberties, but by 2015, a clear majority (56%) felt the government had not done enough to protect the country, and only 28% remained primarily worried about civil liberties[5][8]. This general trend is mirrored in public opinion data, which illustrates how concern for protection has gradually taken precedence over protecting civil liberties, with the two perspectives intersecting around 2010-2011 and diverging significantly afterward. ![Long-term trends show increasing concern about government not doing enough for security, overtaking civil liberties worries by 2015.](image5)\n\nAge-related data in detailed tables reinforce these themes: young adults are most concerned about civil liberties (43% of those aged 18-29, compared to 15% of those 65+), while older adults are increasingly focused on the need for more government action on security, with 71% of those 65 and over expressing this view. ![Older adults prioritize national protection much more highly than younger adults, who worry more about civil liberties.](image2)\n\nIn sum, older Americans and conservatives are more skeptical of government terrorism efforts and are more likely to demand stronger action, while younger people are less critical and more sensitive to civil liberties. Over time, the general public has shifted toward preferring stronger government measures at the expense of civil liberties, with partisanship driving sharp divides in overall perception and approval.\n\nTo directly answer: Age and political ideology both significantly shape views on government anti-terrorism efforts—older adults and conservatives are more critical and security-focused, while younger adults and liberals are more concerned with civil liberties; over time, concern about not doing enough for security has grown, especially among Republicans and older Americans."}

Adults under 30 were almost evenly divided: 43% worried that policies went too far in restricting civil liberties and 44% felt they had not gone far enough to protect the country. However, as age increased, concern shifted strongly toward believing policies had not gone far enough. For example, among those 65 and older, only 15% worried about civil liberties being overly restricted, while a significant 71% felt anti-terror policies had not gone far enough to safeguard the country[10]. The data from these two questions are well illustrated in the following tables:\n\n![Older Americans are less satisfied with government performance and more likely to want tougher anti-terror policies.](image4)\n\nLooking at the distribution of concern over civil liberties versus national protection by age group, there is a clear trend: the older the age group, the more likely they are to prioritize increased security over civil liberty considerations. While those under 30 are split, by age 65 and above the preference for stronger protection (and less concern over civil liberty restrictions) is overwhelming.\n\n![Older age groups are much more likely than younger ones to say anti-terror policies have not gone far enough, while younger adults are more divided between security and civil liberties.](image5)\n\nIn summary, older age groups are both more critical of the government’s anti-terror performance and far more likely to support stronger anti-terror measures over concerns about civil liberties, while younger adults are more evenly divided between the two views."}

This split is clearly visualized in the data, where partisan gaps for U.S. evaluations reach 44 points between Democrats/Lean Democrat (27% positive) and Republicans/Lean Republican (71% positive), making it by far the largest partisan difference compared to any other nation in the survey![The U.S. response to COVID-19 is rated much more favorably by Republicans than Democrats, showing a strong partisan gap.](image2).

Age also slightly affects these perceptions, with older Americans particularly critical of China's performance[7]. Most Americans across all groups believe China has not dealt with the pandemic well, regardless of education[4].\n\nEducational background significantly influences assessments of how the U.S. handled the outbreak, but barely affects views on China. Two-thirds of Americans with postgraduate degrees, and about six-in-ten college graduates, say the United States has done a poor job, much higher than the 43% of those with a high school degree or less who share this view[2]. The impact of education emerges in the demographic breakdown![Higher education correlates with more critical views of the U.S. COVID-19 response, while views on China are negative across all education levels.](image3). These data show a clear trend: as education level increases, so does criticism of the U.S. handling of the pandemic, but for China, education does not produce much variation, as majorities across all levels remain critical[4][3].\n\nIn summary, Americans' perceptions of their own and China’s pandemic responses are shaped primarily by political affiliation—more sharply so for the U.S.—with higher education correlating to harsher judgments of the U.S. but not affecting views on China."}

This indicates that those on the left generally see greater value in learning from foreign responses, while those on the right are more skeptical.\n\nIn terms of trust in international organizations like the WHO and EU, a pronounced partisan divide emerges as well.

Conversely, when considering China, Republicans are markedly more likely to believe Chinese influence will wane post-pandemic, whereas fewer Democrats expect such a decrease[1], and Democrats overall are less negative about China’s prospects. This divide can be seen in the contrasting responses, where 63% of Republicans (and 70% of conservative Republicans) believe China’s influence will lessen, while only 40% of Democrats share that expectation; liberal Democrats are the least likely to predict a drop in Chinese influence[1][5].  \n![The bar chart depicts that 63% of Republicans and 40% of Democrats believe China's influence will decline post-pandemic, with strong divides also visible by age and among liberal/moderate Dems.](image5)\n\nEducation level also plays a striking role.

This decline is linked to shifting personal experiences, childhood environments, and varying connection to Hispanic culture across generations[2].\n\nA primary reason many do not identify as Hispanic is a mixed or distant ancestry, followed by upbringing without contact with Hispanic relatives, lack of Spanish language skills or cultural links, racial self-identification, and strong identification as American due to U.S. birth[10].\n\n![The leading reasons for not identifying as Hispanic are distant ancestry, upbringing, lack of Spanish, racial self-identity, and being American.](image2)\n\nImportantly, cultural traits such as speaking Spanish or having a Spanish last name are largely not seen as requirements for Hispanic identity.

Over time, factors like ancestry and language diminish in importance, while identification as American becomes more prevalent.\n\nIn summary: Generational distance, mixed ancestry, cultural contact, language proficiency, and integration into American society all influence whether U.S. Hispanics self-identify as Hispanic, with American identification and cultural assimilation becoming more influential in later generations."}

Meanwhile, both males (75%) and females (77%) predominantly use traditional radio sets for listening![Urban listeners favor mobile phones for radio, while rural and female listeners use traditional radios more.](image3)\n\nListening frequency also varies. 46% of all respondents never listened to the radio in the past six months, but daily listening is slightly higher in urban areas (28%) than rural (27.4%). Males are far more regular listeners than females—34.3% of men listen every day, compared to only 20% of women. Conversely, more than half of women (55.7%) never listen to radio, compared to just 37.1% of men, indicating a substantial gender divide in radio engagement that mirrors the disparities in device ownership and access![Males are more frequent radio listeners, while more than half of females never listen to radio.](image4)\n\nIn summary, access to technology is much higher within households—especially for mobile phones, radios, and televisions—than it is outside the home. These patterns, along with urban/rural and gender divides in ownership, directly affect how and how often people listen to radio. Urban dwellers and men have greater access to both traditional sets and mobile phones for radio, and they listen more frequently compared to their rural and female counterparts."}

First, as more subscribers use data-based services like IM and VoIP, traditional SMS and voice calls have become less popular, leading to reduced ARPU in those segments [1][9]. The drop in ARPU is also due to a broader reduction in tariffs initiated by intense competition and regulatory pressures [2][3]. It's expected that while Voice and SMS ARPU will keep decreasing, Data ARPU—after an initial decline—will rise again as mobile internet use and bigger data plans become more prevalent [7]. This marks a transition period where increasing smartphone and data user penetration compensates for declines in traditional services, as highlighted by Telkomsel's growing share of smartphone and data users.\n\nIn summary, from 2013 to 2014, Telkomsel's subscriber base increased while its ARPU continued to decline, mainly due to the shift from voice/SMS to data usage, competitive pricing, and evolving user habits toward mobile internet and messaging apps."}

The ARPU for both voice and SMS services demonstrated a steady decline during this period, while Mobile Data ARPU, after an initial drop, was projected to increase as users' consumption of mobile internet grew.

First, as users shifted to smartphones, their usage moved away from traditional SMS and voice calls to data-driven services like instant messaging and VoIP apps, further reducing ARPU derived from voice and SMS[4][5]. This, coupled with a price war among operators, contributed to reduced ARPU across the board, though tariffs had already hit rock-bottom, signaling an end to ongoing price reductions[9][10]. However, as data consumption increased, users began enrolling for larger data plans, compensating for lower ARPU from other services and leading to a projected uptick in Data ARPU[2].\n\n![Line graph showing voice and SMS ARPU steadily declining while data ARPU decreases initially but recovers and rises towards 2017, signifying rapid changes in usage patterns due to smartphones.](image2)\n\nIn summary, between 2013 and 2014, Telkomsel and XL experienced a sharp increase in the number of smartphone users, while voice and SMS ARPU continued to decline, and data ARPU began to show signs of recovery—largely influenced by the shift to smartphone-based, data-centric usage."}

This pattern is not unique to only OrganAMNIST; for PathMNIST, VAAL heavily sampled the muscle class and overlooked classes like mucus and mucosa, resulting in the lowest entropy among compared strategies, indicating the least diverse selection![VAAL selects mostly the muscle class, ignoring mucus and mucosa, resulting in lowest entropy (worst diversity)](image5).\n\nQuantitative results across multiple datasets reinforce that these traditional uncertainty-driven strategies (e.g., Entropy, Margin, VAAL) tend to be strongly biased, especially in scenarios with imbalanced data distributions, such as medical imaging or long-tailed benchmarks. The absence of certain classes in their queries at both low and even higher labeling budgets further exacerbates the problem, and their class coverage is eclipsed by more diversity-aware methods[6][8].

The encoding, along with the embedding of the previous system action, is then passed to a dialogue-level LSTM, which maintains the state of the dialogue throughout the interaction.\n\nThis updated dialogue state is used for state tracking, where the system estimates the user's current goals in the form of slot-value pairs, such as identifying the desired \"date\" and \"time\" for a movie.

An analysis using both experiment results and retrieval analysis provides a comprehensive view.\n\nAs knowledge elements are intentionally removed, precision and F1-Score notably increase, while recall remains relatively stable. This pattern is evident from the experimental results depicted in the line graph on \"Conscious Incompetence\", where removing more knowledge leads to a marked rise in precision (from around 14 to 26) and a moderate increase in F1-Score, whereas recall hovers just below 15 throughout the process. This suggests the model becomes increasingly adept at correctly identifying the absence of knowledge when prompted to do so and is less likely to incorrectly cite non-existent or missing information. However, its ability to retrieve all necessary information remains steady and limited.\n\n![With more knowledge removed, precision rises sharply, F1 moderately, while recall stays stable, highlighting identification of absent knowledge.](image3)\n\nSupporting this, the text affirms that recall remains stable despite an increasing amount of absent knowledge, indicating the model's limited but consistent ability to identify what is missing. The rise in precision and F1-Score signals that models, when guided by \"Conscious Incompetence\", are able to more accurately target which parts of the knowledge are actually absent, thus avoiding spurious citations [5]. This setting, therefore, becomes crucial precisely when significant gaps exist in the knowledge graph [6].\n\nWhen considering retrieval analysis, as retrieval accuracy drops (i.e., as more irrelevant or missing knowledge is introduced), all metrics—precision, recall, and F1-Score—decline, but recall is disproportionately affected. The decline in recall is nearly linear as more knowledge is absent, emphasizing that a model cannot cite what isn't present. Precision, however, drops less sharply, reflecting the model's ability to filter out incorrect knowledge even as relevant information becomes scarcer. Overall correctness remains the least impacted at high accuracy but does trend downward as well.\n\n![As retrieval accuracy decreases, precision, recall, and F1-score all drop, with recall dropping steeply and correctness more gradually.](image5)\n\nIn essence, these patterns imply that while large language models can consistently identify when information is missing (stable recall), their skill in avoiding incorrect citations improves dramatically in the \"Conscious Incompetence\" setting (rising precision and F1-Score). Yet, as retrieval quality diminishes, their ability to recall all relevant citations falls, revealing a critical limitation in coverage when facing absent knowledge.\n\nIn summary: Removing knowledge elements causes precision and F1-Score to increase (as the model avoids spurious citations), with recall staying stable in the \"Conscious Incompetence\" setting; however, overall recall drops sharply with lower retrieval accuracy, highlighting that the models recognize—and can indicate—absent knowledge, but cannot recover what is not provided."}

As shown in a table comparing various models—such as RoBERTa, Turbo, Davinci, GPT-4, Vicuna, and Llama2—each in settings with and without logical constraints, there's a consistent trend where models perform better (higher Micro-F1 scores and lower logical inconsistency) when logical constraints are explicitly provided. For example, \"CoT with logical constraints\" often yields the highest accuracy across the board, as clearly observed by the bolded best scores in the results table. This pattern is particularly prominent for GPT-4 and Llama2, where logical constraints significantly boosted their scores compared to vanilla ICL or ICL with basic chain-of-thought prompting[1][4][6].\n\n![Explicit logical constraints and more demonstrations increase accuracy and reduce inconsistency.](image1)\n\nAn ablation study visualizes how increasing the number of demonstration samples, especially when combined with logical constraints, amplifies accuracy. The Micro-F1 improvement is clear as the demonstration count grows from 1 to 5, but with diminished returns beyond that threshold. Importantly, the performance with fewer demonstrations plus logical constraints can surpass that with more demonstrations lacking logic—for instance, five demonstrations with logic outperformed ten demonstrations without it (25.7% vs 24.5% on MAVEN-ERE). This highlights the synergistic value of instructing models on both \"what\" to solve and \"how\" to reason[7].\n\nIterative retrieval strategies further support the impact of logical constraints: as more iterations are performed, logical inconsistency drops, stabilizing the accuracy score. This suggests that repeated application of logical rules smooths out inconsistencies in model inference, though there's a trade-off with potential information overload during multiple-step reasoning[2].\n\n![More demonstration samples and logic constraints together yield higher Micro-F1; repeated reasoning reduces inconsistency.](image4)\n\nOverall, the evidence shows that supplying relevant logical constraints dramatically increases model accuracy and logical consistency, and that these gains are enhanced—but not linearly—with more demonstration examples. Direct evidence confirms that logical constraints, paired with reasonable numbers of demonstrations, outperform larger quantities of demonstrations alone, making them essential for efficient model performance on these reasoning tasks.\n\nIn summary: Logical constraints and demonstration samples both boost model performance on MAVEN-ERE and Causal-TimeBank, with logical constraints providing stable gains in accuracy and consistency, and a moderate number of demonstrations maximizing their benefit."}

For instance, the LI for models like Turbo, Davinci, GPT-4, Vicuna, and Llama2 decreases significantly when logical constraints are applied, as seen in the result table:\n\n![Logical constraints markedly lower logical inconsistency, but post-processing reduces it to zero across all models.](image1)\n\nSpecifically, adding logical constraints reduces LI from relatively high values without constraints to substantially lower rates. However, post-processing, which ensures removal of logical conflicts after model generation (at the possible expense of answer quality or relevance), always achieves an LI of 0% for all evaluated models and datasets.\n\nThis trend holds regardless of whether pre-trained variants or different architectures are used. The improvements in logical consistency are summarized in another performance-focused results table, where both Micro-F1 and LI are reported for MAVEN-ERE and Causal-TimeBank:\n\n![For each model and setting, post-processing always brings LI to 0%; logical constraints also achieve substantial reductions.](image3)\n\nThe trade-off, as noted in the evidence, is that while post-processing excels at removing inconsistencies, it \"may severely affect the quality of the whole generation\" because the answer may stray from the ground truth or require extensive manipulation of candidate outputs [8]. On the other hand, logical constraints—when part of model instruction or applied via multi-step retrieval—provide substantial reductions in logical inconsistency with less risk of semantic drift from the intended generation. This approach also enhances the models' overall ability to generate logically coherent outputs, as supported by observed boosts in Micro-F1 (precision and recall balance) across tasks and models.\n\nIn summary, both logical constraints and post-processing are effective, but post-processing offers a guaranteed elimination of logical inconsistency at the possible expense of answer quality, while logical constraints significantly and reliably reduce inconsistencies while maintaining higher semantic fidelity.\nTherefore: Post-processing completely removes logical inconsistency in all models and datasets, but applying logical constraints already achieves a substantial reduction and better preserves answer quality."}

This transition is visually depicted in the following comparison:\n\n![Naive, Advanced, and Modular RAG processes compared, highlighting the addition of optimization and flexible modules across paradigms.](image3)\n\nFurther illustrating this, Advanced RAG deploys both pre-retrieval and post-retrieval optimization strategies. Pre-retrieval approaches may include refining the search queries or expanding them for broader coverage, while post-retrieval steps re-evaluate retrieved documents to prioritize the most relevant or concise information for generation[1]. These improvements collectively address the indexing limitations and basic retrieval accuracy that constrain the Naive RAG approach[1].\n\nModular RAG takes these advancements further by introducing additional specialized modules designed to enhance adaptability and the overall system’s capability. Unlike the sequential processes found in Naive and Advanced RAG, Modular RAG offers integrated modules for tasks such as multi-query expansion (RAG-Fusion), task-specific routing, memory management, prediction optimization, and adaptive retrieval[6][8]. These modules enable dynamic, non-linear processes such as iterative and adaptive retrieval, allowing the RAG system to flexibly navigate, combine, and aggregate information from diverse data sources and knowledge bases for different downstream tasks[6][8].\n\nFor example, the Modular RAG paradigm handles a broader range of scenarios by managing tasks like routing queries to specific external databases or re-ranking retrieved results using intelligent algorithms and can even integrate autonomous prompt generation for zero-shot or few-shot learning[6]. Its components are more loosely coupled, allowing for end-to-end training as well as component-wise customization, thus supporting more complex and high-precision information retrieval and generation tasks[8].

This ensures that the extracted image embeddings emphasize the objects of interest, even when they appear small or off-center compared to standard classification datasets [8].\n\n![Cropping and blurring localize objects before embeddings are extracted for retrieval.](image4)\n\nOnce these cropped (and possibly blurred) images are generated for each bounding box, the retriever encodes them into embeddings using an image encoder designed for multimodal retrieval. These embeddings are stored in an indexed memory structure for efficient comparison and retrieval [3][8][9]. When a query object is presented (for instance, during inference), the system uses k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) search to retrieve the top-k most similar class names from memory, leveraging either past image embeddings or textual descriptions related to possible object classes [6][3][10].\n\nInstead of relying solely on CLIP's image-to-image retrieval, for tiny or low-resolution objects, the system performs image-to-text retrieval using CLIP’s capabilities. Top-k category information is thus retrieved by ranking the similarity between the encoded object (from the bounding box) and the textual class labels [6].\n\nFollowing retrieval, these top-k candidate class names for each object region are re-ranked using a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM). The MLLM takes as input the context—the object’s embedding and the list of retrieved candidate labels—and applies semantic reasoning to assess which candidate label most accurately fits the object in question [4][5]. This ranking step relies on MLLM’s advanced knowledge from pre-training and is designed to disambiguate fine-grained or context-sensitive objects, overcoming the limitations of broader, less precise initial retrieval [5][4].

When the SnapNTell model includes ED, there are marked improvements in all assessed metrics: ROUGE, BLEU, METEOR, and BELURT ([2]). For instance, ROUGE jumps from 28.02 to 35.28, BLEU from 3.73 to 7.81, METEOR from 26.26 to 29.27, and BELURT from 0.45 to 0.55, all indicating a more accurate and knowledge-enriched model response.\n\n![The inclusion of entity detection leads to significantly higher scores across all evaluated metrics in SnapNTell.](image1)\n\nThis pattern reflects a substantial reduction in hallucinations—which refers to generating incorrect or unsubstantiated information—because the model identifies the precise entities in images and thereby grounds its answers in genuine context.\n\nOn the retrieval augmentation side, the effect is even more pronounced across different entity popularity categories—head (frequent), torso (less frequent), tail (rare). With RA, accuracy improves in every category, most dramatically for the tail entities that typically present the hardest challenge for large language models.

In balanced conditions like + Positive, DSC provides minor but consistent improvements over standard options like DL, but it shines most in imbalanced data scenarios, such as + Negative, aligning with expectations that DSC is better suited for such cases[6].\n\nThis trend is clearly reflected in the performance metrics across several datasets. Regardless of dataset complexity or task—whether in question answering (SQuAD v1.1, SQuAD v2.0, QuoRef), paraphrase (MRPC, QQP), or augmentation settings—BERT configurations utilizing the DSC loss achieve the highest F1 scores, providing robust gains particularly when data imbalance is challenging. The improvement over the base models can be significant, especially for more difficult datasets or imbalanced data conditions.\n\n![A table shows that BERT performance improves with positive augmentation and DSC loss, and drops with negative-only augmentation.](image1)\n\nOn concrete datasets such as SQuAD and QuoRef, the use of DSC loss continues to yield the highest EM and F1 scores among BERT variants, surpassing not only the baseline but also other enhanced versions such as those using FL or DL losses. These improvements are present but smaller when using positive-only or dual-positive/negative augmentation, while the impact is stronger with imbalanced or negative-only augmentation setups[1].\n\n![A summary table confirms that BERT+DSC consistently achieves the highest EM and F1 scores across MRC datasets compared to other configurations.](image3)\n\nHowever, for accuracy-oriented tasks like sentiment classification (SST-2 and SST-5), DSC and DL do not outperform cross-entropy (CE); BERT+CE achieves the highest accuracy, confirming that these advanced loss functions are tailored for metrics like F1 rather than accuracy-driven evaluations[3].\n\n![Table shows BERT+CE yields the highest accuracy for sentiment datasets, outperforming BERT+DL and BERT+DSC.](image4)\n\nIn summary, BERT's performance increases most reliably when employing the DSC loss, especially under data imbalance or difficult augmentation techniques. Positive augmentation and dual augmentation approaches also help, while negative-only augmentation harms results. For accuracy-focused tasks, though, traditional cross-entropy remains preferable."}

Interestingly, \"Our Approach\" even slightly exceeds human performance at the highest rating (5), though humans have a higher frequency at rating 4. Ratings at the lower end (1 and 2) are minimal for both, indicating that major failures to follow instructions are rare in either case:\n![Our Approach achieves a high proportion of Likert scale 5 ratings, slightly higher than humans, indicating strong instruction following, with both outperforming at high ratings and low rates of failure.](image3)\n\nIn summary, certain linguistic categories, especially temporal coordination and co-reference, significantly increase goal prediction error, while other categories have less effect.

In practical terms, this idea was tested by applying orthogonal transformations to map the word embeddings from both languages into a unified space. The intuition is that if the embeddings are aligned, it becomes easier for the model to share semantic information across languages [4], particularly in settings where a single encoder is used for more than one source language.\n\nEmpirical evidence for the effect of embedding alignment is somewhat mixed. For single language pairs, experiments show that aligning the embeddings does not lead to significant improvements in BLEU score—differences across languages are minimal, and gains or losses are generally negligible. This suggests that, at least in these cases, explicit alignment of embeddings may not be a necessary step for boosting translation accuracy [8]. This pattern is clear from the evaluation table, where for several language pairs (e.g., GL→EN, PT→EN, TR→EN), the differences between unaligned and aligned embeddings are usually within ±0.3 BLEU [image3].\n\n![Alignment of embeddings leads to minimal changes in BLEU scores across various single-language translation tasks.](image3)\n\nHowever, the situation is different in multilingual and multi-source setups, where one encoder is responsible for multiple languages. In these cases, aligning the embeddings helps the model to process inputs from multiple languages more effectively, as the encoder does not have to learn vastly different transformations for semantically similar words in distinct vector spaces [7]. Evidence for this is shown by the higher BLEU scores in the \"align\" columns compared to both \"pre\" and \"std\" across several multilingual evaluation cases (e.g., the gain for GL+PT evaluated on GL is 1.6 BLEU over plain pre-training) [image2].\n\n![Aligned embeddings raise BLEU scores in multilingual translation tasks, making alignment helpful in these cases.](image2)\n\nIn summary:  \nAligning embeddings has little effect or even negligible impact on BLEU scores for single language-pair translation, but it can significantly improve BLEU in multilingual or multi-source NMT systems where a shared encoder is used."}

Pre-training consistently improves translation accuracy across a range of language pairs and is especially beneficial in low-resource scenarios—that is, when training data is scarce[1][4]. This is visibly demonstrated by the largest BLEU score gains occurring at smaller training set sizes; as the graph shows, these gains decrease as the training set grows, indicating diminishing returns when ample data is available. The effect is most pronounced when there is just enough data for the model to learn the basics, but still inadequate coverage of rarer concepts[9].\n\n![Pre-training has the largest impact on translation accuracy when training set size is small; with more data, the effect diminishes.](image5)\n\nLinguistic similarity between source and target languages further modulates the impact of pre-training. When the languages are closely related or share similar semantic neighborhoods, pre-training can yield more substantial improvements. This is because the pre-trained embedding spaces for similar languages can be more easily aligned, making it easier for the model to transfer learned representations[10][4]. For instance, the quantitative improvements in BLEU scores for translation pairs such as ES → PT (Spanish to Portuguese), a closely related pair, are quite high (+7.0), whereas more distant pairs such as RU → PT (Russian to Portuguese) and HE → PT (Hebrew to Portuguese) see different (sometimes even higher, but less consistent) improvements, indicating more complex dynamics that can depend on both baseline system strength and language proximity.\n\n![Translation pairs from closely related language families generally see large BLEU improvements from pre-training, but distant pairs like Hebrew also sometimes benefit due to poor baseline performance.](image1)\n\nIn depth, pre-training not only boosts overall accuracy but has a pronounced effect on translating rare or low-frequency words, thereby yielding sentences that are more complete and grammatically well-formed, as qualitative comparisons reveal[7]. \n\nIn summary, pre-training improves translation accuracy the most for linguistically similar language pairs and when training data is limited; the effects are greatest when there is enough data for the model to learn basic patterns but not enough to fully cover the vocabulary or grammar."}

This pattern holds for AZ+TR→AZ. In both cases, alignment yields a significant boost over independent (unaligned) embeddings. Even for BE+RU→BE, where the languages are less similar, alignment improves the performance, though gains are smaller. This indicates that alignment minimizes the burden on the encoder to reconcile divergent semantic spaces and enables more direct learning from multilingual data, echoing the conclusion that alignment is particularly helpful in such scenarios[7].\n\n![Alignment yields highest translation scores, especially for similar language pairs.](image3)\n\nHowever, alignment in simpler bilingual settings may not always yield consistent gains and can even cause small drops or negligible changes in some language directions—for example, in GL→EN or PT→EN, where aligned embeddings show slight reductions or negligible improvements in scores relative to unaligned ones.

For example, when GloVe embeddings are used, the presence of R-GCN yields 59.2 unmasked and 11.1 masked accuracy, but removing R-GCN drops the scores to 51.2 (unmasked) and 11.6 (masked), resulting in a considerable loss in the unmasked condition and showing almost no utility for masked scenarios due to the limited capability of GloVe embeddings to handle masked tokens[2]. This impact is further reinforced by the fact that the R-GCN, when present, allows the model to perform multi-hop reasoning by updating mention representations based on their relations, as described in supporting analysis[2][3]. \n\nWhen the model is evaluated without relation types—meaning all nodes are connected without distinguishing between types such as DOC-BASED, MATCH, or COREF—the unmasked accuracy slightly increases from 62.4 to 62.7, and the masked accuracy from 63.2 to 63.9 compared to the removal of R-GCN, suggesting only marginal benefits from naive connectivity[9]. This demonstrates the need for both sophisticated graph construction and relation-specific modeling for optimal performance.\n\nDissecting specific relation types further clarifies their roles. Dropping the DOC-BASED relation type has a more noticeable negative effect: unmasked accuracy drops to 62.9 (from 65.1 full), and masked accuracy to 65.8 (from 70.4 full). The MATCH and COREF ablations show smaller impacts: removing MATCH drops unmasked to 64.3 and masked to 67.4, while COREF ablation drops unmasked to 64.8. The removal of the COMPLEMENT type causes a slight decrease to 64.1 and 70.3[1]. Notably, DOC-BASED information is most critical because it aligns with the most frequent and informative entity connections in the data[1]. MATCH and COREF provide incremental but less pronounced boosts since simpler heuristics already capture the easiest links, and the external coreference system may not perform reliably in-domain[1].\n\nAggregating these results from the comparative table:\n![Model ablation and configuration performance on unmasked and masked conditions.](image1)\n\nFurthermore, performance generally degrades more sharply under masked conditions, as evidenced by the drastic drop with GloVe embeddings and the subdued gains from adding relational structure.

The primary conclusion is that performance on unperturbed data may drastically overstate actual reasoning ability, while adversarially balanced datasets offer a far more honest and challenging benchmark for machine understanding of argument reasoning [6][8][10].\n\nIn summary: The adversarial data setup reduces BERT’s performance to near-random on the ARCT dataset, highlighting that previous success was largely due to exploiting statistical cues, not true argument comprehension."}

For example, its average performance on the ATOMIC test set reaches 77.53, notably closer to human validation’s average score of 86.18. While beam search and sampling methods trail behind, no algorithm fully achieves human validation levels, but greedy decoding narrows the gap best. This demonstrates that, although COMET's automated decoding is strong, human judgment still leads in overall quality and nuance.\n\n![Greedy decoding comes closest to human performance in generating commonsense inferences, but a gap remains.](image1)\n\nWhen examining the impact of training data quantity, the model remains relatively robust even with less data, but clear performance degradation occurs at the lowest levels. For example, using just 1% of the training data causes perplexity (PPL) to rise considerably (from 11.13 up to 23.81), BLEU-2 to drop (from 14.34 to 5.08), and metrics related to novelty and utility (N/U and N/T) to fall. Notably, with 10% of training data, metrics remain surprisingly high: BLEU-2 is 12.72 (versus 14.34 at full), and novelty-related scores (N/U = 58.34, N/T = 9.54) are actually at their peak, perhaps due to a regularizing effect or the generation of more creative outputs in low-resource settings. Still, reducing to 1% clearly hampers both fluency and creativity.\n\n![Model performance steadily improves as the percentage of training data increases, with marked drops when data is very limited.](image3)\n\nIn summary: Greedy decoding in COMET offers the best automated performance, approaching but not matching human validation, and performance on all core metrics improves as the proportion of training data increases, with substantial declines when only very small amounts of data are available."}

It achieves the lowest perplexity (4.32), the highest classifier score (95.25), and a human evaluation score of 91.69, closely approaching human-level performance. These numbers are notably better than those achieved by LSTM and CKBG models, as well as by ablations of COMET that do not use pretraining or relation token mapping. This highlights COMET’s ability to both generate high-quality knowledge and approximate human judgement in commonsense reasoning tasks. ![COMET achieves the best accuracy and closest-to-human performance among models on ConceptNet.](image1)\n\nIn terms of novelty, COMET is particularly effective at generating new, previously unseen knowledge. About 59.25% of its generated ConceptNet tuples are novel, illustrating a strong capacity to expand the knowledge base beyond the training set[1]. Even as the “edit distance” (i.e., the difference from training tuples) increases, a significant portion of novel tuples remain, and their correctness remains high – the classifier accuracy for these novel tuples is close to 100%, only slightly decreasing as novelty increases. This demonstrates that COMET can produce innovative knowledge that is also trustworthy. ![Classifier accuracy remains high even as the novelty (edit distance) of tuples increases, showing the reliability of new COMET generations.](image2)\n\nThese findings collectively imply that the COMET model is highly effective for knowledge base completion on ConceptNet: it excels not only at generating knowledge that is accurate and convincing to both classifiers and human judges, but it also introduces a considerable amount of genuinely new, high-quality data. This combination of accuracy and novelty positions COMET as a leading approach for advancing automated commonsense knowledge bases.\n\nIn summary: COMET outperforms prior models in both accuracy and novelty on the ConceptNet dataset, meaning it can reliably produce new, correct knowledge, making it the most effective model evaluated."}

For open vocabulary models, however, the Pass-through variant yields a much higher error rate (All: 30.3), while Background (All: 14.7) and Neutral (All: 11.3) dramatically reduce error rates, with Neutral matching the closed vocabulary best performance.\n\nThe sensitivity of these strategies is crucial: Pass-through in open vocabulary models is particularly sensitive, as each unique character combination is considered different, drastically increasing the model's potential response to attacks[8]. In contrast, the Neutral strategy, which always maps unrecognized words to a fixed token, consistently results in low sensitivity — clustering output and providing attackers fewer options[4][7]. Image4 visualizes this: in both word-only and char-only models, the Neutral strategy is associated with the lowest sensitivity and highest robustness (as reflected by the largest bubbles), despite not always having the very lowest WER. Background backoff can also reduce WER, especially for open vocabulary models, but may result in slightly higher sensitivity than Neutral, limiting the robustness gains.\n\nFor open vocabulary models, reducing sensitivity via Neutral backoff is paramount, given the inherently higher flexibility (and therefore vulnerability) of their character-level architectures. For closed vocabulary models, the distinction is less dramatic, since OOV words are already \"neutralized\" by the design of the model, thus resulting in similar sensitivity and WER among backoff strategies[8].\n\n![Neutral backoff achieves low sensitivity and high robustness in both closed and open vocabulary models.](image4)\nThe Neutral (green) and Pass-through (blue) strategies overlap in the closed vocabulary plot (left), both showing WER ≈ 11 and sensitivity ≈ 12, with high robustness, while Background (orange) is slightly less robust. In the open vocabulary plot (right), Neutral achieves the best robustness due to its low sensitivity, while Pass-through is notably more sensitive with the lowest robustness.\n\nTo summarize, sensitivity is generally more influential than WER for robustness; Neutral backoff yields the lowest sensitivity and ample robustness for both closed and open vocabulary models, with the greatest impact in open vocabulary (character-level) models where sensitivity can otherwise be high. Open vocabulary models benefit the most from backoff strategies that cluster OOV corrections, reducing their attack surface.\n\nIn short: Closed vocabulary models show little difference in sensitivity or WER across backoff strategies, but open vocabulary models are highly sensitive with Pass-through and most robust with Neutral backoff, which keeps both sensitivity and WER low."}

For example, on WIKIHOP in the standard setting, BiDAF achieves a performance score of 42.9 on the test set, while FastQA reaches 25.7. This superiority is also observed in the masked setup, although the margin narrows somewhat: BiDAF mask yields 54.5, and FastQA mask achieves 35.8.

For instance, in one representative business unit in 2020, gross profit increased from IFRS 29,896 to core 33,275 after accounting for amortization, impairments, acquisition/divestment effects, and other items. Similarly, operating income improved from IFRS 9,172 to core 13,645 for the same reasons. The adjustments were especially notable in the cost of goods sold (mainly amortization), as well as within selling, general and administration, research and development, and other income and expense categories. These changes collectively provided a more normalized view of the company's operations by excluding large, often non-cash or one-time charges.[2]  \n![Adjustments for gross profit and operating income in 2020 show how amortization and other items boost core results compared to IFRS results.](image2)\n\nIn 2021, a similar pattern emerged, as seen across the group and within business units. For example, at the group level, gross profit increased from IFRS 37,010 to core 41,097 due to adjustments such as amortization of intangible assets (3,655), impairments (18), and acquisition/divestment-related items (414). Operating income saw an uplift from IFRS 11,689 to core 16,588, again because these adjustments removed the effects of such non-core expenses. The step-by-step adjustments highlight that the most significant increase to gross profit and operating income came from adding back the expense of amortization of intangible assets, while other items provided smaller or compensating effects.[4]  \n![In 2021, adjustments including amortization of intangible assets raised gross profit and operating income from IFRS to core levels.](image4)\n\nA more detailed breakdown of the adjustments for 2021 further supports this, showing cost of goods sold under IFRS at -11,751, which shifts to core -7,988 after adding back amortization and other items; operating income moves from 10,688 (IFRS) to 15,215 (core) due to similar adjustments. The additions for amortization, impairments, and other items are clearly itemized to display their incremental impact.[3]  \n![Detailed view for 2021 shows that adding back amortization and other items significantly increases gross profit and operating income.](image3)\n\nIn summary, for both years, the adjustments—predominantly the add-back of amortization of intangible assets and, to a lesser degree, \"other items\"—consistently increased both gross profit and operating income when moving from IFRS to core results.

The company’s share repurchase program, overseen by Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger, allows for open-ended, flexible buybacks when they believe the stock is trading below its intrinsic value, without an explicit limit on volume or duration. In 2021, Berkshire spent $27.1 billion on share repurchases, with the guideline that cash holdings must remain above $30 billion to ensure liquidity and financial strength [4]. The monthly breakdown of these repurchases shows substantial purchases of both Class A and B shares—all at high prices, indicating substantial confidence in Berkshire’s intrinsic value during that period:\n\n![Summary of Class A and B common stock repurchases, volume and prices for October to December 2021](image2)\n\nParallel to buybacks, Berkshire’s earnings composition across segments from 2019 to 2021 reveals resilience and growth in several key areas. The insurance underwriting business rebounded from $325 million in 2019 to $728 million in 2021, while insurance investment income declined due to lower interest rates.

The U.S. also saw a decrease of 4%, while the International Developmental Licensed Markets & Corporate segment actually saw a 6% increase, but this could not offset the overall decrease. Franchised revenues also saw decreases: down 14% in International Operated Markets and modest declines in the U.S. (2%) and International Developmental Licensed Markets & Corporate (10%)![Significant declines in company-operated and franchised revenues, especially in International Operated Markets, led to an overall 10% decrease in total revenues in 2020](image5).\n\nOverall, total company-operated sales and franchised revenues fell by 10%, with total revenues landing at $19,208 million in 2020 compared to $21,365 million in 2019. These declines were driven especially by the impact of COVID-19, which caused widespread temporary restaurant closures and limited operations, particularly outside of the U.S. The International Operated Markets suffered the largest revenue declines, especially in the U.K., France, Germany, Italy, and Spain, all of which were hit by stricter restrictions and lower sales capacity [5][6].\n\nAs revenues declined, this pressure directly carried through to margins and ultimately to earnings per share. The impact can be seen in both the GAAP and Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share. GAAP EPS dropped from $7.88 in 2019 to $6.31 in 2020—a 20% decrease.

The sharp decline in profitability was amplified by higher selling, general, and administrative expenses due to additional franchisee support and brand campaigns, as well as higher closing costs and increased reserves for bad debts [7]. While U.S. sales showed relative resilience, the larger drag from international markets more than offset any positive performance domestically.\n\nIn summary, the revenue declines led by International Operated Markets and, to a lesser degree, the U.S., translated into a substantial reduction in both GAAP and Non-GAAP earnings per share for McDonald’s from 2019 to 2020."}

Notably, for 2020, the risk-free rate ranged from 0.2% to 1.4%, expected volatility from 22.2% to 29.5%, expected dividend yield from 1.4% to 1.7%, a uniform forfeiture rate of 5%, and an expected life of options of about 5.1 years.\n\n![Key valuation assumptions for employee stock options include risk-free rate, volatility, dividend yield, forfeiture, and expected life, each with their specific 2020 ranges.](image4)\n\nTurning to operating leases, the future minimum lease payments as of December 31, 2020, are scheduled each year over time, starting with $865 million in 2021 and decreasing annually, with a cumulative total of $5,046 million before interest and $4,447 million after deducting $599 million for imputed interest. These obligations reflect a long-term liability on the company’s balance sheet, likely discounted using an interest rate (noted at a 3.0% weighted-average discount rate) and a remaining lease term of 8.7 years in aggregate [8][10].\n\n![Future lease payments are spread annually from 2021 onward, totaling $5,046 million before interest and $4,447 million after imputed interest, indicating long-term fixed obligations.](image2)\n\nComparing the two, assumptions for stock options largely focus on the estimation of fair value using volatility, yield, interest rates, and employee behavior, whereas minimum lease payment disclosures center on actual contractual cash outflows, imputed interest, and lease terms. Both are influenced by interest rates and time, but their purpose diverges: stock option valuation is about estimating compensation cost, while lease computations relate to recognizing and measuring liability for future payments.\n\nIn summary: Assumptions for stock option fair value estimation focus on financial modeling variables like volatility, yield, and risk-free rate, while future minimum lease payments are based on fixed contractual amounts and the imputed discount rate, reflecting actual financial obligations rather than modeled estimations."}

In the U.S. upstream division, reported earnings improved from a loss of $1.6 billion in 2020 to positive earnings of $7.3 billion in 2021. This turnaround was primarily due to higher realizations, increased sales volumes, and the absence of 2020’s impairments and write-offs[5]. International upstream followed a similar trajectory, moving from a loss of $825 million in 2020 to earnings of $8.5 billion in 2021, driven by higher price realizations and a reduction in one-time impairments and severance charges[6]. The positive shift in net income can also be linked to improved performance in downstream operations, where U.S. downstream earnings rose from a $571 million loss in 2020 to a $2.4 billion gain in 2021[8].\n\nAs a direct consequence of these improved earnings, the return on stockholders’ equity (ROE) also saw a substantial increase, reflecting Chevron’s stronger profitability and enhanced returns for shareholders.

Compensation and benefits expenses grew by 11% in 2020 compared to 2019, largely due to increased discretionary incentive compensation, higher expenses from deferred compensation plans linked to investment performance, and new costs associated with the E*TRADE acquisition. These increases in compensation contribute to the higher level of earnings that affected the tax rate[9].\n\nA breakdown of the total recognized compensation expense shows it rising from $1,878 million in 2019 to $2,119 million in 2020, underscoring the link between increased compensation expenses and the effective tax rate[9].\n\n![Compensation expenses increased in 2020 compared to 2019.](image1)\n\nIn summary: The effective tax rate increased while net discrete tax benefits decreased from 2019 to 2020, a change directly related to higher compensation expenses and increased earnings in 2020."}

Excluding these items, operating income still decreased 23% in constant currencies.

Some divisions, like FLNA (Frito-Lay North America), posted steady increases in both net revenue and operating profit, reflecting continued strength in the snack sector.

For instance, in one business segment, the IFRS operating income was 1,600, and, after adding back 236 in amortization and 34 in impairments (along with other adjustments), core operating income rose to 2,064. This pattern is observed in other areas such as cost of goods sold and other income/expense, where similar amortization and impairment adjustments led to higher core results compared to IFRS figures. Specifically, cost of goods sold included a 236 adjustment for amortization and 18 for impairments, directly improving gross and operating income upon transition to core results![Amortization and impairment adjustments increase core results by reversing expenses recognized in IFRS.](image3).\n\nFor 2020, the impact is even more pronounced in some segments.

Similarly, within the gross profit adjustments, 366 related to amortization and 127 to impairments were key components in achieving higher core profitability.

The largest components are associated with cost of goods sold and research and development costs, reflecting the depreciation and impairment of assets utilized in primary operational areas, especially research-linked assets and intangible assets not yet available for use as outlined in accounting policy explanations [5].\n\nLooking into specific asset classes, property, plant, and equipment bear significant annual depreciation charges. In 2020, “Land and buildings” saw depreciation of DKK 644 million and “Other equipment” DKK 320 million, collectively DKK 964 million—an uptick from DKK 852 million the prior year, demonstrating an expanding asset base but also a heavier annual expense as new assets are brought into use and older assets are written down. The net carrying amount for these categories fell from a combined total of DKK 3,532 million at the end of 2019 to DKK 3,380 million in 2020, underscoring the impact of depreciation outpacing new capital additions for the year.[10]\n\n![Annual changes in carrying amounts for property, plant, and equipment, showing depreciation, additions, and final balances for 2019 and 2020.](image2)\n\nFor intangible assets, including patents and licences, a significant share of impairment losses in 2020 (DKK 350 million) was tied to assets not yet available for use, particularly in diabetes and obesity research. These impairment losses are closely linked to management revising expectations on the recoverability of future economic benefits from research projects or licenses, adjusting carrying amounts to reflect prospective realizable value [3][4]. Amortization also continues on intangible assets already in service, except for those with indefinite useful life or not yet ready for use, which are subject to annual impairment testing instead of systematic amortization [9].\n\nThe aggregate data for intangible assets and property, plant, and equipment confirm these trends. The tables track costs, additions, amortization/depreciation, impairment losses, and exchange rate effects for each asset type across both years, visibly charting the net decline in carrying amounts as charges outweigh capitalizations and revaluations.[4]\n\n![Year-over-year movements in intangible assets and property, plant and equipment, reflecting additions, disposals, depreciations, and impairment losses.](image4)\n\nIn summary, between 2019 and 2020, depreciation and impairment losses grew moderately, leading to net declines in the carrying amounts of both intangible assets and property, plant, and equipment.

This figure is based on a market-related value that incorporates fair value and smooths certain gains and losses over three years, as described in U.S. GAAP, meaning not all actual fluctuations are immediately reflected in cost calculations [3]. The fair value of assets, capturing the real market condition, is reported at year end as part of the total plan assets [4].\n\nWhen we look at the actual return on plan assets, the relevant figures can be found by examining changes associated with real asset returns in the financial tables. The specific figures for actual returns are not explicitly listed in any text quote, but from the image evidence:\n\n- In image3, the “U.S. Defined Benefit” column shows a sequence of values: $9, (6), (39), $(36). These likely relate to investment returns or related adjustments, where the negative figures (such as $(39)) may represent losses or negative returns, and $9 could represent positive changes in some aspect, although without precise labels, one must interpret contextually.\n- In image5, as of December 31, 2020, total U.S. Defined Benefit plan assets are shown as $1,061 million, mainly comprising fixed income securities and equity holdings. This aggregate reflects the results of both expected and actual returns, net of contributions, benefit payments, and other transactional effects.\n\nThe smoothing mechanism means that variations between expected and actual returns are not instantly recognized in expense but are instead gradually phased into the financial statements. Over time, and particularly in a year with returns that differ significantly from expectations, the actual returns will affect the year-end fair value of total plan assets [3][4]. If actual returns were significantly above or below the expected return, that would cause a change in plan asset values and eventually flow through to the expense calculations.\n\n![Plan asset and expense reconciliation shows expected and actual returns](image1)\nThe comparison of net periodic benefit costs and corresponding expected returns illustrates the integration of these financial elements from year to year for the U.S. Defined Benefit plans.\n\n![Asset breakdown for U.S. defined benefit plans as of year-end 2020](image5)\nThis breakdown confirms that at year-end 2020, the U.S. Defined Benefit assets totaled $1,061 million, verifying how both expected and actual returns (after smoothing) are realized in the final balance.\n\nIn summary, the expected return on plan assets for the U.S. Defined Benefit dropped from $(41) million in 2019 to $(36) million in 2020, while total plan assets ended at $1,061 million in 2020; actual returns, as reflected in fair value, are gradually recognized in expenses through a smoothing process, influencing but not immediately determining the reported total assets and pension costs."}

This turnaround was shaped by a combination of stronger operating cash flows, a sizable reduction in cash used for investing, and a significant switch in financing activity flows.\n\nNet cash provided by operating activities rose from $14,770 million in 2019 to $18,197 million in 2020. This increase was driven by greater cash collection from receivables ($4,795 million), including sales of financing receivables, as well as temporary benefits from tax relief under COVID-19 government programs [6][10]. Though there were performance-related declines within net income, the increase in receivables collections offset these declines [6].  \n\nNet cash used in investing activities improved dramatically, shrinking from ($26,936) million in 2019 to just ($3,028) million in 2020. The primary reason was the absence of a large outflow for acquisitions—$32,294 million used for the Red Hat acquisition in 2019—which did not recur in 2020. This benefit was partially offset by less cash provided from non-operating finance receivables due to winding down the OEM IT commercial financing business, and slightly higher purchases of marketable securities and other investments [1][5][9].\n\nFinancing activities, which had provided $9,042 million inflow in 2019, turned around to a net outflow of ($9,721) million in 2020—a swing of $18,763 million. This change was tied to lower levels of new debt issuance and repayments in line with reduced financing receivables and adjusted balance sheet needs [8].\n\nLooking at the summarized cash flow table, the combined effect of improved operating inflows, drastically reduced acquisition investments, and a reversal in financing inflows resulted in the positive swing in net cash:\n\n![A table summarizes IBM's 2020 and 2019 cash flows, highlighting improvements in operating and investing activities but a reversal in financing sources.](image2)\n\nIn summary, IBM’s net change in cash was positive in 2020 mainly due to increased operating cash flows and a dramatic drop in cash used for acquisitions, offset somewhat by financing outflows rather than inflows as in the prior year.

Examining the details, total stock-based compensation expense was $558 million in 2020, dropped to $540 million in 2021, and further to $528 million in 2022. This decline is seen in both components: expenses related to stock options as well as RSUs and PSUs, with a consistent decrease for three years. This trend is complemented by a similar decline in the associated income tax benefit, which went from $97 million in 2020 to $88 million in 2022.  \n![Stock-based compensation expenses and tax benefit declined steadily from 2020 to 2022.](image3)\n\nDuring this period, P&G's net earnings attributable to shareholders rose each year: $12,764 million (basic, 2020), $14,035 million (2021), and $14,461 million (2022). Correspondingly, diluted net EPS increased from $4.96 in 2020 to $5.50 in 2021 and $5.81 in 2022. This gain was aided by both higher net earnings and a reduction in shares outstanding, contributing to EPS growth even as stock-based compensation—which could be dilutive by increasing the number of shares—was managed effectively.\n![Diluted net earnings per share consistently rose from $4.96 in 2020 to $5.81 in 2022 as net earnings increased and shares outstanding declined.](image4)\n\nThis overall pattern suggests that P&G not only controlled stock-based compensation costs, thus moderating a potential drag on EPS through dilution or expense, but also grew net earnings robustly.

Over these years, the company saw strong net income performance, but other equity activities and comprehensive items played a significant role in shaping total equity and comprehensive income.\n\nFirst, the company's net income increased notably: $6,759 million in 2019, $3,135 million in 2020, and $8,060 million in 2021. However, comprehensive income adjusts net income for items that do not pass through the income statement—such as unrealized gains/losses on securities, foreign currency translation, and pension adjustments. For these years, other comprehensive income (OCI) was consistently negative or diminished the overall total: $(140) million in 2019, $(158) million in 2020, and $(50) million in 2021, each figure reflecting the net effect of all OCI components and reducing total comprehensive income derived from net income.\n\n![The table for 2019–2021 details net income, other comprehensive income components, and total comprehensive income, showing a decrease in comprehensive income relative to net income each year.](image5)\n\nAt the same time, shareholders’ equity—including retained earnings and accumulated OCI—reflected these results. Elements such as repurchases of common shares, dividend payments, and changes in accumulated OCI (arising from unrealized gains/losses and pension adjustments) directly influenced the ending equity balance for each year. The recapitalization of equity through buybacks and dividend outflows reduced retained earnings, while negative accumulated OCI further moderated the equity total.\n\nThe company’s equity section also reveals the translation of comprehensive income into cumulative shareholders' equity. For instance, total shareholders' equity decreased from $22,984 million at the end of 2020 to $22,177 million at the end of 2021, even as 2021 realized the highest net and comprehensive income in the period. This was due to equity-reducing activities like share repurchases and dividends, along with ongoing negative accumulated OCI.\n\n![Shareholders' equity declined from 2020 to 2021, due to negative OCI and equity distribution activities despite high net income.](image2)\n\nA detailed review of changes year over year shows that while net income drives most of the increase in comprehensive income, negative components from OCI—primarily unrealized security losses, currency translation losses, and pension adjustments—consistently pulled the total comprehensive income below reported net income, thus affecting the portion of income available to equity after factoring in all sources of change.\n\nIn summary, the changes in shareholders' equity significantly impacted comprehensive income from 2019 to 2021 by reducing it below the level of net income due to negative other comprehensive income and equity distributions, such as dividends and share repurchases, which also reduced the retained earnings component of equity."}

Specifically, WAIO’s iron ore production reached a record 252 Mt (equity share), benefiting from operational improvements despite weather and labor disruptions [2]. The underlying EBITDA for WAIO climbed to $26.3 billion, with higher prices being the main contributor—net price impacts accounted for approximately $12.1 billion of this growth, alongside a small volume increase of $148 million, albeit partially offset by exchange rates and inflation [1]. This effect of commodity prices is underscored by the sensitivity data: for every $1/ton increase in the iron ore price, underlying EBITDA increases by $233 million, a testament to WAIO's strong leverage to price movements ![Each $1/ton rise in iron ore price increases underlying EBITDA by $233 million.](image1).\n\nIn terms of unit economics, WAIO’s cost per tonne increased from $12.63 in FY2020 to $14.82 in FY2021, primarily reflecting higher gross costs, though the average realized iron ore price surged to $130.56/wmt from $77.36 [1].

The combined total for foreign provisions went from a net benefit in 2019 to an overall expense in 2020 and 2021.\n\n![The table shows that the foreign current tax provision shifted from a benefit in 2019 to expenses in 2020 and 2021.](image3)\n\nParallel to this, foreign income before income taxes more than tripled from $439 million in 2019 to $1,493 million in 2021, with an interim figure of $715 million in 2020. This substantial growth in foreign income means that a larger portion of the company's total profitability is coming from foreign operations, emphasizing the increasing importance of international markets.\n\n![The table demonstrates the significant increase in foreign income before taxes from 2019 to 2021.](image4)\n\nThese changes in both foreign tax provision and foreign pre-tax income may prompt the company to revisit its financial strategy in several ways:\n- With higher foreign income and rising foreign tax liabilities, the company may seek new tax planning opportunities, such as optimizing the location of profits, tax credits, or incentives in foreign jurisdictions.\n- Enhanced focus on compliance and risk management is warranted, given the elevated tax provisions and the increased attention from foreign tax authorities.\n- The company may evaluate the cost-benefit of maintaining certain operations or investments in higher-tax jurisdictions vs. exploring further expansion in regions offering tax benefits or incentives.\n\nIn summary, from 2019 to 2021, foreign tax provision shifted from a benefit to a significant expense, and foreign income before taxes increased substantially, both of which may lead the company to refine its global tax and operational strategy to optimize tax efficiency and manage exposure."}

During the year there were inflows of $69.3 billion, outflows of $96.8 billion, and a positive market impact of $11.6 billion. However, the pivotal change was the sale of WFAM on November 1, 2021, which resulted in a reduction of $587.1 billion in managed assets, leaving a much lower end-of-year balance compared to the prior year.

This growth was primarily driven by an increase in commercial loans, which grew from $478,417 million to $513,120 million, while consumer loans declined from $409,220 million to $382,274 million. The shift reflects heightened demand and greater originations in the commercial and industrial segment, partially offset by consumer loan paydowns and a reduction in the residential mortgage – first lien portfolio, as $17.8 billion was transferred to loans held for sale and consumer paydowns increased in the low interest rate environment [1][5].\n\n![Breakdown of commercial loans increased, consumer loans fell, total loans rose moderately.](image5)\n\nDeposits rose significantly over the same period, increasing from $1,404,381 million at the end of 2020 to $1,482,479 million by the end of 2021—a 6% increase.

The principal driver behind this decline was significantly lower income from short-term investments and fixed maturity securities—a direct effect of persistently low interest rates throughout 2021. The company mentions that, despite maintaining high levels of liquidity in cash and U.S. Treasury Bills, low short-term rates prevailed, curtailing potential yields on those holdings [2]. \n\nAlthough dividend income increased modestly, it was insufficient to offset the loss from lower interest returns. This reflects the company's stated preference for safety over yield when it comes to short-term investments, even if it means earning less [2].\n\nExamining asset allocations at year-end further corroborates these changes. The amount held in cash, cash equivalents, and U.S. Treasury Bills rose significantly from $67,082 million in 2020 to $90,688 million in 2021, indicating a strategic move toward highly liquid, low-yield instruments![Increase in cash and U.S. Treasury Bill holdings in 2021 while fixed maturity securities declined.](image1).

These declines were mainly driven by unfavorable volume/mix, as the region sold significantly fewer units, leading to a large negative impact on income, only slightly mitigated by price and cost variances[1].\n\nThe Middle East & Africa region also saw significant contraction, with total shipment volumes dropping 13.3%, cigarettes declining by 12.3%, and heated tobacco units plunging by 61.5%. This demonstrates that both traditional and newer product segments experienced declines.\n![The Middle East & Africa region faced a 13.3% total drop in shipments, including a massive fall in heated tobacco units.](image4)\n\nFinancially, the Middle East & Africa mirrored this trend: net revenues were down by 23.6% and operating income by a striking 39.1%. Again, the key factor was unfavorable volume/mix, underscoring the crucial role that declining sales played in causing this regional downturn[6].\n\nBy contrast, East Asia & Australia displayed more resilience. Total shipment volume declined slightly by 2.1%, but this masked diverging product trends: cigarette volume dropped by 9.7%, while heated tobacco unit shipments increased by 10.4%. The growing popularity of heated tobacco units partly counterbalanced cigarette declines.\n![East Asia & Australia’s shipment volume was nearly flat, with heated tobacco units growing while cigarettes fell.](image5)\n\nFinancial outcomes reflected some of this product mix shift. Net revenues in East Asia & Australia increased modestly by 1.2% to $5,429 million, and operating income jumped 24.2% to $2,400 million. Improved pricing and cost management, combined with the surge in heated tobacco, helped the region overcome volume losses and post financial gains[3].\n\nIn summary, South & Southeast Asia and Middle East & Africa both suffered steep declines in shipment volume and net revenues, primarily due to falling cigarette sales and weaker sales of heated tobacco units. By contrast, East Asia & Australia saw only a minor drop in shipment volume, and even modest revenue growth, owing largely to the increased uptake of heated tobacco units in that market.\n\nSo, while shipment and revenue declines were prominent in South & Southeast Asia and Middle East & Africa, East Asia & Australia managed a far more stable performance, thanks primarily to product diversification and pricing strategies."}

By 2021, unallocated revenues fell further to just $54 million, indicating the absence of similarly large, nonrecurring licensing transactions and one-time revenue releases in that fiscal year[7]. \n\nCorrespondingly, unallocated expenses, such as research and development and selling, general, and administrative expenses, showed an upward trend over this period. Notably, unallocated research and development expenses increased from $989 million in 2019 to $1,820 million in 2021, and unallocated selling, general, and administrative expenses rose from $413 million in 2019 to $538 million in 2021.

This improvement in operating activities facilitated a rise in free cash flow, which grew by 15% to $6.4 billion in 2020, compared to $5.6 billion in 2019. This figure is derived after considering capital spending and proceeds from the sale of property, plant, and equipment, with capital spending remaining relatively stable between the two years ![Free cash flow rose 15% in 2020, with higher operating cash flows.](image1).\n\nOn the investing side, PepsiCo increased its expenditure, with net cash used for investing activities reaching $11.6 billion in 2020, primarily reflecting significant acquisitions, notably Rockstar ($3.85 billion), Pioneer Foods ($1.2 billion), and Be & Cheery ($0.7 billion), along with continued capital investment[3]. Despite these outflows, free cash flow remained robust, evidencing PepsiCo’s strong cash generation capability.\n\nContractual commitments also changed notably.

This was mainly due to higher volatility and increased client activities, with foreign exchange, rates, and credit especially strong—credit revenue nearly doubled with a 90% jump. In contrast, Global Banking revenue slipped by $71 million (2%), weighed by lower real estate and structured finance fees, and losses from legacy positions, though capital markets revenue and net interest income from corporate lending both increased[4][image4].

The company also realigned its segment structure in 2020, but these changes were stated to have no effect on financial reporting [4].\n\nVisually, one summary table demonstrates the evolution of the company's figures over three years: each column likely represents a year based on the relationship between opening and closing balances and the presence of annual net income and dividend figures. In the third column, representing the most recent year, the ending balance moves from $5,580 to $7,189, suggesting increases in both net income and retained earnings. The numbers in parentheses—most notably (137) and (105)—likely indicate substantial outflows such as dividends or repurchases each year. The positive numbers above these figures correspond to items like net income and stock compensation, offsetting these outflows and pointing to the underlying operating strength.\n\n![Yearly equity movements show increases in net income and retained earnings, offset by dividends and buybacks.](image2)\n\nIn summary, retained earnings and net income increased from 2018 to 2020, driven by strong net income and cash flow, though partially offset by rising dividends and share repurchases as part of an active capital return program."}

The aggregate number of domestic medical members fell only slightly, down about 1% overall, from 49,150,000 to 48,435,000[image3].\n\nThis trend is substantiated by the revenue distribution within UnitedHealthcare. Revenue tied to the Employer & Individual segment dropped 2%, while Medicare & Retirement revenue climbed 9%, and Community & State revenue rose 6%. UnitedHealthcare Global saw a more pronounced decrease, falling by 21% in revenue from 2019 to 2020[image4]. \n\nThese changes are deeply connected to several underlying factors. Increased unemployment and corresponding attrition led to fewer people being covered under employer-sponsored (commercial) plans, both domestically and internationally. Meanwhile, the growth in Medicare Advantage was driven by an increase in individual enrollees. Medicaid numbers rose largely because states relaxed redetermination requirements in response to COVID-19, making it easier for people to retain coverage. These patterns were reinforced by the pandemic’s broader economic impact and by shifts in the public policy landscape[10][5].\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic had a considerable influence across all segments, as care deferral, shifting demand, and changes in employment status exerted downward pressure on commercial and global membership, while simultaneously driving up participation in public plans. The total number of individuals served through Medicare Advantage and Medicaid increased due to these factors, whereas commercial and global membership declined[9][10].\n\nThe number of individuals served by UnitedHealthcare declined in commercial and global segments due to increased unemployment and economic effects from COVID-19, but increased in Medicare Advantage and Medicaid thanks to policy changes and more people qualifying for these programs.\n![Segmented membership change table shows commercial decrease, growth in Medicare/Medicaid, overall slight decline.](image3)\n![Revenue by segment echoes member shifts: commercial down, Medicare/Medicaid up, global sharply down.](image4)"}

By year-end 2020, the attributable equity had grown to RMB 52,245 million and non-controlling interests to RMB 486 million, a reflection of substantial profit for the year, which pushed retained earnings from RMB 7,007 million to RMB 11,111 million.

This boost in average revenue per customer occurred despite a slight overall drop in total customer relationships, which decreased each year, culminating in a net loss of 198,000 relationships in 2021, following smaller losses or modest growth in prior years:\n\n![Customer relationships declined slightly over three years, ending 2021 with a net loss.](image1)\n\nHowever, the increase in per-customer revenue in 2021 helped offset the effect of these declining customer relationships.

This means operating lease costs declined by $352, while finance lease costs showed a moderate increase of $21 over the one-year period. Consequently, the overall lease costs decreased between 2020 and 2021, driven mainly by a reduction in operating lease expenses.[1]  \n![Operating lease costs declined by $352, while finance lease costs increased by $21 from 2020 to 2021.](image3)\n\nTurning to lease liabilities, operating lease liabilities fell from $3,906 at the end of 2020 to $3,503 at the end of 2021, a reduction of $403.

The data illustrates this with total loans falling from $211,436 million in 2020 to $181,237 million in 2021, a substantial decrease of $30,199 million or 14%. This decline was observed in specific business lines as well, such as Middle Market Banking (down $9,966 million, or 9%) and Asset-Based Lending and Leasing (down $20,233 million, or 21%) ![Loans and deposits by business line show total loans fell 14% while deposits rose in 2021](image4).\n\nConcurrently, total deposits showed notable growth. This increase was attributed to heightened liquidity and increased savings by both consumer and commercial customers. As detailed, the boost in deposits can be connected to government stimulus programs and ongoing economic uncertainty from the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to less investment spending and higher levels of liquid assets held as deposits [4][6].\n\nThe primary factors driving the drop in loan balances were decreased loan demand — including lower line utilization and higher paydowns, which were themselves a manifestation of sustained high levels of client liquidity and strength in the capital markets. Any modest loan growth that appeared late in 2021 was not enough to offset the broad downward trend in loan balances caused by these factors [3]. Additionally, specific segments (including Home Lending and Small Business) experienced lower balances due to temporary suspensions or curtailments of certain loan products and a decline in PPP loans [8].\n\nIn summary, from 2020 to 2021, total loans across all business lines decreased mainly because of lower demand, higher client liquidity, and paydowns, while total deposits rose as clients maintained higher liquidity and savings amid ongoing economic uncertainty and government fiscal support. The primary drivers of these trends were shifts in client behavior, increased government aid, and changes in the broader economic environment.\n  \nIn short: Total loans decreased and total deposits increased across business lines from 2020 to 2021, driven by lower loan demand, higher client liquidity, and government stimulus programs."}

The United States segment experienced a particularly significant dip, dropping from a $(5,094) million loss in 2019 to a further loss of $(1,608) million in 2020, while international upstream went from $7,670 million to a loss of $(825) million. However, in 2021, both segments strongly rebounded: upstream U.S. earnings reached $7,319 million and international upstream $8,499 million, for a total of $15,818 million, reflecting higher realized prices for crude oil and natural gas, increased sales volumes, and the absence of major impairments that hit the prior year[5][6].\n\nDownstream showed a similar, though less extreme, pattern. U.S. downstream profits dropped from $1,559 million in 2019 to a $(571) million loss in 2020 before rebounding to $2,389 million in 2021. International downstream, while not posting a loss, fell from $922 million in 2019 to $618 million in 2020, and then dropped further to $525 million in 2021. This reflects margin pressures and higher operating expenses, particularly outside the U.S.[2][9].\n\nThese operational swings drove Chevron’s net income. In 2019, the company earned $2,924 million. With the onset of pandemic-related disruptions and a crash in commodity prices, net income plummeted to a $(5,543) million loss in 2020. As global energy demand and prices recovered in 2021, net income surged to $15,625 million![Financial turnaround is led by a recovery in upstream earnings.](image1) This closely tracks the pattern of the company’s results: upstream results, which are highly sensitive to global commodity prices, were the leading factor shaping Chevron’s overall profitability[3].\n\nThe overall trend is clear: Chevron’s earnings were hit hard by the price-driven downturn of 2020, with both upstream and downstream operations suffering, particularly upstream. As energy prices rebounded in 2021, upstream earnings soared, downstream operations improved, and net income reached new highs![Steep drop in net income in 2020 followed by strong recovery in 2021.](image2)\n\nIn summary, Chevron’s financial performance from 2019 to 2021 was strongly influenced by the volatility in upstream operations caused by global oil and gas prices, leading to major net losses in 2020 and a record rebound in 2021."}

In contrast, the Operating (non-GAAP) effective tax rate for 2020 was (1.5)%, which, while still negative, is not as dramatically so as the GAAP figure.

This dramatic recovery in 2021 was mainly due to higher margins on refined product sales (increasing by $1.6 billion), greater earnings from the CPChem joint venture ($1.0 billion), and higher sales volumes ($470 million); these gains were only partially offset by higher operating expenses ($150 million) [9].

In 2019, net income was strong, but in 2020, it dropped dramatically, reflecting the pandemic’s adverse effects, before surging in 2021 to levels even higher than 2019. This recovery was linked with higher total revenue, driven by increased fees and mortgage banking noninterest income, despite lower net interest income primarily due to decreased loan balances and lower interest rates [6][7][8].\n\nThis evolution is captured well in the financial segment summary:\n![Consumer Banking and Lending net income increased sharply in 2021 after a decrease in 2020.](image3)\n\nOn the balance sheet, Consumer Banking and Lending loans declined between 2019 and 2021. The total loan balance dropped each year, influenced by elevated paydowns, lower origination activity, and specific actions like temporarily suspending certain mortgage and home equity products [9]. Home Lending and Small Business loan balances particularly declined, also affected by the decreased activity in PPP loans and non-conforming mortgages.\n\nConversely, total deposits saw substantial growth from 2019 through 2021. This increase was aided by higher liquidity and consumer savings, supported by government stimulus and payment programs during the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as a general rise in customer deposit behavior in an uncertain economic environment [3]. \n\nThis contrasting trend of rising deposits and declining loans is clear in the selected balance sheet data:\n![Consumer Banking and Lending’s loans declined and deposits grew strongly from 2019 to 2021.](image4)\n\nIn summary, from 2019 to 2021, net income for Consumer Banking and Lending dropped significantly in 2020 but rebounded even higher in 2021, loan balances steadily decreased, and deposits increased strongly over the period."}

During this time, average Card Member loans decreased before rebounding, while net interest income showed a modest increase by 2021 despite some underlying challenges.\n\nAverage Card Member loans for the company fell in 2020 before increasing again in 2021. Specifically, average loans were $13.3 billion in 2019, dropped to $12.9 billion in 2020, and then rose to $15.0 billion in 2021, signaling a recovery in consumer borrowing and lending activity as economic conditions improved after the disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nNet interest income followed a somewhat similar pattern but with a gentler trajectory. Net interest income amounted to $866 million in 2019, increased to $967 million in 2020, and then to $1,011 million in 2021. However, the net interest yield on average Card Member loans did not keep pace—declining over these years, primarily due to higher paydown rates and lower revolving balances, which reduced yields despite the increase in average loan balances by 2021.\n\n![Loans rebounded in 2021 after a dip in 2020 while net interest income increased modestly.](image4)\n\nThe implications for the company’s financial performance are multifaceted. The modest rise in net interest income from 2019 to 2021 helped offset some pressure from lower yields and higher paydown rates[6]. This resilience in net interest income, combined with the rebound in loan balances, improved overall revenue and pre-tax income. Meanwhile, improvements in credit quality—reflected in significant reductions in provisions for credit losses—further supported the company’s bottom line, allowing more of the growing revenues and net interest income to translate into profits[2][9].\n\nIn summary, average Card Member loans decreased and then recovered by 2021, while net interest income increased modestly, contributing to improved financial performance mainly due to strong credit quality and reductions in credit loss provisions."}

Specifically, for 2020, share-based compensation resulted in an increase of 1,118,284 Restricted Share Units and an addition of $79,522 to Additional Paid-in Capital. The total impact on equity from share-based compensation activities was $1,197,806, evidencing its notable contribution to the year’s equity changes [5]. Share-based compensation, while expensed on the income statement, is non-cash in nature and therefore added back to net income when reconciling to cash flow from operating activities.\n\nThe cash flow from operating activities directly strengthens Accenture’s cash position. In 2020, these activities began with the net income and were adjusted for non-cash items such as share-based compensation, depreciation, and amortization. Changes in working capital items (like receivables or payables) are included as well, to present the net cash provided by day-to-day operations. This inflow is a crucial source of liquidity, supporting operational needs, investments, and pay-outs such as dividends—all without requiring external financing.\n\n![Share-based compensation boosts additional paid-in capital and equity](image5)\nThis table shows that share-based compensation increased both Restricted Share Units and Additional Paid-in Capital, contributing $1,197,806 to equity, while the net income (the starting point for cash flow from operations) increased retained earnings by $5,107,839.\n\n![Cash flows from operating activities increase cash reserves](image2)\nHere, the details of the cash flow statement illustrate that the net income (boosted by share-based compensation and other non-cash adjustments) flows into Accenture’s overall cash and cash equivalents, providing the company with financial flexibility.\n\nIn summary, share-based compensation increases shareholders’ equity by boosting additional paid-in capital, and cash flow from operating activities increases Accenture plc’s cash reserves, both supporting the company’s financial strength in 2020."}

This rise was primarily due to higher profit before taxes (adjusted for non-cash items, including higher accruals for short-term incentive compensation), and lower payments for short-term incentive compensation, although it was partially offset by increased working capital requirements—specifically, increases in inventory and accounts receivable, with partial offsets from accounts payable and accrued expenses[9][2].\n\n![Cash flow from operating activities increased, reflecting stronger operational results and improved profitability.](image2)\n\nSimilarly, an examination of the consolidated balance sheet shows that total consolidated assets grew from 2020 to 2021. By referring to the assets section, the total consolidated assets for 2020 and 2021 can be seen to have increased, reflecting not only operational performance but also a potential accumulation of cash and investments, as well as perhaps the buildup of accounts receivable and inventory, which are consistent with stronger business activity and higher demand.\n\n![Total consolidated assets increased from 2020 to 2021, indicating business expansion and possibly higher working capital needs.](image3)\n\nThese changes suggest that the company experienced a period of improved operational efficiency and profitability in 2021.

The investing activities also show a large outflow ($10,529 million), corresponding to the shift from investment securities to loans. The entity's operating activities, however, produced significant positive cash flow ($14,645 million in 2021), underlining robust core earnings. Still, the reductions in cash and securities outpaced these inflows, leading to the lower year-end asset values.\n\n![The cash flow statement demonstrates major outflows from financing and investing activities, resulting in a notable year-over-year decrease in cash and cash equivalents.](image2)\n\nComprehensive income, which includes net income and changes in other comprehensive income (OCI) components such as unrealized gains/losses on securities and foreign currency adjustments, slightly influenced equity but did not offset the declines from asset redeployment. The retained earnings fell from $11,881 million to $11,495 million, and accumulated OCI was negative and remained similar, keeping total equity relatively stable compared to the reductions in assets and liabilities.\n\nIn summary, the significant decreases in both total assets and liabilities from 2020 to 2021 were primarily driven by a drop in cash, equivalents, and securities as the entity allocated more to receivables and loans, repaid debt, and experienced lower deposits. These changes are mirrored in the comprehensive income—which did not substantially offset the outflows—and are clearly shown by the outflows revealed in the cash flow statement. The entity's total assets and total liabilities both declined mainly due to a reduction in cash, equivalents, and investment securities, and these shifts are closely connected to cash outflows from investing and financing activities and to changes in core operating performance as reflected in comprehensive income."}

There were gross decreases as well, but these were smaller in scale and did not offset the increases significantly. ![Gross unrecognized tax benefits rose considerably from 2018 ($1,056M) to 2020 ($1,829M), with the most significant year-on-year increments in current year tax positions.](image4)\n\nRegarding common share repurchases, the company was active in buying back its stock in both 2019 and 2020. In 2019, it repurchased 22 million shares at an average price of $245.97 per share, totaling an aggregate cost of $5,500 million. In 2020, repurchases amounted to 14 million shares at a higher average price of $300.58 per share, with an aggregate cost of $4,250 million. These repurchases decreased the number of shares outstanding (which can increase earnings per share and return more value to remaining shareholders), and contributed to optimizing capital structure and offsetting dilution from share-based compensation. The reduction in board-authorized shares remaining—from 72 million in 2019 to 58 million in 2020—shows the ongoing commitment to these repurchase activities. ![The company repurchased 22 million shares ($5.5B) in 2019 and 14 million shares ($4.25B) in 2020, reducing shares outstanding and likely enhancing shareholder value.](image1)\n\nIn summary: The company’s gross unrecognized tax benefits rose from $1,056 million in 2018 to $1,829 million in 2020. Common share repurchases in 2019 and 2020 totaled $9.75 billion, reducing shares outstanding and enhancing shareholder returns."}

For leasehold improvements, the carrying amount was $81,765,000 at 30 June 2019, and it decreased to $19,815,000 by 28 June 2020. Hardware and software went from $3,332,000 to $2,125,000, and fixtures and fittings declined slightly from $5,802,000 to $5,059,000 over the same period. Several factors contributed to these changes: there were additions during the year, but significant depreciation charges and some impairment losses reduced the carrying amounts. For leasehold improvements, there was also a notably large decrease due to the transition to AASB 16, whereby many assets were derecognised and reclassified as right-of-use assets rather than being maintained as leasehold improvements.\n\n![Asset values and depreciation show reduction in carrying amounts for leasehold improvements, hardware/software, and fixtures and fittings, with a large drop for leasehold improvements due in part to the adoption of AASB 16.](image4)\n\nFor right-of-use assets, a new category arising from the adoption of AASB 16, the carrying amount at 1 July 2019 was $138,403,000, with additions of $48,793,000, lease re-measurements of $1,698,000, and negative exchange rate movements of -$1,755,000 affecting the cost. After deducting depreciation and impairments totaling -$37,454,000 and adding minor positive exchange rate adjustments, the carrying amount at 28 June 2020 was $150,464,000.

This sharp increase in 2019 was mainly due to a $2,472 million derecognition of a deferred tax asset linked to distributed intellectual property and a $(570) million benefit from newly established U.S. net deferred tax assets, both unique tax events not recurring in the subsequent years. These effects dissipated in 2020 and 2021, leading to lower, more normalized tax provisions and effective rates in those years.\n\n![2019's spike in tax provision and effective rate, with normalization in 2020 and 2021.](image2)\n\nFurther examination of the tax provision composition by jurisdiction shows that the federal deferred provision was a significant driver of the high total in 2019, with a $2,037 million deferred tax provision for that year. In contrast, 2020 and 2021 saw negative deferred provisions, indicating tax benefits or reductions in provision, contributing to lower overall tax expenses.

Throughout the year, there were inflows of $69.3 billion and outflows of $96.8 billion, with a positive market impact of $11.6 billion. However, the sale event resulted in a significant reduction: $587.1 billion was removed from the balance due to the sale, leaving nearly no WFAM assets under management on Wells Fargo’s books by year-end 2021.  \n![The sale of WFAM reduced AUM by $587.1 billion almost entirely removing managed assets.](image5)\n\nThis sale yielded broader effects on the company’s income. Wells Fargo realized a gain of $269 million from the transaction, directly increasing noninterest income in 2021[2][10]. This, coupled with other asset sales, contributed to a surge in total noninterest income, which more than doubled from the previous year.  \n![Noninterest income jumped substantially in 2021, partly due to the gain from the sale of WFAM.](image1)\n\nFurthermore, the sale of WFAM had implications for the company’s ongoing operations. Since asset-based fees from WFAM ceased, Wells Fargo recorded lower asset-based fees following the sale[3]. However, some related administrative services persisted through a transition services agreement, as Wells Fargo continued to administer certain assets under management and assets under administration at the buyer’s direction until June 2022[4].\n\nThe balance sheet also reflected the effects of this transaction. While total assets decreased slightly toward the end of 2021, in part due to the timing of cash deployment and asset rebalancing connected to these large divestitures, the cash position and equity securities saw some offsetting movement owing to the reallocation of capital post-sale[1].  \n![Total assets decreased modestly at year-end, illustrating asset rebalancing after the WFAM sale.](image3)\n\nIn conclusion, the sale of WFAM almost entirely removed related assets under management from Wells Fargo’s balance, generated a substantial gain that boosted noninterest income, and led to a decline in asset-based fee revenue, while modestly reducing total assets near year-end."}

According to the data, net interest income fell sharply by $5.5 billion to $43.4 billion in 2020, driven mainly by lower interest rates. Although the bank managed to reduce its deposit and funding costs and deployed excess deposits into securities to offset some of the decline, these measures were not enough to counteract the rate-driven reduction in overall interest income[6].\n\nA closer look at interest income and expense items reveals that the most significant drop came from a decrease of $19,747 million in total interest income, which was only partially offset by a $5,627 million reduction in interest expense. Interest-bearing deposits and other short-term investments also saw pronounced decreases in income, and while expense reductions were significant (especially with lower interest expense on deposits and other borrowings), the sharper drop in income led to a reduced net interest spread. This was further substantiated by the 53-basis-point decrease in net interest yield on a fully taxable-equivalent basis, landing at 1.90% for the year[6].\n\n![The table displays detailed changes, highlighting a substantial decrease in total interest income from 2019 to 2020, which exceeded the decrease in total interest expense.](image2)\n\nUnderlying these changes, the main contributing factors were:\n- Significant market-wide declines in interest rates, which lowered yields on earning assets more rapidly than the cost savings on liabilities.\n- Lower income from loans and securities despite growth in total deposit and loan balances, as rates on these assets plunged.\n- Reduced provision costs due to strategic management of funding and shifting of excess deposits into securities, though not sufficient to maintain net interest margins.\n- Asset and liability management (ALM) practices helped mitigate some pressures, but the environment of persistent low rates strongly compressed the spread.\n\nIn summary, the net interest spread narrowed significantly from 2019 to 2020, primarily due to a much larger decline in interest income relative to the decrease in interest expense, with the drop in market interest rates being the key driver."}

Sales volume and price realization positively contributed $3,076 million and $932 million, respectively, to the increase in operating profit, while increases in manufacturing costs and SG&A/R&D expenses subtracted $1,246 million and $1,021 million, respectively. Additional, though smaller, factors included positive impacts from Financial Products and miscellaneous items.[1]  \n![2021 saw a sharp rise in consolidated operating profit, with sales and price realization driving the increase.](image1)\n\nFor the ME&T segment specifically, 2021 adjusted operating profit margin was 13.7%, meeting the company’s long-term targets, while free cash flow for ME&T reached $6 billion, both consistent with management’s objectives[6][3]. This performance speaks to operational efficiency and effective cash management, especially in the context of ongoing investments in expanded offerings and sustainability.\n\nLooking at net cash provided by operating activities, there was a notable increase at the consolidated level: from $6.329 billion in 2020 to $7.200 billion in 2021—an $871 million improvement. This rise was primarily attributed to higher profit before taxes (adjusted for non-cash items) and lower payments for short-term incentive compensation, although partially offset by increased working capital needs, particularly in inventory and accounts receivable[5]. For ME&T alone, net cash from operating activities was also strong and aligned with leadership targets, reinforcing the robust cash-generating capacity of Caterpillar’s core segments.\n  \nThe detailed cash flow statement further supports this, visually demonstrating the enhancements in both operating profit and operating cash flows for the consolidated group and the ME&T segment.  \n![Cash flow summary table shows increases in net cash provided by operating activities at both the consolidated and ME&T levels from 2020 to 2021.](image2)\n\nIn summary, Caterpillar's consolidated operating profit and net cash provided by operating activities both increased in 2021 versus 2020, and these improvements were mirrored within the Machinery, Energy & Transportation segment."}

At the end of 2019, gross unrecognized tax benefits stood at $1,423 million, but by the end of 2020, this figure had risen to $1,829 million, an increase of approximately $406 million. This growth was primarily driven by $416 million of gross increases from current year tax positions and $120 million from prior year tax positions, partially offset by decreases related to prior year positions. The steady rise in unrecognized tax benefits can have implications for potential future tax expenses, regulatory scrutiny, and may impact the company’s effective tax rate due to greater uncertainty surrounding certain tax positions.![The table shows gross unrecognized tax benefits rising from $1,423 million in 2019 to $1,829 million in 2020.](image3)\n\nLooking at common share repurchases, there was a notable decrease from 2019 to 2020. In 2019, the company repurchased 22 million shares at an average price of $245.97, for an aggregate cost of $5.5 billion. By comparison, in 2020, only 14 million shares were repurchased, though at a significantly higher average price of $300.58, resulting in a lower aggregate cost of $4.25 billion. The number of board-authorized shares remaining decreased from 72 million at the end of 2019 to 58 million by year-end 2020, reflecting continued but reduced share repurchase activity. This decline in both the volume and total cost of repurchased shares suggests a more cautious approach, possibly in response to market conditions or an effort to strategically balance capital allocation.![In 2020, share repurchases fell to 14 million shares (from 22 million in 2019), at a higher average price; total cost declined from $5.5B to $4.25B.](image1)\n\nIn summary, between 2019 and 2020, the company’s gross unrecognized tax benefits increased by $406 million while common share repurchases decreased both in share volume and aggregate cost.

The primary driver was a significant increase in sales volume, which contributed $2,049 million to the growth, while favorable price realization added $507 million. Other influences, like financial products revenues and minor negative impacts from currency, also played a role, but were far less substantial.[10] ![Bar graph illustrates the major components of the $2,563 million increase in sales and revenues, highlighting sales volume and price realization as key drivers.](image1)\n\nOperating profit for the fourth quarter of 2021 was $1,611 million, an increase of $231 million or 17% compared with $1,380 million in the fourth quarter of 2020. This improvement in profitability was primarily due to the higher sales volume and favorable price realization, which more than offset increases in manufacturing costs, selling, general and administrative (SG&A), and research and development (R&D) expenses. Net restructuring income from the sale of a facility also contributed positively to operating profit.[7] ![Bar chart details the components contributing to the $231 million rise in operating profit, with higher sales volume and price realization offsetting cost increases.](image4)\n\nAn important context to these shifts is the behavior of dealer inventories. During Q4 2020, dealers significantly reduced inventories—about $1.1 billion—whereas in Q4 2021, inventories remained flat. This shift meant that sales in 2021 benefited from more stable or increased dealer inventory levels, thus aiding reported sales volume and revenues.[9]\n\nIn summary: Compared to the fourth quarter of 2020, the fourth quarter of 2021 saw higher sales volume and operating profit, mainly due to increased end-user demand, less aggressive dealer inventory reductions, and favorable pricing, with cost increases offset by revenue gains."}

In 2021, Chevron declared and paid significant cash dividends, seen as a deduction in stockholders’ equity. Specifically, the consolidated statement of equity highlights a substantial decrease in retained earnings due to dividends, as well as related per-share payment amounts. These payments are evident in the annual equity summary as a reduction in retained earnings and, subsequently, total equity[3]. \n\nAt the same time, treasury stock transactions—when the company repurchases its own shares—also impact equity by lowering the total Chevron Corporation Stockholders’ Equity. Treasury stock is accounted for at cost as a negative component in equity; additional purchases of treasury shares in 2021 increased this negative balance, thereby further reducing total equity[3]. Issuances or re-releases of treasury shares would decrease the negative treasury stock balance, but the provided data indicates the balance increased, showing more shares were repurchased than reissued.\n\nOn the cash flow side, both activities are significant uses of cash. Cash dividends paid out flow out under financing activities, representing a direct reduction to the cash balance. Likewise, the purchase of treasury shares is recorded as a cash outflow (investment) in financing activities. The consolidated cash flow statement for 2021 confirms that net cash used for financing activities was substantial, with cash dividend payments and treasury stock purchases being major components of these outflows![Significant financing cash outflows reflect dividend and treasury stock payments.](image4).\n\nTogether, 2021 saw Chevron’s equity structure decrease via reduced retained earnings (due to cash dividends) and a larger treasury stock (from share repurchases), while cash balances were also diminished due to these outflows; this is clearly summarized in the statements of equity and cash flows![Dividends reduced retained earnings and treasury stock purchases reduced equity, both shown in the changing equity breakdown.](image3).\n\nIn summary: In 2021, cash dividends reduced retained earnings and total equity, while treasury stock purchases increased the treasury stock balance, further lowering equity; both resulted in significant cash outflows under financing activities."}

Previously, operating leases were not recognized on the balance sheet, but adoption of AASB 16 required the Group to recognize both a right-of-use asset and a corresponding lease liability for leases as the lessee, with payments due under the lease now recognized as liabilities rather than as straight-line rent provisions or incentives [10][4]. Upon transition, lease liabilities related to operating leases were measured at the present value of the remaining lease payments, discounted using the Group’s incremental borrowing rate as at 1 July 2019 [8].\n\nThis accounting change resulted in the initial recognition of a significant lease liability balance on the Group’s statement of financial position: on 1 July 2019, the lease liability recognized upon initial application of AASB 16 was $143,621,000. During the year, additional lease liabilities of $50,245,000 arose, re-measurements of $1,559,000 occurred, and lease payments of $31,886,000 were made. After accounting for interest and exchange rate effects, the balance at 28 June 2020 stood at $167,154,000, of which $36,019,000 was current and $131,135,000 non-current.

ClickSoftware’s acquisition had a much higher overall value, with goodwill and identifiable intangible assets dominating the allocation (notably, developed technology and customer relationships), whereas Salesforce.org’s allocation was much smaller and included a deferred tax asset rather than significant intangible assets. Also, the respective liabilities and deferred revenue accounted for a materially larger proportion relative to the net assets in Salesforce.org’s case, likely reflecting different operating models or financial profiles.\n\nTo summarize: The main similarity is that both acquisitions allocated substantial value to goodwill, primarily due to workforce and market opportunity expectations, and both applied preliminary management estimates subject to adjustment.

The reported GAAP measure reflects the raw financial results under standard accounting rules, while the core non-GAAP measure adjusts for significant items to demonstrate underlying operational performance.\n\nIn 2020, the reported GAAP % change for PBNA was 4%. This growth number is directly affected by several key factors. First, there was a noticeable negative impact from acquisitions and divestitures, specifically a -2% effect on the reported change, likely reflecting portfolio adjustments. Furthermore, the organic % change as a non-GAAP measure, which removes the volatility from acquisitions, divestitures, and foreign exchange, was softer at 2%. Influencing organic growth were volume declines (-1%) and positive net pricing interventions that slightly mitigated those volume effects, indicating strategic pricing decisions amidst fluctuating demand![PBNA reported 4% growth amid -2% impact from acquisitions/divestitures; organic growth was 2% with -1% volume and positive pricing effect.](image1).\n\nThe transition from GAAP to the core non-GAAP measure for PBNA further clarifies what drove performance. In addition to the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, the business experienced restructuring and impairment charges. This context is enriched by adjustments for mark-to-market impacts and charges related to integration activities, all of which are backed out for the core performance metric. As shown in the adjustments table, PBNA’s performance on a core, non-GAAP basis reflects the intention to strip out one-time or non-operational effects to highlight the ongoing health of the segment![Adjustments for PBNA include mark-to-market, restructuring, and integration charges for core, non-GAAP metrics.](image4).\n\nTherefore, from 2019 to 2020, PBNA’s reported GAAP measure increased by 4%, while the core non-GAAP measure presented a lower, more normalized growth once factors such as acquisitions/divestitures, mark-to-market impacts, and restructuring/impairment charges were adjusted out. The main drivers behind these changes were the negative impact of business portfolio actions and volume declines, with some offsetting from pricing strategies and operational adjustments, as highlighted by the various layers of financial reporting.\n\nIn summary, PBNA saw a 4% increase in its reported GAAP measure and a 2% increase in its core non-GAAP (organic) measure in 2020 versus 2019, with the results shaped by acquisition/divestiture activity, strategic pricing, volume trends, and adjustments for mark-to-market and restructuring impacts."}

This decrease was mainly due to unfavorable currency movements and increases in working capital requirements, offset in part by higher net earnings excluding certain non-cash charges[10]. The positive effect of selling trade receivables also contributed to operating cash flow, as proceeds were included in operating activities[1][3].\n\nLooking at investing activities, the net cash used was $1,200 million in 2020, a significant decrease from the $1,900 million used in 2019. The lower outflow was primarily due to reduced capital expenditures and the absence of large cash outflows related to the deconsolidation of RBH that occurred in 2019[9]. Capital expenditures in 2020 were $602 million, down from $852 million the year prior, largely related to ongoing investments in reduced-risk products (RRPs)[7].\n\nIn financing activities, net cash used increased to $8,496 million in 2020 from $8,061 million in 2019, largely due to higher payments to noncontrolling interests and higher dividend payouts, partially offset by changes in debt activity[4].\n\nThese changes can be visualized in the summary cash flow tables below:\n![2020 operating and investing cash flows and their components contributed to ending balance calculation.](image2)\n![Net cash used in financing, and the reconciliation to year-end cash balances, 2020 vs 2019.](image3)\n\nFrom these numbers, we see the change in year-end cash: The cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash balance increased from $6,865 million at the end of 2019 to $7,285 million at the end of 2020. This net increase of $420 million is the result of slightly decreased operating cash inflow, significantly lower investing outflow, and increased financing outflow, along with a positive effect from exchange rate changes.\n\nIn summary, despite a decrease in cash from operating activities and higher financing outflows, the overall cash balance at year-end 2020 increased compared to 2019, primarily due to a substantial reduction in net cash used in investing activities and a positive foreign exchange translation effect."}

The evaluation for annual total remuneration is based on a combination of three main criteria: consolidated operating income, volatility of Toyota’s share price, and individual performance evaluation. Consolidated operating income serves as an indicator of business performance, reflecting the company’s operational success, while volatility of the share price acts as a measure of corporate value from the perspective of shareholders and investors. Individual performance evaluation addresses qualitative aspects of each director’s contributions. ![Toyota links pay to consolidated operating income, share price volatility, and individual performance.](image1)\n\nThe evaluation framework assigns an equal 50% weight to consolidated operating income and the volatility of Toyota’s share price. The attainment of consolidated operating income is benchmarked against a reference value targeted for sustainable growth, while share price volatility is compared to the Nikkei stock average, thus encompassing both financial achievements and market perception. ![Evaluation gives 50% weight to both operating income and share price volatility for remuneration decisions.](image3)\n\nRemuneration is not only linked to overall corporate performance but is also adjusted for individual job responsibilities, home country standards, and performance. Fixed remuneration ensures stability, while the performance-linked component fluctuates based on the aforementioned indicators. This blend of fixed and performance-based pay helps Toyota secure talent while maintaining an explicit tie between executive rewards and company accomplishments, aligning executives’ incentives with both business success and shareholder interests [2][3][10].\n\nIn summary, Toyota’s executive remuneration systematically incorporates business performance and shareholder value through weighted evaluation of operating income and share price volatility, aligning executive incentives with corporate results and investor interests."}

Net income for this segment also dropped significantly—from $4,251 million in 2019 to $3,075 million in 2020, a 28% decrease. This decline in revenue was largely attributed to the impact of lower interest rates and lower net interest income, though it was partially offset by a slight increase in noninterest income, especially from investment and brokerage services[5][3]. The negative effects of the pandemic—affecting market conditions and client activity—played a major role in these decreases.\n\n![GWIM revenue and net income both fell from 2019 to 2020, with a marked decline in net income.](image3)\n\n![Detailed breakdown shows both sub-businesses (MLGWM and Private Bank) had lower revenues in 2020, though client balances increased.](image2)\n\nMeanwhile, in the Consumer Banking segment, revenue and net income both experienced declines as well. Net income for Consumer Banking was halved, dropping $6.5 billion to $6.5 billion in 2020 from $13.0 billion in 2019. Revenue fell due to lower interest rates (reducing net interest income), higher credit loss provisions, and lower noninterest income from services and card activity, which all reflected the impact of the macroeconomic environment and COVID-19 on consumer spending and behavior[8]. While deposits and digital user engagement grew, core profitability was weaker.\n\nTherefore, both GWIM and Consumer Banking segments experienced declines in revenue and net income in 2020 compared to 2019, but Consumer Banking saw a steeper fall in net income, influenced largely by macroeconomic pressures and credit losses stemming from the pandemic.\n\nIn summary: Both segments had lower revenue and net income in 2020 vs. 2019, but the decline in net income was sharper in Consumer Banking than in Global Wealth & Investment Management."}

At the same time, Operational Risk RWA slightly decreased due to fewer and less severe litigation-related losses![Components of RWA change—credit and market risk increases drive total RWA higher, operational risk declines slightly.](image3)[5][6][9].\n\nWith these RWA changes, the denominator for the TLAC-to-RWA ratio grew substantially. Looking at TLAC requirements and actuals, the total dollar amount of external TLAC rose from $196,888 million in 2019 to $216,129 million in 2020. However, the TLAC as a percentage of RWA actually decreased, from 49.9% in 2019 to 47.7% in 2020, precisely because RWA grew faster than TLAC itself. This illustrates the mechanical relationship: when the denominator (RWA) increases more rapidly than the numerator (TLAC dollars), the ratio declines![TLAC as a percentage of RWA declines from 2019 to 2020 as RWA grows faster than TLAC.](image5).\n\nIn summary, the increase in RWA—due to heightened credit and market risk exposures—resulted in a decrease in the TLAC as a percentage of RWA from 49.9% in 2019 to 47.7% in 2020, despite an absolute increase in TLAC resources."}

However, in 2020, the U.S. segment's share grew to 41%, and the International Operated Markets segment's share fell sharply to 50%, with International Developmental Licensed Markets & Corporate remaining at 9%. This significant shift reflects divergent impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic across regions.  \n![The U.S. segment gained proportion in total revenue composition in 2020, while International Markets shrank.](image4)\n\nGrowth rates underscore these changes: the U.S. segment saw a slight decline in revenues of only 2% in 2020, representing relative resilience, while the International Operated Markets segment suffered a much steeper drop of 17% in total revenues, and a 19% drop in company-operated sales. In contrast, International Developmental Licensed Markets & Corporate revenues fell by 5%.  \n![International Operated Markets experienced the largest revenue percentage decline in 2020, while the U.S. was stable.](image3)  \nThis is corroborated by comparable sales trends, where the U.S. held steady (+0.4%), but International Operated Markets plummeted (−15.0%), driven by major declines in the U.K., France, Germany, Italy, and Spain; meanwhile, International Developmental Licensed Markets also decreased (−10.5%) [2].\n\nThese changes were influenced mainly by the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to widespread temporary closures and operational restrictions internationally, especially in Europe, depressing both sales and company-operated revenues [1][3]. The U.S. segment was cushioned by relatively positive sales performance, strategic marketing investments such as free Thank You Meals for first responders, and support to accelerate recovery [1][4]. The number of drive-thru locations also mitigated some declines, particularly in the U.S., where such channels were more common [3].

The company placed strong emphasis on identifying prime retail sites in high-traffic shopping centers across a diverse set of countries and regions, following a proven model that enabled fast and cost-efficient store rollouts. This is evidenced by the continuous increase in store numbers—from 250 in 2016 to 435 by 2020—across Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, South Africa, Malaysia, the United Kingdom, France, the USA, and various franchise regions in the Middle East and Vietnam. The expansion spanned both company owned and franchised outlets, with notable achievements in opening 47 stores outside Australia in the most recent year of reporting, including rapid rollouts in key Northern Hemisphere markets like the UK, France, and the USA, and maintaining a trajectory of targeting at least one new trial territory annually[4].\n\n![Bar chart of store counts demonstrates consistent international expansion, growing total stores from 250 in 2016 to 435 in 2020.](image5)\n\nLovisa’s strategy balanced opportunism and prudence: before entering new markets, regions were thoroughly assessed for suitability, leveraging local expertise to build initial footprints. This flexible approach allowed Lovisa to accelerate entry when opportunities arose or defer expansion if conditions were not optimal. Key strategic pillars included optimizing global supply chains—streamlining processes and consolidating suppliers—to maintain gross margins even as the company scaled rapidly overseas, as well as aggressively enhancing existing store performance by rolling out customer loyalty initiatives like in-store piercing services[1][2][4].\n\n![Summary of expansion, supply chain optimization, and pillar strategies, along with risks and achievements by growth area.](image4)\n\nHowever, the expansion was not without challenges. Intense competition in the global fast fashion jewelry sector, ever-changing consumer preferences, and disruptions introduced by events like COVID-19 posed constant threats. The company also faced operational risks such as finding suitable high-traffic retail sites and navigating retail leasing constraints during volatile periods. To mitigate competitive threats, Lovisa invested in its product and supply chain teams and refined its store model to allow rapid fit-outs—approximately 14 days per new store—while maintaining a consistent and recognizable retail format globally[9][7][8].\n\nFinancially, this expansion-driven strategy fueled robust growth, with group revenue rising from $25.5 million in FY2011 to $242.2 million in FY2020, despite pandemic impacts[5]. Investments in property, plant, and equipment increased significantly, underscoring ongoing capital commitment to network development.[1][10] Gross margins remained high, although dipped slightly in FY20 due to global challenges, reflecting operational resilience despite external shocks.\n\nIn summary, Lovisa’s international store expansion from 2016 to 2020 was marked by rapid, strategic growth into multiple new territories, supported by disciplined site selection, supply chain optimization, and a nimble, opportunity-driven approach. The critical achievements include more than doubling the global footprint and maintaining profitability across markets; major challenges included navigating fierce market competition, adapting to fast-changing retail conditions, and managing risk during periods of disruption.\n\nLovisa’s international store network grew substantially from 2016 to 2020 through targeted expansion, innovative operational strategies, and overcoming competitive and external challenges."}

Railroad operating earnings grew accordingly, as pre-tax earnings rose from $6.8 billion in 2020 to $7.9 billion in 2021, and net earnings increased from $5,161 million to $5,990 million in the same period. This growth was driven by higher volumes, up 6.9%, and increased average revenue per car/unit by 3.5%, the latter a result of favorable business mix and higher fuel surcharge revenues due to rising fuel prices. The industry’s rebound was attributed to continued recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic’s impact in 2020, with improvements in both domestic and export demand, especially visible in agricultural and coal product carloads, which rose 2.9% and 8.9%, respectively. However, the year was still somewhat hindered by ongoing global supply chain disruptions[7][4][5][10]. ![Railroad operating earnings and revenue increased from 2020 to 2021, reflecting higher volumes and pre-tax/net earnings.](image1) ![Total railroad cars/units handled rose by 6.9% from 2020 to 2021, with significant gains in coal and consumer products.](image3)\n\nIn contrast, net investment income dropped from $5,039 million in 2020 to $4,807 million in 2021, a decrease of 5%. The main driver was a sharp decrease in interest and other investment income, which plummeted by 44.4% ($1,059 million to $589 million) due to persistently low short-term interest rates, reducing returns on short-term and fixed-maturity investments. On the other hand, dividend income rose by 3.5%, softening the overall decline. These dynamics are clearly depicted in the financial data table: ![Net investment income decreased by 5% from 2020 to 2021, with a sharp decline in interest and other investment income partially offset by increased dividend income.](image2) The company maintained substantial liquidity in cash and Treasury bills, prioritizing safety over yield, which also contributed to the lower interest income[2][9].\n\nIn summary: From 2020 to 2021, railroad operating earnings increased because of post-pandemic volume rebounds and higher per-unit revenues, while net investment income declined due to much lower returns from interest-bearing assets amid a low-rate environment."}

Similarly, total operating lease liabilities rose from $797 million to $974 million, with increases seen in both current and long-term liabilities. This change indicates that the company took on more leased properties or equipment in 2020, possibly to support expanded operations or new acquisitions. The weighted average lease term remained steady at 7 years, while the weighted average discount rate slightly decreased from 3.1% to 2.8%. These factors would result in higher annual rent expenses and future cash flow obligations related to lease commitments, thereby increasing both assets and liabilities on the balance sheet. ![Company operating lease assets and liabilities rose significantly from 2019 to 2020.](image4)\n\nInventories also saw a notable rise across all categories.

The total inventory summed up to $2,292 million in 2020, compared to $1,628 million in 2019. This indicates the company either produced and held more products in anticipation of greater demand, especially as described in reports of strong market growth and acquisitions like Cytiva, or faced slower inventory turnover due to changes in supply chain or market conditions.

The valuation allowance decreased by $1 million from $180 million to $179 million, so most of the shift in the net deferred tax asset was not due to a material change in valuation allowances. Rather, the reduction in deferred tax liabilities—from $363 million in 2019 to $213 million in 2020—played the largest role in the rise in the net deferred tax asset.\n\n![Net deferred tax assets rose significantly, driven by decreased deferred tax liabilities rather than large movements in assets or valuation allowances.](image2)\n\nSupporting this, the more general summary confirms those figures, showing an increase in deferred tax assets from $197 million to $343 million but, more importantly, a reduction in deferred tax liabilities from $78 million to $90 million, culminating in the net increase cited above.\n\n![The net deferred tax asset more than doubled from $119 million in 2019 to $253 million in 2020.](image3)\n\nFurther evidence is provided regarding uncertain tax positions. In 2020, there was a $249 million reduction for tax positions of prior years, reflecting a tax benefit from the settlement of a depreciation-related uncertain tax position. This also caused a reversal of $46 million in accrued interest, with a dramatic drop in the year-end balance for such liabilities from $303 million in 2019 to $89 million in 2020. This effective settlement and reversal of previously accrued liabilities favorably impacted the net deferred tax asset by reducing related deferred tax liabilities and uncertainties.\n\n![Settlement of significant uncertain tax positions reduced related liabilities and contributed to the net deferred tax asset increase.](image4)\n\nIn summary, the sharp increase in the net deferred tax asset from 2019 to 2020 primarily resulted from the effective settlement and reduction of certain uncertain tax positions, and a sizable decrease in deferred tax liabilities, while deferred tax assets and valuation allowances remained relatively stable."}

This brought their total holdings from 4,140,000 shares at the start of FY20 to 5,827,764 shares at year’s end, with no shares sold in the period.

In 2019, general and administrative expenses represented 57% of operating expenses, and this grew to 60% by 2021. Meanwhile, selling and marketing expenses dropped from 43% to 40% of the total.

This stability in long-term debt aligns with the decrease in overall company debt, which dropped from $62,899 million to $61,538 million, and a more notable decline in Global Financing segment debt from $24,727 million to $21,167 million ![Overall company debt decreased, and Global Financing segment debt dropped substantially in 2020.](image4).\n\nCash flow analysis provides further context. Net cash from operating activities increased from $14,770 million in 2019 to $18,197 million in 2020, suggesting stronger core business performance. However, net cash used in investing activities decreased sharply, mainly because there was no major outlay like the Red Hat acquisition in 2020. Crucially, financing activities saw a dramatic shift from a net source of $9,042 million in 2019 to a net use of $9,721 million in 2020, reflecting reduced borrowing and possible debt repayments ![Net cash from operations increased, while investing needs declined and financing activities shifted from a source to a use of cash.](image3).\n\nOn the equity side, total equity decreased by $258 million over the year, driven by large dividend payments and negative currency translation, partially offset by net income gains [7].

However, equity declined mainly due to dividends, and significant net cash was used in financing—signaling a cautious but stable approach to managing financial resources and obligations.\n\nIBM’s financial standing in 2020 shows increased noncurrent assets and steady long-term debt, paired with lower overall debt and healthy operational cash flows, while equity declined chiefly because of dividend distributions."}

For coal and nickel, changes in market prices can have immediate and measurable financial impacts. A US$1 per ton increase in the price of metallurgical coal raises profit after taxation by $24 million and underlying EBITDA by $35 million, while the same price increase in energy coal leads to smaller, but still notable, improvements. Similarly, a US cent per pound increase in nickel price results in $1 million higher profit after taxation and underlying EBITDA. ![A financial table quantifies the impact of unitary price increases in major commodities on BHP's profit and EBITDA, including coal and nickel.](image1)\n\nThe underlying mechanisms behind these impacts are multifaceted. For coal, BHP's financial results in FY2021 were negatively affected by lower realised prices, resulting in a steep decline in underlying EBITDA from $1,632 million in 2020 to $288 million in 2021. At the same time, while production volumes of metallurgical coal were steady, energy coal production fell, and the average realised price for metallurgical coal dropped significantly from $130.97 per tonne to $106.64 per tonne over the year. ![The financial and production data table shows a sharp decrease in underlying EBITDA for coal, reduced realised prices, and steady to declining production volumes year-over-year.](image2)\n\nBreaking this down further, the Queensland Coal operations saw reduced revenue and a substantial decline in underlying EBITDA, accompanied by an increase in cost per tonne from $67.59 to $81.81. This was driven by higher maintenance and stripping costs, partially offset by cost-saving measures. NSW Energy Coal also recorded rising costs and deeper negative EBITDA. ![A comparative table reveals decreased revenue, falling EBITDA, and rising per-tonne costs for both Queensland Coal and NSWEC, highlighting profitability pressures.](image5)\n\nNickel, on the other hand, benefited from both higher volumes and surging prices, with average realised sales prices climbing from $13,860 per tonne in FY2020 to $16,250 in FY2021. This price boost, coupled with operational improvements and lower costs, supported a US$296 million improvement in Nickel West’s underlying EBITDA. Growing demand, positive investor sentiment, and regional supply disruptions bolstered the nickel market, although stronger prices also increased third-party concentrate purchase costs, partially offsetting gains.[1][10]\n\nIn summary, changes in coal and nickel prices directly move BHP’s profits and EBITDA, with coal suffering from price and cost pressures in FY2021 while nickel benefited from strong pricing and demand. The key drivers are market prices, production volumes, operational costs, and external factors like currency exchange rates and broader demand-supply shifts. These elements, combined, explain the significant financial sensitivity to commodity price movements."}

This growth was supported by issuing new shares, which provided financing for key acquisitions, like Varian, as indicated by a €53 million increase in issued capital and a related €2,275 million addition to the capital reserve[6]. These changes directly reflect the March 2021 capital increase, which was executed by issuing 53,000,000 new ordinary shares to institutional investors, raising the issued capital from €1,075 million to €1,128 million[4][7]. The capital increase led to a higher capital reserve, given that shares were placed at a significant price premium over their notional value.\n\nIn tandem with the capital increase, comprehensive income for the periods also contributed notably to equity growth. Net income, as part of total comprehensive income, rose from €1,423 million in 2020 to €1,746 million in 2021, which, together with positive other comprehensive income, resulted in an increase in total comprehensive income to €2,446 million in 2021 from €825 million in 2020.\n\n![The table displays comprehensive income data, showing significant jumps in net and comprehensive income, particularly in 2021.](image1)\n\nAnother material movement was the change in capital reserves and retained earnings.

The increase was 26% year-over-year, which translated to a substantial rise in the company's overall revenues net of interest expense[2]. This growth in discount revenue was mainly driven by a surge in Card Member spending, aligning with the broader economic recovery from the adverse impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly as consumer and commercial activity rebounded[2][1].\n\nFurther supporting this, the uptick in worldwide network volumes—up 24% over the prior year—was crucial, with U.S. network volumes increasing by 27% and non-U.S. volumes by 17%. This growth in transaction volumes directly led to higher discount revenues[5]. Notably, net card fees and other fee-based revenues also increased, providing an additional boost but to a lesser extent than discount revenues[2]. The growth was bolstered by both the continued recovery of general goods and services (G&S) spending and the sharp rebound in travel and entertainment (T&E)-related volumes, which lifted both the volume and value of transactions processed through the network[6].\n\nAdditionally, a modest increase in the average discount rate—from 2.28% in 2020 to 2.30% in 2021—contributed to the rise in discount revenue. This was primarily due to a favorable shift in the spending mix, with increased proportions of higher-yielding T&E-related transactions[7].\n\nThe direct financial figures confirm this trend, with the table of revenue categories showing the increase in discount revenue between 2020 and 2021, illustrating its dominant role in driving company performance during this period.\n![Discount revenue rose sharply in 2021 as Card Member spending and network volumes recovered, supported by a slight increase in average discount rate.](image4)\n\nIn summary, discount revenue increased by 26% from 2020 to 2021, primarily due to higher Card Member spending, a strong rebound in network volumes globally, especially in the U.S., and a small rise in the average discount rate, all reflecting the recovery from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic."}

The largest drivers include higher operating income, which jumped from $17,493 million in 2020 to $20,817 million in 2021, as well as a notable rise in proceeds from investments and other sources, which soared from $190 million in 2020 to $1,246 million in 2021. Additionally, payments of income taxes decreased by $555 million year over year, further supporting the increase in operating cash flow.

Operating income improved due primarily to the recovery and growth across segments, notably the theme parks returning to full operation and enhanced media and studio revenues as production and events, like the Tokyo Olympics, resumed and expanded[10].

In 2016, the total was a net benefit of $(26) million, in 2017 it grew to an expense of $144 million, and in 2018 it increased further to $207 million.

The company also referenced higher defined benefit pension and postretirement service cost expenses and lower non-service cost component income as factors contributing to this total expense increase [4]. Supplementing this, it’s specifically noted that for 2018, defined benefit pre-tax pension and post retirement service cost expense was $483 million with a $73 million benefit from non-service items, totaling a defined benefit pre-tax pension and postretirement expense of $410 million—up from $334 million in 2017 [10].\n\nThus, the financial data and narrative indicate that the total net expense changed from a benefit of $(26) million in 2016 to an expense of $207 million in 2018, which is a clear increase.\n\nIn summary: The total net expense increased by $233 million from a $(26) million net benefit in 2016 to a $207 million net expense in 2018."}

This improvement was primarily attributed to the reduction and sales of financing receivables, which bolstered cash inflow from operations [5]. \n\nCash used in investing activities dropped sharply, with a decrease from $(26,936) million in 2019 to $(3,028) million in 2020. This $23,908 million change was mainly driven by substantially less cash being deployed for acquisitions (notably the absence of a large acquisition like Red Hat in 2020 compared to the prior year), partially offset by reduced inflow from the wind-down of financing operations and modest increases in investment purchases [2][3]. \n\nFinancing activities also swung dramatically: in 2019, financing was a net source of cash at $9,042 million, while in 2020 it became a net use of cash at $(9,721) million. This $18,763 million reversal was principally due to an emphasis on debt repayment and the suspension of share repurchases post-Red Hat acquisition [1][5]. \n\nThe culmination of these changes yielded a $5,361 million increase in net cash, shifting from a $3,290 million decrease in 2019 to a positive net change in 2020.

The plan sketched the closure of between 1,000 and 1,200 stores over the two-year period of 2020 and 2021, with an emphasis on consolidating sales into local flagship shops and online channels. The result was a substantial number of stores closed or absorbed, especially where their continued operation was less efficient or redundant. Additionally, these changes were accelerated by the lasting impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, which forced up to 90% of stores to close at peak and continued to restrict openings into late 2020, pressing the company to reevaluate physical store needs and further promote digital and local flagship sales strategies[1][4][10].\n\nIn summary: From 2021 to 2022, Inditex reduced its overall store count and adjusted distribution across all regions, primarily due to its store optimization program targeting less viable and aging stores and the ongoing effects of pandemic-era disruptions."}

This direct or indirect approach provides flexibility and responsiveness, which is particularly necessary in pandemic scenarios to ensure timely aid and compliance with government guidelines as highlighted by the effective disbursement of funds through the Public Financial Management System [4].\n\nIn contrast, the Rural Development projects are more localized, generally focusing on specific villages or districts within states like Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar, and several others. Each rural project, as detailed in the HRDP initiative, has a much smaller financial footprint—rarely exceeding ₹2 crore per initiative. Their implementation is uniformly indirect, carried out through partnerships with agencies such as the Sanjeevani Institute for Empowerment & Development or the BAIF Development Research Foundation, all with registered CSR numbers, emphasizing adherence to corporate collaboration guidelines and regulatory compliance.\n\n![COVID Relief projects receive major funding and are implemented both directly and via multiple agencies across India.](image1)\n\n![Rural Development projects have lower budgets per initiative and are always implemented indirectly through local agencies.](image4)\n\nIn summary, COVID Relief projects involve much higher expenditures and are implemented both directly and through agencies, often at a national scale, while Rural Development projects are smaller in scale, financially modest, focused on specific regions, and always implemented indirectly via local partners."}

This upward trend mirrors consistent growth in net earnings, which rose from $12,382 million in 2018 to $15,769 million in 2020, providing the primary driver of higher comprehensive income. The gains in net earnings were supported by significant increases in consolidated revenues—total revenues grew from $226,247 million in 2018 to $257,141 million in 2020—and improved performance across major business segments, with operating earnings up by 14% in 2020, and Optum segment revenues in particular growing by 21% that year[1].\n\n![UnitedHealth Group’s comprehensive income increased every year from 2018 to 2020, rising from $10,865 million to $15,533 million.](image5)\n\nHowever, comprehensive income was also influenced by movements in other comprehensive income (OCI), which includes unrealized gains/losses on investment securities and foreign currency translation adjustments.

The impact of inflation was significant: 2022 saw higher-than-usual inflation affecting merchandise costs, challenging the company's ability to maintain margins[3][10]. In response, Costco leaned on pricing strategies designed to maintain its competitive price image—sometimes choosing not to pass cost increases onto members, accepting lower margins instead[3]. Furthermore, a notable 19 basis-point reduction in margin was attributed to a LIFO charge for higher merchandise costs, and increased $2\\%$ rewards also negatively impacted the margin[1][5]. \n\nGasoline sales, although increasing overall net sales through higher prices and volumes, lowered the gross margin percentage due to their inherently lower margins compared to other business lines. This shift in sales mix toward gasoline further contributed to the margin decline[2][5][7]. On the positive side, ceasing incremental COVID-19 wages slightly offset the downward pressure on margins, but it was not enough to counter the overall decline[1][5].\n\nIn summary:  \nGross margin percentage fell from 10.04% in 2020 to 8.88% in 2022, mainly due to margin pressure in core merchandise (especially foods), inflation-driven cost increases, pricing strategies to maintain competitiveness, higher LIFO charges, increased rewards, and a rising share of lower-margin gasoline sales[1][3][5][6][7]."}

Key adjustments applied were amortization of intangible assets (3,419 million USD) and other items (344 million USD), resulting in a core COGS of –7,988 million USD. This reduction in recognized costs led to a higher core gross profit of 35,981 million USD, up from the IFRS result of 32,218 million USD. The main drivers of this adjustment were amortization and other non-core items being excluded from core costs, thereby improving the gross profit figure.[3]  \n![Adjustments to 'Cost of Goods Sold' for 2021 elevated core gross profit compared to IFRS results by excluding items like amortization and other exceptional charges.](image3)\n\nIn contrast, for 2020, COGS under IFRS was –13,379 million USD (as referenced in the corresponding table). Adjustments—primarily from amortization, impairments, acquisition/divestment effects, and other items—reduced the reported costs, leading to a core COGS of –12,034 million USD. The resulting core gross profit was 33,275 million USD, higher than the IFRS gross profit of 29,896 million USD. These adjustments similarly excluded significant amortization and exceptional costs, which improved the core result.[4]\n![In 2020, adjustments to 'Cost of Goods Sold' also significantly increased core gross profit over IFRS, mainly via amortization and one-off expense exclusions.](image4)\n\nComparing the two years, the nature of adjustments remained consistent, with amortization of intangible assets making up the largest portion. However, the absolute value of these adjustments was greater in 2021 (notably for amortization), leading both to a sharper reduction in COGS and a more substantial increase from IFRS to core gross profit. This demonstrates a year-on-year amplification in the magnitude of core adjustments.\n\nIn summary: Adjustments to 'Cost of Goods Sold,' primarily by excluding amortization of intangible assets and other exceptional items, led to a greater increase in core gross profit in 2021 compared to 2020."}

This change reflects a combination of movements in retained earnings and accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI). \n\nRetained earnings fell from $11,881 million at the end of 2020 to $11,495 million in 2021, a decrease of $386 million despite strong net income for the year. This suggests that net income ($8,060 million in 2021) was more than offset by dividend distributions and potentially share repurchases, both of which reduce retained earnings. The equity statement confirms ordinary patterns of dividends and buybacks as drivers of retained earnings changes[5].\n\nAOCI, which encompasses unrealized gains and losses from debt securities, foreign currency translation, and pension benefits, moved further negative, from $(2,895) million in 2020 to $(2,945) million in 2021. The primary drivers here were increased losses in foreign currency translation adjustments and a drop in net unrealized gains on debt securities. Specifically, foreign currency translation adjustments worsened by $163 million and unrealized gains on debt securities decreased by $42 million, while there was a partial offset from improved pension and postretirement benefit adjustments (+$155 million)[1][2]. Thus, AOCI contributed a further reduction to overall equity.\n\n![Shareholders’ equity decreased mainly due to declines in retained earnings and accumulated other comprehensive income.](image4)\n\nDespite this decrease in equity, the company's total assets only declined marginally, from $191,367 million in 2020 to $188,548 million in 2021. The reduction in equity did not substantially impair the company's overall financial stability, and the business continued generating substantial net income.\n\nThe translation of foreign-currency-denominated assets and liabilities also played a role in AOCI. Adjustments arising from currency changes and results of hedging activities are included in AOCI and only reclassified to earnings in case of significant changes in foreign operations[1]. With foreign currency translation adjustments negative and deepening in 2021, this component negatively impacted overall equity.\n\nIn summary, from 2020 to 2021, shareholders’ equity mainly decreased because retained earnings dropped (due to outflows for dividends and share repurchases despite high net income) and accumulated other comprehensive income became more negative (due to foreign currency translation losses and lower unrealized securities gains). This slightly reduced the company’s financial flexibility but did not indicate deteriorating operational strength, given strong profitability.\n\nThe changes in shareholders’ equity between 2020 and 2021, especially the decline in retained earnings and further negative comprehensive income, modestly reduced the company’s financial position but did not undermine its solid earnings performance."}

Significant growth was observed in categories such as goodwill and intangible assets ($5,761 million to $5,783 million), other retiree benefits ($645 million to $1,031 million), and unrealized gain on financial and foreign exchange transactions ($111 million to $439 million), contributing to the overall increase [2].\n\n![Deferred tax assets decreased while liabilities increased, indicating a shift towards higher net deferred tax liabilities.](image3)\n\n![Deferred tax liabilities rose across several key categories, underlying a less favorable deferred tax position for the company in 2022 versus 2021.](image5)\n\nA decrease in deferred tax assets coupled with an increase in deferred tax liabilities results in a higher net deferred tax liability on the company’s balance sheet. This shift can negatively impact the company’s financial position by reducing the net deferred tax benefit that would otherwise offset taxable income in future periods. With higher deferred tax liabilities, the company may face greater future tax payments, which can reduce available cash for operations, investment, or distributions to shareholders. The change also suggests that the realization of tax benefits from previously recognized deferred tax assets is now less certain or limited, reinforcing a more conservative outlook on expected future tax savings.\n\nIn summary, the company’s deferred tax assets decreased and deferred tax liabilities increased between 2021 and 2022, resulting in a higher net deferred tax liability and a less favorable deferred tax position on the balance sheet."}

However, there is a substantial shift in 2021, with the figure reversing to $(1,122) million—indicating a net benefit rather than a cost. The trend continues with an expected net benefit of $(121) million for 2022, excluding any mark-to-market effects. This dramatic swing between 2020 and 2021 aligns with a change in mark-to-market losses or gains recorded each year.\n\nThe figures for annual mark-to-market items reinforce this relationship. Significant mark-to-market losses were recognized in 2019 ($468 million) and 2020 ($383 million), while a large mark-to-market gain of $(833) million was registered in 2021. No estimate is provided for 2022. Accordingly, as mark-to-market results transitioned from losses in 2019–2020 to a substantial gain in 2021, the Total Net Periodic Benefit Cost also shifted from expense to substantial benefit in 2021 and is expected to remain a net benefit in 2022, albeit at a reduced amount if mark-to-market impacts are excluded.\n\n![Total net periodic benefit cost moved from significant cost in 2019 and 2020 to a net benefit in 2021 and is expected to remain a benefit in 2022, mirroring the shift from mark-to-market losses to a large gain.](image1)\n\nThis pattern is supported by the mark-to-market explanations: losses in prior years resulted largely from lower discount rates, with gains in 2021 emerging from higher discount rates at year-end and other assumption adjustments, consistent with the trend visible in the figures[6][7][10]. The change in mark-to-market results has a direct, material impact on the reported Total Net Periodic Benefit Cost (Benefit) each year.\n\nIn summary, the Total Net Periodic Benefit Cost (Benefit) shifted from significant costs in 2019–2020 to a net benefit in 2021, primarily due to transitioning from mark-to-market losses to a substantial mark-to-market gain; this effect is expected to continue into 2022 if mark-to-market outcomes are favorable."}

According to the data, 42% of U.S. adults find it acceptable for the criminal justice system to use such scores, while 56% oppose their use. The reasons people find them acceptable center primarily on perceived fairness and effectiveness—for example, some believe these systems would be more objective or could be used as one of several factors in decision-making. One cited rationale is that they could help reduce the subjective human biases that currently exist in parole decisions, potentially making the process fairer for marginalized groups. Others believe that if the criteria used are shown to be valid, algorithms could help identify people who truly deserve parole and thus become a useful tool in conjunction with human judgment[9].\n\nHowever, concerns about the acceptability of automated criminal risk scores are substantial. The biggest concern is that these systems cannot account for individual circumstances or changes in a person's character over time. Many argue that every individual is different, and rigid algorithms might not capture this complexity or the capacity for personal growth and rehabilitation. There's significant apprehension that reliance on such systems removes essential human judgment from life-changing decisions, which could lead to unfair outcomes or even further bias and profiling[1][8][10]. Additionally, issues about transparency, privacy, and the potential for flawed or incomplete data to influence important decisions further fuel public skepticism.\n\n![Pie chart showing 56% do not accept automated criminal risk scores, 42% accept.](image3)\n\nWhen it comes to fairness, opinions are similarly mixed.

By 1880, the population had surged to 8,267, and by 1890, it peaked at 14,096. This dramatic upswing was driven by significant historical factors, most notably the completion of the Union Pacific Railroad and the enactment of the Homestead Act in 1862. The railroad turned Nebraska from a sparsely populated frontier into a principal agricultural state, attracting thousands of settlers seeking new opportunities. The Homestead Act provided 160 acres to pioneers willing to settle and build, fueling a \"great tide of emigration\"—and making Nebraska the state with the most people acquiring land under the Act by 1900 [9].\n\nThe rapid growth is clearly illustrated in the population table: from 130 in 1870 to its remarkable crest in 1890. However, after this high point, the population began a steady decline, dropping to 13,330 by 1900 and then falling more sharply through the 20th century—down to 9,982 by 1940, and hovering between 8,700 and 9,400 from the 1950s to 2000 ![Sharp population growth in the late 1800s, followed by a long period of decline and stabilization by 2000.](image3).\n\nThis reversal in population trajectory was closely linked to changes in the agricultural economy. As farming became more mechanized and farm sizes increased, fewer families were needed to work the land. The number of farms shrank substantially: over 2,000 in 1900 declined to just 603 by 2002, while the average farm size ballooned from about 180 acres in 1920 to 577 acres by 2002. This consolidation meant fewer rural jobs and communities, pushing population down [4].\n\nThe initial population boom was therefore fueled by transportation and land policies, while the subsequent decline was a consequence of agricultural modernization and consolidation. After 1940, the population stabilized, reflecting broader rural trends but with some towns like Aurora bucking the decline through modest growth [2].\n\nFrom 1870 to 2000, Hamilton County saw explosive population growth due to the railroad and Homestead Act, peaked in 1890, then declined and stabilized as agricultural mechanization reduced the rural population."}

However, in extremely low-resource settings, the effect is more variable: some languages see modest improvements, while others experience dramatic gains—for instance, Galician (GL) to English (EN) translations showed gains of up to 11 BLEU points, suggesting that pre-trained word embeddings are especially helpful for languages just on the threshold of being able to produce reasonable translations [1]. This benefit is further illustrated by qualitative analyses, where pre-trained embeddings allowed systems to produce not only more accurate but also grammatically well-formed translations, particularly handling rare vocabulary and multi-word expressions better [2].\n\nComparisons across language pairs also show that pre-training is most beneficial when baseline performance is neither too poor nor too strong, typically where the baseline BLEU score is in the 3–4 range [4], which points to pre-training being highly effective once a minimum level of model capability and linguistic data is achieved.\n\nEmpirical results indicate that the largest BLEU gains can occur for language pairs with more room for improvement. For example, as shown in the dataset translating into Portuguese (PT), Hebrew—a less similar and lower-resource language—benefits even more from pre-training (+8.9 points), whereas more closely related and higher-resource pairs see more modest gains [9]. This is clearly documented in the following table:\n\n![BLEU improvements for various source languages to Portuguese, showing the largest gain for Hebrew and substantial but smaller gains for related Romance languages.](image3)\n\nFurther, the impact of pre-training is especially pronounced when the available training data is small. In scenarios where the training set size is reduced, pre-trained models maintain higher BLEU scores compared to standard models without pre-training. The improvement is most noticeable at lower data sizes and gradually diminishes as more training data becomes available, as demonstrated by the following graphs:\n\n![Pre-training boosts BLEU scores, especially when training data size is small; the effect decreases as more data is used.](image2)\n\nMoreover, analyses show that pre-trained word embeddings are particularly effective at improving translation accuracy for rare or less frequent words in the vocabulary, bringing broader benefits across the full lexical spectrum [8].\n\nIn summary, pre-training leads to significant BLEU score improvements, particularly for low-resource or linguistically distant languages and when training data is limited; the magnitude of gains depends on both language pair characteristics and data quantity."}

In particular, the impact of reranking by LLMs becomes most evident when dealing with hard samples, which have lower confidence scores.\n\nAccording to the experiment design, samples are grouped by their confidence scores, and two methods are compared: (a) SLM-based predictions alone and (b) SLM-based filtering followed by LLM reranking for the most difficult samples. The key insight here is that LLM reranking is only utilized for a small fraction of the hardest samples—typically between 0.5% and 10% of all instances—but the performance boost on these selected samples is substantial, sometimes resulting in absolute F1 gains between 10% and 25% for those hard cases [1][4].\n\nThe provided line graphs visually reinforce this pattern. They track micro-F1 performance across confidence bins for FewNERD. The blue line (LLM reranking) rises noticeably in the left-most range (lower confidence, harder samples), surpassing the pink line (no reranking). This demonstrates that LLM reranking most significantly elevates F1 performance for challenging, low-confidence samples. By contrast, for easy samples with high confidence, reranking proves unnecessary or even counterproductive—the blue line does not offer meaningful improvement over the pink line, and may even dip slightly below it, consistent with the finding that LLMs are less proficient than SLMs on easy tasks [9].\n\n![LLM-based reranking boosts F1 for hard (low-confidence) samples but may slightly harm easy ones.](image5)\n\nFurther supporting this, numerical data show hard FewNERD samples (τ < 0.6) have much lower baseline performance (1.28) compared to easy samples (τ > 0.9, 9.44).

However, once repetition control is introduced, the maximum achievable rate of question-asking drops significantly. Specifically, \"the z=10 setting (which should produce 100% questions) now only produces 79.67% questions.\" The primary reason is that repetition controls, such as the weighted decoding feature extrep bigram, discourage the model from repeating common bigrams in questions (like \"do you\" and \"what is\"), resulting in fewer questions being generated overall [3].\n\nThis effect is illustrated in the line graph, where the curve for question-controlled CT with repetition control exhibits a more gradual increase and plateaus below the curve for question-controlled CT without repetition control, never reaching the same high frequencies of question-asking at corresponding control levels.

This process aims to enrich the context for each generation step and typically iterates a set number of times or until a specific criterion is satisfied. The method focuses on incrementally building a more useful information set for generation, improving relevance by layering context through multiple retrieval and generation rounds. \n\nRecursive retrieval, in contrast, is designed to tackle complex or multifaceted queries by progressively refining the search. It decomposes potentially ambiguous or complex user questions into smaller, more tractable sub-queries through feedback loops. With each iteration, the retrieval process is refined based on previous outcomes, often involving query transformation, summarization, or hierarchical reasoning to target the most pertinent information. Recursive retrieval excels in iterative breakdown and continuous adaptation to the user's informational needs, particularly in specialized or unclear search scenarios[1][5].\n\nAdaptive retrieval further extends flexibility by empowering the RAG system (specifically, the large language model) to autonomously decide whether and when to trigger an external retrieval step. Rather than strictly following a fixed cycle, the system evaluates each generation contextually, determining if external information is required and, if so, what and how much to retrieve. This dynamic approach can halt retrieval and generation at will, often using special tokens to signal completion. Adaptive methods aim to optimize both efficiency and relevance by integrating only the information necessary at each point, thus avoiding redundant or extraneous content[2][3].\n\nThese differences are visually summarized as follows: \n\n- Iterative retrieval cycles through retrieve->generate steps until a goal or threshold is met, ensuring richer context at each loop.\n- Recursive retrieval continually refines the query through subproblem decomposition and transformation in response to judged outputs, enabling deeper or more precise retrieval.\n- Adaptive retrieval adds autonomy, letting the model determine the need and timing for retrieval, dynamically adjusting its workflow for optimal utility.\n\n![Iterative, recursive, and adaptive retrieval represent different workflows in RAG systems: iterative loops between retrieval and generation, recursive decomposes and refines queries, and adaptive empowers the model to decide on-demand retrieval.](image5)\n\nIn summary: Iterative retrieval alternates between retrieval and generation in set cycles, recursive retrieval breaks down and continuously refines complex queries, and adaptive retrieval allows the system to flexibly decide if and when retrieval is necessary during generation."}

The consistently high accuracy in this setting indicates that many questions can be answered accurately, sometimes even by single-hop methods, despite the nominal requirement for multi-hop reasoning [1][9]. \n\n![Adding gold paragraphs drastically boosts F1 scores in open-domain settings.](image5)\n\nHowever, when models are evaluated in more realistic or challenging open-domain settings—where a system must retrieve relevant passages from a large corpus—the F1 scores drop sharply. With 10 or 500 retrieved paragraphs (without guaranteed gold paragraph retrieval), F1 falls toward 38–39.12, reflecting how much model performance depends on access to the required information [3][10]. Notably, if the two gold paragraphs are simply included with the 500 retrieved paragraphs, F1 can leap from 39.12 to 53.12. This sharp increase highlights how missing relevant context (i.e., the gold paragraphs) is a primary bottleneck for open-domain QA performance [10].\n\nThe nature and strength of distractors also plays a crucial role. When distractors are selected adversarially—designed to be more similar or misleading—F1 scores of models trained on standard distractors fall (e.g., from 67.08 down to 46.84), but can partially recover if the model is re-trained with these new adversarial distractors, rising to 60.10 [4].\n\n![Performance drops with adversarial distractors; re-training mitigates the loss.](image2)\n\nThis pattern remains when further filtering by entity type, where the original model's accuracy drops even more but regains some ground after adversarial training [2]. These fluctuations show that the model's ability to distinguish relevant evidence is heavily dependent on the challenge posed by the distractors.\n\nThe findings show that:\n- Including gold paragraphs in the input is vital for high F1 scores; as soon as these are missing, model performance drops dramatically, no matter how many other (distractor) paragraphs are present.\n- The standard TF-IDF retrieval frequently fails to surface gold paragraphs in open-domain settings, suggesting current retrieval systems are a core weakness for multi-hop QA [10][6].\n- Stronger, adversarial distractors expose gaps in single-hop models' multi-hop reasoning ability, though adversarial training can partially mitigate this.\n- There remains a need for better distractor sets and retrieval methods that can truly require and reward multi-hop reasoning [7][5].\n\nIn summary: The inclusion of gold paragraphs greatly increases F1 scores in multi-hop QA models, especially in open-domain scenarios, while challenging distractors and retrieval failures expose significant limitations—emphasizing the need for better retrieval and distractor design to fairly measure multi-hop reasoning ability."}

LSTM models, by design, are capable of capturing word-order features, which is particularly important for sentiment analysis since sentiment can change significantly based on word sequence—for example, the difference between “not really good” and “really not good”[2].\n\nWhen the words in the training data are shuffled, thereby removing word-order information, the performance of LSTM models on sentiment analysis tasks declines noticeably. This phenomenon is confirmed by experimental results: in an evaluation on the Yelp Polarity sentiment analysis dataset, the LSTM achieved a score of 95.11 with the original (ordered) dataset, but this dropped to 93.49 when the words in the training set were shuffled, while keeping the test set in the original order[1]. This result is clearly seen in the following summary:\n\n![Shuffling training set for Yelp sentiment analysis causes LSTM accuracy to drop, indicating word order matters.](image1)\n\nFurther supporting this, research observes that both CNN and LSTM architectures surpass simple word embedding models (SWEM) in sentiment analysis tasks, specifically because these models can capture the sequential word-order patterns necessary for accurate sentiment prediction[2]. For example, with shuffled input, the subtle cues that influence sentiment—such as negations and intensifiers—may be lost, leading to misinterpretations of the overall sentiment.\n\nMoreover, accompanying explanations highlight that in tasks like topic categorization or textual entailment, word order is less crucial, and thus shuffling does not affect accuracy as drastically. In contrast, for sentiment analysis, the accuracy drops “noticeably” with shuffled word order, reinforcing that preserving word order is critical for this particular task[6].\n\nIn concise terms: Preserving word-order information is essential for accurate sentiment analysis in LSTM models; shuffling words in the training data reduces sentiment classification accuracy significantly."}

For example, on datasets like PathMNIST, OrganAMNIST, and BloodMNIST, the improvement over random selection can range from 1.8% to 5.2% AUC when querying just 0.1% of the entire dataset. On challenging long-tail datasets like CIFAR-10-LT, the improvement is even more pronounced—showing 21.2% to 24.1% higher AUC at higher sampling ratios.

This setup enables a granular trace that mirrors the underlying structure of the knowledge graph, providing both the reason for each entity mention and the web of relations justifying their appearance.\n\n![Structured annotation table color-codes tokens, entity types, relationships (like \"pub date\" and \"genre\"), and parent entities to map the discourse of a passage about \"Super Mario Land\" into knowledge graph concepts.](image2)\n\nMoreover, this mapping reflects missed links or ambiguities in entity relationships due to limitations or incompleteness in the knowledge base. For example, not all genre information is fully connected, and parent entity assignments reflect plausible (not necessarily exhaustive or definitive) explanatory links, capturing both direct and inferred connections between entities such as \"Nintendo\" and \"Game Boy.\"[2]\n\nIn summary: Entities and their relationships in the example annotation are mapped token-by-token, associating each with an entity, mention type, relationship, and parent entity, forming a structured trace to the knowledge graph."}

Across various datasets and query cycles, this superiority is evident both visually and statistically.\n\nFor instance, a set of ten graphs show that whether training from scratch or fine-tuning from self-supervised pre-training, the red line (representing Hard-to-Contrast) typically achieves higher AUC values at every stage compared to Random, Entropy, Margin, BALD, and Coreset strategies. This pattern holds true as the number of labeled images increases, indicating the robustness of Hard-to-Contrast querying across label budgets. The strong performance is especially notable in the early cycles (starting with just 20 labeled images) and remains high through to 50 images, suggesting a positive and statistically significant correlation between initial and final model performances for this and other strategies (as measured by Pearson’s r between AUC_20 and AUC_50)[1][4]. \n\n![Hard-to-Contrast consistently outperforms other strategies in AUC across active learning cycles, as indicated by the dominant red line in the graphs.](image1)\n\nBar chart comparisons across multiple datasets such as PathMNIST, OrganAMNIST, BloodMNIST, and CIFAR-10-LT further confirm that Hard-to-Contrast is either the best or very close to the best—which is important since, unlike Easy-to-Learn/Hard-to-Learn approaches, it does not require ground-truth labels to work. This practicality makes it suitable for real-world active learning where label scarcity is common[8].\n\n![The Hard-to-Contrast strategy yields the highest AUC across datasets, especially when labels are limited, illustrating its advantage as an initial query method.](image3)\n\nThis advantage stems from the fact that Hard-to-Contrast querying leverages pseudo-labels to identify samples that are difficult to classify with high confidence but do not require manual annotation for selection. It also supports label diversity—ensuring a wide coverage of classes in the initial batch—which is crucial for model generalization in subsequent learning cycles[2][5][6]. Studies show that enforcing both label diversity and selecting hard-to-contrast samples defines the efficacy of the starting point and thus the overall efficiency of model training in active learning[2][6]. \n\nIn summary, the Hard-to-Contrast querying strategy delivers higher AUC than other approaches across varying amounts of labeled data, especially in the initial stages that are critical for subsequent learning. This establishes it as a practical and effective initial query method in active learning: selecting hard-to-contrast data as the first labeled set significantly boosts model performance in future active learning cycles."}

The question generator similarly utilizes InstructGPT for in-context learning to produce relevant follow-up questions when the context is insufficient, ensuring multi-step reasoning [5]. \n\nMoving to the question-answering (QA) module, the architecture is designed with flexibility in mind, offering various LLM-based implementations.

MMMU's breadth is evident in its coverage: it encompasses 11,550 college-level multimodal questions spanning 30 subjects and 183 subfields across six major disciplines, including Engineering, Art & Design, Business, Science, Humanities & Social Sciences, and Medicine. This extensive subject diversity ensures that models are tested on a wide range of knowledge domains, far exceeding the narrower focus of many previous benchmarks[2][10].\n\nMoreover, MMMU’s depth is reflected in the complexity and expertise required to answer its questions. Unlike prior benchmarks that primarily assess basic perception abilities or common-sense reasoning, MMMU demands deliberate, step-by-step reasoning with deep subject knowledge—such as applying advanced topics like Fourier Transform or Equilibrium Theory. This shift toward expert-level reasoning sets MMMU apart from datasets that only require surface-level understanding or general knowledge and perception[5][6][10].\n\nThe design of MMMU further bolsters its challenge by interleaving text and diverse image types within questions. The images are not limited to simple photographs or diagrams but include a variety as broad as medical scans, music sheets, geometric and chemical structures, and more. Models must not merely recognize visual content but also integrate it with domain-specific textual knowledge to reason their way to solutions. This joint requirement for multimodal perception, domain expertise, and logical reasoning makes MMMU an all-encompassing and challenging benchmark for evaluating LMMs[5][6].\n\nThese differences are vividly illustrated in benchmarking comparisons: while other datasets, like VQA or GQA, focus on common-sense or basic visual reasoning with limited image variety and mainly visual question answering formats, MMMU is unique in its college-level difficulty, modal diversity, and complex reasoning requirements.

This elevates the standard for LMM evaluation, making MMMU a critical choice for measuring true progress in the field[1][8].\n\nIn short, MMMU's wide coverage and deep, expert-level problems make it the most comprehensive benchmark available for evaluating how well large multimodal models can perceive, understand, and reason across diverse domains."}

The difference in Kendall’s Tau correlation (Δτ) between these two settings quantifies the improvement gained by adding reference information.\n\nThe data from the comparative table clearly demonstrates that for every language pair evaluated, incorporating reference translations increases COMET-RANK scores. However, the extent of this benefit is not uniform across language directions. Notably, for language pairs where English is the target, such as en-cs, en-de, en-fi, and en-tr, the improvement from including references is moderate with Δτ values ranging from about 0.024 to 0.051. In contrast, for the reverse directions, where English is the source and the target is another language, improvements are considerably higher, especially with cs-en (Δτ = 0.107), de-en (Δτ = 0.155), fi-en (Δτ = 0.119), and tr-en (Δτ = 0.132)![Δτ for COMET-RANK is largest for de-en (German-English)](image2).\n\nThe largest gain is observed for the German-to-English (de-en) pair, with a Δτ of 0.155, meaning the correlation with human judgment substantially improves when the model leverages reference translations in this scenario.\n\nIn summary, including reference translations consistently enhances the performance of COMET-RANK across all language pairs, with the most substantial improvement seen in German-to-English translation."}

Initially, standard GPT-4 is already the best-performing baseline among evaluated models, surpassing other instruction-tuned and non-instruction-tuned language models, with an overall accuracy of 62.03%.

CAUSALCoT achieves top accuracy on each rung, indicating robustness even as question difficulty increases. For example, CAUSALCoT scores 83.35% in Rung 1, 67.47% in Rung 2, and 62.05% in Rung 3, highlighting a typical decrease as questions get harder, but always maintaining a clear lead over baseline GPT-4 and all other models![CAUSALCoT consistently beats GPT-4 across overall and rung-specific accuracy metrics.](image1).\n\nAnother important axis of evaluation is how models generalize to different commonsense alignments: common-sensical, nonsensical, and anti-common-sensical queries.

Specifically, CAUSALCoT boosts accuracy by 9.65 points on anti-common-sensical data compared to base GPT-4, which demonstrates its generalization power and strength on 'out-of-distribution' or unseen data[3][4].\n\nThe benefits of CAUSALCoT are not limited to final answer accuracy. Step-by-step error and reasoning chain analyses using the ROSCOE evaluation framework reveal that, although the model is particularly strong at certain steps—such as extracting the correct causal graph structure (nodes F1: 99.34, edges F1: 97.01)—other reasoning tasks in the chain remain challenging.

Each cropped region is then resized and embedded by an image encoder, ensuring that the representations correspond specifically to the objects of interest, rather than to the background or irrelevant elements. \n\nAdditionally, in some implementations, areas outside the target object within each crop are blurred. This blurring technique further directs the multimodal large language models (MLLMs) toward the pertinent object, making it easier for the system to distinguish and recognize the correct label during the retrieval and ranking stages. By isolating the object and minimizing visual distractions, the system is better equipped to perform accurate zero-shot recognition even when it has not encountered the specific object instance during training. \n\nThe diagram illustrates this process: bounding boxes highlight multiple objects; these objects are individually cropped and resized, passed through the image encoder to create embeddings, and associated with class labels through a k-NN retrieval against a memory bank.

In 2010, the field introduced the \"Time tensor with Random Indexing,\" which conceptualized tracking semantic changes across time by updating distributional models incrementally, effectively creating a tensor structure where each word has a semantic vector for every time span of interest [4]. This innovation enabled direct, quantitative comparisons of word meanings as they evolved.\n\nBy 2011, researchers turned to substantial linguistic resources such as the Google Ngrams corpus, allowing broad exploration of changes in word usage over multi-decade periods. This dataset helped kickstart 'culturomics'—the study of human culture through large-scale textual analysis—and facilitated early work on quantitative semantic shift detection [9]. The subsequent year (2012) is marked by efforts in \"Word epoch disambiguation,\" advancing the ability to align and interpret word vectors across different time frames.\n\nA leap forward came in 2013 with the move towards prediction-based models. These included neural approaches like word2vec, which improved the representation of semantics and made it feasible to measure subtle changes in meaning over time [2].\n\nIn 2014, word embeddings—most notably those generated by the word2vec algorithm—gained prominence for tracking semantic shifts, spearheading a new era of robust, dense vector representations. The work by Kim et al. utilizing prediction-based word embedding models was especially influential here [7].\n\nThe year 2015 focused on \"Models alignment,\" a technique critical for making word embeddings comparable across different temporal snapshots—vital for accurately tracking meaning changes. Key research published during this time established the use of model alignment alongside new sources of diachronic data, such as diverse corpora with higher temporal granularity [10].\n\nBroadening the variety of corpora, 2016 saw analyses employing periodized datasets like the New York Times Annotated Corpus and the Corpus of Historical American English (COHA), further strengthening the robustness and granularity of semantic change analysis [10].\n\n2017 was particularly active, highlighted by discussions on the \"Laws of semantic change,\" an investigation into underlying regularities governing how word meanings shift. Researchers also determined that local similarity measures are more effective for capturing cultural semantic drift. There was criticism and refinement of previously proposed semantic change laws, and new efforts were made in \"Joint learning across time spans,\" promoting better cross-temporal analysis [8]. Expanded use of the English Gigaword corpus and deeper study of diachronic semantic relations rounded out the year’s advancements.\n\n![The timeline chronicles paradigm shifts in methodologies, corpora, and theoretical insights for semantic shift research from 2010 to 2017.](image1)\n\nIn summary, the key milestones between 2010 and 2017 include the introduction of time-aware tensor models, leveraging vast diachronic corpora such as Google Ngrams, the rise of neural word embedding techniques, development of model alignment methods, the use of varied and granular corpora, and the theoretical consolidation of semantic change laws."}

In these settings, several methods have been evaluated, such as Chain of Thought (CoT), Take a Deep Breathe (TDB), Retrieval Augmentation (RAG), and, notably, Step-Back prompting and its combination with RAG.\n\nA comparative look at the results shows that the combination of Step-Back prompting with RAG yields the highest gains on both MuSiQue and StrategyQA. In the case of MuSiQue, which is particularly difficult due to its multihop reasoning requirements, the best baseline (PaLM-2L) achieves only 35.5%, whereas PaLM-2L + Step-Back + RAG achieves 42.8%, surpassing both baseline models and even GPT-4 at 38.5%[9]. For StrategyQA, where baselines are already high (PaLM-2L at 82.8% and GPT-4 at 78.3%), the combination still provides the top result, at 86.4%. This is echoed in the visual summary:\n\n![On MuSiQue and StrategyQA, Step-Back + RAG achieves top accuracy, outperforming all other prompting methods and even GPT-4](image3)\n\nThe strong performance of Step-Back + RAG can be attributed to the abstraction skills enabled by Step-Back, which allow the model to frame higher-level questions. These abstract queries, when paired with retrieval mechanisms, better surface relevant supporting information for complex reasoning chains. This approach thus outperforms standard retrieval (RAG) and prompting (CoT, TDB) methods alone: RAG on its own provides a moderate uplift (e.g., up to 39.5% on MuSiQue), but it is the addition of Step-Back abstraction that further boosts the scores to the leading levels[9].\n\nTextual analysis supports these findings: “STEP-BACK PROMPTING with the power of abstraction produces the best performance of all methods: 42.8% in MuSiQue and 86.4% in StrategyQA, significantly outperforming GPT-4 on both tasks”[9]. Step-Back + RAG therefore ties both higher accuracy and a margin of improvement over other prompting techniques specifically due to its effective combination of abstraction and retrieval.\n\nIn summary, combining Step-Back prompting with RAG substantially improves performance on MuSiQue and StrategyQA, outperforming other prompting methods and even surpassing GPT-4."}

First, MMMU stands out for its comprehensive dataset size: it consists of 11,550 questions, which is notably larger than many previous benchmarks in the field. These questions span six disciplines, 30 subjects, and 183 subfields, highlighting its extensive coverage and providing a larger testing ground for multimodal models than others offer, many of which tend to focus on more constrained domains[4].\n\nLooking at the diversity of image types, MMMU covers 30 different formats, including diagrams, tables, charts, chemical structures, photos, paintings, geometric shapes, music sheets, and medical images[2]. In contrast, other benchmarks typically restrict themselves to a handful of common formats, often centered around daily knowledge or simple visual scenes. This variation ensures that models are challenged to interpret a diverse range of visual information, going far beyond what’s provided in most comparable datasets.\n\nIn terms of reasoning depth, MMMU sets itself apart by requiring deliberate, expert-level reasoning with college-level subject knowledge, in contrast to existing benchmarks that primarily emphasize commonsense reasoning or basic physical and temporal deductions[2]. Many problems in MMMU are drawn from college exams, quizzes, and textbooks, often demanding domain-specific knowledge such as applying concepts like “Fourier Transform” or “Equilibrium Theory” for solution derivation[10]. This emphasis on advanced reasoning stands in sharp contrast to typical benchmarks that prioritize either surface-level understanding or simple inferences.\n\nThe included comparative dual-panel illustration further emphasizes this: the left graph demonstrates how MMMU outpaces others both in breadth (knowledge coverage) and depth (reasoning difficulty), while the accompanying table on the right catalogues various datasets, showing MMMU as unique in its college-level focus, range of image types, and interleaved text-image input format.

The toolkit is made up of several core components, each of which is critical to success in modern recruiting.\n\nThe components outlined for LinkedIn Recruiter Certification cover the full recruiting lifecycle: identifying talent through advanced search capabilities; engaging talent via a professional LinkedIn presence and using InMail effectively; building a sustainable talent pipeline; posting jobs to attract the right candidates; and maximizing efficiency with organizational and collaborative tools. Each of these areas represents a vital skill or resource recruiters need to excel.\n\n![A diagram illustrating the five key areas of the LinkedIn Recruiter Certification: Search, Engagement, Talent Pipeline, Job Posting, and Organizational Tools.](image4)\n\nFinding talent often begins with an advanced understanding of search techniques, such as Boolean searches, which go beyond everyday knowledge and allow recruiters to zero in on ideal candidates swiftly [5]. Engagement is enhanced by leveraging LinkedIn’s messaging and presence features, ensuring the recruiter can attract and maintain the interest of high-quality prospects. Building and managing a talent pipeline are foundational, making projects and pipelines some of the most valuable assets for recruiters once they master them [9]. Posting jobs, even if not a current organizational practice, is essential for responding to evolving business needs and ensuring visibility to potential candidates [7]. Finally, maximizing organizational efficiency requires the optimal use of best practices and the right tools, cultivating a collaborative and well-organized recruitment team that can swiftly adapt to change [6].\n\nA recruiter’s toolkit is thus a holistic system, encompassing specialized search, targeted engagement, pipeline management, effective job postings, and efficiency through advanced tools and practices, all underpinned by recognized certification that validates these abilities.\n\nThe key components of the Ultimate Toolkit for Recruiters are advanced talent search, candidate engagement, talent pipeline management, job posting skills, and organizational efficiency tools."}

Some of the earlier-numbered piers, which are used for cargo and ferries, and appear boxy and deep, but not elongated.\n\nA closer look at image2, focusing on the Fisherman’s Wharf area, shows several piers jutting out into the Bay. Here, you can see that Pier 39 is actually quite extensive in terms of visitor facilities, but Pier 35, just to the south, seems longer in terms of actual coastline when viewed from above. The piers to the north near Hyde Street and the Maritime National Historical Park are comparatively short [6].\n\nThe map in image1 also labels the piers, and visually, Pier 35 and Pier 27 are quite long and are container or cruise ship terminals, indicating they require significant waterfront space, but Pier 39, due to its wraparound structure for tourist access and boat slips, gives the visual impression of a lengthy and undulating coastline.\n\nConsidering both the mapped coastline and the prominence given to Pier 39 as a tourist attraction in relevant text references [6], the evidence leans towards Pier 39 as having the longest and most complex coastline due to its tourist boardwalk design rather than just a linear pier.\n\n![Pier 39's extensive and winding coastline is visible on the map, highlighting its wraparound boardwalk structure.](image2)\n\nAfter examining both the lists and map images, the pier with the longest coastline in this section is Pier 39."}

The output low voltage (VOL) for Port 0, ALE/PROG, and PSEN is specified as a maximum of 0.45 V at a current of 1.6 mA, and for the other ports, it is a maximum of 0.45 V at 100 µA. The output high voltage (VOH) for those same outputs is a minimum of 2.4 V at −80 μA, while for the rest, VOH is also a minimum of 2.4 V at −10 μA. These specifications establish the logical level thresholds required for correct operation and compatibility with other digital components.\n\n![The table summarizes electrical voltage and current specs for 8751H and related microcontrollers, highlighting similar input/output logic levels.](image1)\n\nSimilar values can be found for other models, such as the 8751BH and 8752BH, which share the same basic logic level voltage thresholds and test conditions.

These T cells recognize infected liver cells that present malaria parasite (Pf) peptides on their surface via MHC Class I molecules. Upon recognizing the infected cell, the CD8+ T cell becomes activated and releases cytotoxic substances: perforin, which forms pores in the liver cell's membrane, and granzymes, which enter the cell to trigger apoptosis, effectively destroying both the parasite and the host cell.\n\nAdditionally, the illustration highlights the involvement of cell signaling molecules like IFN-γ and interactions such as Fas/FasR, which further induce apoptosis in the infected cell. This concerted immune response aims to eliminate the malaria parasite at a crucial early stage, halting the infection before it spreads.\n\n![CD8+ T cell initiates apoptosis in a malaria-infected liver cell through antigen recognition and cytotoxic mechanisms.](image1)\n\nIn summary, the immune system targets malaria parasites in the liver by using CD8+ T cells to recognize infected cells, release cytotoxic molecules, and induce cell death to eliminate the parasite."}

Military research often acts as a catalyst for innovation due to the urgency and unique conditions “in theater.” In the case of malaria, NMRC’s partnerships extend across institutions and disciplines, focusing on advanced immunological research—such as identifying malaria antigens as vaccine candidates using approaches like mass spectrometry [9]. \n\nThis science is vividly captured in the graphic representation of the immune response to malaria: CD8+ T cells interact with liver cells infected with malaria parasites, aiming to kill the parasite through mechanisms such as perforin and granzyme release, and the initiation of apoptosis. These insights are not only relevant for troop health but hold immense potential to benefit populations in malaria-endemic regions worldwide, showing how military-driven research can translate to global health gains. ![Immune response illustration informs vaccine development in malaria by showing CD8+ T cell interactions with infected liver cells.](image1)\n\nThe collaborative nature of NMRC’s work is further evidenced by the operations of the Joint Combat Casualty Research Team (JC2RT), which embeds teams of researchers within active military medical units. Their efforts—prioritized and driven by real-time combat needs—focus on areas like pre-hospital care, traumatic brain injury, and hemorrhage management. The systematic capture and analysis of battlefield medical data accelerates advances in trauma care, leading to innovations that improve both military and civilian emergency medicine [1][6][8]. This inter-service collaboration is exemplified by the diverse, multidisciplinary teams deployed alongside combat and medical personnel. ![A diverse team of military medical researchers poses in front of a medevac helicopter, symbolizing inter-service collaboration and real-world medical research in action.](image4)\n\nUnderlying these advances are structured agreements—such as Cooperative Research and Development Agreements (CRADAs)—which facilitate partnerships between federal, academic, and private sectors, ensuring that breakthroughs transition efficiently from military labs to commercial and civilian applications [3][5][10]. These technology transfers, often mandated and accelerated by governmental policies, ensure that innovations born out of military necessity can rapidly benefit the general public [7].\n\nIn summary, NMRC’s malaria vaccine research and JC2RT’s trauma innovations reveal that military medical research, driven by collaboration with civilian institutions and industry, leads to medical and technological advancements with far-reaching benefits for both military and global populations."}

This includes options such as requirements envisioning (light specification), more extensive detailed specification, or even working without upfront specification, depending on what makes sense for the project and stakeholders.\n\nMultiple view types are considered, such as usage modeling, domain modeling, process modeling, user interface modeling, and identifying non-functional requirements. Teams also need to decide on a modeling strategy—ranging from informal sessions to more structured formal modeling, or simply using interviews for requirement gathering. The management of work items at this phase is flexible: strategies include work item pools, lists, agile backlogs, or possibly formal change management for regulated environments.\n\nFor non-functional requirements, the approach can be as simple as acceptance criteria or as structured as an explicit list or technical stories, or in some cases, this may be deferred until later. The overall mindset is to tailor the level of scope exploration to what will best facilitate a shared understanding and provide just enough direction for the team to proceed, adapting as needed as more is learned through the agile process.\n\n![Disciplined Agile scope exploration considers levels of detail, view types, modeling strategies, work item management, and non-functional requirement handling.](image3)\n\nIn summary, Disciplined Agile offers a flexible, context-sensitive set of strategies for exploring initial scope, encouraging teams to balance just enough planning with adaptability."}

The value chain emphasizes a sequence of steps—starting with data collection, progressing through analysis, guiding informed actions, and culminating in measurable impact. Skipping any step means falling short of genuine value; simply moving partway, such as stopping at analysis without taking action, delivers no organizational change or benefit [4][1].\n\nTo illustrate, a flowchart demonstrates this journey: data is transformed first into reports, then analyses, followed by action, eventually leading to enhanced value. Reporting and analysis are crucial pivots: reporting delivers charts and dashboards, while analysis mines these for actionable insights, setting the stage for decision-making and value creation.\n\n![From data collection through reporting and analysis, action is taken that results in value creation.](image4)\n\nNested within the value chain, the Levels of Analytics detail the increasing depth and sophistication organizations can achieve with their data. The hierarchy begins with standard reporting—asking \"What happened?\"—and ascends through diagnostic, predictive, and prescriptive analytics, culminating in optimization—\"What’s the best that can happen?\" As organizations advance up this ladder, the business value and intelligence they extract from the same data rise dramatically.\n\n![Higher analytics levels move from basic reporting to deep analysis and optimization, increasing business value and intelligence.](image2)\n\nComparing reporting and analysis reveals their distinct but interconnected contributions: reporting looks backward and summarizes what occurred, while analysis seeks to explain why, offering recommendations and storytelling that prepare the ground for meaningful action.\n\n![Reporting summarizes what occurred, while analysis explains why and recommends action, creating the bridge from data to value.](image1)\n\nIn essence, the Analytics Value Chain sets out the sequence required to realize impact from data, while the Levels of Analytics describe the depth and complexity possible at the analysis stage of that chain. Together, they ensure that organizations not only move methodically from data to action, but also continuously extract greater strategic insight and value at each step.\n\nIn summary, the Analytics Value Chain provides the critical process stages, while the Levels of Analytics define how sophisticated and valuable each stage—especially analysis—can become, together enabling organizations to transform raw data into actionable insights and real-world value."}

The remaining pins need to be held at the \"Security\" levels as indicated in the reference table [10].\n\nFrom the operational table, the precise pin settings for the \"Program Lock Bits (LBx)\" mode are as follows:\n\n- **RST**: High (1)\n- **\\(\\overline{\\text{PSEN}}\\)**: Low (0)\n- **ALE/PROG**: 0*\n- **\\(\\overline{\\text{EA}}/V_{PP}\\)**: Vpp (programming voltage, 12.75 V)\n- **P2.7**: 1\n- **P2.6**: 1 (this pin specifically must be high for security/lock bit programming)\n- **P3.6**: 1\n- **P3.7**: 1\n\nThis configuration ensures that the microcontroller enters the correct mode to program the lock bits and applies the correct programming pulse. The timing and voltage requirements for this operation are detailed in the device's programming specification and are typically the same for both code memory and lock bits [2][10].\n\nThe following schematic illustrates the physical connections and pin assignments required for programming, showing how the Vpp is applied, the ALE/PROG pin is pulsed, and which pins are set to logic high:\n\n![A schematic diagram illustrating the required pin connections for programming, showing Vpp on EA/VPP, pull-ups on P0, and specific pin assignments for programming.](image1)\n\nFor greater clarity, the operational mode table gives a concise reference for the required state of each relevant pin in the \"Program Lock Bits (LBx)\" mode:\n\n![The table showing required pin states for 'Program Lock Bits (LBx)': RST=1, PSEN=0, ALE/PROG=0*, EA/Vpp=Vpp, P2.7=1, P2.6=1, P3.6=1, P3.7=1.](image2)\n\nTherefore, to program the lock bits in the 875XBH, you must set Port 2.6 to logic high and ensure RST, P2.7, P3.6, and P3.7 are also held high; apply the programming voltage to EA/VPP, pulse ALE/PROG low accordingly, and follow the correct programming sequence with these pins configured as described."}

This information allows the ECU to determine the precise requirements for the engine to run efficiently, such as fuel injection timing, amount, and ignition timing[4]. \n\nIn the system, the ECU specifically controls the opening of fuel injectors, regulating how much fuel is delivered to each cylinder based on the readings from the sensors[1][3].

The second step features the elongation of the cell, which physically moves the duplicated chromosomes even further apart[1][10]. Lastly, the plasma membrane starts to grow inward at the midpoint of the cell, effectively dividing the original cell into two separate, genetically identical cells[10]. \n\nThis process is visually represented in the following image, which outlines the stages from the original cell to the formation of two daughter cells, highlighting the duplication, segregation, and division:\n\n![Bacterial binary fission occurs as the cell replicates its DNA, elongates, and splits into two daughters.](image4)\n\nIn summary, the three steps of binary fission in prokaryotic cells are: chromosome duplication and separation, elongation of the cell, and division into two daughter cells."}

This is clearly shown in the table where, after the first hot dog, utility drops sharply: +10 for the first, +4 for the second, 0 for the third, and quickly becomes negative with further consumption, illustrating that repetition lessens pleasure, which is the core idea in standard consumption economics [3]. \n\n![Utility decreases with each additional hot dog consumed, illustrating diminishing marginal utility in standard consumption.](image4)\n\nIn standard consumption, this decrease in marginal utility motivates individuals to seek variety once enjoyment drops, reflecting a tendency to avoid focus and minimize repetitive consumption for greater overall satisfaction [3]. In fact, standard economic theory often warns that excessive focus on one activity (such as eating too many hot dogs) is suboptimal, as it leads to declining enjoyment [4].\n\nHowever, in competitive contexts, the pattern changes. While the initial units still show diminishing returns, the outcome of singular focus can be dramatically different. In a hot dog eating contest, for example, the table shows utility remaining negative as consumption increases (-50 at 66 hot dogs), but suddenly, at a pivotal point (the 64th hot dog), utility spikes to +5000 because winning or tying in a competition drastically alters the stakes and rewards. This differential outcome is not present in ordinary consumption—it is uniquely linked to focusing for mastery or victory in competitive settings.\n\n![At a key point in competition, such as tying a championship, utility jumps, overruling the usual negative returns from additional consumption.](image5)\n\nThis shows that while ordinary consumption pushes for variety to keep satisfaction high, competitive focus, despite possibly negative utility in the process, can result in a large leap in utility when mastery or a significant achievement is reached [5][10]. Thus, the drive for competitive mastery can justify singular focus and enduring negative marginal returns, because of the possibility of surpassing a threshold for a substantial payoff.\n\nIn summary: Diminishing marginal utility in standard consumption leads to reduced enjoyment and encourages variety, while in competitive contexts, focus can produce negative utility until a breakthrough is achieved, at which point the reward (utility) can dramatically increase."}

Meanwhile, activities such as watching films (increased from 20% to 22%) and especially fitness (from 5% to 17%) took up more weekend time in 2010. Activities like net surfing and hobbies saw slight increases as well, suggesting some diversification in leisure pursuits. Reading and shopping remained stable, but the general trend shows a move away from purely social or passive activities toward more individualized and possibly health-conscious or digital engagements.\n\n![The distribution of time spent on weekend activities shifted from predominantly social interaction in 2005 to more individualized and diverse pursuits including fitness and digital activities by 2010.](image2)\n\nWhen these changes are viewed in relation to global educational participation trends, as indicated by the CTBT expert training program statistics, an interesting parallel emerges. The training program reported substantial engagement: 70,000 minutes watched online, 2,000 clicks on lecture videos, 425 registered participants from 105 countries, and strong institutional diversity. This indicates a significant global embrace of remote, self-directed learning, highlighting the trend toward digital engagement and independent learning across nations and sectors.\n\n![High levels of global, multi-institutional participation in a digital training program reflect a trend toward individualized, online educational engagement.](image1)\n\nThe increased prevalence of activities such as net surfing and watching films on weekends, alongside sustained or growing participation in structured digital learning, suggests a global cultural shift: people are now more inclined to engage in individual development and use technology both for leisure and education. Enhanced digital access and a growing comfort with online platforms are reflected in both leisure activities (where screen time increases) and in the pursuit of continuing education and professional development through online programs.\n\nTo summarize: between 2005 and 2010, weekend activities shifted toward more individualized and digital pursuits, which aligns with the increasing global engagement in online educational and training programs, highlighting a broader trend toward digital, self-directed activities."}

These approaches ensure that the team gathers comprehensive requirements in a timely, collaborative, and iterative fashion, allowing stakeholder input to shape development priorities and outcomes. For example, ATDD uses executable acceptance tests to clarify and validate needs, making requirements more understandable and verifiable[2]. Likewise, engaging stakeholders early and often through techniques like split testing or incremental requirements specification helps catch shifts in priorities or context before they become problematic.\n\n![Needs Exploration covers multiple collaborative and modeling-based methods to refine what stakeholders actually want and need.](image2)\n\nElicitation Methods represent the tactical choices teams make to directly understand what stakeholders want. Options such as just-in-time (JIT) model storming, look-ahead modeling, iteration and all-hands demos, or even utilizing none, provide flexibility in how and when information is acquired. Agile frameworks often select an elicitation approach based on project complexity, team location, and immediacy of requirements. For distributed teams or complex regulatory environments, business analysts (BAs) may be used at multiple sites to facilitate this process[5].\n\n![Multiple elicitation methods—like JIT model storming or demos—help teams fit requirement gathering to context and ensure frequent stakeholder feedback.](image1)\n\nBy integrating Needs Exploration and Elicitation Methods, agile teams can remain responsive, refining solutions iteratively as they gain fresh understanding of stakeholder needs throughout the project lifecycle.

MF (manual focus), on the other hand, allows the photographer to pinpoint focus manually—great when you want complete control, such as focusing precisely on a face in busy settings ![Each focus mode (AF-S, AF-C, MF) excels with stationary, moving, or specifically chosen subjects, respectively.](image1)[1].\n\nPro Mode in the camera interface brings together these features, giving you full manual control to adapt to any photographic situation ![Pro Mode interface offers direct adjustment of metering and focus modes among other settings, enabling creative control.](image2)[10].\n\nIn summary, different metering and focus modes in Pro Mode let photographers adapt to varied lighting and subject movement, ensuring optimal exposure and sharp focus for each scenario."}

{"q_id": 1997, "model": "gpt-4.1", "in_tok": 2191, "out_tok": 378, "total_tok": 2569, "response": "To assess conversion rates from Marketing Qualified Leads (MQL) to Sales Accepted Leads (SAL), we need to examine the progression of leads through the sales funnel in different datasets.\n\nThe first dataset shows conversion numbers and rates: out of 10,051 MQLs, only 668 convert to SALs, resulting in a conversion rate of 1.50%. This means that while marketing is capable of generating a significant number of MQLs, only a small fraction are deemed acceptable for the sales team. The sharp drop suggests possible misalignment between marketing’s qualification criteria and what sales considers actionable, or that MQLs may be over-generated or of lower quality in this case.\n![Very low conversion rate from MQL to SAL highlights alignment issues.](image4)\n\nIn contrast, another data set presents average cross-industry conversion rates. Here, the conversion rate from MQLs to SALs is substantially higher, at 45-75%. This indicates in typical scenarios, a significant portion of marketing qualified leads are successfully accepted by sales, suggesting better calibration of scoring criteria or tighter qualification standards being shared between marketing and sales.\n![The industry average for MQL to SAL conversion is much higher, suggesting better alignment.](image5)\n\nThe implication of this contrast is profound: an exceptionally low conversion rate (like 1.50%) signals an operational gap. Marketing may be qualifying leads that don’t fit the sales team’s requirements, leading to inefficiency and wasted resources. Conversely, when the conversion rate is closer to industry averages (45–75%), it typically reflects strong marketing-sales alignment, more efficient lead handling, and better targeting.\n\nIn summary, the first dataset's MQL to SAL conversion rate of 1.50% is drastically lower than the industry average of 45–75%, indicating issues in lead qualification or interdepartmental alignment that need urgent attention."}
