However, when we specifically look at the demographic breakdown, we find that younger individuals under 30 are less attentive to these news, with only 32% following the news very closely and 6% following it very closely. This contrasts with the 47% of those aged 30 to 49 and 61% of those 50 and older who are following the news very or fairly closely.\n\nIn the context of the specific question, the Democratic Party holds the highest total percentage of good policy ideas and high ethical standards. According to the data, 18% of whites, 30% of blacks, and 13% of Hispanics are following the news about the congressional elections very closely. Given that the majority of the Democratic Party's supporters are likely to fall into the demographic categories where higher percentages of people are following the news closely, we can conclude that the percentage of Democratic Party supporters who followed the news about the congressional elections in their state very closely would be around 18%.\n\nThus, the percentage of the Democratic Party that reported following the news about congressional elections in their state very closely is approximately **18%**."}

In the U.S., there was a consistent trend where market publication requirements for endowments compelled general partners (GPs) to publish financial performance, leading to transparency in fund statistics [3]. However, in Europe, the situation was quite different. There were no such requirements, and a significant portion of top-performing European funds did not publish their financial data, making it difficult to obtain accurate information [3].\n\nMoreover, the scarcity of venture capital (VC) money in Europe led to higher capital efficiency and yield rates compared to the U.S. [1], suggesting that European VCs were more selective in their investments, which could be reflected in the median investments. This scarcity also meant that many European venture funds had disappeared after the burst of the bubble, and only a small percentage of the remaining funds were considered active [3]. Additionally, the lack of pension and endowment funds, which account for roughly 65% of the U.S. VC industry, contributed to the limited availability of capital in Europe [4].\n\nThe image quotes, particularly image5, provide a visual representation of the average median pre-money valuations of European funds from 2004 to 2009. This data would help us understand the trend in median investments during this period.\n\n![Average median pre-money valuations of the years](image5)\n\nComparing these two regions, the U.S. likely saw more consistent and possibly higher median investments due to the greater availability of capital and transparency in fund statistics. In contrast, Europe's trend would reflect higher capital efficiency and yield, but with fewer active funds and lower overall investment volume due to the scarcity of VC money.\n\nIn summary, the trends of median investments in Europe and the U.S. from 2004 to 2009 show that while the U.S. had more consistent and potentially higher median investments, Europe demonstrated higher capital efficiency and yield rates, albeit with fewer active funds."}

This is significantly lower than the ratings at various points in other administrations, as current ratings for the Trump administration’s ethical standards are lower than for those at various points in other administrations dating back to Ronald Reagan's administration in 1983 [11].\n\nLooking at the image quotes, we can see that the approval ratings for Trump's administration officials' ethical standards are generally lower compared to past administrations. For instance, the graph in image7 shows that the ethical standards of the Trump administration are rated lower than those of previous administrations such as Reagan's, Clinton's, and Bush's [7].\n\nThe text also indicates that the public's approval of Trump's job performance is roughly on par with ratings at the outset of his presidency [3]. In fact, the public's evaluation of Trump's handling of his job as president is little changed in recent months [3]. However, evaluations are more intense among disapprovers; $42\\%$ of the public disapproves of the way Trump is handling his job very strongly, while $12\\%$ say they disapprove not so strongly [4]. Additionally, the gender gap in approval ratings is notable, with $48\\%$ of men approving of Trump's performance, while just $30\\%$ of women say the same [6]. Furthermore, younger adults, those with higher levels of education, and non-whites are more likely to disapprove of the job Trump is doing [8].\n\nConsidering the data provided, it appears that the low ethical standards ratings of Trump's administration officials correlate with the public's disapproval of his job performance. As shown in the image8, the majority of the public disapproves of Trump's performance, with $54\\%$ disapproving strongly and $39\\%$ disapproving not so strongly. This aligns with the text which states that $42\\%$ of the public disapproves of the way Trump is handling his job very strongly, while $12\\%$ say they disapprove not so strongly [4].\n\nIn conclusion, the approval ratings of Trump's administration officials' ethical standards are notably lower than those of past administrations, and this is closely related to the public's disapproval of Trump's job performance, especially among disapprovers and certain demographic groups. ![Public disapproval strongly correlates with low ethical standards ratings](image8)"}

This suggests that higher education may correlate with a more critical assessment of both parties' ethical standards [12].\n\nFurthermore, partisan leanings strongly influence these perceptions. For example, while only $19\\%$ of Republicans and $18\\%$ of Democrats say that neither party has high ethical standards, this number rises to $34\\%$ among independents, with equal shares of Republican and Democratic leaners holding this view [9]. This indicates that independent voters, particularly those leaning towards the Democratic Party, are more likely to perceive both parties negatively in terms of ethical standards.\n\nRegarding approval ratings of Trump, the data show a notable gender gap where $48\\%$ of men approve of his performance, compared to $30\\%$ of women [10]. However, the data also reveal that there is a significant difference in approval ratings based on education level. Among those with at least a college degree, $31\\%$ believe that neither party has high ethical standards, whereas $43\\%$ believe that one party's standards are higher than the other's [12]. In contrast, among those with some college experience or a high school degree or less, $26\\%$ and $20\\%$ respectively, hold the view that neither party has high ethical standards [4].\n\nIn the context of political affiliations, the image `image6` illustrates that among Republicans and independents who lean Republican, a significant portion believes that neither party has high ethical standards. Conversely, among Democrats and independents who lean Democrat, a much larger proportion holds the view that at least one party has high ethical standards. This aligns with the broader trend observed in the data where Democrats tend to view their own party positively in terms of ethical standards, while Republicans are more divided [3].\n\nOverall, the data suggest that both educational attainment and political affiliation significantly shape perceptions of ethical standards and approval ratings of Trump. Higher education tends to correlate with a more critical stance on both parties, while political leanings can further polarize these views [12].\n\n![Both parties have low ethical standards among higher educated individuals](image12)"}

For instance, a large majority of Clinton voters believed that Trump's election would lead to worse race relations, with only 2% expecting improvements and 13% seeing no change [2, 8, 9]. This stark contrast can be seen in the image4, where the expectations among Clinton voters are overwhelmingly negative, with 41% expecting race relations to worsen, 84% saying there will be no change, and only 3% anticipating improvements. \n\nOn the other hand, Trump voters exhibited greater optimism regarding race relations, with 50% expecting them to improve and 38% believing there would be no change [9, 10]. This can be observed in image5, showing a substantial portion of Trump voters (50%) expecting race relations to improve, with 38% indicating no change and 9% expecting worsening conditions. \n\nRegarding partisan relations, the expectations were more mixed but generally less optimistic overall. Image7 illustrates that a significant portion of all voters were unwilling to give Trump a chance, which could imply skepticism about improved relations. The data also indicates that while some Trump voters (47%) expected partisan relations to improve, a considerable number (43%) felt they would remain unchanged or worsen [10]. Similarly, the image8 shows that a majority of voters, regardless of party affiliation, were unhappy with the state of partisan relations, with 27% expecting them to improve and 27% predicting they would worsen, while 45% anticipated little change [11].\n\nThe presence of enthusiastic supporters can have profound implications for both race and partisan relations. As seen in image1, supporters of a president often believe that more gets done when their side is in power, which can lead to a sense of division and reduced cooperation. This sentiment is further reinforced by the fact that voters were more pessimistic about partisan relations improving in the future, as indicated by the image12, where 79% of Americans believed the country was more politically divided than in the past. \n\nIn summary, voters' expectations of race relations after the 2016 election were more negative compared to their expectations for partisan relations, reflecting a significant divide along party lines.

Conversely, Democratic voters showed a greater divide, with a shift towards a more liberal stance, as indicated by the increase from 38% in 2014 to 49% in 2016, according to quote [10]. This change reflects a growing ideological gap within the Democratic party.\n\n![](image1)\n\nIn terms of voter reactions to the 2016 election outcomes, the graph from image4 illustrates a stark contrast between Clinton and Trump voters. A whopping 94% of Trump voters were happy with the Republican Party retaining control of Congress, while a large majority of Clinton voters (87%) were unhappy.

This shift is particularly pronounced among Republicans, where the percentage saying the government is doing very or fairly well has dropped from 59% in January to only 18% today (image2).\n\nThe image3 provides further insight into the political divide, showing that Republicans are much more likely to believe that anti-terrorism policies have not gone far enough to protect the country, while Democrats and Independents are more evenly split between these views. Specifically, 71% of Republicans now express this view, up from 57% in January and 38% in July 2013. In contrast, 67% of Democrats and 74% of moderate and liberal Republicans also believe that the policies have not gone far enough.\n\nAge also plays a significant role. According to image6, older adults (50-64 and 65+) are more likely to say the government is not doing well in combating terrorism compared to younger adults (18-29). For instance, 66% of those aged 50-64 and 80% of those aged 65+ say the government is not doing well, whereas only 47% of those aged 18-29 hold this view (image1).\n\nThe graph in image7 illustrates that the percentage of Republicans who say the government has not gone far enough to protect the country has increased significantly since 2013, rising from 38% to 71%. Among Democrats, however, the increase has been smaller, from 54% in January to 64% currently (image8).\n\nIn conclusion, public perceptions of government efforts to combat terrorism have deteriorated over time, becoming more negative across the board. These perceptions are notably more negative among Republicans and older adults, indicating a significant shift in sentiment since the Snowden disclosures in 2013."}

For instance, older and less educated Americans are more likely to view the government's efforts negatively compared to younger and more educated individuals. This is evident from the quote [11], where it states that \"Older, less educated give more negative ratings of govt efforts against terrorism.\" The image `![Perceptions of government efforts to reduce the terrorist threat vary by age and education level](image6)` illustrates this trend, showing that the percentage of people who believe the government is not doing well increasing with age.\n\nAdditionally, the data reveals that perceptions of government efforts to combat terrorism have become more negative across the political spectrum. Democrats are now the only partisan group in which a majority say the government is doing at least fairly well, down significantly from earlier. Independents' positive ratings have dropped by 25 points, and Republicans have seen a decline from 63% to 27%. This can be seen in the quote [3], which states, \"Compared to early 2015, assessments of government efforts to combat terrorism are more negative across the political spectrum.\"\n\nThe image `![Perceptions of government efforts to reduce the terrorist threat vary by political affiliation over time](image2)` provides a visual representation of these changes. It shows that while in February 2015, 64% of Democrats approved of the government's efforts, this figure has decreased to 54% by December 2015. Similarly, the approval ratings for Republicans and independents have declined, indicating a broader shift in public opinion.\n\nFurthermore, the data indicates that younger adults generally have more positive views of government efforts to reduce the terrorist threat. For example, among those 18-29 years old, 53% say the government is doing very or fairly well, while 46% give a negative rating. This is in contrast to those 50 and older, where 57% give a negative rating, and only 42% say the government is doing well. This trend is illustrated in the quote [4], which states, \"Among those 50 and older, a majority (57%) say the government is not doing well reducing the terrorist threat (42% say that it is).\"\n\nThe image `![Perceptions of government efforts to reduce the terrorist threat vary by age group](image1)` further supports this observation. It shows that among adults aged 18-29, 56% are concerned that the government's anti-terror policies have not gone far enough to protect the country, while 28% are concerned that these policies have gone too far. For those aged 65 and older, the concern is reversed, with 71% worried that the policies have gone too far, and only 21% thinking they have not gone far enough.\n\nIn conclusion, the data and images clearly demonstrate that both age and political ideology significantly influence perceptions of government efforts to reduce the terrorist threat, and these perceptions have become more negative over time."}

In contrast, older adults, particularly those aged 65 and above, express a stronger preference for increased security measures, with 71% saying they are more concerned about the lack of protection compared to civil liberties restrictions (43%) [8].\n\nThe graph in `image4` illustrates these differences clearly, showing that younger adults are more concerned about civil liberties, while older adults, especially those over 65, are more worried about the government not going far enough to protect the country.\n\nRegarding political affiliations, the data reveal a notable shift in opinions since Edward Snowden’s revelations in 2013. According to `image7`, Republicans have become increasingly concerned that anti-terrorism policies do not go far enough to protect the country. Specifically, the share of Republicans who believe this rose from 57% in January 2015 to 71% in December 2015, a 14-point increase [5]. On the other hand, Democrats' views have been more consistent, with `image11` indicating that 54% of them now believe that policies do not go far enough, a slight increase from January 2015 but still higher than in 2013 [11].\n\nIn `image6`, the overall sentiment is reflected by a growing number of respondents expressing concern that anti-terrorism policies do not go far enough to protect the country, from 47% in 2009 to 55% in 2015. This trend is evident across all age groups, but it is particularly pronounced among older adults and Republicans.\n\nThe graph in `image2` also highlights the political divide, showing that while the Islamic militant group ISIS is seen as a major threat by a wide majority across all groups, Republicans are more concerned about this threat compared to Democrats and Independents. The difference in opinion is particularly stark when comparing the levels of concern about Iran's nuclear program and North Korea's nuclear program, where Republicans are more worried about these threats than Democrats and Independents [2].\n\nIn conclusion, opinions on government anti-terrorism efforts have evolved over time, with younger adults and older adults having distinct preferences. Politically, the shift towards believing that anti-terrorism policies do not go far enough is more pronounced among Republicans, especially those who are more conservative. This suggests a significant ideological divide in perceptions of government security measures and civil liberties."}

For instance, the majority of white evangelicals believe that Muslims living in the U.S. should be subject to more scrutiny due to their religion, with 50% saying so, compared to 43% who disagree [1]. This contrasts sharply with non-white groups, where 74% of blacks and 66% of Hispanics believe Muslims should not face greater scrutiny solely because of their faith [4].\n\nMoreover, younger individuals, particularly those aged 18-29, are less likely to support increased scrutiny. Eighty percent of young adults say that Muslims should not be subjected to greater scrutiny because of their religion [10], reflecting a more inclusive attitude among the younger generation.\n\nOn the other hand, older adults (ages 50 and above) are more divided, with 50% supporting increased scrutiny and 41% opposing it [11]. This suggests that generational attitudes play a role in perceptions of Muslim scrutiny.\n\nThe partisan divide is also evident. While 49% of Republicans are evenly split on the issue, with 44% supporting greater scrutiny, a clear majority of Democrats (76%) and independents (62%) believe Muslims should not be subject to additional scrutiny because of their religion [9]. This indicates that political affiliation significantly influences opinions on Muslim scrutiny.\n\nAdditionally, there is a strong correlation between the perceived importance of terrorism and the support for increased scrutiny. According to the data, 41% of Republicans list terrorism, defense issues, and national security as the most pressing problems facing the nation [6]. However, when it comes to the federal government's efforts to prevent terrorism, 80% of young adults and 63% of those aged 30-49 say that additional scrutiny of U.S. Muslims should not be a part of these efforts [10]. This suggests that while some groups view terrorism as a critical issue, they do not necessarily support increased scrutiny of Muslims.\n\nIn summary, the perception of increased scrutiny of Muslims varies widely across different demographics and political affiliations. Younger, non-white, and Democratic-leaning groups tend to be more supportive of equal treatment, while older, Republican-leaning groups are more likely to favor increased scrutiny.

This trend is also reflected in text quote [4], which states that for the first time, more people now say the government is doing not too well or not at all well in reducing the threat of terrorism (52%) compared to those who say it is doing very or fairly well (46%). This marked a 26-point decline in positive evaluations since January.\n\nThe perception of terrorism as a top concern has risen sharply. According to text quote [10], the share of Americans citing terrorism, national security, or ISIS as the most important problem has surged to 29%, up from just 4% a year ago.

This disparity is further highlighted by the survey results presented in `image6`, where the percentage of Republicans who rate the government's efforts to reduce the terrorist threat positively is notably higher at 46%, compared to 27% of Republicans who view it negatively.

A majority of Republicans believe that government regulation does more harm than good, whereas Democrats are more likely to see it as necessary to protect the public interest. Independents, however, show a more balanced view, with a larger portion preferring bigger government providing more services, indicating a preference for a more active regulatory role compared to Republicans, but not as much as Democrats.\n\nRegarding economic fairness, the Pew Research Center data (text quote [12]) reveals that Republicans are more likely to believe the U.S. economic system is fair to most Americans (63%), while Democrats are less likely to agree (14%).

For instance, in the context of gender, the percentage of men who favor the Republican Party is higher (56%) compared to women (44%), while women favor the Democratic Party more (70%) compared to men (26%) [image2]. This indicates that gender can influence the political leanings and perceptions of both parties.\n\nAdditionally, age plays a role in shaping these views. Younger individuals (ages 18-29) are more likely to favor the Democratic Party (25%) compared to older generations, while older individuals (65+) tend to favor the Republican Party (21%) [image4]. This suggests that generational differences can also contribute to the varying levels of favorability towards the two parties.\n\nOverall, the unfavorable views towards both major U.S. political parties have increased among independents, particularly among those who lean towards a specific party.

The data indicates that in 2018, 66% of Americans favored one party and were unfavorable towards the other, while 17% expressed unfavorable views of both parties, down from 36% in 2015 [9].\n\nMoreover, the data also reveals that independents, who do not lean to a specific party, are more likely to have unfavorable views of both parties. According to the survey, 37% of independents had an unfavorable opinion of both parties in 2018, compared to only 11% who viewed the Democratic Party favorably and 9% who viewed the Republican Party favorably [12]. This stark contrast highlights the polarizing nature of the political landscape.\n\n![](image6) The graph above further underscores this trend, showing the increasing share of Republicans and Democrats who view the opposing party favorably while viewing their own party favorably, and the declining share of those who view both parties unfavorably. By 2018, a majority of Republican leaners viewed the Republican Party favorably (55%), while just 24% viewed both parties unfavorably [6].\n\nIn summary, the unfavorable views toward the opposing party have significantly increased among all political affiliations, reflecting a highly polarized political environment. Independents, who do not lean to a specific party, are particularly divided, with a higher percentage having unfavorable views of both parties. As of 2018, 37% of independents viewed both parties unfavorably, indicating a deep divide within the non-partisan voter base."}

In fact, around two-thirds of Americans (64%) believe that China has done a bad job dealing with the coronavirus outbreak [8]. This sentiment is reflected in the rising unfavorable views of China, with 73% of U.S. adults now holding such views, up 26 percentage points since 2018 [11].\n\nMoreover, as seen in image3, Republicans and those leaning towards the GOP are more critical of China. In 2020, 73% of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents viewed China unfavorably, compared to 37% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents [4]. This partisan divide is also evident in the desire to hold China accountable for its actions. While 50% of Americans think the U.S. should hold China responsible for the role it played in the outbreak, even at the expense of economic relations, Republicans are significantly more likely to support this stance, with 71% agreeing compared to 37% of Democrats and Democratic leaners [6].\n\nThe evolving perceptions have also impacted broader U.S.-China relations, particularly regarding economic ties. As illustrated in image1, while more Americans still see the U.S. as the world's leading economy (52%), views of U.S. economic superiority have declined by 7 percentage points over the past four months. Additionally, those who see China as economically dominant are less likely to support getting tough on China economically, instead prioritizing building a strong relationship with China on economic issues [2]. Furthermore, the survey indicates that while Americans are divided on whether the U.S. should pursue a strong economic relationship or get tough on China, more Americans (51%) prefer a strong economic relationship, even if it means overlooking any role China played in the outbreak [3].\n\nIn summary, American perceptions of China's role in handling the COVID-19 pandemic have led to a significant increase in unfavorable views and a shift in attitudes towards China, particularly among Republicans.

In the U.S., half of the respondents name the United States as the world's leading economic power, while about a third choose China (32%). Conversely, in Germany, roughly half name China as the leading economic power (53%), whereas only 24% name the U.S. as such. This disparity is also reflected in their views on the European Union (EU), where 14% of Germans name the EU as the leading economic power, a figure that is about twice as high as in the U.S. (7%). The image `![Views on Leading Economic Powers](image2)` illustrates these differences clearly, showing that Germany places more emphasis on China and the EU, while the U.S. sees itself as the leading economic power.\n\nWhen it comes to international relationships, the survey reveals that Americans and Germans also have different perspectives. Americans are generally more positive towards the United Nations (UN) and NATO, with 66% and 58% viewing these organizations favorably, respectively. Germans, on the other hand, have a more positive view of the EU (71%), followed by the UN (64%) and NATO (62%). The image `![International Organizations](image4)` further highlights this difference, demonstrating that Germans are more inclined towards the EU, while Americans are more supportive of the UN and NATO. \n\nMoreover, the survey indicates that when it comes to cooperation with other countries, nearly seven-in-ten Americans (69%) want to cooperate more with Germany, compared to only half of Germans who feel the same way about the U.S. (see `![Cooperation with Germany](image1)`). This suggests that while Americans see Germany as a key partner, Germans are more ambivalent about their relationship with the U.S.\n\nIn summary, the views of Americans and Germans differ significantly regarding the leading economic powers and international relationships. Americans predominantly see themselves as the leading economic power and are more positive towards the U.S., while Germans place more importance on China and the EU. Additionally, there is a notable difference in their views on international organizations like the UN and NATO, with Germans being more supportive of the EU compared to Americans."}

For instance, when asked which country is the world's leading economic power, Americans and Germans gave starkly different answers. Half of Americans named the U.S., with about a third (32%) choosing China, whereas roughly half of Germans named China (53%) as the leading economic power, compared with 24% who named the U.S. (Text Quote [7], Text Quote [8]).\n\n![](image1)\n\nIn contrast, when it comes to views on international organizations, Germans tend to view them more positively than Americans. For example, about 70% of Germans favor the EU, while only about half of Americans agree. Similarly, Germans tend to view the UN and NATO more positively than Americans, although there is notable consensus on these organizations (Text Quote [10]). The image below illustrates these differences, showing that Germans have a more positive view of the EU (+18), Russia (+17), and China (+8) compared to Americans. \n\n![](image5)\n\nThese perceptions are influenced by several factors, including ideological differences. Conservatives and those on the right of the ideological spectrum in both countries are more likely to view Russia favorably, while liberals and those on the left are more likely to favor the UN and EU (Text Quote [11]). Additionally, the division is notably wider between Americans than it is between Germans on these issues.\n\n![](image6)\n\nAnother factor is the geographical location within Germany. Germans living in the former East tend to view Russia more favorably (43%) and the EU less favorably (59%) compared to those in the former West (71% for the EU) (Text Quote [4]).\n\n![](image7)\n\nAge also plays a role. Younger Germans (18-29) and those aged 30-49 are more likely to favor China than older age groups (Text Quote [12]). \n\nIn summary, Americans and Germans differ significantly in their views of international organizations and economic powers, with these differences being influenced by factors such as ideology, geographical location, and age. Americans tend to view the U.S. as the leading economic power and are more skeptical of international organizations like the EU and the UN, while Germans tend to have a more positive view of these organizations and are more likely to view China as the leading economic power."}

In contrast, in Germany, nearly 60% of those on the right see military force as necessary, while only about a third of those on the left agree. Additionally, Americans are more likely than Germans to believe that military force is sometimes necessary to maintain order in the world; approximately 80% of Americans hold this view, compared to only about 50% of Germans. This is illustrated in image1, where the gap between Republicans/Lean Rep and Democrats/Lean Dem is evident over the years (2017-2019).\n\nOn the topic of defense spending, the data shows that Americans are more inclined than Germans to support keeping the same level of spending. In 2019, 50% of Americans said that U.S. allies should maintain their defense spending levels, marking a shift from 45% in 2017 who believed they should increase their spending. However, in Germany, public opinion is more divided, with about 40% each supporting an increase or maintaining the current levels, as shown in image6. The percentage of Americans who see a need for European allies to increase national defense spending has decreased since 2017, while Germans are equally split between increasing or maintaining their budgets.\n\nRegarding the age demographics' views on U.S.-Germany relations, there is a noticeable generational divide.

According to quote [1], Republicans are more likely to believe the U.S.'s international influence will be strengthened post-crisis, whereas Democrats are more likely to think it will weaken. This gap is even more pronounced within the Democratic party, where liberal supporters are more pessimistic about the U.S.'s influence (quote [1]). Similarly, there is a large divide over China's influence, with Republicans and older Americans more likely to view China negatively (quotes [2] and [6]). The data also show that when asked about the EU's influence, majorities from both parties expect it to remain unchanged (quote [3]).\n\nSecondly, education plays a role in shaping these views. Higher education levels correlate with a perception that the U.S.'s global influence will decrease. For instance, quote [10] indicates that Americans with higher educational attainment are more likely to think the country's global influence will recede.\n\nThe images further illustrate these trends. Image1 shows the distribution of views based on education level, highlighting that those with higher education are more likely to believe the U.S.'s influence will weaken (total 41%, postgraduates 37%, etc.).

While half of Americans think China will have less influence, fewer hold the same view for the U.S. or the European Union (quote [10]).

Similarly, when asked about the WHO's performance, a majority of Democrats (67%) and moderate and conservative Democrats (58%) give the WHO positive reviews, while only 21% of Republican conservatives do so.\n\nThese perceptions and the resulting partisan differences are illustrated in the image depicting the trust levels in the WHO, where Democrats and moderate/conservative Democrats overwhelmingly trust the organization, while Republicans express much lower levels of trust. Additionally, the image showing the U.S.'s assessment of its own performance during the pandemic highlights the stark contrast between Democratic and Republican viewpoints, with 81% of liberal Democrats believing the U.S. has done only a fair or poor job, compared to just 22% of conservative Republicans holding the same view.\n\nIn summary, Americans, especially those on the conservative end of the political spectrum, perceive China's handling of the coronavirus outbreak negatively and anticipate a decline in China's global influence post-pandemic. These perceptions are deeply rooted in partisan divisions, with Democrats generally viewing China more favorably and Republicans more critically."}

The graph in `image1` shows that the percentage of Republicans believing the U.S. does too much in addressing global challenges has increased from 2013 to 2020, reaching 62% in 2020, while Democrats remain largely opposed to this view, with only 26% sharing this sentiment.\n\nAdditionally, the survey indicates that most Americans think the U.S. can learn from other countries about how to limit the spread of the coronavirus. However, there are stark differences between Democrats and Republicans on this issue. As shown in `image10`, 60% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents believe the U.S. can learn a great deal from other countries, whereas only 28% of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents agree.\n\nFurthermore, the graph in `image6` illustrates the partisan divide on the U.S.'s international influence. Democrats are more likely to expect the U.S. to lose influence due to the coronavirus outbreak. Specifically, 81% of liberal Democrats think the U.S. has only done a fair or poor job dealing with the coronavirus outbreak, compared to 22% of conservative Republicans holding the same view. Moreover, the belief that the U.S. will have less influence in world affairs after the outbreak is significantly higher among liberal Democrats (56%) than among moderate and conservative Democrats (15%) and even more so among conservative Republicans (8%).\n\nIn conclusion, Republicans are more likely to believe the U.S. does too much in addressing global challenges and are less inclined to see the U.S. learning from other countries to combat the coronavirus. Conversely, Democrats are more likely to perceive the U.S. as doing poorly in handling the crisis and anticipate a decline in U.S. international influence. These trends have been consistent since 2013, as indicated by the data presented in the graphs."}

This indicates that Democrats are more optimistic about the potential for learning from other nations.\n\nAdditionally, partisan views differ on the U.S.'s role in global affairs. A larger proportion of liberal Democrats (64%) believe the U.S. should help other countries deal with their problems compared to 39% of the general population ([9]). Moreover, liberal Democrats (56%) are more pessimistic about the U.S.'s future influence in world affairs post-pandemic, believing it will have less influence, whereas only 8% of conservative Republicans share this view ([3]).\n\n![The U.S. should help other countries deal with their problems](image5) The data also highlights that there is a strong belief among Democrats, especially liberal Democrats, that the U.S. should help other countries.

This is illustrated in image6, where Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents are more likely to support helping other countries, with 60% saying the U.S. should help. In contrast, Republicans and Republican-leaning independents are more likely to prioritize dealing with domestic issues, with 77% wanting the U.S. to handle its own problems (image7).\n\nMoreover, the relationship between education and these views is evident. Postgraduates, who are better educated, are more likely to support the U.S. helping other countries (66%, see image1), while those with lower educational attainment are more likely to prefer the U.S. focusing on its own issues (43%, image1). The data in image2 further confirm this trend, showing that highly educated individuals (postgraduates and college graduates) are more likely to believe the U.S. can learn a great deal from other countries about slowing the spread of the coronavirus (56% and 50%, respectively).\n\nIn summary, the evidence suggests that Democrats and more educated Americans are more likely to advocate for the U.S. helping other countries and learning from them, while Republicans and those with lower educational attainment tend to prioritize addressing domestic issues. This pattern is consistent across different demographic groups, as seen in the trends shown in images1 through 8."}

This significant divide is evident when we look at the data across different age groups and educational levels, as shown in image1. The figure indicates that the percentage of Republicans who think the U.S. does too much is consistently higher compared to Democrats, regardless of age or education level.\n\nFurthermore, the partisan gap in perceptions has widened over time. As shown in image6, in 2013, only 26% of Republicans believed the U.S. did too much, compared to 48% in 2020. This shift is even more pronounced when we consider the trend line, which demonstrates a steady increase in the percentage of Republicans who think the U.S. does too much to solve global challenges.\n\nThe ideological divide among Democrats is also noteworthy. According to image8, liberal Democrats are more likely to support the idea that the U.S. should help other countries deal with their problems, with 64% agreeing, compared to 44% of conservative and moderate Democrats. This suggests that while there is a general trend towards Republicans believing the U.S. does too much, the internal division within the Democratic Party is more nuanced, with liberal Democrats being more supportive of international aid.\n\nAdditionally, the data reveals that more educated Americans are more critical of the U.S. role in addressing global issues. Image7 shows that 66% of postgraduates believe the U.S. has done an only fair or poor job, compared to 43% of those with a high school degree or less. However, these perceptions are most divided along party lines. Image4 illustrates that while a majority of Democrats (73%) and Democratic-leaning independents (63%) rate the U.S. response to the coronavirus outbreak more negatively, a similar proportion of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents (71%) praise the country's handling of the outbreak. This partisan divide is further emphasized by the racial disparities in evaluations, where Black and Hispanic Americans rate the U.S. response more negatively than white, non-Hispanic Americans (see image5).\n\nIn conclusion, the data clearly shows that perceptions of the U.S. role in solving world problems are significantly influenced by political affiliation, with Republicans more likely to believe the U.S. does too much and Democrats more likely to believe the U.S. does too little. These perceptions have become more polarized over time, particularly among Republicans, who have increasingly viewed the U.S. as overcommitting to global challenges."}

This sentiment is reflected in their preference for the U.S. to focus on its own problems rather than helping others (image9). The partisan divide is stark, with 77% of conservative Republicans believing the U.S. should deal with its own problems (image1).\n\nOn the other hand, Democrats are more likely to think the U.S. does too little to help solve world problems (48%), with 26% each saying it does the right amount or too much (image1). Liberal Democrats are even more inclined to support international assistance, with 64% believing the U.S. should help other countries deal with their problems (image2). This ideological difference within the Democratic Party is also evident in other measures, such as the belief that the U.S. should help other countries deal with their problems (image9).\n\nEducational attainment plays a significant role in shaping these views. Higher levels of education correlate with a greater willingness to support international assistance. For instance, 60% of postgraduates say the U.S. should help other countries deal with their problems, compared to 44% of those with some college experience and 43% of those with a high school diploma or less (image1).\n\nMoreover, there is a noticeable trend over time where the partisan divide on these issues has grown more pronounced. The gap between Republicans and Democrats in their views on U.S. global engagement has widened since 2013 (image3), and similarly, the difference in views on how the U.S. has handled the coronavirus outbreak has also increased (image6).\n\nIn conclusion, Republicans, especially conservative ones, tend to favor a more isolationist approach, believing the U.S. does too much in global engagement and should focus on domestic issues. In contrast, Democrats, particularly liberals, are more supportive of international assistance, reflecting a broader belief in the U.S.'s role in addressing global challenges. Higher education levels generally correlate with a stronger inclination towards supporting international aid, regardless of political affiliation."}

According to image1, only 63% of Americans have confidence in Biden to deal effectively with China, indicating a notable disparity. This is further illustrated by image7, where 86% and 76% of Americans consider cyberattacks from China and China's growing military power to be very serious, respectively, yet only 32% and 41% have a lot of confidence in Biden to handle these issues.\n\nMoreover, the data in image2 shows an increase in concern regarding the loss of U.S. jobs to China and China's growing military power.

This trend is consistent with the finding that 70% of Americans aged 50 and over are in favor of limiting Chinese students, compared to 66% of those aged 30 to 49 and just 44% of those aged 18 to 29 [8].\n\nMoreover, political affiliation plays a crucial role in shaping these opinions. Republicans are more likely to support limitations on Chinese students, with 58% of Republicans and Republican-leaning individuals favoring such measures, compared to 49% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning individuals [8].

This sentiment is reflected in the data from image1, where Republicans and Democrats are equally critical of China's policies, with 60% of Democrats and 19% of Republicans expressing confidence in Biden to deal effectively with China [11].\n\n![Public opinion on dealing with China](image6)\n\nImage6 further demonstrates the stark divide between Democrats and Republicans regarding the approach to China. While 83% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents have confidence in Biden to deal effectively with China, only 19% of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents share the same view [11]. This division is evident in the priorities set by different political groups, with Republicans prioritizing limiting China's power and influence over strengthening economic relations [9].\n\nIn conclusion, the key concerns of Americans regarding China include cyber attacks, job losses, technological advancements, human rights abuses, and the overall impact on the U.S. economy and security. These concerns have clearly grown stronger over the past year, as evidenced by the increasing percentages of Americans who view these issues as very serious problems."}

For instance, the share of Latinos who expect their family's financial situation to improve \"a lot\" or \"some\" has risen from 67% in 2008 to 81% in 2015, a 14 percentage point increase. This growth is notably faster than that of the general population, where the share of optimists increased by only 6 percentage points over the same period (from 61% to 67%).\n\n![](image5) This graph illustrates the gap between Latino optimism and the general population's optimism, showing that the difference widened from 16 percentage points in 2004 to 20 percentage points in 2015.\n\nMoreover, the optimism has been particularly strong among younger Latinos. For example, the share of Latinos aged 18 to 29 who believe their personal finances are in \"excellent\" or \"good\" shape has doubled, increasing from 11% in 2008 to 23% in 2015. Additionally, the share of Latinos with some college education who expect significant improvements in their finances has increased by 20 percentage points since 2008, compared to just 9 percentage points for those with a high school diploma or less.\n\n![](image7) This chart breaks down the optimism changes among various Hispanic subgroups, showing that optimism among U.S.-born and foreign-born Latinos, males and females, and those with different levels of education all saw substantial increases.\n\nIn contrast, the general population's optimism about their financial situation has remained relatively stable. While there was a slight increase in the share of optimists from 2008 to 2015, the overall sentiment among the general population did not change as dramatically as it did among Latinos.\n\n![](image6) The graph indicates that while the optimism of the general population increased by 6 percentage points, the increase among Latinos was much larger, reaching 14 percentage points.\n\nOverall, the financial optimism among different Hispanic subgroups has not only improved but also expanded more rapidly compared to the general population, reflecting a broader sense of economic recovery and resilience within the Hispanic community."}

Furthermore, there are notable differences by educational attainment among Latinos. Among those with at least some college experience, 69% expect their children will be better off financially, with a similar share (71%) of those with less than a high school education saying the same [10]. However, Latino high school graduates are more optimistic than those with some college experience or more, with 79% predicting that their children will be better off financially.\n\n![Financial expectations vary by educational attainment](image10)\n\nIn other words, the higher the level of education, the more optimistic parents tend to be about their children's financial futures.

The share of Latinos who expect their family finances to improve \"a lot\" or \"some\" has increased from 43% in 2004 to 81% in 2015 [4]. This optimism is reflected in the graph in `image1`, which shows a steady increase in the percentage of Latinos expecting improvements in their finances over the years, reaching a peak of 60% in 2015.\n\nHowever, despite this optimism, the economic reality paints a different picture. Median household income for Hispanics has stagnated since the Great Recession, remaining around $42,491 in 2014, which is essentially unchanged since the recession began [5]. Additionally, the poverty rate for Hispanics, which peaked at 26.5% in 2010, remained above pre-recession levels at 23.6% in 2014. This can be seen in `image2`, where the line for Hispanic households is below the line for all households, indicating lower median income and higher poverty rates compared to the general public.\n\nUnemployment trends among Latinos have shown improvement since the Great Recession, with the unemployment rate falling from a high of 12.8% in the first quarter of 2010 to 6.4% in the last quarter of 2015, and further to 5.6% in the first quarter of 2016 [6]. Nevertheless, this rate remains above its 2006 low of 5% and is higher than that for non-Hispanic workers in 2015, as shown in `image7`.\n\nThe graph in `image8` illustrates the change in economic optimism among different subgroups of Latinos, showing that the gains in optimism are particularly pronounced among younger individuals. The percentage of Latinos aged 18-29 who expect their financial condition to get better increased by 27 percentage points from 2008 to 2015, while those aged 30 to 49 and 50 to 64 saw increases of 14 and 16 percentage points, respectively.\n\nIn summary, while there has been a notable increase in the optimism about financial well-being among Latinos from 2000 to 2015, the actual economic indicators such as median income and poverty rates have not shown significant improvement. Unemployment rates have decreased but remain higher than before the Great Recession. This contrast highlights the complex nature of economic recovery and the persistent challenges faced by the Latino community."}

The unemployment rate for Hispanics has improved since the Great Recession, falling from a high of 12.8% in the first quarter of 2010 to 5.6% in the first quarter of 2016 [8]. However, it still remains above its low of 5% in the fourth quarter of 2006 and is higher than the non-Hispanic workers' rate in 2015 [8]. This trend is illustrated in image8, showing a more stable unemployment rate for non-Hispanic workers compared to Hispanics during and after the recession.\n\nIn terms of economic perceptions, Hispanics are generally more optimistic about their current and future economic conditions. As shown in image5, 35% of Hispanics in a December 2015 Pew Research Center survey said that economic conditions today are good or excellent, a higher share than whites (25%). Additionally, one-third of Hispanics (34%) expect U.S. economic conditions to be better in the coming year, a share about twice as high as seen among other groups of Americans [5].\n\nHowever, despite growing confidence and a larger economic footprint, federal government data indicates a mixed economic picture for the Hispanic community. Median household income for Hispanics has stagnated since the Great Recession, with a median of $42,491 in 2014, essentially unchanged from the recession period [2]. The poverty rate for Hispanics in 2014 was 23.6%, which is below the peak of 26.5% in 2010 but remains above pre-recession levels [2]. Image2 provides a visual representation of this disparity, showing that while the median income for all households is around $53,700, the Hispanic median income is significantly lower at $42,500.\n\nThe wealth gap is also evident, with Hispanic households experiencing the largest percentage decline in their net worth through 2009 compared to other racial or ethnic groups. Unlike white households, Hispanic net worth continued to fall after the recession [2]. This is further highlighted in image1, where only 72% of Latinos believe their children will be better off financially than they are now, compared to 55% of the general population.\n\nThese trends suggest that while there has been some improvement in employment rates and optimism among Hispanics, significant disparities persist in income and wealth. The resilience and optimism of the Hispanic community may indicate potential for future growth, but the ongoing challenges in wealth accumulation and income stability highlight the need for targeted policies to address these disparities.\n\nOverall, the data shows that Hispanics have experienced improvements in employment but continue to face economic challenges, particularly in terms of wealth accumulation and income stability compared to non-Hispanic populations."}

This is illustrated in image4, showing a decline in the Hispanic unemployment rate but remaining higher than the non-Hispanic rate during the period. This suggests that while there has been improvement, the Hispanic community continues to face higher unemployment compared to the broader U.S. population.\n\nSecondly, when looking at income, median household income for Hispanics has stagnated since the Great Recession, remaining at approximately $42,491 in 2014, essentially unchanged from the period of the Great Recession. This is in comparison to the general U.S. public, where income is also little changed. Image6 provides a visual representation of this trend, showing that while income for all households has increased slightly over the period, the growth for Hispanic households has been minimal. Additionally, the purchasing power of the U.S. Latino community grew significantly, reaching $1.3 trillion in 2014, a 155% increase from earlier periods, indicating that despite stagnant income, purchasing power has grown due to population growth.\n\nIn terms of poverty rates, the Hispanic poverty rate was 23.6% in 2014, down from a peak of 26.5% in 2010 but still above pre-recession levels. The general U.S. poverty rate also increased during the recession but has since decreased. Image8 shows the poverty rate trends for different racial and ethnic groups, illustrating that while the poverty rate for Hispanics has improved, it remains higher than the pre-recession levels and is higher than the rate for the general U.S. population.\n\nFinally, concerning wealth, Hispanic households experienced the largest percentage decline in net worth through 2009 compared to other major racial or ethnic groups. Unlike white households, their net worth continued to fall after the recession. Image7 provides a visual representation of the changes in net worth among different demographic groups, highlighting the disparity in wealth accumulation between Hispanic and non-Hispanic households.\n\nIn conclusion, while there has been some improvement in unemployment and a growing sense of optimism about the economic future among Hispanics, the challenges in terms of income stagnation, higher poverty rates, and wealth inequality persist. These trends indicate that although the Hispanic community has made strides, particularly in employment, it still faces significant economic challenges compared to the broader U.S. population. ![Hispanic unemployment remains higher than non-Hispanic](image4) ![Income stagnation among Hispanics](image6) ![Poverty rates for Hispanics](image8)"}

As shown in image5, only 18% of seniors own a smartphone, significantly lower than the national average of 55%. This disparity is starkly evident across different age groups, with smartphone ownership decreasing sharply among those in their mid-70s and beyond [10]. \n\nInternet and broadband adoption also vary significantly based on educational attainment and income levels. College graduates exhibit higher rates of both internet and broadband adoption compared to those without a college degree. For instance, 87% of seniors with a college degree go online, while only 40% of those without a college degree do so [2]. Similarly, 76% of college graduates have broadband at home, whereas just 27% of non-college graduates have it [2].\n\nIncome levels play a crucial role as well. Seniors in households earning $75,000 or more have much higher rates of internet and broadband adoption—90% go online and 82% have broadband at home [12]. In contrast, seniors earning less than $30,000 annually have much lower rates, with only 39% going online and 25% having broadband at home [12]. These figures highlight a significant digital divide, where wealthier and more educated seniors are more likely to engage with online technologies.\n\nFrom the provided data, we can see that education and income are strong predictors of technology adoption among seniors. The graph in image2 illustrates this trend clearly, showing that higher education and income correlate with higher rates of internet and broadband use. The data also indicate that smartphone adoption is particularly low among the oldest seniors and those with lower incomes, as seen in image5, which breaks down smartphone ownership by age and income.\n\nIn summary, while a majority of seniors own cell phones, smartphone adoption and internet/broadband access are significantly influenced by educational attainment and income levels. College graduates and those with higher incomes are more likely to be fully connected, highlighting the need for targeted efforts to bridge the digital divide among older adults. ![Seniors with higher education and income are more likely to be connected](image2)"}

Similarly, seniors who have graduated from college are more likely to have broadband at home; 76% of college graduates have broadband compared to just 27% of those who have not attended college [9].\n\nAdditionally, there is a strong correlation between educational attainment and broadband adoption. Seniors with a college degree are 2.78 times more likely to have broadband at home compared to those who have not attended college [3]. This trend is consistent across different income brackets, although the disparity is particularly stark for those with lower incomes. For example, among seniors earning $75,000 or more annually, 82% have broadband, while only 25% of those earning less than $30,000 do [9].\n\nFrom the provided image5, we can see that the broadband adoption rate among seniors increases with higher education levels and higher household incomes. The graph clearly shows that the broadband adoption rate for seniors with a college degree is significantly higher than for those without a college education, and it is also higher for those in higher income brackets.\n\nOverall, the evidence suggests that broadband adoption at home is much higher among better-educated and higher-income seniors.

For instance, seniors who have graduated from college are around three times as likely to own both an e-book reader and a tablet as those who have not attended college ([12]). This trend is consistent across various technological devices. Specifically, for smartphones, the disparity is even more pronounced; those with an annual household income of $75,000 or more are around four times as likely to own each device as those with a household income of less than $30,000 per year ([12]).\n\n![Education level significantly impacts the adoption of tablets and e-book readers among seniors](image4)\n\nThis pattern suggests that higher education levels and higher incomes correlate with greater technological adoption, particularly for devices like tablets and e-book readers. However, the adoption rates of these devices among seniors are still relatively low compared to the general population. For example, only 18% of seniors own a tablet, an e-book reader, or both, which is lower than the national average for similar devices ([11]).\n\nExamining the trends over time, we see that the adoption of cell phones among seniors has been increasing, although at a modest pace. In 2006, only 79% of seniors had cell phones, whereas by 2012, this number increased to 86%. The adoption of smartphones, however, has been slower, with only 18% of seniors owning them in 2012 ([8], [6]). This indicates that while seniors are increasingly adopting mobile communication devices, the transition to more advanced devices like smartphones remains limited.\n\n![Adoption trends of cell phones and smartphones among seniors](image6)\n\nWhen comparing the adoption rates of tablets and e-book readers across different age groups, we find that younger seniors (ages 65-69) are more likely to own these devices than older seniors (ages 80+). For example, 54% of internet users aged 65-69 own a tablet or e-book reader, compared to just 27% of those aged 80 and older ([11]). This trend is consistent with the overall adoption patterns observed, where younger generations tend to adopt new technologies more quickly than older ones.\n\n![Adoption rates of tablets and e-book readers by age group among seniors](image7)\n\nIn conclusion, education level plays a significant role in the adoption of tablets and e-book readers among seniors, with higher education levels correlating with greater adoption rates. While there has been some increase in the adoption of mobile devices among seniors over time, the transition to more advanced devices like smartphones remains slow. The adoption rates for tablets and e-book readers among seniors are generally lower than those observed in the broader population, and they show a trend where younger seniors are more likely to adopt these devices compared to their older counterparts."}

College graduates are more likely to see these technologies as making their work more demanding (45%) and less demanding (31%), while those with only a high school diploma or less are less likely to agree, with 36% seeing no change.\n\nFor instance, image3 illustrates that among college graduates, 90% view word processing or spreadsheet software as having a positive impact on their careers, compared to 45% of those with a high school diploma or less. Similarly, smartphones, email or social media, and software managing daily schedules show a significant disparity in positive perceptions, with college graduates being more optimistic about the benefits of these technologies. This is further confirmed by image4, which shows a stark difference in the percentage of workers with high school diplomas or less who believe these technologies have no positive impact (ranging from 25% to 40%), compared to the relatively higher positive views held by college graduates.\n\nMoreover, the survey highlights that the positive views of workforce technologies are more common among those with higher educational attainment. Image5 and image7 demonstrate that college graduates are more likely to find that technology has made their work more interesting (64% vs. 38%) and increased their opportunities for career advancement (53% vs. 32%). This is consistent with the broader findings in text quotes [1], [2], and [10].\n\nRegarding the expectations for driverless car technology, image8 provides insight into public anticipation.

College graduates are more inclined to believe that technology has made their work more interesting ([9], [12]) and increased their career advancement opportunities ([9]). This is evident in the distribution of responses shown in `image1`, where college graduates have higher percentages for making work more interesting (64%) and increasing career advancement opportunities (53%) compared to those with a high school diploma or less (38% and 32%, respectively).\n\nMoreover, the impact of workforce automation varies among different professions. As seen in `image4`, there is a wide range of responses regarding the likelihood of experiencing an impact from technology. For example, fast food workers and insurance claims processors are more likely to report a significant impact, while software engineers and legal clerks are less so. However, a majority of respondents in all professions feel that technology has had a positive impact, particularly in areas like word processing or spreadsheet software, smartphones, and email or social media ([8], [11]).\n\nIn contrast, those with less education are much less likely to view technology positively. They are less likely to find their work more interesting or to see increased opportunities for career advancement due to technology ([9], [11]). This is reflected in `image5`, which shows that workers with a high school diploma or less are more likely to find their work less interesting (53%) and less likely to see increased career advancement opportunities (32%).\n\nAdditionally, the impact of technology on workers' perceptions of their job demands is also notable. While some workers, particularly those with higher education, may find technology making their work less demanding, others might experience a decrease in interest in their jobs ([10], [12]). This is illustrated in `image6`, where the distribution of responses shows that a significant portion of workers with a high school diploma or less find their work less interesting (53%) and have fewer opportunities for career advancement (32%).\n\nIn summary, the perceptions of the impact of workforce automation and technology vary widely depending on the level of education and the specific profession of the workers. College graduates tend to have more positive views on the role of technology in enhancing their careers, while those with less education are generally less optimistic about its benefits."}

As shown in image5, 64% of college graduates find that technology has made their work more interesting, compared to only 38% of workers with high school diplomas or less. Similarly, 53% of college graduates believe that technology has increased their opportunities for career advancement, whereas only 32% of those with lower educational attainment share this view.\n\nMoreover, the survey indicates that certain technologies have different impacts on workers depending on their professions. For example, image6 illustrates that software to manage daily schedules or routines, customer self-serve technologies, and industrial robots are viewed more positively by those with higher educational attainment. For instance, 58% of software engineers find that customer self-serve technologies have had a positive impact on their careers, while only 25% of fast food workers share this sentiment. This suggests that the benefits of these technologies are more likely to accrue to workers in professions that require higher skill levels and more complex tasks.\n\nIn contrast, workers with less educational attainment are more likely to perceive these technologies as having little impact on their jobs or careers. Image7, which categorizes workers by age, shows that younger workers (18-24 and 25-29) are more likely to see the positive impacts of technology on their careers, possibly due to their familiarity with and comfort level with new technologies.\n\nOverall, the evidence indicates that higher educational attainment correlates with more positive perceptions of the impact of workforce technologies on job interest and career advancement opportunities. This is illustrated in image5, where college graduates are significantly more likely to find that technology has made their work more interesting and increased their career advancement opportunities."}

This indicates a higher emotional engagement among younger users.\n- **Older Adults**: Older adults, especially those aged 65 and above, are less likely to feel amused but are more likely to feel angry. For instance, 30% of users in this age group frequently see content that makes them feel amused, while 24% feel angry [7].

This is evident from the data where 44% of users frequently feel amused, but 31% feel lonely and 29% feel depressed [4].\n\nRegarding emotions, the survey reveals that there is a modest correlation between the frequency of seeing content that makes users angry and their political affiliation. Conservative Republicans are more likely to feel angry (31%) compared to moderate or liberal Republicans (19%). Similarly, liberal Democrats are more likely to feel angry (27%) compared to moderate or conservative Democrats (19%) [2]. \n\nWhen it comes to behaviors, around half of social media users say they typically see an equal mix of people being kind or supportive and people being mean or bullying.

The survey also indicates that a majority of social media users find it acceptable for companies to use video analysis when hiring candidates, with 40% finding it acceptable and 16% viewing it as not fair [5].\n\nThese findings suggest that while social media can be a source of amusement and connection, it also exposes users to a range of negative behaviors and emotions, with varying experiences across different age groups and genders."}

For instance, if a platform notices a higher frequency of deceptive behavior among male users, it might prioritize content that emphasizes transparency and authenticity. On the other hand, if female users frequently encounter bullying or mean behavior, the platform could focus on promoting content that fosters kindness and support.\n\nMoreover, the data suggest that men are more likely to accept certain uses of their personal data, such as showing them ads for products or services, compared to women. For example, 67% of men find it acceptable for social media sites to show them ads for products or services, while only 57% of women share this view [11]. This indicates that social media platforms might benefit from segmenting their audience by gender to refine their advertising strategies.\n\nIn summary, understanding these gender differences in perceptions can help social media platforms better tailor their content and advertisements to meet the diverse needs and preferences of their users. By recognizing that men may be more accepting of certain data uses and women may prefer more supportive and less bullying content, platforms can enhance user satisfaction and engagement."}

However, older users are significantly more wary of using data for political messaging, with only 36% of users aged 65 and older finding it acceptable compared to 66% of users aged 18-49 [4].\n\n![](image3) This graph illustrates these differences clearly, showing that younger users are more likely to find it acceptable for social media sites to recommend events in their area (80%), while older users are less likely to find it acceptable for the same purpose (50%). The difference is even more pronounced for recommending someone they might want to know, where 78% of users aged 18-29 find it acceptable compared to only 36% of users aged 65 and older.\n\nAdditionally, users are generally less comfortable with social media platforms using their data to show them ads for products or services. While 57% of social media users find it acceptable for their data to be used to recommend new friends, only 41% find it acceptable for their data to be used to show them ads for products or services [12]. Furthermore, a substantial majority of users (78%) think it is unacceptable for social media platforms to change the look and feel of their site for some users but not others [3].\n\n![](image2) This table provides a visual representation of these findings.

For showing ads for products or services, the numbers are 41, 41, and 30, respectively.\n\nMoreover, the overall comfort level with social media companies using personal data depends on how the data are used. For example, 75% of social media users would be comfortable sharing their data if it were used to recommend events they might like to attend, but this drops to just 37% if their data are being used to deliver messages from political campaigns [6].\n\n![](image1) This image depicts the mixed feelings people have towards social media interactions, which can be seen as reflective of the varied perceptions of data usage. People are often kind or supportive, but there's also a significant portion who can be mean or bullying, indicating a balance between positive and negative experiences. This duality may influence users' comfort levels with data practices, as they might feel more secure when the data is used for beneficial purposes and less so when it involves political messaging.\n\nIn conclusion, different age groups perceive the acceptability of social media platforms using their data for various purposes quite differently, with younger users generally more accepting and older users more skeptical, especially regarding political messaging. This variance highlights the importance of understanding user demographics when designing data usage policies to ensure they align with users' comfort levels."}

For instance, the automated personal finance score concept stands out as a notable exception, with only around one-third of Americans finding it acceptable and fair to consumers [2, 7]. In contrast, the automated scoring of people up for parole is viewed as more fair by a larger share of the public, with 50% considering it fair compared to 32% for the personal finance score [8].\n\n![Public skepticism about fairness](image3) This figure illustrates that the personal finance score is perceived as less fair by the public, with 33% finding it very or somewhat fair. In comparison, 43% found the automated scoring of people up for parole to be fair, indicating a higher level of acceptance in this context.\n\nMoreover, the public's skepticism about fairness is evident in their responses to the acceptability of these systems. For example, 68% of Americans find the personal finance score algorithm unacceptable, and 67% view the computer-aided video job interview analysis algorithm similarly [2, 7]. This high level of rejection suggests significant public mistrust in these systems.\n\n![Public acceptability of automated systems](image2) This graph clearly shows the public's mixed feelings towards different automated systems. The criminal risk assessment for parole is seen as acceptable by a majority, whereas the personal finance score and automated resume screening are viewed as unacceptable by a large proportion of the public.\n\nThe effectiveness of these systems also varies. While 54% of Americans think the personal finance score program would be effective at identifying good customers, only 32% believe it is fair to consumers [11]. Similarly, 49% think the criminal risk score would be effective at identifying people who are deserving of parole, yet only 50% find it fair [8]. These discrepancies highlight a gap between perceived effectiveness and fairness, which could undermine public trust.\n\nDemographic differences further complicate the picture. For instance, blacks and Hispanics are more likely than whites to find the consumer finance score concept fair to consumers, but express much more concern about a parole scoring algorithm [10]. This indicates that trust in these systems may vary based on racial and ethnic backgrounds, suggesting that the design and implementation of these systems need to consider broader societal impacts.\n\nIn conclusion, the public's perceptions of fairness and effectiveness in automated decision-making systems are deeply divided. The significant differences imply that trust in these systems is contingent upon their perceived fairness, and that addressing public concerns about bias and privacy is crucial for gaining broader acceptance."}

While there is a general sense that presidents should release their tax returns, the level of trust in Trump's statements is markedly lower than in previous presidents, particularly among Democrats. The partisan divide is further emphasized by the sharp contrast between Republican and Democratic views on Trump's economic policies and his ethical standards (images3 and 9).\n\nIn summary, public perceptions of Trump's responsibilities and trustworthiness are generally lower than those of previous presidents, especially among Democrats, and this is closely tied to the strong partisan divide."}

These differences are vividly illustrated in the provided data and images.\n\nIn terms of ethical standards, the public views the Trump administration with considerable skepticism. According to [10], the ethical standards of top Trump administration officials remain at record lows when compared with previous administrations dating back to the 1980s. This is further supported by [3], which highlights that 76% of Republicans and Republican leaners believe the ethical standards of top administration officials are excellent or good, while 90% of Democrats and Democratic leaners believe these standards are not good or poor.\n\nThe partisan divide is evident in perceptions of Trump's long-term success. While [6] shows that 65% of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents believe Trump will be a successful president in the long run, [4] and [12] indicate that 80% of Democrats and Democratic leaners think he will be unsuccessful. This polarization is also reflected in [8], where Republicans' views of Trump's long-term outlook are similar to how they viewed Bush in his third year, while Democrats' views of Bush were not as fully established. The image1 provides a historical comparison, showing how public sentiment towards various presidents has fluctuated over time, with Trump's approval ratings being notably lower than those of his predecessors.\n\nEconomically, the public's views are more nuanced. While [11] indicates that overall, 40% think that Trump's policies have made economic conditions better since taking office, and 28% say they have made conditions worse, the partisan divide is stark. Image4 displays these differences clearly, showing that 79% of Republicans and Republican leaners believe Trump's economic policies have improved conditions, while 46% of Democrats hold the opposite view.

In January 2019, a majority of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents still believed Trump would be successful, but this figure was notably lower than the levels of support seen for Bush and Obama at comparable points in their presidencies. The graph in image3 illustrates that the percentage of people who believe Trump will be unsuccessful has risen sharply since 2017, with 47% of the public now holding this view, compared to the 29% who believe he will be successful [5].\n\nMoreover, the level of confidence in Trump's ability to keep his business interests separate from his presidential decisions has also declined. While 55% of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents expressed high confidence in January 2019, this number has fluctuated and generally decreased since then [8].\n\nThese trends indicate a significant shift in public opinion towards Trump, particularly among Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents, compared to their views of previous presidents. The image2 clearly shows the divergence in opinions between Republicans and Democrats regarding Trump's success, which is much more pronounced than the differences observed during the presidencies of Obama, Bush, and Clinton.\n\nOverall, the data suggest that Trump's presidency has been met with considerably more skepticism and distrust among the public, especially from Democrats, compared to the more positive views of his predecessors [12]."}

While 55% of the public expressed some level of confidence in the fairness of Mueller's investigation, this figure was notably higher among Republicans and Republican-leaning independents (72%) compared to Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents (30%).\n\nIn the context of Trump's handling of the investigation, Democrats showed a high level of distrust. As illustrated in image5, 92% of Democrats expressed a lack of confidence in Trump, with 70% stating they were not at all confident. On the other hand, 65% of Republicans believed Trump would be a successful president in the long run, with 42% expressing very high confidence in his ability to handle the matter appropriately.\n\nThese data points underscore the deep partisan divide not only in perceptions of Trump's potential success but also in confidence in the impartiality of the Mueller investigation. The consistent levels of confidence in Mueller's investigation among Republicans, coupled with the overwhelming skepticism among Democrats, suggest that trust in the investigative process is closely tied to party affiliation.\n\nIn conclusion, Republican respondents generally perceive Trump more positively and have greater confidence in the Mueller investigation, while Democratic respondents tend to view Trump negatively and lack confidence in the probe."}

According to [4], [5], and [6], majorities of Republicans (71%) and Democrats (53%) believe there are plenty of jobs available locally, but there is a noticeable partisan gap. Republicans are more optimistic about job availability, with [6] showing that 71% of Republicans believe there are plenty of jobs, compared to 53% of Democrats. This gap has widened since October 2017, when 58% of Republicans and 47% of Democrats viewed jobs as widely available locally.\n\n![Partisan views of job availability have become more polarized since the fall of 2017](image1)\n\nThe image [image1] illustrates this shift, depicting the increasing disparity between Republican and Democratic views on job availability. Additionally, [11] indicates that positive views of job availability have risen since the last survey in October 2017, with the percentage of people saying there are plenty of jobs increasing from 50% to 60%.\n\nFurthermore, the text [12] highlights that positive views of the economy are particularly strong among Republicans, with 75% rating economic conditions as excellent or good. This sentiment has remained relatively stable over the past year, and it's worth noting that Republican views of the economy have been much more positive since President Trump's election.\n\n![Views of the economy and jobs have been more positive since Trump's election](image2)\n\nThe image [image2] further supports this trend, showing that Republican views of the economy have been consistently higher since 2014, with a peak in 2018.\n\nHowever, despite these positive perceptions, overall public satisfaction with national conditions remains low. As shown in [10], only 26% of Americans are satisfied with the way things are going in the country, a decline from 33% in September. This suggests that while there may be localized optimism about job availability, broader national sentiments remain pessimistic.\n\nIn conclusion, perceptions of job availability are significantly different between political affiliations, with Republicans being more optimistic than Democrats. These perceptions have evolved positively over time, particularly since the Trump administration, yet overall national satisfaction remains low."}

This can be seen in the text quote [9], which states, \"Republicans more likely to say Wall Street helps U.S. economy; Democrats are more divided on impact.\"\n\nIn terms of satisfaction levels regarding national conditions, the data indicates a consistent trend of dissatisfaction over time. Image5 shows that dissatisfaction with the way things are going in the country has been increasing, reaching 70% in recent years. This is a stark contrast to the relatively stable positive economic outlook among Republicans, as noted in text quote [10], where it is mentioned that 75% of Republicans rate economic conditions as excellent or good. However, this positive sentiment among Republicans does not translate into overall satisfaction with national conditions, as illustrated by the decline in the percentage of satisfied Americans from 33% in September to 26% currently, as per text quote [3].\n\n![70% of Americans are dissatisfied with the way things are going in the country today](image5)\n\nThe polarization in opinions on Wall Street and satisfaction with national conditions is further emphasized by the partisan divide.

The graph indicates that dissatisfaction was around 54% in 1990, decreased to about 41% in 2010, and then rose again to 70% by 2019. This trend aligns with the text quote [11], which states that public dissatisfaction with the state of the nation is higher than at any point in the past year, having increased 9 percentage points since September.\n\nThe partisan divide on Wall Street's impact on the economy is evident in images1 and image8. Image1 shows a consistent gap between Republicans and Democrats in their views on Wall Street's influence, with Republicans consistently seeing it as more beneficial. In 2019, 55% of Republicans believed Wall Street helped the economy more than it hurt, compared to 31% who thought otherwise. In contrast, Democrats were more evenly split, with 41% believing it helped and 46% thinking it hurt. This is reflected in quote [6], which notes that more Republicans believe Wall Street helps the economy more than it hurts, while Democrats are more divided.\n\nThe sentiment towards the availability of jobs has also shifted, as seen in image3. The data shows a significant increase in the perception that there are plenty of jobs available, peaking at 60% in 2019, which is a notable change from previous years where fewer people felt job availability was sufficient.\n\nThe polarization in views on economic policies under President Trump is highlighted in quote [8]. There has been a marked increase in the positive view of his economic policies among Republicans, rising from 63% in October 2017 to nearly 80% in 2019. Conversely, Democrats have become more negative, with 46% now disagreeing with his policies, up from 30%.\n\nIn summary, the public's satisfaction levels and political affiliations have evolved significantly from 1990 to 2019, leading to a greater partisan divide on views of Wall Street's impact on the economy. Democrats and Republicans increasingly diverge in their assessments, with Republicans tending to see Wall Street more favorably and Democrats becoming more critical. ![Party division on Wall Street's impact on the economy](image8)"}

Additionally, 40% of respondents mention unclear instructions for preventing the spread as a significant factor.\n\n![An inadequate federal government response is a major reason for the continuation of the outbreak among Democrats, while Republicans are more likely to attribute the spread to the impossibility of controlling the outbreak.](image5)\n\nIn conclusion, Democrats are far more critical of the federal government's response, seeing it as a significant factor in the ongoing outbreak, whereas Republicans are more inclined to believe that the outbreak cannot be controlled effectively. The public largely agrees that insufficient social distancing is a major reason for the outbreak's continuation, followed by a lack of timely testing."}

Similarly, 82% of Democrats think places have been too quick to ease restrictions, whereas just 31% of Republicans agree [8].\n\n![Major reasons for the continuation of the outbreak](image1)\n\nMoreover, Democrats tend to view the increase in confirmed coronavirus cases as primarily due to more new infections rather than increased testing, with 82% holding this belief, compared to 36% of Republicans who think the rise is mainly due to more testing [11]. This aligns with the image showing a larger percentage of Democrats attributing the increase in cases to new infections [image3].\n\nOn the other hand, Republicans are more inclined to believe that the outbreak is continuing because it is not possible to control its spread effectively, with 35% of Republicans agreeing compared to 20% of Democrats [6]. They also tend to blame the Chinese government's initial handling of the outbreak for the global spread of the virus [5].\n\nThe image \"Not enough people social distancing and mask-wearing\" [image2] illustrates the significant partisan divide on the effectiveness of preventive measures. While 75% of Republicans believe there are not enough people social distancing and wearing masks, only 58% of Democrats share this view. Additionally, the image \"Restrictions have been lifted too quickly in some places\" [image6] shows that 53% of Republicans think restrictions have been lifted too quickly, while 23% of Democrats agree.\n\nOverall, Democrats are more concerned about the inadequacies of federal measures and the rapid easing of restrictions, while Republicans are more skeptical about the potential to control the spread and the effectiveness of social distancing and mask-wearing [8]."}

In contrast, Democrats overwhelmingly attribute the rise in cases to more new infections, not just more testing (image10).\n\nMoreover, when it comes to the lifting of restrictions, there's a notable difference in opinion between Republicans and Democrats. As seen in image1, while a majority of Republicans are more concerned that state restrictions have not been lifted quickly enough, Democrats, especially liberal Democrats, are more worried that restrictions have been lifted too quickly (image12). This is further illustrated in image3, where the reasons for lifting restrictions too quickly are more strongly endorsed by Democrats compared to Republicans.\n\nIn summary, the data indicates that Republicans are more likely to see the increase in cases as a result of increased testing, and they are generally more concerned about the pace of lifting restrictions. On the other hand, Democrats, particularly liberals, tend to view the rise in cases as a consequence of new infections and are more critical of the speed at which restrictions have been lifted. ![Democrats and Republicans differ significantly in attributing the rise in coronavirus cases and concerns over the lifting of restrictions](image1)"}

In contrast, a majority of Republicans believe the increase in confirmed cases is due to more testing, with conservative Republicans more inclined to this view than moderates and liberals [9].\n\nThis ideological divide influences opinions on lifting restrictions. Democrats are significantly more concerned that restrictions have been lifted too quickly, with overwhelming majorities of both liberal and conservative Democrats sharing this view [2], [11]. On the other hand, Republicans are more divided but still largely concerned that restrictions have not been lifted quickly enough [1]. Furthermore, the partisan gap is evident in views on the adequacy of the federal government's response and the lifting of restrictions; Democrats see these as major issues, whereas Republicans are less critical [11].\n\nFor instance, the survey data from July 27-Aug. 2, 2020, show that Democrats are more likely to consider the federal government's response inadequate and lifting restrictions too quickly as major reasons for the outbreak's continuation [11]. Meanwhile, Republicans are more focused on insufficient social distancing and mask-wearing as contributing factors [4]. This is illustrated in image4, where Democrats assign higher importance to the federal government's response and the lifting of restrictions, while Republicans prioritize social distancing and testing.\n\nMoreover, the demographic breakdown reveals that Black and Hispanic adults, as well as a majority of white adults, are concerned that restrictions have been lifted too quickly [10]. This aligns with the broader pattern seen in the data, where Democrats and certain racial groups are more concerned about the pace of lifting restrictions, while Republicans are more focused on other aspects of the pandemic response.\n\nIn summary, Democrats and Republicans have distinct views on the causes of increased COVID-19 cases, with Democrats attributing it more to infections and Republicans to testing.

For instance, immigrants, Spanish-dominant Latinos, Catholics, and evangelical Protestants, along with those aged 50 to 64 and those 65 or older, tend to agree with the statement \"Democrats work hard to earn Latinos' votes\" [1]. This suggests that Democrats have a strong base among these groups, possibly due to their historical support for social and economic policies that align with the needs and values of these communities.\n\nOn the other hand, a smaller share of Latinos, including immigrants, Spanish-dominant Latinos, evangelicals, those aged 50 to 64, and those aged 65 or older, say the same about Republicans [4]. This indicates that Republicans face a challenge in earning the votes of these demographic groups, which could be attributed to their more conservative stances on issues such as immigration and social welfare.\n\nThe data also show that there is a notable divide within the Latino population regarding the perceived differences between the Democratic and Republican parties. While a majority of Latinos see the Democratic Party as working hard to earn their votes and caring about them, a smaller portion of Latinos believe the same about the Republican Party [9]. This suggests that the Democratic Party has a more cohesive and supportive base among Latinos, whereas the Republican Party may struggle to maintain a unified stance across different segments of the Latino community.\n\nMoreover, when examining the political leanings of Latinos, it becomes evident that the Republican Party has a stronger presence among conservative and moderate Latinos, particularly those who are Catholic or evangelical Protestant. However, the Democratic Party holds a more significant advantage among liberal Latinos, regardless of their religious affiliation [10].\n\nThe perception of party differences among Latinos varies significantly by generation and age. For example, second-generation and third-generation Latinos, as well as those aged 18-29, tend to see a greater difference between the parties, while older generations and those aged 65 or older perceive less difference [3]. This suggests that younger and more recent immigrant Latinos are more politically engaged and aware of the distinct positions of the two parties.\n\nIn summary, the data indicate that Democrats are more successful in earning the votes of various Latino demographic groups, especially those who are more recently immigrated, speak Spanish, belong to certain religious affiliations, and are younger or middle-aged. This suggests that the political landscape is increasingly polarized, with Democrats having a stronger base among Latinos, particularly those who are more liberal or progressive in their views."}

The majority of Latino registered voters continue to identify with or lean towards the Democratic Party, maintaining a nearly two-to-one margin compared to Republicans (text quote [2]). This stability suggests that despite differences in perceptions, the core support base for each party remains consistent.\n\nThe image1 provides a visual representation of the shift in party identification among Latinos, showing a steady trend since 2019, with no significant changes in the past few years. This aligns with text quote [10], which states that Latino voters' future party affiliation remains uncertain but with soft ties to the political parties, indicating a lack of strong allegiance shifts.\n\nIn conclusion, while there are varying perceptions of the Democratic and Republican parties' efforts to engage with Latino voters, the overall party affiliation trends among Latinos have remained largely unchanged, suggesting that these perceptions may not significantly impact broader political alignment."}

This stability is evident even as the political landscape has become increasingly polarized (see image1).\n\nHowever, despite the lack of perceived differences, there is a clear partisan divide when it comes to support for the parties. A majority of Hispanic adults express positive views of the Democratic Party, with 71% saying it works hard for Latinos' votes, 63% saying it \"really cares about Latinos,\" and 60% saying it represents their interests (see image3). In contrast, only 45% of Latinos say the Republican Party \"works hard to earn the votes of Latinos.\" Furthermore, a larger share of Hispanics believe the Republican Party does not really care about Latinos, with 73% disapproving of Trump's continued role as a national political figure compared to 26% approving (see image8).\n\nThe political affiliation of Hispanic registered voters further solidifies these divides. While 64% of Hispanics identify with or lean towards the Democratic Party, 33% lean towards the Republican Party, indicating a strong preference for the Democratic Party (see image4). Additionally, the survey reveals that a substantial number of Hispanic voters have soft ties to the political parties, as seen in the 2021 Pew Research Center study (see text quote [7]).\n\nThese trends suggest that while there may not be a stark perception of difference between the parties, there is a clear preference for the Democratic Party among Hispanic registered voters, with this preference being consistent over time (see text quote [12]). This alignment is reflected in the positive assessments of the Democratic Party and the negative assessments of the Republican Party, especially regarding their care and efforts to earn Latino votes (see text quote [9] and image3).\n\nIn conclusion, perceptions of party differences among Hispanics are mixed but generally show a preference for the Democratic Party, which is consistent over time and varies significantly by political affiliation."}

In contrast, only 45% of respondents believe the Republican Party \"really cares about Latinos,\" and 36% consider the statement \"works hard to earn Latinos' votes\" to be true. This sentiment is further reflected in image6, where a higher percentage of Latino Democrats and Democratic leaners view the Democratic Party positively compared to Republican leaners.\n\nHowever, the views of Latinos on the differences between the two parties are not as stark as those held by non-Latino Americans. Image1 also shows that a majority of Latinos (45%) perceive a \"great deal of difference\" between the parties, but this is still lower than the overall American population. Additionally, as depicted in image2, while being Hispanic is considered extremely or very important to a large portion of Hispanic registered voters (73%), there is a notable divide on whether Trump should remain a national political figure. This suggests that while Latinos recognize differences, they are not uniformly aligned behind one party due to other factors such as personal politics and individual experiences.\n\nIn terms of party affiliation, the views of Latino voters have remained relatively stable over recent years. As noted in text quote [4], Latino registered voters continue to identify with or lean towards the Democratic Party by a significant margin (64% vs. 33%). However, text quote [8] indicates that only a minority of Latino voters (22% for Democrats and 12% for Republicans) consider there to be a \"great deal of difference\" between the parties, which might suggest some level of ambivalence or uncertainty among Latino voters about their party allegiance.\n\nThis evolving perception of party differences, combined with the high importance placed on economic issues (as highlighted in image5), could potentially influence Latino voters' decisions in the upcoming congressional elections. Text quote [5] points out that while a majority of Latino voters express dissatisfaction with the current state of the country and disapproval of President Biden's performance, they are not deeply engaged in election planning. Nonetheless, as shown in text quote [12], a majority of Latino voters find it important who wins control of Congress, indicating that there is a stake in the outcome despite the lack of deep engagement.\n\nIn conclusion, the views of Latino voters regarding the differences between the Democratic and Republican parties have evolved to recognize significant distinctions, particularly in terms of their perception of the parties' commitment to Latino issues. This could lead to shifts in party affiliation if candidates and parties are able to effectively communicate their positions and resonate with Latino voters' priorities."}

This decline in connection can be seen in the image `![Connection to Origin Country](image3)`, which illustrates the decreasing percentage of individuals feeling very or somewhat connected to their family's country of origin as the generation increases.\n\nIn terms of language dominance, the data from [2] and [6] show that while 61% of foreign-born Hispanics are Spanish dominant, this drops to 6% for the second generation and virtually disappears in the third generation. This trend is further supported by [7], which indicates that only 7% of foreign-born Hispanics predominantly use English, rising to 43% in the third generation.

This indicates a gradual shift towards English dominance as the generations progress.\n\nAdditionally, the percentage of bilingual individuals increases as the generations move forward. While 51% of the second generation is bilingual [2], only 24% of the third generation holds this characteristic [2]. The image `![Language Dominance](image1)` visually represents these statistics, showing a decrease in Spanish dominance and an increase in English dominance from the foreign-born to the third generation.\n\nIn terms of the sense of connection to Hispanic heritage, the Pew Research Center data shows a similar pattern.

This suggests that the USA and China are significant contributors to global motor vehicle usage.\n\nIn terms of CO2 emissions, the image6 illustrates the distribution of CO2 emissions from different sectors across various countries. The size of the bubbles represents the total CO2 emissions from energy use in different sectors. Notably, the USA and China are prominently represented, indicating substantial CO2 emissions from energy use. Specifically, the USA and China have larger bubbles, signifying higher CO2 emissions compared to other countries like South Korea and Mexico.\n\nThe transportation sector is a major contributor to CO2 emissions. According to quote [12], it accounts for 30.0% of CO2 emissions in OECD industrialized economies and about 20.0% worldwide. This underscores the significant role of transportation in these countries' overall emissions.\n\nFurthermore, quote [4] highlights that U.S. passenger vehicle standards are lagging behind other nations, which could imply that the USA may have higher CO2 emissions from transportation compared to more stringent standards in Europe and Japan. On the other hand, South Korea is the only nation expected to have rising GHG emissions from passenger vehicles, which could also contribute to higher CO2 emissions.\n\nGiven the high levels of motor vehicle ownership and CO2 emissions, especially in the USA and China, these countries are likely to have greater environmental impacts, including air pollution and health risks associated with traffic-related pollutants, such as benzene and aromatic compounds (quote [7]).\n\nIn conclusion, the USA and China, with their high motor vehicle ownership and significant CO2 emissions, face considerable environmental challenges, particularly in terms of air quality and public health."}

Inside the household, people predominantly use their mobile phones to listen to the radio, with 88% of respondents stating they do so (image4). However, when stepping outside the household, the distribution changes dramatically. Outside the household, 70% of respondents listen to the radio via mobile phones, while only 10% use computers/laptops (image4). This indicates a strong reliance on mobile devices for accessing radio content both inside and outside the household, but the frequency of use outside the household is notably lower, with only 9% listening to the radio on their office computer/laptop (image4).\n\nRegarding radio listening habits across different demographics, the data highlights several key points. Firstly, 79% of respondents do not have time to listen to the radio (quote [8]), suggesting a busy lifestyle that limits their ability to engage with radio content. Secondly, 9% of respondents do not go to places where the radio plays (quote [9]), indicating a preference for private listening rather than public spaces. Additionally, the majority of respondents are married, with 83% living in rural areas (quotes [3] and [7]). These demographic factors play a role in shaping radio listening habits, with rural dwellers being more likely to listen to the radio, as indicated by the higher percentage of rural respondents who have regular access to it at least once a week (image3).\n\nThe type of programs listened to also varies. News programs are the most popular, followed by religious music and folk music (image6). However, the diversity of programming does not seem to fully capture the interest of all listeners, as 13% find the programs uninteresting (quote [11]).\n\nIn conclusion, the differences in technology usage within and outside the household, particularly the dominance of mobile phones, reflect a trend towards personal and portable media consumption. This aligns with the observed radio listening habits, where mobile phones are the primary device for both in-house and out-of-house listening, though the frequency of out-of-house listening is lower.

This age group is particularly influential in shaping mobile content preferences and driving business opportunities in the country (see image8).\n\nAccording to the data, 60% of Internet users rely on the Internet to find information, and 62% access the Internet through mobile devices, indicating a strong preference for mobile content. The top 10 websites in Indonesia, including Facebook, Google, YouTube, and Detik, highlight the popularity of social media and video content among mobile users (see image1 and image9).\n\nThe preference for mobile content extends to various forms, such as games, music, and apps. In fact, 49% of mobile phone users install games, making them the most downloaded category (see image3). This indicates a strong demand for interactive and engaging mobile content, which presents significant business opportunities for developers and content creators.\n\nMoreover, the growth in mobile advertising is noteworthy. The ads industry in Indonesia saw a 20% YoY growth from \\$5 billion in 2011 to \\$7 billion in 2012, with mobile ads expected to account for 5-10% of the total ads industry by 2015. Intrusive ads, such as interstitial and off-deck ads, are currently the most popular form of mobile ads in Indonesia, although they have sparked controversy (see image4).\n\nGiven the high penetration of mobile devices and the increasing reliance on the Internet for information, businesses targeting the Indonesian market should focus on mobile-first strategies. This includes developing mobile-friendly websites, creating engaging mobile content, and leveraging mobile advertising to reach a large and growing audience. For instance, e-commerce platforms like Tokopedia and Bukalapak have seen significant growth in mobile usage, with Tokopedia recording an 800% growth on their Android app in 2013 (see image8 and quote [8]).\n\nIn conclusion, the demographics of mobile internet users in Indonesia suggest a young, tech-savvy, and increasingly mobile-first population, presenting substantial business opportunities in areas such as mobile content creation, e-commerce, and mobile advertising."}

Over the years, there has been a significant shift in subscriber numbers and data usage patterns among these three operators.\n\nFrom image3, we can see that Telkomsel, XL, and Indosat have seen a steady increase in subscribers and data users from 2010 to 2014. Telkomsel leads in both subscriber count and data users, followed closely by XL and then Indosat. Specifically, in 2010, Telkomsel had approximately 139.3 million subscribers and 13.8 million smartphone users, while XL and Indosat had around 38 million and 13.8 million subscribers respectively, and 43 million and 12.3 million smartphone users. By 2014, Telkomsel's subscriber base had grown to about 139.3 million, with 65 million smartphone users, while XL and Indosat had 85 million and 12.3 million subscribers, and 65 million and 85 million smartphone users respectively.\n\n![Telkomsel, XL, and Indosat subscriber comparison](image3)\n\nMoreover, the trend in data users (image3) shows a marked increase, indicating growing data consumption. Telkomsel has consistently led in this metric, with data users increasing from around 13.8 million in 2010 to 65 million in 2014. XL and Indosat also saw substantial growth, but lagged behind Telkomsel in terms of data users.\n\nIn addition, as shown in image5, the CDMA operators, including Indosat and Smartfren, are being phased out by 2016, with a push towards LTE migration. This transition could further influence subscriber counts and data usage trends, as LTE networks typically offer higher data speeds and better connectivity.\n\nOverall, Telkomsel has maintained a strong position in terms of both subscribers and data users, whereas XL and Indosat have also shown significant growth, though they remain behind Telkomsel in these metrics. This suggests that Telkomsel continues to dominate the market, but the competition from XL and Indosat remains robust.\n\nTelkomsel leads in terms of subscribers and data users compared to XL and Indosat, who have also seen notable growth but remain second and third respectively."}

According to image6, Telkomsel's subscriber count increased from around 139.3 million in 2013 to approximately 143.8 million in 2014. This growth is further illustrated in image7, where the subscriber numbers for Telkomsel in 2013 were around 132 million, increasing to about 138 million in 2014.\n\nRegarding ARPU (Average Revenue Per User), the trends suggest a decline over this period. Image2 shows a clear downward trend in Voice ARPU from 2013 to 2014, and the SMS ARPU also decreased during this time. The data indicates that the decline in ARPU was primarily due to a shift in user behavior towards data-based communication methods such as instant messaging (IM) and VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol).\n\nThe rise of IM services, as mentioned in quote [9], is evident from the statistics showing that 90% of users use IM daily, with 60% using it multiple times per day. Additionally, the popularity of platforms like WhatsApp, BBM, and LINE, as highlighted in quote [10], further underscores the shift away from traditional SMS and voice calls. This shift led to a reduction in ARPU as SMS and voice services became less frequently used.\n\nMoreover, the growth in smartphone usage, as indicated in image6, played a significant role in these changes. The increase in smartphone adoption meant that users were consuming more data, which contributed to a rise in Data ARPU over time. However, in the short term, as seen in image2, there was a decrease in Data ARPU due to the initial phase of the price war initiated by the government, as mentioned in quote [7].\n\nIn summary, the subscriber base for Telkomsel grew from 2013 to 2014, but the ARPU declined due to a shift towards data-based communication and the initial phase of the price war. The continued trend of declining ARPU is expected to stabilize as data consumption increases, leading to the enrollment of users in larger data plans. This transition reflects the broader shift in telecommunications services towards data-centric offerings. ![ARPU Trends and Subscriber Growth](image6)"}

The surge in smartphone adoption is a key driver behind the changes observed in ARPU trends.\n\n![Voice ARPU and SMS ARPU Trends](image1) illustrates the decline in Voice ARPU and SMS ARPU, indicating that as more users shifted to smartphones, traditional voice and SMS services became less frequent. This shift is further supported by [4] and [7], which state that people are using data-based instant messaging and VoIP services instead of SMS and voice calls.\n\nThe changes in ARPU trends can also be linked to the competitive landscape and pricing strategies. As mentioned in [2], tariffs have hit rock bottom, leading to a reduction in price wars. However, the impact of reduced prices on ARPU can be seen in [5], where it is noted that Voice ARPU will continue to flatten in the medium term, while SMS ARPU will decrease. This reflects the ongoing trend of declining ARPU until 2015, driven by the increasing use of data services and the shift towards smartphones.\n\nMoreover, the growth in smartphone users and the decline in traditional services are also evident in the subscriber numbers shown in [10], which indicate a continuous growth in mobile subscribers, particularly in smartphones, from 2006 to 2010 at a rate of 31.9%.\n\nIn conclusion, the increase in smartphone users and the corresponding decline in ARPU for Telkomsel and XL between 2013 and 2014 were influenced by the growing preference for data-based services, reduced prices, and the shift away from traditional voice and SMS services."}

This suggests that rock listeners tend to engage more with past releases rather than current ones.\n\nIn contrast, R&B/hip-hop, as depicted in image5, has a more balanced distribution between album sales (23%) and streams (23%). The image8 also highlights that R&B/hip-hop artists like Meghan Trainor and Ariana Grande have high streaming numbers, particularly on platforms like Spotify, with Meghan Trainor's \"All About That Bass\" and Ariana Grande's \"My Everything\" topping the charts. This indicates that R&B/hip-hop listeners are more inclined towards current and popular tracks.\n\nThe difference in these formats' shares can be attributed to the nature of the genres themselves. Rock often relies on classic hits and live performances, leading to a higher engagement with older material. Meanwhile, R&B/hip-hop, being more contemporary, thrives on newer releases and streaming services.\n\nThis disparity in consumption patterns suggests that while rock maintains strong album sales, its streaming activities are more focused on catalog, whereas R&B/hip-hop excels in both current and catalog streams, indicating a higher level of engagement with modern music.\n\n![R&B/hip-hop excels in both current and catalog streams](image5)\n![Rock is driven by catalog at all formats](image6)"}

This indicates that these genres are heavily influenced by the popularity of individual tracks and the ease of access through streaming services. For example, the image of Top On-Demand Songs YTD Streams (000) highlights that artists like Drake and Taylor Swift, who dominate the charts, have a significant portion of their income from streams, with Drake's \"Hotline Bling\" being the most streamed song of 2015.\n\nThese differences have substantial implications for the music industry. The dominance of streaming in R&B/Hip-Hop and Pop suggests that these genres can thrive without strong album sales, relying instead on single-track purchases and frequent listening.

However, a significant portion of Android devices are still running on older versions like Kit Kat, which makes up 39.2% of the market [4]. This suggests that while newer versions of Android are becoming more popular, a considerable number of users are still on older versions.\n\n![Global Android breakdown](image2)\n\nLooking at the operating system market share, we can observe that Android developers significantly outnumber iOS developers, with a ratio of 4 to 3. This implies that the majority of app developers are focusing their efforts on the Android platform [10]. Furthermore, only a small fraction of developers, less than 2%, identify as Windows Phone developers, indicating a much smaller developer base for this platform.\n\n![Operating System Market Share](image3)\n\nThe pie chart in image3 clearly shows the distribution of app developers across different platforms, with Android taking up the largest segment followed by iOS, and a very small segment for Windows Phone. This aligns with the data from the Google Play Store, where the majority of apps are developed for the Android platform.\n\n![Operating System Distribution](image4)\n\nIn conclusion, the distribution of apps between the Google Play Store and Apple App Store reflects the broader market dynamics of mobile operating systems. While the Google Play Store hosts a larger number of apps and has a higher market share among operating systems, the majority of app developers focus on the Android platform, contributing to its dominance in the market."}

The graph in image1 illustrates the market share percentages of Android, iOS, Windows Phone, and BlackBerry. In 2012, Android had a market share of around 19.8%, while iOS held 23%. By 2015, these numbers had shifted, with Android gaining ground to 80.32% and iOS dropping slightly to 17.80%.\n\nThe number of apps available in the app stores also increased dramatically. According to text quote [1], the Google Play Store saw an increase of over 50% in the number of apps, growing from 1.5 million to over 1.6 million by the end of 2015. In contrast, the App Store had 1.5 million apps, which remained relatively stable during this period.\n\nThe growth in the number of apps can be visualized in image3, which shows the year-over-year increase in the number of apps in the Google Play Store from 2012 to 2015. The figure starts at 0.35 billion in 2012 and reaches 0.37 billion in 2015, indicating a steady but modest growth. This growth is much higher compared to the App Store, as mentioned in text quote [1].\n\n![Market share comparison and app store growth](image1)\n![Yearly increase in Google Play Store apps](image3)\n\nThese figures indicate that while the number of apps in the Google Play Store continued to grow significantly, the market share of Android increased substantially, outpacing iOS, which saw a decline in its market share. This suggests that developers are increasingly targeting the Android platform, which now holds a dominant position in the mobile operating system market."}

Specifically, the number of apps in the Google Play Store increased by over 50% last year, reaching over 1.6 million apps, compared to 1.5 million for Apple's App Store, which is a difference of approximately 17% ([3]). This growth in the number of apps correlates with the projected revenue trend in the mobile app industry, where it is expected that apps to resales would generate 45.37 billion dollars in revenues in 2015, and mobile e-commerce is projected to account for 30 billion U.S. dollars of mobile sales ([12]).\n\n![](image1) This graph illustrates the growth in the number of mobile apps across different operating systems from 2012 to 2015. It shows that Android has a significant lead over iOS, with a much steeper incline, indicating a larger number of apps available on the Google Play Store compared to the App Store.\n\nAdditionally, the adoption rates of new Android operating system versions have been high. For instance, Lollipop, the latest Android version at the time, accounted for 35% of total Android users ([10]). This rapid adoption suggests that the Android ecosystem is expanding, potentially supporting a greater variety of applications and contributing to higher revenues.\n\nHowever, it is also worth noting that despite the significant increase in the number of apps, the market share of iOS declined by 22.3% quarter-over-quarter (QoQ) in 2015/Q2, with 47.5 million shipments ([7]). This indicates that although there are more apps available on the Google Play Store, the iOS platform still holds a strong position in terms of market share and revenue generation.\n\n![](image2) This graph further supports the idea that the number of apps is increasing rapidly, particularly on the Android platform, as the percentage of apps in the Android store continues to grow, while the iOS market share is declining.\n\nIn conclusion, the trends in the number of mobile apps available in different app stores are closely related to the revenue trends in the mobile app industry. The rapid growth in the number of Android apps suggests a growing market potential, but the revenue projections and market share data indicate that the iOS platform remains a significant player in generating app-related revenues."}

First, the user's utterance is encoded into a continuous vector through a bidirectional LSTM, known as the utterance-level LSTM (see text quote [2]). This vector, along with the encoding of the previous system action, serves as input to a dialogue-level LSTM, maintaining a continuous representation of the dialogue state (text quote [3]).\n\nThe dialogue state, represented by \\( s_k \\), is updated after processing each dialogue turn by incorporating the user's utterance encoding and the previous system action encoding (text quote [10]). This dialogue state is crucial for the dialogue state tracker, which updates its estimation of the user’s goal, maintaining a probability distribution \\( P(l_k^m) \\) over candidate values for each goal slot type (text quote [10]).\n\nNext, the dialogue policy, modeled as a deep neural network, selects the next system action based on the current dialogue state \\( s_k \\), the log probabilities of candidate values from the belief tracker \\( v_k \\), and possibly other inputs (text quote [12]). This policy network guides the system to take appropriate actions in response to the user's input.\n\nFinally, the selected system action is used to produce a natural language response via a natural language generator (NLG). The NLG replaces delexicalized tokens in a template with values from either the estimated user goal or KB entities, depending on the emitted system action (text quote [6]).\n\nFor instance, in the given example, the user says \"Movie for the day after tomorrow, please\" (see image6). The system encodes this utterance and uses the dialogue state to determine the next action, which could be to confirm the date (image6). The system then formulates a response like \"Ok, what time do you prefer?\" (image6).\n\nThis process ensures that the system's response is coherent and aligned with the ongoing dialogue, effectively assisting the user in completing their task."}

This underscores the challenge of developing models capable of handling highly complex fact-checking tasks [4][11][12]."}

In Figure 5, hard-to-contrast data outperformed other initial queries in every cycle of active learning on OrganAMNIST, showing a strong positive correlation between the performance of the initial cycle (20 images) and the final cycle (50 images). Similarly, in Figure 14, hard-to-contrast data outperformed all other querying strategies, including random selection, Entropy, Margin, BALD, and Coreset, as shown in image6.

The dataset is designed to reflect real-world scientific fact-checking scenarios, which involve a wide range of reasoning types, including numerical reasoning, closed-domain knowledge, and open-domain knowledge [10]. Moreover, the dataset's complexity is highlighted by the fact that some claims require up to 11 reasoning steps for verification [12].\n\nIn terms of reasoning steps, image6 provides a detailed breakdown of the functions used in the reasoning process. The most common functions include \"simple lookup,\" \"comparison,\" and \"closed-domain knowledge,\" each contributing significantly to the overall reasoning steps. Specifically, \"simple lookup\" accounts for 20.6%, \"comparison\" for 19.5%, and \"closed-domain knowledge\" for 12.1% of the reasoning steps [6].\n\nWhen it comes to the challenges, image8 shows the most common reasons why claims are refuted. The largest proportion, 33.3%, of refuted claims are due to incorrect calculation results. Additionally, 33.3% of the refuted claims contain \"incorrect approximation words,\" and 10.0% are cases where \"the claim is partially right.\" These reasons highlight the importance of accurate numerical reasoning and the need to interpret claims correctly [5].\n\nFurthermore, image7 provides statistical comparisons with other datasets, showing that S CI T AB  has a higher average number of reasoning hops (11) compared to other datasets, indicating its increased complexity [7]. This complexity is also reflected in the human performance analysis, where annotators took around 1.5 to 2 hours to complete the fact-checking tasks [3].\n\nIn conclusion, the most common reasoning steps in the SciTAB dataset involve simple lookups, comparisons, and closed-domain knowledge. The main challenges encountered when verifying claims in this dataset include incorrect calculation results, the use of incorrect approximation words, and claims that are partially right.

However, there are also cases requiring up to 11 reasoning steps, highlighting the presence of more complex scenarios.\n\nThe detailed breakdown of reasoning functions in image7 reveals the types of operations involved. Functions like \"Simple lookup,\" \"Comparison,\" and \"Closed-domain knowledge\" are frequently used, accounting for a significant portion of the reasoning steps. For instance, \"Simple lookup\" and \"Comparison\" together make up 39.1% of the functions, while \"Closed-domain knowledge\" accounts for 5.3%.

These types are summarized in image5, which shows the estimated proportion of each error type.\n\n2. **Distribution of Reasoning Steps**:\n   - The distribution of reasoning steps is depicted in image2, showing percentages across different reasoning steps. While this image doesn't directly correlate with the reasoning types, it highlights the complexity of the reasoning process required for each step.\n\n3. **Common Error Types**:\n   - Image3 provides a detailed breakdown of the common error types in the ScITAB dataset. Specifically, it indicates that:\n     - 33.3% of refuted claims contain \"incorrect approximation words.\"\n     - 10.0% of refuted claims are \"partially right,\" reflecting the nuanced nature of scientific claims.\n     - 8.3% of refuted claims involve \"values in the claim not matching,\" and 6.7% involve \"operation type errors.\"\n\nThese error types are closely related to the reasoning types identified earlier. For instance, grounding errors often arise when the model incorrectly associates data with the respective cells in the table, which aligns with the complexity of the reasoning steps. Ambiguity errors are particularly challenging because they involve interpreting ambiguous expressions, leading to potential misrepresentations in the generated programs. Calculation errors occur due to incorrect floating-point arithmetic, while program errors encompass issues like missing arguments or variables.\n\nThe interplay between these reasoning types and error categories underscores the need for advanced models capable of handling complex numerical reasoning and addressing the inherent ambiguities in scientific claims.\n\n![The unique challenges in reasoning and error types in the ScITAB dataset](image5)"}

Secondly, 33.33% of the refuted claims contain \"incorrect approximation words,\" and 10.0% are \"cases where the claim is partially right\" (quote [10]). Additionally, the lack of matching evidence, the need for open-domain or closed-domain knowledge, and the presence of vague pronouns are also significant factors (quote [10], see image7).\n\nRegarding the performance of different large language models in fact-checking these claims, the results show a notable discrepancy between the 2-class and 3-class settings. In the 3-class setting, which includes the \"Not Enough Information\" (NEI) class, the performance drops significantly (quote [5]). The best performing models, such as FLAN-T5-XL, achieve 38.05% in the 3-class setting, which is still considerably lower than the human performance of 84.73% (quote [2], see image6).\n\nFor the zero-shot setting, where models do not have access to any in-domain data, the performance is generally lower compared to the in-context setting, where the model receives three hold-out examples as demonstrations (quote [12]). The table in image5 provides a detailed comparison of various models' performance in both zero-shot and in-context settings. It highlights that while some models, like FLAN-T5-XL, perform reasonably well in the 2-class setting (52.41%), their performance diminishes in the 3-class setting (38.05%).\n\nIn conclusion, the primary reasons for refuted claims in the SciTab dataset include incorrect calculations, inappropriate approximation words, and insufficient evidence or domain-specific knowledge.

This indicates that the model has the ability to identify absent knowledge to a limited extent, but its ability to correctly cite the available knowledge remains a challenge.\n\nSpecifically, as shown in image1, the recall remains stable around 15, suggesting that the model can recognize the absence of knowledge to some extent, but precision and F1-Score increase, indicating that the model becomes better at locating and citing the available knowledge as more knowledge is removed. This behavior aligns with the \"Conscious Incompetence\" setting, where the model identifies the need for supporting knowledge beyond the provided Knowledge Graph (KG).\n\nMoreover, the results from image2 further corroborate these findings. The table shows that as knowledge is removed, the citation precision and recall decrease, while the overall correctness remains relatively high. For instance, when 1 piece of knowledge is removed, the citation precision drops to 26.1, and recall to 42.5, indicating a significant impact on the model's ability to accurately cite the remaining knowledge.\n\nThese observations imply that while the model demonstrates a capacity to handle the absence of knowledge to some degree, there is still substantial room for improvement. The model's ability to accurately cite the correct knowledge decreases as the coverage of the KG diminishes, highlighting the critical role of retrieval accuracy in generating high-quality attributed texts.\n\nIn summary, the removal of knowledge elements affects precision, recall, and F1-Score in a way that suggests the model can identify the absence of knowledge but struggles with accurately citing the available knowledge, underscoring the necessity of improving retrieval accuracy in handling such scenarios."}

The figure shows that as the number of demonstrations increases, the performance improves, but the benefits plateau after a certain point. Additionally, incorporating logical constraints provides stable improvements, especially with a smaller number of demonstrations. For instance, using 5 demonstrations with logical constraints can outperform using 10 demonstrations without logical constraints.\n\nCompared to post-processing, logical constraints offer more consistent and substantial improvements. Post-processing can completely remove logical inconsistencies but may affect the semantic quality and the size of the candidate set, leading to potential degradation in overall performance. On the other hand, logical constraints can be integrated more effectively, providing a balanced approach to improve both logical consistency and semantic quality.\n\nIn summary, logical constraints are more effective than post-processing in reducing logical inconsistency across different LLM models, particularly when used in conjunction with a smaller number of demonstrations."}

Additionally, Step-Back + RAG fixes \\(21.6\\%\\) of the errors coming from RAG, and the errors introduced to RAG by Step-Back are only \\(6.3\\%\\). On the other hand, for StrategyQA (Figure 11), Step-Back + RAG manages to correct \\(15.4\\%\\) of the wrong predictions, but introduces \\(6.1\\%\\) new errors. Furthermore, Step-Back + RAG fixes \\(12.7\\%\\) of the errors coming from RAG, and the errors introduced to RAG by Step-Back are just \\(4.4\\%\\).\n\nThe differences in the error analysis results between TimeQA and StrategyQA can be attributed to the nature of the datasets and the complexity of the tasks. TimeQA involves a higher number of examples (as seen in Figure 8, with 5226 examples) compared to StrategyQA (with 229 examples). The larger dataset size in TimeQA might contribute to the higher percentage of errors fixed by Step-Back + RAG, indicating that the model has more opportunities to learn and correct mistakes. Conversely, StrategyQA, which is smaller, might have a higher proportion of errors due to reasoning and retrieval issues, making the impact of Step-Back + RAG more significant in correcting these types of errors.\n\nIn summary, the error analysis results for Step-Back + RAG on TimeQA and StrategyQA highlight the importance of dataset size and task complexity in determining the effectiveness of the model. The larger and more diverse TimeQA dataset allows for better generalization and error correction, whereas the smaller StrategyQA dataset requires more targeted interventions to address specific error sources. \n\n![Step-Back + RAG Error Fixing on TimeQA](image10)\n![Step-Back + RAG Error Fixing on StrategyQA](image11)"}

This is a relatively large number compared to other categories, indicating a broad range of landmarks included in the dataset. However, when looking at the pageviews, the category does not necessarily reflect high popularity. According to the dataset's entity statistics [8], the landmark category has a lower percentage of entities (1000, 2000, 3000, etc.) compared to other categories like 'celebrity', suggesting that while there are many landmarks, they may not receive as much attention as celebrities.\n\n### Celebrity Category\nThe celebrity category, on the other hand, contains 732 unique entities, which is also a considerable number. The celebrity category is particularly notable for having the highest average popularity as indicated in Figure 11 [4]. The average pageview per entity in the celebrity category is significantly higher than in the landmark category, reflecting the general higher popularity of celebrities compared to landmarks. This can be seen in the detailed analysis of total pageviews for all categories in Figure 10 [not directly shown here but referenced in text1].\n\n![Celebrities have higher pageviews due to their popularity](image1)\n\n### Conclusion\nIn summary, the 'landmark' category has a larger number of entities but potentially lower pageviews compared to the 'celebrity' category, which has fewer entities but significantly higher pageviews.

For Chinese OntoNotes4.0, BERT+DSC achieves the highest F1 score of 84.67, followed closely by BERT+DL (84.52). For English QuoRef, BERT+DSC also leads with a high F1 score of 68.44, again showing the advantage of DSC over other variants.\n\n**Image2, Image3, Image4**: These tables present the performance of BERT and its variants on various NER datasets. On the CoNLL2003 dataset (Image2), BERT+DSC improves the F1 score by 0.29 compared to BERT-MRC. Similarly, on the MSRA dataset (Image3), BERT+DSC boosts the F1 score by 0.97. For the OntoNotes4.0 dataset (Image4), BERT+DSC achieves a significant improvement of 2.36 in the F1 score. These results suggest that DSC consistently enhances the performance of BERT across different NER tasks.\n\n**Image7**: This table shows the performance on the SST-2 and SST-5 datasets. For SST-2, BERT+DSC performs slightly better than BERT+DL, with an accuracy of 94.84 compared to 94.37. However, for SST-5, the performance difference is minimal, with BERT+DSC achieving 55.19 compared to 54.63 for BERT+DL. This indicates that DSC is not as effective in improving accuracy-oriented tasks like sentiment classification.\n\n**Image8**: This table compares the performance on SQuAD v1.1, SQuAD v2.0, and QuoRef. For SQuAD v1.1, BERT+DSC shows a slight improvement over BERT+DL with an F1 score of 85.34 versus 84.83. For SQuAD v2.0, BERT+DSC achieves an impressive F1 score of 89.51, which is better than BERT+DL (89.44) and BERT+FL (87.65).\n\n**Conclusion**: Across various datasets, particularly in NER tasks, DSC consistently outperforms other loss functions like Focal Loss (FL) and Dice Loss (DL). The improvement in F1 scores is notably higher for more imbalanced datasets, suggesting that DSC is particularly beneficial when dealing with skewed data distributions. However, DSC does not provide significant improvements in accuracy-oriented tasks such as sentiment analysis, indicating that its effectiveness is task-dependent."}

For instance, BERT+DSC achieves the highest F1 scores across various settings, indicating that the dynamic weight adjustment strategy helps improve performance on imbalanced datasets.\n\nIn the context of sentiment analysis, as shown in ![SST-2 SST-5](image6), the use of different objectives impacts the accuracy of sentiment classification. For SST-5, BERT with CE (cross-entropy) achieves 55.57 accuracy, while BERT with DL (Dice loss) and DSC (Dynamic Softmax Cross-Entropy) perform slightly worse (54.63 and 55.19, respectively). This suggests that the proposed DSC loss is less effective for accuracy-oriented tasks compared to the cross-entropy objective.\n\nFor named entity recognition tasks, the impact of different objectives is highlighted in ![Chinese OntoNotes 4.0](image4) and ![English OntoNotes 5.0](image7).

Similarly, on the SQuAD v2.0 and QuoRef datasets, the DSC loss also shows superior performance. This indicates that DSC is particularly effective in handling more imbalanced datasets, as seen in the positive and negative augmentation techniques.\n\nIn contrast, Table 8 highlights the impact of positive and negative augmentation techniques on BERT's performance. The positive augmentation (augmenting with positive examples to create a balanced dataset) leads to better overall performance compared to the original dataset. However, the negative augmentation (creating a more imbalanced dataset) generally results in lower performance due to the decreased number of training examples.\n\nMoreover, the performance of DSC is consistent across different datasets, whereas other losses like Dice Loss (DL) and Cross Entropy (CE) show varying results. This consistency suggests that DSC is a robust choice for various types of datasets.\n\nTo further illustrate these points, consider the graph in image1, which compares the performance of BERT and its variants (with different loss functions) on the MRPC (QQP) dataset. BERT with DSC loss consistently outperforms BERT with other loss functions, demonstrating its effectiveness across different datasets.\n\nAdditionally, the graph in image2 provides a detailed comparison of BERT with different augmentation techniques.

For instance, in the \"en-cs\" pair, COMET-RANK achieves a score of 0.711 compared to BLEU's 0.364, indicating a significant improvement in performance [4].\n\nNext, Figures 2 and 3 further illustrate the comparative performance of these metrics. Figure 2 depicts the architecture of the Translation Ranking model, highlighting the importance of including the source language for better performance [5]. Figure 3, on the other hand, showcases the Kendall’s Tau correlations, which measure the agreement between human judgments and the metric scores.

This suggests that the model heavily relies on both the RNN and language input for accurate goal prediction and action generation.\n\nFurthermore, the inclusion of oracle goals significantly enhances performance, as shown in image8, where the stop distance is drastically reduced to 2.13 in LANI and 2.19 in CHAI, and the task completion rates rise to 94.60% and 41.07% respectively. This highlights the challenge of ambiguous instructions in the CHAI dataset, where even with the best current methods, performance remains poor.\n\nIn summary, the 'Our Approach' method performs well in reducing stop distance and increasing task completion rates in both LANI and CHAI datasets. However, its performance is heavily influenced by the integration of the RNN and language input, and the inherent ambiguities in the CHAI dataset pose significant challenges. The model's success in LANI is more robust, suggesting that the CHAI dataset might require more sophisticated handling of complex and constrained instructions."}

For instance, the image `image8` presents a comparison of the mean goal prediction error based on the presence or absence of various linguistic categories, indicating that categories like temporal coordination (`Temporal coordination`) and co-reference (`Co-reference`) have notable effects on goal prediction. Specifically, the `p-value` for temporal coordination is extremely low (`015`), suggesting a strong statistical relationship between its presence and the accuracy of goal prediction. Similarly, co-reference also shows a significant impact with a `p-value` of `016`.\n\nThe text [3] further elaborates on the relationship between goal prediction and other linguistic elements, stating that goal prediction is related to referring expression interpretation, which involves understanding spatial relations, temporal coordination, and other categories mentioned in the table.\n\nIn terms of comparing our approach to human performance, the images `image2` and `image4` offer valuable insights. `image2` shows a comparison between human performance and the model's performance, where the model's performance is notably lower than that of humans. Specifically, the model achieves a success rate of around `60%` in terms of task completion, whereas humans perform significantly better. `image4` provides a written scenario with corresponding instructions, illustrating the complexity of the task and highlighting the challenges faced by both the model and the human in executing the instructions accurately.\n\nThe text [10] supports this by mentioning that there is still a \"large gap to human-level performance\" across both tasks, indicating that even though our approach outperforms some previous methods (as mentioned in the text [1]), it still lags behind human performance. This is further supported by the experimental results presented in `image6` and `image7`, where the model's performance, especially in terms of task completion (`TC`), is consistently lower than that of humans.\n\nIn conclusion, the presence of certain linguistic categories affects goal prediction error, and while our approach outperforms some previous methods, it still falls short of human performance, particularly in complex tasks involving multiple steps and constraints."}

This can be seen from the comparison tables and figures provided.\n\nFrom `Table 4` and `Figure 1`, the SciIE model achieves significant improvements in entity recognition, relation extraction, and coreference resolution. For instance, in `Table 2`, the SciIE model outperforms all the baselines with relative improvements of \\(1.3\\%\\) and \\(2.4\\%\\) for entity recognition when using and not using ELMo, respectively, and \\(13.1\\%\\) and \\(7.4\\%\\) for relation extraction. Additionally, in `Table 2c`, SciIE shows a \\(4.5\\%\\) relative improvement in coreference resolution over E2E Coref. These results are summarized in the image `image1`, where SciIE (Multi Task) scores higher than Single Task models in all three tasks.\n\nIn relation extraction, the SciIE model's performance is highlighted in `Figure 2`, which compares different models including LSTM+CRF, LSTM+CRF+ELMo, E2E Rel (Pipeline), E2E Rel, and E2E Rel+ELMo. SciIE achieves a Precision of 70.0, Recall of 66.3, and F1 Score of 68.1, outperforming all other models. This superiority is further evident in `Table 4`, where SciIE surpasses the state-of-the-art systems on keyphrase extraction and relation extraction, especially in span identification, as shown in `Figure 3`.\n\nMoreover, the multitask learning approach in SciIE contributes significantly to its effectiveness. The ablation study in `Table 3` and the results on the SciERC development set indicate that sharing span representations and leveraging cross-sentence information enhance performance across all tasks. This is visually represented in `image1`, where the SciIE model performs better than single-task models in all three tasks.\n\nThe importance of coreference links in creating a dense and useful knowledge graph is another key insight from the SciIE model. Human evaluation of the constructed knowledge graph, as mentioned in the text quotes, shows that propagating coreference can significantly improve the quality of the automatic graph, as illustrated in `image7` and `image8`. \n\nIn conclusion, the SciIE model outperforms other models in precision, recall, and F1 score across various NLP tasks due to its unified multi-task setup that effectively improves performance through shared span representations and cross-sentence information."}

As shown in image2, the average GLUE scores for various model sizes and training data tokens range from 81.5 to 81.0, indicating that both models benefit from increasing the amount of training data, with the largest gains seen with more tokens.\n\nBERT models, such as BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) and BERT+STILTs (Phang et al., 2018), consistently outperform CNN models like the CNN base and large configurations. For instance, the CNN base model achieves an average GLUE score of around 81, whereas BERT models achieve scores closer to 86. This suggests that BERT's architecture, which includes bidirectional transformers and a cloze-style word prediction task, is more effective at capturing contextual information across the entire sentence.\n\nMoreover, the detailed results for individual tasks on the GLUE benchmark, as presented in image1, highlight that BERT models generally perform better than CNN models. For example, on the RTE (Recognizing Textual Entailment) task, BERT models like BERT+STILTs and BERT achieve scores of 80.9 and 81.9, respectively, compared to the CNN large model's score of 66.4. This indicates that BERT's ability to capture complex relationships between words and sentences is superior to the CNN's sequential processing.\n\nIn contrast, CNN models, particularly when fine-tuned, show competitive performance on certain tasks. For example, the CNN large model fine-tuned on the GLUE tasks achieves an average GLUE score of 93.2, comparable to BERT's scores. However, this improvement is not uniform across all tasks, as seen in image1, where BERT models outperform CNN models on tasks like MRPC (Microsoft Research Paraphrase Corpus) and QQP (Quora Question Pairs).\n\nFrom these comparisons, we can infer that BERT models have a stronger ability to handle diverse and complex linguistic tasks due to their bidirectional nature and comprehensive context capture. CNN models, on the other hand, are highly effective when fine-tuned and can achieve state-of-the-art performance on specific tasks, suggesting that they are adept at learning task-specific features through sequential processing.\n\nOverall, the performance differences on the GLUE benchmark suggest that BERT models are more versatile and robust across a wide range of natural language understanding tasks, while CNN models excel in fine-tuning for specific applications."}

For instance, in the context of Named Entity Recognition (NER) and constituency parsing, the models are stacked on top of pretrained representations, leading to new state-of-the-art performance levels [4, 11]. This stacking approach, similar to the ELMo method, either combines the pretrained models linearly or fine-tunes them with different learning rates.\n\nThe results from Table 2 illustrate this difference. Without fine-tuning, the CNN base model performs comparably to the BPE model, but with a slight disadvantage in terms of overall performance across tasks [12]. However, when fine-tuning is applied, the CNN model achieves better results, particularly on tasks involving sentence pairs like MRPC and RTE [12].\n\nAdditionally, the experimental analysis in [3] and [10] demonstrates that more training data leads to increased accuracy. For instance, training on up to 18 billion Common Crawl tokens significantly enhances performance, suggesting that more data could further improve model accuracy [3, 10].\n\nMoreover, the comparison in Figures 3 and 7 highlights the importance of multi-sentence training examples, especially for tasks that rely on sentence pairs. The accuracy gap between News Crawl and Common Crawl datasets, which contain individual sentences vs. multi-sentence examples, underscores this point [10].\n\nIn summary, the performance of CNN models is notably enhanced through fine-tuning and stacking with task-specific architectures, leading to better results on various NLP tasks such as NER and constituency parsing.

This is evident in `image1` where the cloze loss outperforms the BiLM loss, and combining the two does not yield significant improvements. This indicates that the context prediction task is more effective when focusing on predicting the center word given all surrounding context.\n\nThe effectiveness of multi-sentence training examples is also highlighted. According to `image3`, models trained on corpora with paragraph structures, such as BooksCorpus and Wikipedia, perform better than those trained on individual sentences. This aligns with the statement in text quote [10], which notes that pretraining on corpora that retain paragraph structure performs better than individual sentences.\n\nFurthermore, the impact of fine-tuning is significant. As shown in `image4` and `image5`, fine-tuning the model after pretraining can lead to substantial improvements in performance metrics like F1 scores.

Text quote [2] states that this is crucial for many tasks, and `image3` supports this claim by showing better performance on various GLUE tasks when trained on data containing multiple sentences.\n\nIn conclusion, the combination of larger pretraining datasets and appropriate modeling approaches, such as using cloze-style objectives and incorporating multi-sentence contexts, significantly enhances the performance on NLP tasks."}

The aligned embeddings (second column) generally show comparable performance to the unaligned ones (first column), indicating that the gains or losses due to alignment are essentially insignificant. This is further supported by the findings in image6, where the increase in BLEU scores (difference between pre-aligned and standard embeddings) is minimal across different training set sizes.\n\nSpecifically, for English (EN) to German (GL), the aligned embeddings show a slight increase in BLEU scores, but for other language pairs such as Portuguese (PT) to English (EN), the improvement is negligible. This suggests that while aligning embeddings might theoretically benefit the model by ensuring a consistent embedding space, the practical impact on BLEU scores is minimal in most cases. ![In a way, this is good news, as it indicates that a priori alignment of embeddings may not be necessary in bilingual scenarios.](image3)\n\nTo further explore this, researchers tested the hypothesis by aligning word embeddings across multiple languages, as shown in image4, where the multi-pre-aligned embeddings were used in a multilingual training scenario. Despite the effort to align embeddings, the results in image8 reveal that the aligned embeddings do not significantly improve the translation quality, as indicated by the similar number of aligned and unaligned word pairs in the reference translations.\n\nIn conclusion, the alignment of word embeddings does not appear to have a substantial positive impact on BLEU scores in different language translation tasks, except in specific scenarios where the embedding spaces need to be made more consistent for better learning.

For instance, the BLEU scores for Russian (RU) and Hebrew (HE) to Portuguese (PT) show substantial gains due to pre-training, as seen in the dataset comparison in image1, where the improvement for HE is notably higher than for FR and IT, which are more closely related to PT. This aligns with the hypothesis that languages with more headroom for improvement benefit more from pre-training ([1], [9]).\n\nThe training set size also plays a crucial role. Image2 illustrates the relationship between pre-training and the baseline BLEU scores, demonstrating that the gains are most significant when the baseline performance is moderate (around 3-4 BLEU scores). This suggests that while pre-training can enhance even low-performing models, it is particularly impactful when there is enough data to capture the basic characteristics of the language, but not so much that the model becomes overly specialized without generalization capabilities ([4]).\n\nMoreover, language similarity significantly influences the effectiveness of pre-training. Image1 provides a clear illustration of this, showing that the gains from pre-training are largest for pairs of languages that are more similar, such as French (FR) and Portuguese (PT), and smaller for pairs that are more distant, like Russian (RU) and Hebrew (HE) to PT. This supports the idea that pre-training can bridge the gap between languages by making the embedding spaces more consistent, thereby improving the alignment of semantically similar words across languages ([3], [11]).\n\nLastly, the alignment of word embeddings further enhances translation accuracy, especially in multilingual systems. Image6 shows that aligning embeddings can lead to slight but noticeable improvements, particularly for languages with less similar training sets, such as Russian (RU) to English (EN). This is consistent with the findings in image11, where aligning embeddings helped increase BLEU scores across all three translation pairs, indicating that shared embeddings facilitate learning across languages ([11]).\n\nIn conclusion, pre-training significantly boosts translation accuracy, with the benefits being more pronounced for dissimilar language pairs and when there is a moderate amount of training data.

In contrast, for Portuguese to English (`PT-EN`), the BLEU score improves from 30.8 to 30.6, which is essentially unchanged. These results suggest that, in many cases, the automatic alignment of word embeddings does not significantly enhance translation performance, as shown in `image4`.\n\nMoreover, `image1` provides a glimpse into the translated sentences where the alignment of word embeddings seems to have a noticeable impact. For instance, in the bilingual scenario (`bi:pre`), the translation of \"chris is a big lawyer\" becomes \"chris is a big lawyer,\" whereas in the multilingual scenario with alignment (`multi:pre-align`), the translation changes to \"chris is a big lawyer, but i didn't know almost anything about patent legislation and absolutely nothing about genetic.\" This difference suggests that the aligned embeddings might better capture the semantic relationships between languages, leading to more accurate translations.\n\nOn the other hand, the F-measure scores for target words based on their frequency in the training corpus, as depicted in `image6`, show that pre-training generally improves translation accuracy across all frequency ranges. However, the improvements are more pronounced for lower-frequency words. This trend is further supported by `image10`, which illustrates that pre-training significantly enhances the accuracy of translating low-frequency words, as indicated by the higher F-measure values for these words.\n\nIn summary, the alignment of word embeddings appears to have a limited positive effect on translation performance across different language pairs, with the most significant improvements occurring in closely related language pairs such as Portuguese to English.

Let's delve into the details using relevant quotes and images.\n\nAccording to [6], SWEM-based models, which consist of parameter-free pooling operations, have been compared against CNN and LSTM models on 17 datasets encompassing various NLP tasks. SWEMs exhibit comparable or even superior performance in the majority of cases considered. This is further supported by [4], which states that SWEMs show strong performances on topic prediction tasks, often outperforming complex CNN and LSTM architectures.\n\nWhen examining specific datasets, SWEM-variants like SWEM-aver, SWEM-max, and SWEM-concat are compared against CNN and LSTM models. For instance, in [10], SWEM shows significantly higher accuracy than CNN for a large range of low subspace dimensions, indicating that SWEM is more parameter-efficient to achieve a decent solution. This is evident in Figure 2 (c) and (d), where SWEM exhibits a lower intrinsic dimension ($d_{\\mathrm{int}}$) compared to CNN on the AG News and Yelp Polarity datasets, respectively. This suggests that SWEM can achieve good performance with fewer parameters, making it more efficient in terms of model complexity.\n\nHowever, SWEM's effectiveness varies depending on the task type. For example, in [5], SWEM yields inferior accuracies on sentiment analysis datasets compared to CNN/LSTM models, particularly for shorter texts. This is attributed to the fact that for shorter sequences, word-order features are more critical, and SWEM's reliance on word embeddings alone might limit its performance.\n\nIn document classification tasks, SWEM-variants generally perform well. For instance, in [7], SWEM-hier obtains an accuracy of 96.2% on the Sogou news corpus, which is comparable to the best accuracies of CNN (95.6%) and LSTM (95.2%). This indicates that hierarchical pooling is more suitable for Chinese text classification, as it takes spatial information into account.\n\nComparative studies also highlight the computational efficiency of SWEMs. As mentioned in [9], SWEM is faster than CNN and LSTM in terms of computation complexity and is highly parallelizable. For example, when $K=d$, SWEM is faster than CNN or LSTM by a factor of $nd$ or $d$, respectively. This makes SWEM a more efficient choice for certain tasks.\n\nIn summary, SWEM models demonstrate competitive performance with CNN and LSTM models across various datasets, especially in terms of parameter efficiency and computational complexity. However, their effectiveness can vary based on the specific task and the length of the input text. SWEMs are particularly advantageous in scenarios where parameter efficiency and computational speed are crucial.\n\n![SWEM outperforms CNN in parameter efficiency](image10)"}

This approach tends to perform well in some scenarios but may not always match the effectiveness of GEM, especially in zero-shot settings.\n\nThe performance difference between GEM and EWC highlights the importance of considering slot similarities in dialogue state tracking.

For instance, the accuracy increases from 53.1% to 63.5% in Spanish, from 37.7% to 48.9% in Russian, and from 38.4% to 42.9% in Ukrainian. This improvement suggests that adding contextually relevant adjectives can mitigate some of the gender bias in translations.\n\nLooking at Table 2, we observe that different MT systems perform differently across languages. For example, Google Translate performs relatively well in Spanish (53.1% accuracy) and Russian (37.7%), but less so in other languages like Ukrainian (38.4%) and German (only 12.5%). Similarly, Microsoft Translator and SYSTRAN show varying degrees of success, with SYSTRAN generally performing better in languages like German and Russian.\n\nIn terms of gender bias, Table 4 provides a clear picture. The table shows that all tested MT systems have higher accuracy when dealing with stereotypical gender roles (e.g., a female nurse) compared to anti-stereotypical roles (e.g., a male receptionist). This is evident from the significant differences in accuracy between the two types of roles. For instance, in Spanish, Google Translate has an accuracy of 53.1% for stereotypical roles and 47.3% for anti-stereotypical roles, indicating a gender bias in its translations.\n\nOverall, the evidence from these tables and images suggests that while some MT systems perform better in certain languages and contexts, all systems exhibit gender bias to varying degrees. The addition of context through stereotypical adjectives can improve translation accuracy, but it is not a universal solution. The performance and bias of MT systems need to be carefully evaluated and monitored across different languages and contexts to ensure more equitable and accurate translations.\n\nGoogle Translate, among the tested systems, demonstrates a notable improvement in gender prediction accuracy when stereotypical gender adjectives are added to the dataset, indicating a potential method to reduce gender bias in translations."}

This trend is also observed in Russian (`RU`) and Ukrainian (`UK`), where the addition of stereotypical adjectives such as \"pretty\" and \"handsome\" significantly reduces bias. \n\nFor example, consider the sentence in Figure 6: \"The doctor asked the nurse to help her in the procedure.\" A biased translation might result in \"El doctor le pidio a la enfermera que le ayudara con el procedimiento,\" where the doctor is incorrectly identified as male due to stereotypical assumptions.

As seen in `image4`, which depicts the overall gender accuracy across different languages, the improvement in accuracy is not consistent.

The RetNRef models, while improving upon Seq2Seq, still fall short of human-like statistics, with RetNRef* having the highest rare word usage at 10.9%. The RetNReft+ model, which boosts the use of retrieval, achieves the closest match to human word statistics, indicating a significant improvement in generating more varied and less frequent words.\n\nIn terms of performance metrics, as shown in image3, the RetrieveNRefine method outperforms both the Seq2Seq and Memory Network models across various dimensions: engagingness, fluency, and consistency. It scores notably higher in engagingness and fluency compared to Seq2Seq and Memory Network, suggesting a more natural and engaging conversation. The RetNReft+ model, which combines retrieval and refinement, further enhances performance, particularly in engagingness and consistency, though it slightly lags behind RetrieveNRefine in some metrics.\n\nComparing human-like conversational abilities, the effectiveness of the RetrieveNRefine and RetNReft+ models is evident from their high win rates in human evaluations (see image6). For instance, RetrieveNRefine** has a win rate of 54.5% against the Memory Network model and 53.7% against the Seq2Seq model. These results indicate that these models are perceived as more human-like and engaging by evaluators. Additionally, the ability of RetrieveNRefine to choose when to use the retrieval utterance and when to generate new content, as illustrated in image2, is crucial. This flexibility allows it to maintain the benefits of retrieval while avoiding its limitations, thereby achieving better human-like conversational abilities.\n\nIn summary, the RetrieveNRefine and RetNReft+ models demonstrate superior word statistics and performance metrics, closely matching human-like conversational abilities, as evidenced by their high win rates in human evaluations."}

According to the data presented in the table shown in image1, a 5% increase or decrease in the mentioned currencies against the Euro and Danish Krone (DKK) would affect the company's operating profit by approximately DKK 1,594 million. This indicates the substantial influence of exchange rate volatility on the company's financial performance.\n\nFurthermore, the company's comprehensive income was also affected by these fluctuations. As depicted in image1, the Other Comprehensive Income (OCI) showed a loss of DKK 1,893 million due to a 5% decrease and a gain of DKK 1,893 million due to a 5% increase in exchange rates. This demonstrates that the company's OCI is significantly impacted by exchange rate movements.\n\nIn terms of cash flow hedges, the company uses forward exchange contracts to mitigate the risk of exchange rate fluctuations. The data in image3 reveals that the company had a total of DKK 63,390 million in derivative financial instruments at year-end 2020, with a significant portion recognized in the income statement (DKK 483 million) and others in other comprehensive income (DKK 1,849 million).\n\nThe image4 provides a clear indication of the financial risks Novo Nordisk faces. Foreign exchange risk is highlighted as the highest among all financial risks, which is consistent with the company's operations in multiple currencies and the significant exposure to exchange rate fluctuations. \n\nThe image7 further illustrates the impact of these exchange rate adjustments on the company's reserves and other comprehensive income.

This decline can be attributed to several factors, including changes in operating income, adjustments to net income, and movements in other comprehensive income.\n\nFrom the image7, we can see that the primary driver of the decrease in comprehensive income from 2019 to 2020 was a reduction in net income, which dropped from $6,025.4 million to $4,730.5 million. Additionally, there was a decrease in other comprehensive income, which moved from a positive $126.8 million in 2019 to a negative $104.1 million in 2020. This change can be further broken down into components such as foreign currency translation adjustments and defined benefit pension plans.\n\n![Comprehensive income comparison](image7)\n\nThe decrease in net income is reflected in the operating income, which saw a 19% decrease in 2020 compared to 2019 [8], and this was partially offset by strategic gains from the sale of McDonald's Japan stock, which added $268 million to the income [1].\n\nIn terms of assets, the company reported a 11% increase in total assets in 2020, mainly due to an increase in cash and equivalents, partly offset by depreciation and the impact of foreign exchange rates [4]. This suggests that while the company maintained a strong financial position, the growth in assets did not translate into the same level of profitability as in previous years.\n\nOverall, the comprehensive income for 2020 was significantly lower than the previous two years, primarily due to reduced net income and changes in other comprehensive income, reflecting the broader economic challenges faced by the company in 2020."}

However, the continued decline in interest income indicates that the broader economic conditions, including the ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, negatively impacted consumer and business spending.\n\n2. **Credit Quality:** Improved credit quality, as evidenced by the lower net write-off rates and 30+ days past due rates, contributed positively to the stability and profitability of the card member receivables.\n\n3. **Operational Efficiency:** The decrease in marketing and business development expenses, along with controlled operating expenses, helped improve overall financial performance despite the challenges posed by the pandemic.\n\nIn conclusion, the net interest income and card member receivables experienced fluctuations due to changes in the interest rate environment, improvements in credit quality, and operational efficiencies."}

For instance, the increase in the state and local taxes component from $168 million in 2018 to $392 million in 2020, and the rise in health insurance tax from $552 million in 2018 to $626 million in 2020, contributed to the overall increase in the provision for income taxes.\n\nRegarding deferred income tax assets and liabilities, as seen in `image8`, they play a crucial role in these trends. The deferred income tax assets increased from $2,868 million in 2019 to $3,391 million in 2020, primarily due to the growth in non-U.S. goodwill and intangible assets, capitalized software, and lease liabilities. Conversely, the deferred income tax liabilities also increased from $5,861 million in 2019 to $6,758 million in 2020, largely because of depreciation and amortization, prepaid expenses, and the lease right-of-use asset.\n\nThe net result of these changes in deferred income tax assets and liabilities is a net deferred income tax liability of $(3,367) million in 2020, compared to $(2,993) million in 2019, indicating a net increase in the company's tax liability.

This significant shift can be attributed to the higher level of earnings and lower net discrete tax benefits in 2020, as mentioned in quotes [3], [4], and [5]. The decrease in net discrete tax benefits, primarily related to the conversion of employee share-based awards, contributed to the higher effective tax rate.\n\nThe changes in the effective tax rate and net discrete tax provisions have implications for the overall compensation expenses. As seen in the text quotes, the compensation and benefits expenses increased by $20854 million in 2020, a 11% rise from the previous year. This increase was driven by various factors, including higher discretionary incentive compensation, formulaic payouts to Wealth Management representatives, and incremental compensation due to the E*TRADE acquisition (quote [1]).\n\nThe image `image5` further illustrates this trend by showing the effective tax rates for the respective years, where 2020's rate is notably higher than 2019's, and the net discrete tax provisions in 2020 are significantly lower compared to 2019.\n\n![The effective tax rate increased from 18.3% to 22.5% in 2020](image5)\n\nIn summary, the increase in the effective tax rate and the decrease in net discrete tax provisions from 2019 to 2020 correlate with the higher compensation and benefits expenses observed in the same period."}

This decline is also reflected in the comprehensive income, which dropped from $6,152.2 million in 2019 to $4,626.4 million in 2020, a reduction of around $1,525.8 million.\n\n![](image1)\n\nSeveral factors contributed to these changes. As indicated in text quote [9], operating income decreased by 19% (20% in constant currencies) in 2020, which is a primary driver of the drop in net income. Additionally, the operating margin also saw a decrease from 42.5% in 2019 to 38.1% in 2020, excluding certain items, it decreased further to 36.7%. These reductions were partially mitigated by strategic gains, such as the $274 million of pre-tax strategic gains related to the sale of McDonald's Japan stock, but overall, the core operations faced challenges.\n\nFurthermore, the text quotes suggest that foreign currency translation had a positive impact on diluted earnings per share in 2020, contributing to the decrease in the negative impact of net income and comprehensive income. However, this positive effect was not enough to offset the overall decline in earnings.\n\n![](image2)\n\nThe image2 provides more insight into the components of other comprehensive income (loss). The foreign currency translation adjustments showed a significant loss of $129.1 million in 2020 compared to a gain of $17.3 million in 2019. This large swing in foreign currency translation adjustments is another factor that contributed to the decrease in comprehensive income. The image also highlights that there were gains and losses in cash flow hedges, which further impacted the comprehensive income.\n\nIn summary, the net income and comprehensive income decreased significantly from 2019 to 2020, largely due to reduced operating income and margins, along with unfavorable foreign currency translation adjustments."}

This indicates an increase of $200 million.\n- **Accumulated Depreciation**: For 2020, the accumulated depreciation on property, plant, and equipment was $816 million, whereas in 2019, it was $483 million. This represents an increase of $333 million.\n\nThe net value of property, plant, and equipment can be calculated as the difference between the gross value and accumulated depreciation. Therefore, for 2020, the net value would be $2.28 billion - $816 million = $1.464 billion, and for 2019, it would be $2.08 billion - $483 million = $1.597 billion.\n\n![The net value of property, plant, and equipment decreased from $1.597 billion in 2019 to $1.464 billion in 2020.](image6)\n\n- **Solar Energy Systems, Net**: According to the information provided, as of December 31, 2020, the net value of solar energy systems was $5,979 million, and for 2019, it was $6,138 million.

For instance, the total net revenue grew from $64,661 million in 2018 to $67,161 million in 2019 and further to $70,372 million in 2020. This growth can be attributed to several factors, including increased sales, improved pricing strategies, and the expansion of the company's international presence.\n\nExamining the beverage and food/snack category distribution (see image6), we see that the percentage of net revenue from beverages has remained relatively stable at around 45% to 55%, while the percentage from food/snacks has also stayed consistent, typically ranging from 45% to 55%. This indicates a balanced distribution of revenue across these two categories, which might contribute to the overall stability in net revenue.\n\nHowever, the operating profit margins show more variability. For example, in 2020, the operating profit for FLNA (Food & Beverage North America) increased by 24%, whereas for PBNA (Pepsi Bottling North America), it only increased by 2%, indicating different levels of profitability within the divisions. The table \"Operating Profit by Division\" [image2] provides specific figures for each division, showing that FLNA had an operating profit of $5,340 million in 2020, compared to $5,258 million in 2019, and $5,008 million in 2018. Similarly, PBNA saw an increase from $2,179 million in 2018 to $2,276 million in 2019 and then to $1,937 million in 2020.\n\nThe image \"Net Revenue Long-Lived Assets\" [image1] provides a breakdown of net revenue by country, illustrating that the United States is the largest contributor to net revenue, followed by Mexico, Russia, Canada, and others. This geographical distribution suggests that the company's strategy to enhance its market presence in key regions could be driving the changes in net revenue and operating profit.\n\nFurthermore, the \"Amortization of Depreciation and Intangible Assets\" [image5] shows that the amortization expenses for PBNA are significantly higher than those for other divisions, which might indicate a higher investment in assets, possibly contributing to increased operating costs but also potentially leading to greater long-term benefits.\n\nIn conclusion, the changes in net revenue and operating profit across divisions from 2018 to 2020 are closely tied to the distribution of beverage and food/snack categories, with a balanced but varied performance across different product lines and geographical regions. The increased focus on major customers, especially Walmart, as highlighted in quote [3], likely plays a crucial role in shaping these trends."}

This was accompanied by an additional financing provided by the Siemens Group, amounting to €850 million, to support the acquisition, which was partially offset by repayments of matured loans totaling €730 million (nominal value: €859 million) and €300 million. This indicates that the key factor driving the increase in cash flows from financing activities was the financing associated with the acquisition of Varian.\n\nRegarding cash flows from investing activities, the figure increased by €12,228 million to €14,140 million. This was primarily due to the payout for the acquisition of Varian, which accounted for a significant portion of the increase.

This suggests that the key drivers of the increase in cash flows from investing activities were the acquisition of Varian and the investments in expanding the company's operational capabilities.\n\nTo summarize, the key factors driving the changes in Siemens Healthineers' cash flows from financing and investing activities between 2020 and 2021 were the financing of the acquisition of Varian and the investments in capacity expansions, particularly for the acquisition itself."}

First, as shown in the income statement, the net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders changed from $(862) million in 2018 to $862 million in 2020, indicating a recovery from a significant loss. This improvement was supported by the substantial rise in operating income, which increased from $1,555 million in 2018 to $2,671 million in 2020. Additionally, the reduction in interest expense, from $4,042 million in 2018 to $2,770 million in 2020, contributed to the improved bottom line. The decrease in other (expense) income, from $(663) million in 2018 to $(748) million in 2020, also played a role in the overall improvement.\n\nIn summary, the comprehensive income attributable to common stockholders increased significantly from 2018 to 2020, driven by improvements in net income, reductions in interest expenses, and better management of other income and expenses."}

This increase in authorized shares reflects the company's strategic expansion and future capital raising potential. Additionally, the company introduced a new series of preferred stock, Series A, through the Certificate of Designations, Preferences and Rights of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock filed on December 18, 2012 [12]. The Series A stock holds a significant voting advantage, with holders entitled to 51% of the total votes, regardless of the number of shares outstanding.\n\nMoreover, the company has established a series of subsidiaries to explore various mineral resources. As of December 2021, the company owned subsidiaries in Brazil and the British Virgin Islands, including BMIX Participagées Ltda., Mineracao Duas Barras Ltda., RST Recursos Minerais Ltda., and Hercules Brasil Ltda. in Brazil, and Jupiter Gold Corporation, Mineracao Jupiter Ltda., and Mineracao Apollo Ltda. in the British Virgin Islands [7]. These subsidiaries are engaged in exploring and developing gold, diamonds, lithium, rare earths, titanium, iron, nickel, and sand, as mentioned in the company's description [9].\n\nFurthermore, the company has entered into several agreements that affect its stock ownership and financial obligations. For instance, on December 18, 2012, the company issued 53,947,368 shares of common stock to Lancaster Brazil Fund in exchange for an addendum to the share exchange agreement, resulting in a loss on the exchange of equity of $76,926 [5] [6]. Another notable transaction is the issuance of 25,000,000 shares of common stock to Ares Resources Corporation in October 2017, which is a related party due to the shared CEO [8].\n\nThe financial statements also reflect these changes. For example, the increase in authorized shares is evident in the balance sheet, where the company reported a total of 1,132,435,380 common shares as of December 31, 2020 [10], up from 1,997,930,297 as of December 31, 2018 [11]. The company also reported a significant increase in convertible notes payable, from $824,614 as of December 31, 2019 to $872,720 as of December 31, 2020, indicating the company's ongoing financing activities [1].\n\nIn conclusion, Brazil Minerals, Inc. has expanded its corporate structure and diversified its stock ownership through strategic acquisitions, the introduction of new stock classes, and the establishment of international subsidiaries. These changes are critical for the company's growth and development in the mineral exploration sector.\n\n![Significant corporate and stock changes](image1)"}

Let's break down the changes in stockholders' equity and noncontrolling interests step-by-step.\n\nIn the consolidated balance sheet for the fiscal years ending August 28, 2022, and August 29, 2021, the total stockholders' equity changed from $18,078 million to $20,647 million. This increase is evident from the image3, which shows the detailed breakdown of stockholders' equity components. The increase in total stockholders' equity can be attributed to several factors, such as net income, stock-based compensation, and the release of vested restricted stock units (RSUs).\n\nThe noncontrolling interests also saw a significant change, decreasing from $1,498 million to $842 million. This reduction can be explained by the fact that Costco repurchased the equity interest of its Taiwan operations from its former joint-venture partner, as mentioned in quote [2]. This transaction reflects in the comprehensive income statement, where the cash dividend and the acquisition of noncontrolling interest are recorded.\n\nLet's examine the comprehensive income statement for more clarity. The image4 provides a consolidated view of the comprehensive income, showing the net income including noncontrolling interests. The net income for the fiscal year ending August 28, 2022, was $11,258 million, compared to $12,277 million for the fiscal year ending August 29, 2021. This decrease in net income is consistent with the decrease in noncontrolling interests, as the net income attributable to Costco would have been higher if the noncontrolling interests were still at their previous levels.\n\nAdditionally, the image7 illustrates the changes in various line items over the period, including the reduction in noncontrolling interests. The decrease in noncontrolling interests from $1,499 million to $1,312 million, along with the reduction in total comprehensive income from $17,907 million to $14,215 million, further confirms the impact of the repurchase of noncontrolling interest.\n\nTo summarize, the changes in Costco's total stockholders' equity and noncontrolling interests from 2021 to 2022 reflect in their comprehensive income statements through the net income and the reduction in noncontrolling interests due to the repurchase of equity interest in the Taiwan operations. The detailed changes can be seen in the provided consolidated balance sheets and comprehensive income statements.\n\n![The changes in total stockholders' equity and noncontrolling interests from 2021 to 2022 reflect in the comprehensive income statements through the net income and the reduction in noncontrolling interests.](image3)"}

As seen in the image5, the basic and diluted net earnings per share also increased from $5.69 to $6.00, reflecting the positive changes in net earnings and the reduction in shares outstanding.\n\nThe stock-based compensation expense, as shown in image1, increased from $558 million in 2020 to $528 million in 2022.

However, to get a clearer picture of the Sky segment's revenue specifically, we need to look at the consolidated financial statements. The image1 shows the revenue, operating costs and expenses, and Adjusted EBITDA for the entire company, but it does not break down the Sky segment's specific figures. Nonetheless, we can infer from the image2 that the Sky segment's revenue grew by 9.1% from 2020 to 2021 [2], indicating a positive trend in the Sky segment's revenue.\n\nTo summarize, the revenue in the NBCUniversal Headquarters segment increased significantly from 2020 to 2021, whereas the Sky segment also showed growth but at a smaller scale compared to the NBCUniversal Headquarters segment.\n\n![Sky segment revenue growth](image2)"}

This increase is primarily due to the rise in forward contracts, which are used to manage risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations. Specifically, the forward contracts for USD, CNH, JPY, and CAD saw a significant increase from DKK 25,394 million to DKK 19,411 million, and from DKK 10,013 million to DKK 10,291 million respectively. Additionally, the fair value of derivative financial instruments recognized in the income statement increased from DKK 188 million in 2019 to DKK 483 million in 2020, indicating a more active use of these instruments to hedge against financial risks.\n\n![Comparison of derivative financial instruments](image6)\n\nOn the other hand, image4 illustrates the cash flow changes, particularly focusing on the change in working capital. The cash flow change in working capital decreased from DKK 3,388 million in 2019 to DKK 4,353 million in 2020. This reduction is mainly attributed to the decrease in trade receivables and other receivables and prepayments, as seen from the figures of DKK 2,126 million and DKK 1,305 million in 2019 and 2020, respectively. This indicates that the company managed its receivables more efficiently in 2020 compared to 2019.\n\n![Changes in working capital](image4)\n\nThese financial elements significantly impact the company's financial statements. The increased use of derivative financial instruments helps in managing foreign exchange risks and volatility, thereby stabilizing the company's financial performance.

Specifically, in **Image5**, we see that total liabilities increased from $422,393 billion in 2020 to $443,854 billion in 2021. This increase is primarily driven by the rise in notes payable and other borrowings, particularly in the \"Insurance and Other\" and \"Railroad, Utilities and Energy\" categories.

This approach is reflected in its dividend policy, where it aims to maintain a consolidated payout ratio of 30%, ensuring the stable and continuous payment of dividends [1]. Toyota's commitment to sustainable growth is evident in its strategies to reduce CO2 emissions and expand its electrified vehicle lineup, as seen in the Toyota Environmental Challenge 2050 initiative [10], which outlines ambitious goals to completely eliminate CO2 emissions throughout the entire vehicle life cycle by 2050.\n\n![Toyota's response to climate scenarios](image4) demonstrates Toyota's commitment to reducing CO2 emissions and expanding its electrified vehicle lineup. This strategy aligns with the below 2°C and 1.5°C scenarios, where increased electrification is expected to mitigate the impacts of climate change. Toyota's measures include maintaining top-level fuel efficiency, increasing investment in batteries, and expanding the electrified vehicle lineup, which could lead to increased sales of electrified vehicles and profits from external sales of electrification systems [10].\n\nFurthermore, Toyota's financial strategy ensures that it can respond appropriately to the risks and opportunities arising from environmental issues [8]. This includes tightening of fuel efficiency and ZEV regulations, expansion of carbon pricing, and increased frequency and severity of natural disasters. Toyota's dividend per share and total amount of payment (see image1) show a consistent trend towards maintaining stable returns for shareholders, even amidst these challenges. For instance, despite fluctuations in operating income, Toyota has maintained a relatively stable dividend payout, indicating its commitment to shareholder returns.\n\nToyota's share price volatility (see image2) indicates a stable performance, with the evaluation result for the current fiscal year showing a 150% attainment of consolidated operating income. This suggests that Toyota's strategies, including its focus on electrification and sustainability, are positively impacting its corporate value and shareholder returns.\n\nIn conclusion, Toyota's financial strategy correlates closely with its response to climate scenarios, particularly in terms of shareholder returns and electrification measures. By focusing on sustainable growth and investing in technologies that reduce CO2 emissions and expand its electrified vehicle lineup, Toyota is positioning itself to meet future regulatory requirements and capitalize on emerging market opportunities, thereby enhancing its financial stability and shareholder value."}

This increase in the total fair value of the plan assets is consistent with the slight improvement in the actual return on plan assets from \\(-\\$42\\) million to \\(-\\$38\\) million. However, the expected return on plan assets improved from \\(-\\$41\\) million to \\(-\\$36\\) million, suggesting that the improvement in the actual return was slightly better than what was anticipated.\n\n![The actual return on plan assets improved from -\\$42 million to -\\$38 million, while the expected return improved from -\\$41 million to -\\$36 million, reflecting a slight increase in the total plan assets from \\$1,061 million to \\$1,097 million.](image3)\n\nThus, the expected return on plan assets and the actual return on plan assets for the U.S. Defined Benefit plans improved slightly from 2019 to 2020, and this improvement is reflected in the increase in the total plan assets."}

Let's break down these changes using the relevant information.\n\nFirstly, examining the inventory, the data from image6 shows that the total inventory increased from 2,320 to 3,042. This increase is primarily due to a rise in finished goods for sale, which rose from 2,142 to 2,784. This suggests that the company might have produced more goods than it sold during the period, leading to higher inventory levels.\n\nSecondly, looking at trade receivables, the data from image8 indicates a slight increase from 715 to 842. Specifically, trade receivables (mainly customer debit/credit card payments pending collection) increased from 255 to 267, while other current receivables increased from 85 to 82. However, the most notable change is in receivables due to sales to franchises, which increased from 177 to 242. This could indicate an expansion in the franchise network or an increase in sales through existing franchises.\n\nTo provide a visual representation of these changes, let's consider the following:\n\n- **Inventory Changes**: \n  - Raw materials and consumables: 146 to 199 (an increase of 53).\n  - Goods in process: 34 to 59 (an increase of 25).\n  - Finished goods for sale: 2,142 to 2,784 (an increase of 642).\n\n- **Trade Receivables Changes**:\n  - Trade receivables: 255 to 267 (an increase of 12).\n  - Receiving due to sales to franchises: 177 to 242 (an increase of 65).\n  - Public entities: 199 to 251 (an increase of 52).\n  - Other current receivables: 85 to 82 (a decrease of 3).\n\nThese figures highlight that while the overall inventory increased, the majority of the growth was in finished goods. In contrast, trade receivables showed a modest increase, particularly driven by receivables due to sales to franchises.\n\nThis trend is consistent with the company's strategy of expanding its product range and increasing sales through various channels, including franchises.\n\nIn conclusion, the inventory increased significantly, particularly in finished goods, while trade receivables showed a moderate increase, mainly due to higher receivables from franchise sales."}

This substantial growth is indicative of expanding customer bases and possibly increased sales efforts.\n\nThe unearned revenue, which represents amounts invoiced in advance of revenue recognition, also saw a notable rise, increasing from $6,995 million to $10,662 million (image5). This increase suggests that the company's strategy of invoicing customers in advance of recognizing revenue has become more effective, or there could be a higher proportion of long-term contracts.\n\n![The total revenue and unearned revenue changes from fiscal 2019 to 2020](image5)\n\nThese changes imply several potential implications. First, the higher unearned revenue indicates that a larger portion of future revenue is locked in through pre-paid subscriptions and services, which can provide more stable cash flow and predictability for the company. Second, the increase in total revenue suggests strong demand for the company's products and services, possibly due to successful marketing campaigns, strategic acquisitions, or broader market penetration. However, it also highlights the importance of managing customer relationships and ensuring timely revenue recognition as the company continues to grow.\n\nAdditionally, the substantial increase in unearned revenue could also indicate that the company is facing challenges in converting this deferred revenue into actual revenue, particularly if there are high attrition rates or if customers face financial difficulties. Therefore, it is crucial for the company to monitor its customer retention rates and manage any potential risks associated with unearned revenue, such as bankruptcies or regulatory changes, as mentioned in the text quotes [1].\n\nIn conclusion, the growth in both total revenue and unearned revenue from fiscal year 2019 to 2020 signals a robust business performance but also underscores the need for careful management of the conversion of unearned revenue into actual revenue."}

This significant improvement can be attributed to various financial adjustments and cash flow activities, as evidenced by the provided quotes.\n\nFrom the operating activities section, we see that cash provided by operating activities increased by $3.4 billion in 2020 to $18.2 billion, primarily driven by an increase in cash provided by receivables of $4.8 billion. Additionally, there was a decrease in payroll tax and value-added tax payments due to tax relief measures, contributing positively to cash flow. However, there were also some decreases, such as an increase in workforce rebalancing payments and performance-related declines within net income (quote [9]).\n\nIn the investing activities section, the decrease in net cash used for acquisitions by $32.3 billion, coupled with a decrease in cash provided by net non-operating finance receivables by $6.2 billion, significantly reduced the cash outflows in 2020 (quotes [7], [11]). These adjustments helped to improve the overall cash position.\n\nOn the financing activities side, there was a net use of cash of $9,721 million in 2020, compared to a net source of cash of $9,042 million in 2019, leading to a decrease of $18,763 million (quote [12]). This change was largely due to higher levels of debt transactions in the previous year, particularly related to the Red Hat acquisition (quote [6]).\n\nThe image `![Cash Flow Summary](image3)` visually represents these changes, showing the net cash provided by operating activities, used in investing activities, and the net use in financing activities, which collectively led to the positive net change in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash in 2020.\n\nIn summary, the positive net change in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash in 2020 was a result of increased cash provided by operating activities, a significant reduction in cash used for acquisitions, and a shift in financing activities, all of which contributed to a healthier cash position compared to 2019."}

Specifically, total revenues decreased by approximately 4% in 2020 compared to 2019, while restaurant margins saw a decrease of 13% (13% in constant currencies) [8]. \n\nThe decline in total revenues was primarily due to the sales declines in the International Operated Markets segment as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. This segment, which includes countries like the U.K., France, Germany, Italy, and Spain, experienced significant revenue drops [3]. The U.S., however, showed a positive performance, which helped to offset some of the losses in other regions [1].\n\nLooking at restaurant margins, the decrease was even more pronounced, reflecting the impact of the pandemic on international markets where many restaurants had to close temporarily or operate with limited capacity [8]. The U.S. segment, despite showing a positive trend, still faced challenges such as higher depreciation costs related to investments in the Experience of the Future (EOTF) program and increased marketing expenses [11].\n\n![](image1) The graph above illustrates the shift in margins between 2019 and 2020, showing a notable decrease in company-operated margins and an increase in franchised margins. The decrease in company-operated margins is attributed to the additional expenses incurred during the pandemic, such as employee-related costs and personal protective equipment [10]. Conversely, franchised margins increased slightly due to higher depreciation costs from EOTF investments and marketing support [11].\n\nIn summary, the total revenues and restaurant margins experienced a decline from 2019 to 2020, with the main contributing factors being the impact of the pandemic on international markets and the need for increased spending on safety measures and marketing efforts."}

Let's delve into the details:\n\n- **Net Income**: The net income for 2015, 2016, and 2017 were $596 million, $2,371 million, and $3,033 million respectively. This shows a substantial increase in profitability, which directly contributes to the growth in stockholders' equity.\n- **Stock-Based Compensation**: This includes excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation and stock-based compensation and issuance of employee benefit plan stock. For 2015, 2016, and 2017, the respective figures were $2,119 million, $2,975 million, and $4,215 million, indicating an increase in the amount of compensation provided through stock options and plans.\n- **Issuance of Common Stock for Acquisition Activity**: This involves the issuance of common stock to acquire other businesses. In 2015 and 2016, no such activity was reported, but in 2017, the company issued common stock worth $4,821 million for acquisitions.\n\nThese factors are illustrated in the balance sheet components shown in `image2` where you can see the increases in retained earnings and the additions from stock-based compensation and issuance of common stock for acquisition activity.\n\n![Total Stockholders' Equity changed annually from 2015 to 2017 due to net income, stock-based compensation, and issuance of common stock for acquisitions.](image2)\n\nThus, the Total Stockholders' Equity increased from $19,285 million in 2015 to $27,709 million in 2016, and then to $33,709 million in 2017, driven by net income growth, stock-based compensation, and strategic acquisitions."}

The revenue from transportation, terminaling, and storage services—third parties increased from $143 million in 2019 to $12,308 million in 2020 [image2]. However, this was offset by decreases in transportation services revenue, allowance oil revenue, and product revenue. The increase in terminaling services revenue and lease revenue contributed positively to the overall revenue [11].\n\nThe decrease in cash from investing activities from $-87 million in 2019 to $-27 million in 2020 indicates a reduction in capital expenditures. Specifically, the capital expenditures decreased from $38 million in 2019 to $27 million in 2020 [2]. This reduction is mainly due to the completion of the Houma tank expansion and directional drill projects for Zydeco, as well as the absence of significant contributions to investments in 2020 [2].\n\n![Operating income increased slightly from 2019 to 2020](image2)\n![Decrease in capital expenditures from 2019 to 2020](image1)\n\nThese changes suggest that the company managed to maintain steady operating performance despite the challenges posed by the ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Let's break down the comparison and the impacts of commodity price changes.\n\nFor **Escondida**, the unit costs decreased by 1 per cent to US\\$1.00 per pound [2], reflecting strong concentrator throughput and lower deferred stripping costs. Despite the impact of unfavourable exchange rate movements, a 4 per cent decline in copper concentrate feed grade, and lower cathode volumes due to a reduced operational workforce, the unit cost reduction was notable. The financial highlights include a 47 per cent increase in revenue to US\\$9,470 million [1], with an underlying EBITDA of US\\$6,483 million, up from US\\$3,535 million in FY2020. This improvement is evident in the unit costs table (image1), where the cost per pound decreased to US\\$1.00 from US\\$1.01 in FY2020. The production of copper is expected to be between 1,590 and 1,760 kt, with Escondida contributing between 1,000 and 1,080 kt [3]. The decline in the copper grade of concentrator feed is anticipated to be approximately 2 per cent.\n\nOn the other hand, **WAIO** (Western Australia Iron Ore) had a production increase of 1 per cent to a record 252 Mt [11], driven by strong operational performance and first ore from South Flank. The unit costs for WAIO increased to US\\$14.82 per tonne in FY2021 from US\\$12.63 in FY2020 [6], indicating a rise in costs. Revenue for WAIO increased by US\\$13.7 billion to US\\$34.5 billion, with an underlying EBITDA of US\\$26.3 billion, up from US\\$14.554 billion [12]. This significant increase in revenue and EBITDA is attributed to higher average realised prices and production, although there were unfavourable foreign exchange impacts and other items such as inflation and one-off items that negatively impacted EBITDA.\n\nCommodity price changes significantly impacted the financial performance of both operations. For **Escondida**, the increase in copper prices positively influenced the revenue and EBITDA, while the decline in concentrate feed grade affected production and costs. The impact of foreign currency exchange rates on the market prices of the minerals produced was also a critical factor [5].\n\nFor **WAIO**, the increase in iron ore prices had a substantial positive impact on revenue and EBITDA. However, the rise in unit costs suggests that the operational costs increased, possibly due to higher material costs and other factors. The adverse impacts of foreign exchange movements were also noted, though the overall financial performance remained robust [12].\n\n![Escondida unit costs](image1)\n![WAIO unit costs](image6)\n\nIn conclusion, while Escondida saw a decrease in unit costs and an increase in revenue and EBITDA, the production was slightly lower due to the decline in concentrate feed grade. Conversely, WAIO experienced steady production growth and a significant increase in revenue and EBITDA, but with a corresponding increase in unit costs. Both operations were positively influenced by rising commodity prices, though foreign exchange rates posed challenges."}

In contrast, in 2021, these figures were $393 million for Level 2 assets and $4,08 million for long-term debt (excluding the current portion).\n\n![2022 financial comparison](image6)\n\nThe increase in long-term debt from $4,08 million in 2021 to $6,590 million in 2022 indicates a significant rise in the company's long-term obligations. This could be attributed to various factors such as business expansion, refinancing existing debts, or taking on new debt to finance operations. The relatively stable level of Level 2 assets suggests that the company might have maintained its investment strategy or adjusted it slightly, but the core value remained relatively unchanged.\n\nThe difference in the figures can also be seen in the breakdown of long-term debt, which includes various interest rates and maturities. For instance, the 2022 data show that the long-term debt with fixed interest rates was $6,590 million, whereas in 2021, it was $7,531 million. This reduction in long-term debt from 2021 to 2022 might reflect strategic decisions to pay off some of the existing debt, potentially due to favorable market conditions or other financial considerations.\n\nOverall, the significant increase in long-term debt and relative stability in Level 2 assets indicate a shift in the company's financial strategy, likely focusing on expanding operations or financing growth through debt, while maintaining its investment portfolio."}

This growth can be attributed to several key factors.\n\nFirstly, the operating income adjusted for non-cash items and other adjustments saw a significant rise, which contributed to the higher free cash flow [3, 10]. Additionally, there was a reduction in payments out of provisions, particularly due to legal matters from the previous year, which also positively impacted the cash flow [3, 5].\n\nMoreover, the net cash flows from operating activities from continuing operations increased from USD 13.6 billion in 2020 to USD 15.1 billion in 2021 [5, 8]. This was driven by higher net income adjusted for non-cash items and other adjustments, such as divestment gains, and lower payments out of provisions, mainly due to legal matters in the prior year [5, 3].\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the increase in free cash flow was partly offset by a USD 650 million upfront payment to in-license tislelizumab from an affiliate of BeiGene, Ltd. [3, 9].\n\n![](image5) As illustrated in the image, the net cash flows from operating activities from continuing operations increased significantly from USD 13.65 billion in 2020 to USD 15.071 billion in 2021, while the net cash flows from investing activities decreased from negative USD 13.055 billion to positive USD 4.208 billion. This suggests that the company shifted focus towards generating more cash from operations rather than investing heavily.\n\nTherefore, the primary contributors to the increase in free cash flow from 2020 to 2021 were the improved operating performance and reduced expenditure on provisions, albeit with some offset due to the upfront licensing payment."}

Let's break down the changes and their implications.\n\nIn fiscal 2019, the foreign income before income taxes was $439 million, while in fiscal 2021, it increased to $1,493 million (see image1). This significant growth indicates a substantial increase in the company's foreign earnings, which might be attributed to various factors such as expanded international operations, favorable market conditions, or strategic decisions like shifting production to lower-tax jurisdictions.\n\nThe foreign tax provision, however, saw a more complex pattern. In fiscal 2019, the foreign tax provision was $526 million, but it decreased to $237 million in fiscal 2021 (see image4). This decrease is partly explained by the implementation of certain restructuring in fiscal 2018 and 2019, as mentioned in text quote [1], where the company shifted its income to the U.S., which is taxed at a lower rate, particularly for FDII (foreign-derived intangible income).\n\n![The increase in foreign income before taxes and the decrease in foreign tax provision illustrate the shift in the company's tax strategy towards leveraging preferential U.S. tax rates for its foreign earnings.](image6)\n\nThis shift towards utilizing the FDII deduction and preferential U.S. tax rates can have significant implications on the company's financial strategy. The company can potentially reduce its overall tax burden, thereby increasing its cash flow and profitability. However, as noted in text quote [1], there is a risk that the FDII deduction could be eliminated or reduced, which would negatively impact the company's effective tax rate and results of operations starting as early as the first quarter of fiscal 2022.\n\nIn summary, the foreign income before income taxes and the foreign tax provision have changed significantly between 2019 and 2021, indicating a strategic shift towards leveraging the FDII deduction and preferential U.S. tax rates. While this shift has led to a reduction in the tax provision, it also introduces risks that could affect the company's financial performance if tax policies change. Thus, the company needs to continuously monitor and adapt its tax strategy to mitigate potential adverse impacts."}

This indicates a slight growth in the loan portfolio, but it is noteworthy that the commercial and consumer segments experienced different dynamics.\n- **Commercial Loans**: Commercial loans increased significantly, from $478,417 million to $513,120 million, representing an increase of $34,703 million, or about 7.3%. This substantial growth is primarily driven by the commercial and industrial loan portfolio, which saw an increase of $166,750 million to $166,750 million, as highlighted in image1.\n- **Consumer Loans**: On the other hand, consumer loans decreased from $409,220 million to $382,274 million, a reduction of $26,946 million, or approximately 6.6%. This decline is mainly attributed to a decrease in the residential mortgage - first lien portfolio, driven by loan paydowns and the transfer of $17.8 billion of first lien mortgage loans to loans held for sale, as noted in image8.\n\n![{Total loans increased, with significant growth in commercial loans and a decline in consumer loans}](image4)\n\n### Deposit Changes\n- **Total Deposits**: Total deposits decreased from $1,404,381 million to $1,482,479 million, indicating a net increase of $78,098 million, or approximately 5.6%. This overall increase is somewhat counterintuitive given the deposit decreases mentioned in image7.\n- **Noninterest-Bearing Demand Deposits**: These grew from $467,068 million to $527,748 million, a rise of $60,680 million, or 13%. This suggests a shift towards more cost-effective funding sources.\n- **Time Deposits**: Time deposits, which are often seen as more stable and potentially more expensive funding sources, decreased from $49,775 million to $29,461 million, a drop of $20,314 million, or 41%. This significant reduction might indicate efforts to reduce the cost of funding and improve liquidity management.\n- **Interest-Bearing Deposits in Non-U.S. Offices**: These also decreased from $35,157 million to $19,783 million, a reduction of $15,374 million, or 44%. This could be part of the strategy to focus on more local and cost-effective funding sources.\n\n![{Deposit composition changed with a shift towards noninterest-bearing demand deposits and a reduction in time deposits and interest-bearing deposits in non-U.S. offices}](image3)\n\n### Inferences About the Financial Entity's Strategy\nBased on these changes, the financial entity appears to be implementing a strategy focused on:\n- **Growing Commercial Lending**: The significant increase in commercial loans, particularly in the commercial and industrial sector, suggests a strategic emphasis on this segment of the market.\n- **Reducing Consumer Lending**: The decline in consumer loans, especially in the residential mortgage segment, indicates a strategic decision to reduce exposure in this area, possibly due to lower interest rate environments and higher risk.\n- **Improving Funding Management**: The shifts in deposit composition, particularly the increase in noninterest-bearing demand deposits and the reduction in more expensive time deposits and interest-bearing deposits in non-U.S. offices, suggest efforts to optimize funding costs and improve liquidity management.\n\nIn conclusion, the financial entity is strategically focusing on growing its commercial lending while reducing consumer lending, and is managing its funding sources to enhance cost efficiency and liquidity."}

This indicates a significant growth in net income over the two-year period. For Mars, the net income also showed a notable increase, rising from $108 in 2018 to $154 in 2020, according to the same image.\n\n![Net income changes for Amberjack and Mars](image1)\n\nSeveral factors could have influenced these changes. Firstly, the increase in revenue and operating income, as seen in the detailed Statements of Income for both companies, might contribute to the growth in net income. Additionally, the decrease in operating expenses relative to revenue could also be a significant factor. The changes in financial metrics such as the balance sheets and property, plant and equipment (image6) might reflect the company's investment decisions and asset management strategies.\n\nThe property, plant and equipment, net, which includes land, building and improvements, pipeline and equipment, and construction in progress, shows a slight increase from $699 million in 2019 to $726 million in 2020.

According to the data in image4, the total Adjusted EBITDA for Comcast Corporation was $34,708 million in 2021, down from $30,826 million in 2020, and $34,258 million in 2019. The change in 2021 compared to 2020 was a modest 10.2%, whereas there was no significant change between 2019 and 2020.\n\n![The changes in Adjusted EBITDA from 2019 to 2021 show a slight increase, but the percentage change was relatively small.](image4)\n\nTo understand the reasons behind these changes, we need to look at the components contributing to the Adjusted EBITDA. Image7 provides a detailed breakdown of the Adjusted EBITDA components, including adjustments, depreciation, amortization, and interest expense. The adjustments include items such as income tax expense, investment and other income (loss), and interest expense. The depreciation and amortization also contribute significantly to the Adjusted EBITDA, with values of $8,628 million, $8,320 million, and $8,663 million in 2021, 2020, and 2019 respectively. Interest expense, another key component, was $4,281 million, $4,588 million, and $4,567 million in 2021, 2020, and 2019 respectively.\n\nIn addition, the operating costs and expenses have shown some variation. For instance, in image5, the operating costs and expenses decreased slightly from 2020 to 2021, but increased from 2019 to 2020. This suggests that while Comcast Corporation managed to reduce its operating costs in 2021, the increase in 2020 could be attributed to higher expenses in that year.\n\nFurthermore, the changes in revenue and operating income also provide insights into the Adjusted EBITDA variations. Image1 indicates that revenue grew by 3.1% from 2020 to 2021, which contributed positively to the Adjusted EBITDA. However, the decrease in operating income from $21,125 million in 2019 to $17,493 million in 2020 and then to $20,817 million in 2021 might indicate some challenges in managing costs effectively.\n\nOverall, the slight increase in Adjusted EBITDA from 2019 to 2021 can be attributed to better revenue growth and cost management strategies, although the changes were not dramatic. The primary reasons for the changes likely include the impact of various operating costs, adjustments, and the overall economic environment, particularly the effects of the pandemic on certain segments like theme parks and sports broadcasting.\n\nComcast Corporation's management uses Adjusted EBITDA as a key performance indicator, which helps them evaluate the operational strength and performance of their businesses and allocate resources accordingly."}

Specifically, the Foreign Exchange segment saw a 26% increase, and the Credit segment experienced a 90% surge in revenue. This performance was achieved despite a 2% decline in overall revenue due to lower real estate and structured finance fee income and losses on legacy corporate restructuring positions (quote [7]).\n\nFor the Corporate Centre, the adjusted revenue saw a decrease of $\\S313$ million or 13%, primarily due to legacy portfolio losses and other negative contributions (image7).

Additionally, the text mentions that dividend income, which is a component of net investment income, increased by only $365 million in 2020 compared to 2019, indicating that the overall decline in net investment income is more pronounced than the increase in dividend income [5].\n\nFrom the asset allocation perspective, we can see that the company holds a substantial amount of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term U.S. Treasury Bills. As depicted in image6, the balance of these assets increased from $67,082 million in 2020 to $90,688 million in 2021. This suggests that the company has maintained a conservative approach to its investments during this period, prioritizing liquidity and safety over yield. The slight decrease in the balance of fixed maturity securities from $20,317 million in 2020 to $16,386 million in 2021 indicates a reduction in long-term bond holdings, possibly due to the low interest rate environment, which reduces the returns on these investments.\n\n![Reflecting the changes in asset allocation](image6)\n\nFurthermore, the decline in net investment income is also evident in the interest and other investment income figures, where there was a decrease of $470 million (44.4%) in 2021 compared to 2020 [12].

Specifically, the revenue from transportation, terminaling, and storage services increased significantly from $143 million in 2018 to $12,308 million in 2020. This substantial rise is attributed to the expansion of services and the inclusion of new assets like the acquisitions of additional interests in Explorer and Colonial in June 2019, as well as the acquisition of an interest in Mattox in April 2020.\n\nAdditionally, the comprehensive income includes adjustments for changes in equity method investments and undistributed earnings.

In 2019, unallocated revenues were primarily driven by licensing revenues from Apple and its contract manufacturers, as well as revenues from Huawei under a settlement agreement. Conversely, in 2021, unallocated revenues were mainly due to the release of a variable constraint against revenues not previously allocated to segment results (text [5]). This shift indicates a more internal reallocation rather than external transactions contributing to unallocated revenues.\n\nSimilarly, unallocated expenses saw significant variations. In 2019, unallocated research and development expenses were notably high at $1,820 million, reflecting substantial investment in R&D activities. By 2021, these expenses dropped significantly to $538 million (text [5]). This reduction suggests either a reallocation of R&D efforts within segments or a decrease in overall R&D spending.\n\nComparing these changes with the net assets acquired during the acquisition of NUVIA in 2021, we find that the net assets acquired, totaling $1,332 million (text [4]), encompassed IPR&D valued at $247 million, goodwill at $885 million, and other assets at $26 million. While the unallocated revenues and expenses show a decline in R&D and a shift in revenue allocation, the net assets acquired from NUVIA indicate a substantial investment in intangible assets and goodwill, reflecting the strategic importance of the acquisition.\n\n![Changes in unallocated revenues and expenses](image1)\nThe chart illustrates the transition in unallocated revenues and expenses from 2019 to 2021, highlighting the significant drop in unallocated R&D expenses and the shift in revenue allocation.\n\n![Net assets acquired from NUVIA](image4)\nThis table details the net assets acquired from NUVIA, including IPR&D, goodwill, and other assets, emphasizing the strategic nature of the acquisition.\n\nIn summary, the changes in unallocated revenues and expenses from 2019 to 2021 reflect a reallocation of resources and a decrease in R&D spending, while the net assets acquired from NUVIA underscore a significant investment in intangible assets and goodwill, indicating the strategic importance of the acquisition."}

This improvement was driven by the robust growth in net cash provided by operating activities, which rose to $10,613 million from $9,649 million in 2019. Despite a substantial rise in capital spending to $4,240 million from $4,232 million, the company managed to achieve a higher free cash flow, indicating efficient utilization of cash from operations. This growth can also be seen in the net income attributable to PepsiCo, which increased to $7,120 million from $7,314 million in 2019, despite a slight decrease in the core net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share to $5.20 from $5.21 in 2019.\n\n![](image6)\n\nMoreover, the contractual commitments of PepsiCo also saw an increase from $40,558 million in 2019 to $66,321 million in 2020. This increase is largely due to the payment of long-term debt obligations, which rose to $40,330 million from $27,137 million, and the one-time mandatory transition tax under the TCJ Act, which increased to $3,239 million from $0 in 2019.

Specifically, the net operating income for 2020 was $15,303 million, which is a decrease of $434 million or 3% from 2019's figure of $15,737 million [7]. This decline in net operating income can be attributed to various factors, including lower revenue and higher expected credit losses and other credit impairment charges (ECL).\n\nIn terms of profit before tax, the GBM division experienced a similar trend. The profit before tax for 2020 was $4,830 million, marking a decrease of $342 million or 7% from 2019's figure of $5,172 million [7]. This reduction is primarily due to the increase in ECL and the decline in revenue, which was partially offset by a decrease in operating expenses [7].\n\nTo further illustrate these changes, let's look at the adjusted revenue figures for GBM. In 2020, the division saw a significant increase in revenue within its Global Markets segment, with a growth rate of 27% [9]. However, this growth was not enough to counterbalance the overall decline in revenue across all segments. The Global Markets segment's revenue increased from $5,728 million in 2019 to $7,290 million in 2020 [2], while the Global Banking segment's revenue decreased from $3,875 million to $3,804 million [2].\n\nThe net operating income and profit before tax for GBM in 2020 are shown in the following images:\n![GBM net operating income and profit before tax decreased by 3% and 7%, respectively, from 2019 to 2020](image2)\n![GBM net operating income and profit before tax in 2020](image5)\n\nOverall, the decline in GBM's net operating income and profit before tax from 2019 to 2020 was driven by lower revenue and higher ECL, despite some positive performance in the Global Markets segment."}

Toyota's commitment to diversity and inclusion is evident in its mission to produce happiness for all and enhance the workplace safety and health for all employees, including those in the automotive and mobility sectors [4].\n\nToyota has specifically focused on nurturing a supportive work environment for women, particularly in Japan. Since 2002, Toyota has initiated programs to support women balancing work and childcare, and from 2012, it has concentrated on creating a work environment that motivates women and supports their participation, especially in leadership roles [5]. Additionally, Toyota emphasizes the importance of empathy and the ability to act, recognizing that employees with these qualities can contribute significantly to the company's success [9].\n\nToyota's approach to promoting gender diversity includes a range of initiatives, such as setting employment and management position targets, conducting unconscious bias awareness training, and implementing mentorship and sponsorship systems. For instance, Toyota held company-wide events during the week of International Women's Day, featuring video messages from top management, workshops, and networking opportunities to promote gender diversity [7].\n\nIn terms of specific regional initiatives, the data presented in [11] shows the varying percentages of women in different managerial and directorial positions across Toyota's global operations. For example, in Toyota Motor Corporation (Japan), only 26.6% of full-time hired employees were women in 2018, compared to 12.7% in managerial positions [11]. To address this, Toyota has introduced various measures such as working couple support, home-working systems, part-time career positions, and support for finding employment for spouses [7]. Additionally, Toyota has set targets for employment and management positions and conducted leadership workshops to ensure the acceptance of women and promote their participation and advancement in the workplace [7].\n\nIn regions like Thailand and Brazil, where the percentage of women in managerial positions is higher, Toyota continues to focus on promoting women's leadership and ensuring that they are placed in the right roles based on their abilities and experiences [11]. For instance, in Thailand, 50% of working directors are women, indicating a strong commitment to gender diversity.\n\nToyota's global initiatives and regional strategies reflect its dedication to creating an inclusive and diverse workplace. By focusing on women's empowerment, Toyota aims to foster a harmonious society and contribute to a global community where everyone can live a rich and dynamic life [7].\n\n![Promoting gender diversity through various initiatives](image1)\n\n![Supporting women in leadership roles](image7)\n\n![Creating a supportive work environment for women](image11)"}

Let's break down the changes and the factors influencing them.\n\nNet income for the company in 2018 was $2,630 million, in 2019 it was $3,720 million, and in 2020 it was $3,580 million. The changes in net income are reflected in the following table:\n\n| Year | Net Income |\n|------|------------|\n| 2018 | $2,630     |\n| 2019 | $3,720     |\n| 2020 | $3,580     |\n\nAs seen in the table, there was a significant increase in net income from 2018 to 2019, followed by a slight decrease in 2020. The significant factors affecting these changes include revenue growth, cost management, and other operational efficiencies.\n\nFor instance, the company's revenue grew from $10,801 million in 2018 to $14,461 million in 2020, as shown in the image2 (Revenue: Total revenue...). This growth in revenue is a key factor contributing to the increase in net income from 2018 to 2019.\n\nHowever, in 2020, the net income decreased slightly, which could be attributed to various factors. One of the significant changes is the allocation of corporate-level items to operating segments. According to text quote [1], \"In Other, we also include items that are not used in evaluating the results of or in allocating resources to our segments. Examples of these items include acquisition charges, restructuring charges, and certain corporate-level items.\" These charges and other corporate-level items might have impacted the net income in 2020.\n\nAnother factor is the stock-based compensation and other non-operating items. For example, the company's stock compensation and other comprehensive income (loss) are detailed in the text quotes [4] and [9]. These items can significantly affect the net income and retained earnings.\n\nThe retained earnings can be calculated by considering the net income and dividends paid. From the text quotes [4], [8], and [9], we can see the dividends declared and paid each year. For instance, in 2018, the dividends declared and paid were $2.63 per share, in 2019 it was $3.72 per share, and in 2020 it was $3.21 per share. These figures indicate a reduction in dividends in 2020, which contributed to the retained earnings increase.\n\nThe changes in retained earnings can be seen in the following table:\n\n| Year | Net Income | Dividends Declared and Paid | Stock Repurchases | Stock Compensation | Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) | Retained Earnings |\n|------|------------|----------------------------|------------------|-------------------|---------------------------------|------------------|\n| 2018 | $2,630     | $2.63 per share             |                  |                   |                                 |                  |\n| 2019 | $3,720     | $3.72 per share             |                  |                   |                                 |                  |\n| 2020 | $3,580     | $3.21 per share             |                  |                   |                                 |                  |\n\nIn 2020, despite the slight decrease in net income, the reduction in dividends and the retention of more earnings due to other factors like stock compensation and other comprehensive income likely contributed to the retained earnings.\n\nFrom the analysis, we can conclude that the changes in the company's net income and retained earnings from 2018 to 2020 were influenced by factors such as revenue growth, cost management, stock-based compensation, and other non-operating items.\n\n![](image1) This image shows the detailed breakdown of the net income, dividends, and other components, illustrating the factors affecting the changes in net income and retained earnings."}

This increase can be attributed to states easing redetermination requirements due to the pandemic and growth in people served via Dual Special Needs Plans. On the other hand, the number of individuals served through Medicaid grew from 5,900 in 2019 to 6,620 in 2020, an increase of 12%, primarily due to states easing redetermination requirements and growth in people served via Dual Special Needs Plans.\n\nIn contrast, the number of individuals served through the commercial and Global businesses saw a decline.

Specifically, a decrease in the discount rate (as seen for Pension Benefits) leads to an increase in the present value of future benefit payments, thereby increasing the benefit obligation and reducing the net amount recognized. Conversely, an increase in the discount rate (as seen for Other Retiree Benefits) decreases the present value of future benefit payments, leading to a decrease in the benefit obligation and potentially increasing the net amount recognized (if the expected return on plan assets remains stable, as in this case).\n\nTo further understand these impacts, we can look at the data in `image6` and `image7`. In `image6`, the decrease in the discount rate from 2021 to 2022 for Pension Benefits resulted in a significant increase in the benefit obligation, from $18,469 to $12,608, indicating a reduction in the funded status. This reduction in funded status, combined with the relatively unchanged expected return on plan assets, likely contributed to the negative net amount recognized of $2,435 in 2022.\n\nIn contrast, for Other Retiree Benefits, the increase in the discount rate from 5.0% to 3.2% led to a decrease in the benefit obligation, from $4,206 to $3,070, improving the funded status. However, the net amount recognized for Other Retiree Benefits was still negative at $2,238 in 2022, suggesting that the increase in the discount rate did not fully offset the impact of other factors, such as the amortization of net actuarial losses and the classification of amounts recognized.\n\nIn summary, the changes in the discount rate and expected return on plan assets from 2021 to 2022 had varying impacts on the net amount recognized for Pension Benefits and Other Retiree Benefits, with the former experiencing a more pronounced effect due to the significant change in the discount rate."}

This decrease was primarily due to the reduction in equity for losses, which amounted to $22.4 billion, and the reduction for distributions to ExxonMobil shareholders, totaling $14.9 billion, both in the form of dividends.\n\nTo break down the changes further, let's look at the detailed equity components. The decrease in equity for losses can be seen in the equity statement where the balance sheet for 2019 and 2020 shows a significant reduction in the \"ExxonMobil share of equity\" from $191.7 billion to $157.2 billion. Additionally, the dividends paid to shareholders also contributed significantly to the reduction in equity, as indicated in the cash flow statement (image4), where cash dividends to ExxonMobil shareholders were $14,865 million in 2020.\n\n![](image7)\n\nIn terms of the overall financial health and performance, the decrease in equity is also reflected in the net income (loss) for the year, which showed a loss of $22,440 million in 2020 compared to a profit of $20,840 million in 2019. This decline in profitability, combined with the dividend payouts, led to the reduction in total equity.\n\nTherefore, the total equity of ExxonMobil decreased by $34.5 billion from 2019 to 2020, mainly due to the loss incurred during the year and the distribution of dividends to shareholders."}

Let's delve into the details, supported by the provided quotes and images.\n\n#### Share Capital and Additional Paid-In Capital\nThe share capital and additional paid-in capital saw minimal changes. In 2020, the share capital was RMB34,425 million, and it remained unchanged at RMB35,044 million in 2021 (see `image1` and `image2`). This stability suggests that there were no significant new share issuances or repurchases during these years.\n\n#### Treasury Shares\nThere was a reduction in the treasury shares from RMB4,155 million in 2020 to RMB3,029 million in 2021 (`image1` and `image2`). This indicates that the company repurchased fewer shares in 2021 compared to 2020, reflecting a shift in the company's capital management strategy.\n\n#### Retained Earnings\nThe retained earnings experienced a notable decline, decreasing from RMB7,007 million in 2020 to RMB6,591 million in 2021 (`image2` and `image5`). This reduction can be attributed to the net losses or reduced profits, possibly due to increased investments or expenses.\n\n#### Non-Controlling Interests\nNon-controlling interests showed a slight increase from RMB8,079 million in 2020 to RMB8,100 million in 2021 (`image2` and `image5`). This could indicate that the company either acquired more minority stakes or the existing ones grew in value.\n\n#### Total Equity\nThe total equity experienced a slight decrease from RMB52,731 million in 2020 to RMB51,055 million in 2021 (`image2` and `image5`). This decline is primarily due to the reduction in retained earnings, partially offset by the increase in non-controlling interests.\n\n#### Major Transactions\n1. **Acquisitions and Investments**: In January 2021, Tencent Music Entertainment Group acquired 100% equity interest in Shenzhen Lanren, a well-established audio platform in China, for a total consideration of RMB2.7 billion (`quote [6]`).\n   \n2. **Additional Investments**: Tencent Music Entertainment Group made additional investments in certain equity interests in a consortium, Concerto Partners LLC, which is led by Tencent to acquire an additional 10% equity stake in Universal Music Group (`quote [5]`).\n\n3. **Service Charges**: The group received RMB17,743 million from the variable interest entities (VIEs) as service charges in 2021 (`quote [4]`).\n\n4. **Dividend Payments**: Dividends to non-controlling interests decreased from RMB19 million in 2020 to RMB186 million in 2021 (`quote [10]`).\n\n5. **Repurchase of Shares**: There was a significant decrease in the repurchase of shares from RMB1,286 million in 2020 to RMB21 million in 2021 (`quote [10]`).\n\nThese transactions and adjustments collectively contributed to the changes in equity components over the two-year period.\n\n![Summary of equity changes](image5)"}

The declines in customer relationships and average revenue per customer relationship in Italy primarily resulted from reduced broadcast rights for Serie A, which we had held through the end of the 2020-21 season. Beginning with the 2021-22 season in the third quarter of 2021 and through the 2023-24 season, we have nonexclusive broadcast rights to fewer matches, which has resulted and we expect will continue to result in declines in revenue and customer relationships in Italy.\"\n\n**Image Quotes:**\n- **image5**: This image shows a slight decrease in total customer relationships from 2020 to 2021, indicating a decline in customer bases.\n\n### Impact on Financial Performance\n\n**Text Quotes:**\n- **[10]**: \"Total NBCUniversal revenue increased 26.1% to $34.3 billion and total NBCUniversal Adjusted EBITDA increased 6.0% to $5.7 billion.\" This indicates a strong growth in revenue but a more modest improvement in Adjusted EBITDA, suggesting that while revenue grew significantly, the profit margins did not keep pace.\n\n**Image Quotes:**\n- **image2**: The image confirms the revenue growth but highlights that the Adjusted EBITDA did not increase proportionally, indicating that costs might have risen faster than revenue.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nFrom 2019 to 2021, NBCUniversal saw a substantial increase in revenue, primarily driven by factors such as rate increases, increased sales of wireless handsets, and the postponement of sporting events due to COVID-19. However, the customer relationships showed a slight decline, particularly in Italy, which was partially offset by growth in other regions like the United Kingdom and Germany. Despite the revenue growth, the financial performance improved only moderately, as indicated by the modest increase in Adjusted EBITDA. This suggests that while there was significant growth in revenue, the company faced challenges in maintaining profit margins and customer loyalty, especially in markets like Italy where broadcast rights have been reduced. \n\n![The revenue and customer relationship trends show a significant growth in revenue but a moderate increase in Adjusted EBITDA, indicating that while revenue increased, the profit margins did not improve as much.](image2)"}

The ETR for global operations increased from 29.6% in 2019 to 46.2% in 2020, while the ETR for Australian operations also saw an increase from 27.8% to 31.4%. This suggests a higher tax burden on the company's global and Australian operations. Additionally, the total income tax expense increased from $5,579,000 in 2019 to $9,641,000 in 2020, indicating a significant rise in the company's tax obligations. This can be seen in the consolidated income tax expense details shown in image2, where the current tax expense rose from $7,367,000 in 2019 to $9,248,000 in 2020.\n\nSecondly, in terms of impairment charges, there was a notable change in 2020. Lovisa Holdings recognized impairment charges of $6,117,000, primarily due to the exit from the Spanish market and store impairments, as illustrated in image2. In contrast, there were no impairment charges recognized in 2019. This represents a $6,117,000 increase in impairment charges, which significantly impacted the company's financial health and profitability.\n\nThe increase in tax expenses and the significant impairment charges highlight the financial challenges faced by Lovisa Holdings in 2020, particularly due to strategic decisions such as exiting the Spanish market and the resulting write-downs of assets.\n\n![Summary of tax expenses and impairment charges](image2)"}

However, after accounting for taxes and an exceptional expense related to the recovery of outstanding amounts from Assam-based units, the net profit declined to Rs. 37.91 crore from Rs. 47.80 crore [1]. This indicates a mixed financial performance, with a strong revenue growth but challenges in maintaining profitability.\n\nThe export potential for tobacco is immense, with the potential to earn seven times more with just a 5% share of the global tobacco trade, as illustrated in the graph showing current export earnings of Rs. 930 crore versus the potential of Rs. 7000 crore [3]. This highlights the untapped market for the company to expand its export activities, which could contribute significantly to the overall financial health of the company.\n\nThe disparity in taxation between cigarettes and other tobacco products, as depicted in image1, where cigarettes face a tax burden 21 times greater than bidis and 17 times greater than chewing tobacco, suggests that the company might benefit from diversifying its product range to include less heavily taxed products like bidis and chewing tobacco. This could potentially mitigate the impact of high cigarette taxes on the company's profitability.\n\nMoreover, the company's strategy to focus on developing innovative products and improving the equity of its existing brands, as well as launching new brands, has led to a significant increase in market share to over 11%, up from 10% in 2001-2002 [10]. This indicates a successful approach to competing in a highly competitive market.\n\nGiven the potential for increased export earnings and the challenges posed by high taxation, the company can leverage its strong performance in the domestic market to explore opportunities in international markets. The graph in image3 clearly demonstrates the vast untapped potential in increasing export earnings, which could serve as a strategic avenue for future growth.\n\nIn conclusion, the financial results for 2002-2003, combined with the potential for tobacco export earnings, suggest that the company should consider diversifying its product portfolio to include less heavily taxed tobacco products and expanding its export activities to capitalize on the significant growth opportunities in the global market."}

However, the substantial decrease in 2019 to 2020 was primarily attributed to a large negative net change in interest income of $19,747 million, coupled with a smaller but still notable increase in interest expense of $714 million. This indicates that while the company managed to maintain a relatively stable interest rate environment in 2018 to 2019, it faced challenges in 2019 to 2020, likely due to broader macroeconomic conditions and regulatory pressures.\n\n**Net Interest Expense:**\n\n- **From 2018 to 2019**: Net interest expense increased by $3,738 million.\n- **From 2019 to 2020**: Net interest expense decreased by $14,120 million.\n\nThe increase in 2018 to 2019 was driven by a rise in interest expense across most categories, such as U.S. interest-bearing deposits, non-U.S. interest-bearing deposits, and other interest-bearing liabilities. In contrast, the sharp decrease in 2019 to 2020 was largely due to a significant reduction in interest expense on U.S. interest-bearing deposits, which fell by $2,564 million, and a similar reduction on non-U.S. interest-bearing deposits, which dropped by $129 million. This suggests that Bank of America was able to manage its cost of funds more effectively in 2019 to 2020, possibly due to improved deposit management strategies or favorable market conditions.\n\n![Changes in Net Interest Income and Expense](image2)\n\nThese changes in net interest income and expense reflect the intricate nature of Bank of America's operations, where different segments and product lines interact in complex ways.

The reduction in net investment income could impact the company's ability to generate returns on its investments, potentially affecting its profitability and financial health. The shift towards a higher proportion of equity securities, while increasing risk due to their higher volatility, also provides the potential for higher returns. However, the decline in fixed maturity securities suggests a strategy to reduce exposure to interest rate risk, given the declining interest rates mentioned in text quote [4].\n\nIn conclusion, the net investment income and asset composition changes from 2020 to 2021 reflect a strategic shift towards higher-risk, potentially higher-return assets, which could enhance future earnings but also increases vulnerability to market fluctuations."}

In 2019, the U.S. downstream sector reported earnings of $1,559 million, which decreased to a loss of $571 million in 2020 due to various challenges including the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, by 2021, the earnings rebounded to $2,400 million ([4], [6]). The primary drivers for this recovery were higher margins on refined product sales, higher earnings from 50% owned CPChem, and increased sales volumes, although these were partially offset by higher operating expenses ([4], [6]).\n\nFor the international downstream sector, the earnings also showed a decline from 2019 to 2021. In 2019, the sector earned $922 million, which dropped to $618 million in 2020. By 2021, the earnings further decreased to $525 million ([11]). The decrease in earnings in 2021 was mainly attributed to lower margins on refined product sales and higher operating expenses, partially offset by favorable swings in foreign currency effects ([11]).\n\n![](image11) illustrates the dramatic increase in sales and other operating revenues from $139,865 million in 2019 to $155,606 million in 2021, reflecting the overall growth in the refining sector.

According to Image7 and Image11, the balance of uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2019 was $303 million, whereas it reduced to $89 million in 2020. This reduction includes a $249 million tax benefit for the effective settlement of a depreciation-related uncertain tax position, as mentioned in quote [11]. Additionally, the accrued interest of $46 million related to this uncertain tax position was reversed and included in Other Income and Expense (OI&E), further contributing to the reduction in the balance of uncertain tax positions.\n\nSecondly, regarding the **fair value assets and liabilities**, we see a notable change in the composition of the company's financial assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2020 compared to 2019. Image3 and Image5 provide insights into the fair value assets and liabilities. In 2019, the company held a higher amount of money market funds ($1,213 million) and corporate obligations ($1,390 million) at fair value, while in 2020, the amount of money market funds decreased to $886 million, and corporate obligations increased to $256 million. The total fair value assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2019 were $5,213 million, whereas in 2020, they were $5,961 million. This increase can be attributed to the rise in the value of U.S. government agency and Treasury securities from $2,338 million in 2019 to $4,394 million in 2020, as shown in Image3.\n\nFurthermore, the **net deferred tax asset** saw a decrease from $253 million in 2019 (Image4) to $119 million in 2020 (Image8). This reduction is partly due to the decrease in deferred tax assets, which went from $662 million in 2019 to $645 million in 2020 (Image8), and the valuation allowance increasing from $180 million to $179 million (Image8).\n\n![Uncertain tax positions balance decreased from 2019 to 2020](image11)\n![Fair value assets and liabilities changed significantly from 2019 to 2020](image5)\n\nIn summary, the balance of uncertain tax positions decreased from $303 million in 2019 to $89 million in 2020, primarily due to the settlement of a depreciation-related uncertain tax position and the reversal of accrued interest. Meanwhile, the fair value assets and liabilities increased from $5,213 million in 2019 to $5,961 million in 2020, reflecting changes in the composition of financial assets and liabilities."}

As stated in [2], \"The exact impacts remain difficult to predict and will depend on the evolution and duration of outbreaks, as well as the policy actions and restrictions taken to mitigate the impacts.\" Supply chain disruptions can lead to several potential impacts, including the loss of consumer trust, inability to ensure the supply of key products, and higher input prices and production costs. The Group has implemented various mitigations to address these issues, including business continuity and disaster recovery plans for key sites, active price risk management on key commodities, and long-term initiatives to promote safe and healthy behaviors ([image3]).\n\nFor instance, the Group's supply chain disruption mitigation strategies are highlighted in the principal risk section of the report (image6), which mentions the need for business continuity and disaster recovery plans for key sites. This is crucial for ensuring that Nestlé can maintain its operations even during unexpected disruptions. Additionally, the Group has developed a framework for ethical use of technology to enhance its resilience and adaptability to such challenges.\n\nNestlé's factory distribution across different regions plays a significant role in managing these disruptions. The Americas (AMS) region, as shown in image1, includes countries like the United States, Canada, and Brazil. The distribution of factories across these regions helps in balancing efficiency and resiliency, allowing the company to respond quickly to changes in demand and optimize transport and production schedules. The Group has also increased the scope of its Transport Hub technologies to cover 50% of its global logistics network and extended the scope of AI-powered network optimization tools to evaluate different product sourcing and delivery scenarios, as mentioned in [10].\n\nFurthermore, the geographical spread of Nestlé's operations, as seen in image2, which shows the distribution of sales across different countries, indicates that the company has a diversified portfolio. This diversification helps in reducing the impact of localized disruptions. For example, if a supply chain issue arises in one region, Nestlé can draw on resources from another region to mitigate the effects. The report also highlights that the Group has a wide geographical and product category spread, which acts as a natural hedge against such disruptions.\n\nIn summary, supply chain disruptions pose significant risks to Nestlé, but the company has implemented various mitigations to address these challenges. The geographical distribution of its factories and the diverse nature of its operations help in maintaining stability and resilience. By continuously monitoring and responding to these areas of increased risk, Nestlé aims to minimize the impact of disruptions on its operations and maintain the trust of its consumers."}

As shown, the total net carrying value of intangible assets decreased from $15,421 million in 2019 to $15,344 million in 2020, a reduction of $77 million. This decrease is primarily due to the amortization of customer-related intangible assets, which reduced by $156 million, and trademarks and technology, which reduced by $141 million. However, there was also a slight increase in the net carrying value of other intangible assets, adding $29 million.\n\n**Medical Costs Payable:**\nThe data in image3 details the changes in medical costs payable over the years. The medical costs payable, end of period, increased from $21,690 million in 2019 to $21,872 million in 2020, a rise of $182 million. This increase can be attributed to the acquisitions made during the period, which added $316 million, and the reported medical costs, which were $159,396 million in 2019 and increased to $159,396 million in 2020. The medical payments also saw a slight increase, from $155,320 million in 2019 to $159,530 million in 2020, adding $4,210 million.

Specifically, the total assets increased from $47,036 million in 2020 to $50,009 million in 2021, an increase of $3,076 million. This indicates a growth in the company's overall asset base over the period, which could be due to increased investments, acquisitions, or operational growth.\n\nLooking at the cash flow from operating activities, there was a notable increase as well. The consolidated segment reported a net cash provided by operating activities of $7,177 million in 2021, up from $4,054 million in 2020. This represents an increase of $3,123 million, or about 77%. The increase in operating cash flow is primarily attributed to higher profit before taxes, adjusted for non-cash items such as higher accruals for short-term incentive compensation, and lower payments for short-term incentive compensation. However, it was partially offset by increased working capital requirements, particularly in accounts receivable and inventory.\n\n![Implications of increased assets and operating cash flow](image1)\n\nThis increase in total assets and operating cash flow has several potential implications for the business operations:\n- **Growth and Investment**: The growth in assets suggests the company may have made strategic investments in new projects or acquisitions, which could be aimed at expanding its market presence or enhancing its product offerings.\n- **Operational Efficiency**: The substantial increase in operating cash flow indicates improved operational efficiency and better management of working capital, suggesting that the company is more effective in converting its revenue into cash.\n- **Financial Flexibility**: With increased cash flow, the company may have more financial flexibility to fund future growth, pay down debt, or return value to shareholders through dividends or share buybacks.\n\nOverall, the positive trends in total assets and operating cash flow are encouraging signs for the company's financial health and operational performance. However, the need to manage working capital effectively remains critical to sustain this growth.\n\nThe increase in total assets and operating cash flow from 2020 to 2021 for the consolidated segment suggests robust growth and operational efficiency, indicating a strong financial position for the business."}

This increase is primarily attributed to a rise in Card Member receivables and Card Member loans, which grew by $879 million and $1,679 million, respectively. Additionally, there was an increase in investment securities and other assets, contributing to the overall growth in total assets.\n\nOn the other hand, the total liabilities also saw an increase from $168,383 million in 2020 to $188,548 million in 2021, marking a growth of $20,165 million, or 12%. The largest contributor to this increase was the rise in long-term debt, which rose by $1,043 million. This was partially offset by a decrease in customer deposits, which fell by $2,779 million.

This substantial increase in comprehensive income is mainly due to a rise in net income, which jumped from $3,135 million in 2020 to $8,060 million in 2021, along with a reduction in other comprehensive loss, which decreased from $158 million in 2020 to $50 million in 2021.\n\nIn terms of cash flows, the entity experienced a net increase in cash and cash equivalents from $24,446 million in 2020 to $22,028 million in 2021, despite a net decrease of $10,937 million. This indicates that although there was a reduction in cash and cash equivalents, the entity managed to maintain sufficient liquidity, possibly through the management of cash flows from operating and investing activities. The increase in net income and comprehensive income contributed positively to the cash flows from operating activities, while the increase in Card Member loans and receivables and investment securities helped in managing the cash flows from investing activities.\n\nOverall, the changes in total assets and total liabilities from 2020 to 2021 align with the entity's growth in comprehensive income and cash flows, reflecting a strong performance in both revenue generation and capital management."}

Let's delve into the details.\n\n### Changes in Net Interest Income and Expense\n\n**Net Interest Income:**\n- **2019:** $49,486 million\n- **2020:** $43,859 million\n- **Change:** Decrease of $5,627 million (or approximately -11.38%)\n\n**Net Interest Expense:**\n- **2019:** $22,345 million\n- **2020:** $16,225 million\n- **Change:** Decrease of $6,120 million (or approximately -27.43%)\n\n### Impact on Net Interest Spread\n\nThe net interest spread, which is the difference between the net interest income and the net interest expense divided by the earning assets, can be calculated as follows:\n\n\\[ \\text{Net Interest Spread} = \\frac{\\text{Net Interest Income}}{\\text{Earning Assets}} - \\frac{\\text{Net Interest Expense}}{\\text{Earning Assets}} \\]\n\nFor 2019:\n\\[ \\text{Net Interest Spread} = 2.43\\% - 1.49\\% = 0.94\\% \\]\n\nFor 2020:\n\\[ \\text{Net Interest Spread} = 1.90\\% - 0.50\\% = 1.40\\% \\]\n\nThe net interest spread increased from 0.94% in 2019 to 1.40% in 2020, indicating a positive change.\n\n### Contributing Factors\n\n1. **Decrease in Net Interest Expense:**\n   - **2019:** $22,345 million\n   - **2020:** $16,225 million\n   - **Change:** Decrease of $6,120 million (or approximately -27.43%)\n   \n   This significant reduction in net interest expense is likely due to lower funding costs, as evidenced by the decrease in interest-bearing liabilities from $1,502,561 million in 2019 to $1,432,807 million in 2020. This reduction is reflected in the decrease in various types of deposits and borrowings, such as U.S. interest-bearing deposits and non-U.S. interest-bearing deposits.\n\n2. **Stable or Slightly Decreased Net Interest Income:**\n   - **2019:** $49,486 million\n   - **2020:** $43,859 million\n   - **Change:** Decrease of $5,627 million (or approximately -11.38%)\n   \n   Despite a decline in net interest income, the net interest spread increased, suggesting that the decrease in net interest expense had a more significant impact.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe increase in net interest spread from 0.94% in 2019 to 1.40% in 2020 was primarily due to a substantial decrease in net interest expense, driven by lower funding costs. While there was a decrease in net interest income, the reduction in expenses contributed more positively to the spread, leading to an overall improvement in the net interest margin.\n\n![Net Interest Spread increased due to lower net interest expense](image1)\n\nThis change highlights the importance of managing funding costs effectively to enhance profitability, even in the face of declining revenue."}

Specifically, the net interest income decreased by $13.4 billion to $13.7 billion, while total revenue, net of interest expense, dropped by $3.6 billion to $17.4 billion (see text quote [1]). This reduction was largely attributed to lower interest rates and a shift in customer balances at promotional rates (text quote [2]).\n\nFor the Wealth Management sector, including Merrill Lynch Global Wealth Management and Bank of America Private Bank, the net interest income also showed a decline, with a decrease of $1.036 billion to $5.468 billion (text quote [5]). However, the total revenue, net of interest expense, increased slightly by 4.3% to $18.584 billion (text quote [5]).

In 2021, the amortization of intangible assets under IFRS results was $3,903 million, compared to $3,462 million in 2020.

This is evident from the changes in the equity section of the balance sheet, where the retained earnings decreased by $10,179 million, and the treasury stock increased by $1,383 million, reflecting the repurchase of shares under the share repurchase and deferred compensation plans. \n\n![](image3)\n\nAs shown in the image, the net cash used for financing activities due to cash dividends and purchases of treasury shares was $(23,113) million.

The recognition of lease liabilities increased from $43,620,000 at the balance sheet date of 1 July 2019 to $50,245,000, reflecting the new on-balance-sheet accounting model for lessees. This adjustment also led to an increase in the liability recognized during the period to $1,559,000, and the re-measurement of lease liabilities contributed to a total lease liability of $167,154,000 by the end of the year. The current lease liability increased from $36,019,000 to $43,620,000, while the non-current lease liability grew from $131,135,000 to $167,154,000 (image1).\n\nFor employee benefit liabilities, the Group saw a minor decrease in the liability for annual leave and long-service leave.

The remuneration is structured to support this goal, as indicated in [10], where the Executive Compensation Meeting determines remuneration based on the policy established by the Board of Directors, ensuring that it aligns with the overall strategy for enhancing corporate value.\n\nTo summarize, Toyota's executive remuneration evaluation directly reflects their business performance and shareholder value indicators, ensuring that remuneration is linked to both corporate and individual performance, as well as the company's strategic goals for long-term growth and value creation. ![Reflects performance and shareholder value](image2)"}

This decline was driven by a reduction in net interest income, which fell by 16% from $10,675 million to $9,013 million. Noninterest income also saw a decrease, albeit smaller, from $9,808 million to $9,974 million. Consequently, the net income dropped significantly from $4,251 million in 2019 to $3,075 million in 2020, a decrease of $1,176 million (28%).\n\n![Consumer Banking performance shows a decline in revenue and net income in 2020 compared to 2019.](image2)\n\n### Global Wealth & Investment Management (GWIM)\n\nIn contrast, the **GWIM** segment maintained relatively stable revenue and net income figures. Revenue for GWIM was $18,584 million in 2020, similar to $19,538 million in 2019. The slight decrease in revenue was offset by an increase in net income from $8,073 million in 2019 to $3,470 million in 2020.

As shown in image7, a change in the discount rate by half a percentage point led to a significant increase or decrease in the defined benefit obligation. For instance, a 0.5% increase in the discount rate would result in a decrease of €242 million in the defined benefit obligation, while a 0.5% decrease would lead to an increase of €271 million. Similarly, changes in compensation increases and pension progression also influenced the defined benefit obligation, with a 0.5% increase in compensation leading to an increase of €16 million and a 0.5% increase in pension progression contributing €158 million.\n\nMoreover, the composition of plan assets also shifted between 2020 and 2021, as depicted in image6. The total plan assets increased from €2,813 million in 2020 to €3,259 million in 2021.

These declines are attributed to the closure and limited operations of restaurants due to the pandemic (image2).\n\nThe changes in revenue composition can be seen in the breakdown of revenues into different segments (image4).

This decline was particularly pronounced in the International Operated Markets segment, where sales declined by 13% (image8). The International Developmental Licensed Markets & Corporate segment also saw a 14% decrease in margins (image7).\n\nThe decrease in revenue and margins can be attributed to several factors. First, the closure and limited operations of restaurants during the pandemic (image1 and image10) had a direct impact on sales. Second, the need for additional marketing support to accelerate recovery and drive growth, such as the free Thank You Meals (image9), also contributed to the decline. Lastly, the shift towards delivery services, although having a positive impact on comparable sales in the second half of 2020 (image10), could not fully offset the losses from the closure of dine-in services.\n\nIn conclusion, the revenue composition and growth rates of McDonald's U.S. and International Operated Markets segments significantly declined from 2019 to 2020, primarily due to the impact of the global pandemic, necessitating strategic marketing investments and promotional activities to mitigate the effects."}

For instance, the decrease in 'Total assets' from $895,394 million at the end of 2020 to $895,394 million at the end of 2021, though the change is minimal, reflects the impact of the sale. Similarly, 'Total loans' also saw a reduction, dropping from $127,733 million to $135,811 million, indicating a shift in asset composition away from managed investment products to traditional lending activities (see image3).\n\nAdditionally, the reduction in 'Total deposits' from $102,429 million in 2020 to $32,220 million in 2021 is notable. This can be attributed to the sale of WFAM, which had a substantial presence in managing institutional retirement and trust client assets (refer to quote [3]). The decrease in deposits is also evident in the composition of deposits, where non-interest-bearing demand deposits increased by 13%, while time deposits decreased by 41% (see image7 and image8).\n\nThe decrease in 'Available-for-sale debt securities' from $250,801 million to $165,926 million and 'Equity securities' from $13,770 million to $16,549 million also reflect the reallocation of assets following the sale of WFAM (refer to image1).\n\nIn conclusion, the sale of WFAM led to a significant reduction in 'Total WFAM assets under management', impacting various balance sheet components including total assets, total loans, total deposits, and specific types of securities.

The breakdown includes increases in discretionary incentive compensation and the formulaic payout to Wealth Management representatives, along with incremental compensation from the E\\*TRADE acquisition. The expenses are further detailed in the text [11], which states that non-interest expenses increased by 14%, largely due to higher Compensation and benefits expenses.\n\nAdditionally, the text [12] provides a more granular view, showing a 13% increase in non-interest expenses, with a 12% increase in Compensation and benefits expenses and a 13% increase in Non-compensation expenses.

This is further supported by the significant rise in machinery and equipment from $2,194 million to $2,881 million, and a similar increase in customer-leased equipment from $1,766 million to $1,849 million. Additionally, the gross property, plant and equipment increased from $5,063 million to $6,444 million, while accumulated depreciation also rose from $2,761 million to $3,182 million. The net increase in property, plant, and equipment reflects the company's ongoing capital expenditure and strategic investments.\n\nIn terms of inventories, the changes are illustrated in the image6. The total inventory value increased from $1,628 million in 2019 to $2,292 million in 2020, with a significant rise in finished goods from $833 million to $1,232 million, work in process from $285 million to $369 million, and raw materials from $510 million to $691 million. This suggests an increase in the company's production and inventory levels, possibly to meet growing demand or prepare for future orders.\n\nLooking at the lease data (image4), the total operating lease liabilities increased from $719 million in 2019 to $974 million in 2020, with current liabilities rising from $158 million to $189 million and long-term liabilities increasing from $639 million to $785 million. The weighted average remaining lease term remained at 7 years, but the weighted average discount rate decreased slightly from 3.1% to 2.8%. The maturity of operating lease liabilities also indicates a significant payment obligation in the near term, with $213 million due in 2021 and $181 million due in 2022.\n\nThe inventory and lease data together suggest that the company is expanding its operational capacity and maintaining higher levels of inventory to support its growing sales. The increased lease liabilities and investments in tangible assets are indicative of the company's strategic focus on expanding its physical infrastructure and production capabilities. This aligns with the reported increase in sales and operating cash flows (image3).\n\nIn conclusion, the company's investments in lease assets and inventories between 2019 and 2020 reflect its strategy to enhance operational capacity and meet growing market demands, as evidenced by the substantial increases in machinery, equipment, and inventory values. These changes are reflected positively in the operating cash flows and sales figures, contributing to the overall financial health and growth of the company."}

As shown in the balance sheet changes (image1), the net deferred tax asset decreased from $303 million in 2019 to $89 million in 2020. This decrease is primarily due to reductions in tax positions of prior years and settlements with tax authorities.\n\nTo break it down further, the additions for tax positions of prior years increased from $63 million in 2019 to $35 million in 2020 (image1). Simultaneously, the reductions for tax positions of prior years were substantial, decreasing from $41 million in 2019 to $249 million in 2020 (image1). This significant reduction in prior-year tax positions led to a net decrease in the deferred tax asset. Additionally, the settlements with tax authorities (image1) showed a positive change from $8 million in 2019 to $0 in 2020, contributing to the overall reduction in the deferred tax asset.\n\nFurthermore, the effective tax rate changed from 12.4% in 2019 to 7.0% in 2020 (image6), indicating a reduction in the tax burden. This change is reflected in the deferred tax assets, which decreased from $662 million in 2019 to $645 million in 2020 (image3 and image5).

Let's delve deeper into each component:\n\n- **Employee Separation Costs**: These costs are primarily voluntary and are based on salary levels and past service periods. They are charged to earnings when the employee accepts the offer.\n- **Asset-Related Costs**: These consist of both asset write-downs and accelerated depreciation. Asset write-downs are related to the establishment of a new fair value basis for assets held-for-sale or for disposal, while accelerated depreciation relates to long-lived assets that will be taken out of service prior to the end of their normal service period. These charges do not significantly impact future depreciation charges.\n- **Other Restructuring-Type Charges**: These include asset removal and termination of contracts related to supply chain and overhead optimization.\n\nFor fiscal 2022, the breakdown of the total restructuring charges is as follows:\n\n- **Employee Separation Costs**: $67 million (SG&A: $4, Costs of Products Sold: $182, Other Non-Operating Income, Net: $4)\n- **Asset-Related Costs**: $182 million (SG&A: $176, Costs of Products Sold: $134, Other Non-Operating Income, Net: $20)\n- **Other Restructuring-Type Charges**: $4 million (SG&A: $0, Costs of Products Sold: $0, Other Non-Operating Income, Net: $4)\n\nIn fiscal 2021, the breakdown was slightly different:\n\n- **Employee Separation Costs**: $176 million (SG&A: $176, Costs of Products Sold: $0, Other Non-Operating Income, Net: $0)\n- **Asset-Related Costs**: $134 million (SG&A: $0, Costs of Products Sold: $134, Other Non-Operating Income, Net: $0)\n- **Other Restructuring-Type Charges**: $20 million (SG&A: $0, Costs of Products Sold: $0, Other Non-Operating Income, Net: $20)\n\nThis indicates that the largest component of restructuring costs has historically been related to employee separation, followed by asset-related costs, with other types of charges being relatively small.\n\n![Breakdown of restructuring costs in 2022](image5)\n\nIn conclusion, the total restructuring costs have decreased from 2020 to 2022, primarily due to a reduction in both employee separation costs and asset-related costs.

Let's delve into these changes and interpret them.\n\nFirstly, examining the cost of revenues (see image3 and image6):\n\n- In 2019, the cost of revenues was RMB16,761 million, comprising 65.9% of total revenues.\n- By 2021, this figure had risen to RMB21,840 million, making up 69.9% of total revenues. This increase indicates that the company's operational costs have grown more than its revenues, suggesting potential inefficiencies or increased investment in services and content.\n\nThe breakdown of cost of revenues (see image6) reveals that service costs remain the dominant component, but the proportion of other cost of revenues has also increased. Specifically, other cost of revenues, which include items like employee benefits and advertising agency fees, rose from RMB1,794 million in 2020 to RMB2,848 million in 2021, reflecting a 58.7% increase. This suggests that the company may be expanding its marketing efforts or increasing its investment in personnel.\n\nSecondly, looking at the operating expenses (see image2 and image8):\n\n- Selling and marketing expenses increased from RMB2,041 million in 2019 to RMB2,678 million in 2021, indicating an expansion in promotional activities and user acquisition.\n- General and administrative expenses also saw a rise, from RMB2,703 million in 2019 to RMB4,009 million in 2021, which is a 48.4% increase. This could suggest growing investments in R&D and administrative overheads.\n\nThe overall total operating expenses grew from RMB4,744 million in 2019 to RMB6,687 million in 2021, showing a 41.1% increase. This growth in operating expenses aligns with the increases in selling and marketing and general and administrative expenses, indicating a strategy focused on expanding the business through increased spending.\n\nConsidering the gross profit margin (see image3), it decreased from 34.1% in 2019 to 17.9% in 2021, reflecting a decline in profitability due to the rising costs.\n\nIn conclusion, the company's cost structure and operating expenses have significantly increased over the period from 2019 to 2021, particularly in areas such as marketing, R&D, and general administration. This suggests a strategy of aggressive expansion and investment in new initiatives, which could be aimed at capturing market share or enhancing its product offerings.

This indicates that IBM has maintained a relatively stable long-term debt position but has seen an increase in its noncurrent assets.\n\nThis increase in noncurrent assets could be attributed to various factors such as investments in property, plant, and equipment, or other long-term investments. The increase in long-term debt suggests that IBM might have used borrowed funds to finance these investments, indicating a strategic decision to leverage capital.\n\nThe changes in cash flows and equity also provide context. According to image5, there was a net use of cash in financing activities of $9,721 million in 2020, compared to a net source of cash of $9,042 million in 2019. This shift reflects a significant outflow of cash in 2020, possibly due to the repayment of debt or other financial obligations. Additionally, the decrease in total equity by $258 million, primarily due to dividends and a decline in accumulated other comprehensive income, shows that IBM distributed substantial amounts of cash to shareholders and experienced adverse movements in its financial positions.\n\nConsidering these elements, the increase in noncurrent assets and long-term debt, coupled with the significant cash outflows and equity reductions, suggest that IBM's financial standing has been affected by a combination of strategic investments and operational decisions.

This shift suggests a trend towards debt repayment among consumers, possibly due to economic pressures or increased savings behaviors. Additionally, the outstanding balances in the credit card portfolio decreased by $18.9$ billion in 2020, indicating a reduction in consumer spending and an increase in payments [11]. The decline in credit card purchase volumes by $26.3$ billion, while debit card purchase volumes increased by $23.8$ billion, further supports this notion [10].\n\n![](image2) shows the breakdown of the home equity and first mortgage portfolios, revealing a significant reduction in the home equity portfolio from $9,755$ million in 2019 to $6,930$ million in 2020. This indicates a substantial decrease in new home equity lending activities in 2020, likely due to stricter lending standards or reduced consumer demand for such products.\n\n![](image7) illustrates the changes in gross interest yield and purchase volumes for credit cards and debit cards. The gross interest yield on credit cards decreased from $10.76\\%$ in 2019 to $10.27\\%$ in 2020, while debit card purchase volumes increased by $23.8$ billion. This suggests that consumers shifted their spending from high-interest credit card purchases to lower-cost debit card transactions, which could be attributed to economic uncertainties and a preference for cash-like alternatives.\n\nIn conclusion, the decreases in both home equity and credit card balances indicate a cautious approach to borrowing and spending among consumers, likely driven by economic conditions such as the impact of the pandemic. Consumers are paying down their debts and shifting their spending habits towards more cost-effective options."}

For instance, a $1 per tonne decline in the average iron ore price would have an estimated impact on FY2021 profit after taxation of $163 million, while a $1 per barrel decline in the average oil price would impact it by $24 million [4]. This underscores the sensitivity of BHP's financial performance to commodity price fluctuations.\n\nRegarding coal, the Underlying EBITDA for Coal decreased by $1.3 billion to $288 million, including lower price impacts, net of price-linked costs, of $0.7 billion, and lower volumes decreased Underlying EBITDA by $168 million [2]. The Queensland Coal unit costs are expected to be between $80 and $90 per tonne in FY2022, with higher diesel prices being a key driver, although mine plan optimisation and efficiency uplifts are expected to mitigate increased stripping requirements [3]. Additionally, the company noted that controllable cash costs increased by $102 million, driven by increased maintenance costs and stripping volumes, partially offset by cost reduction initiatives [2].\n\nFor nickel, the Underlying EBITDA for Nickel West increased by $296 million to $259 million in FY2021, reflecting higher prices and volumes, and lower maintenance costs following the major quadrennial shutdowns in the prior year, as well as lower contractor costs following the transition and ramp-up of new mines [9]. However, unfavourable exchange rate movements and the adverse impacts of the stronger nickel price on third-party concentrate purchase costs also offset some of these gains.\n\n![Impact on profit after taxation](image5) illustrates the potential financial impact of changes in commodity prices on BHP's profit after taxation, showing significant reductions in profit from a decline in the price of various commodities like iron ore, metallurgical coal, and nickel.\n\nIn summary, changes in commodity prices, especially for coal and nickel, can significantly affect BHP's financial results through their impact on revenues, EBITDA, and asset values. Key drivers include market price variations, production volumes, and cost control measures."}

This rise can be attributed to various factors, including increased operational costs and potentially higher expenses associated with maintaining and enhancing production facilities.\n\n![The cost per Boe increased from $9.74 in FY2020 to $10.83 in FY2021, reflecting higher operational costs.](image6)\n\nIn summary, petroleum production saw a decline from FY2020 to FY2021, while the cost per Boe experienced an increase, indicating a rise in operational expenses despite lower production volumes."}

This indicates a positive change in operational efficiency, as a lower efficiency ratio suggests that the company is generating more revenue with fewer expenses.\n\nTo understand the context of this change, let's look at the percentage change in the efficiency ratio from 2020 to 2021 across different segments. In the first image quote (image1), we can observe the efficiency ratio for various lines of business. For instance, the efficiency ratio for Consumer and Small Business Banking decreased from 79% in 2020 to 71% in 2021, indicating a significant improvement in operational efficiency within this segment.\n\nComparing the overall efficiency ratio change to the prior year's change, we find that the efficiency ratio decreased by 8 percentage points from 2020 to 2021, whereas in the previous year (2019 to 2020), the efficiency ratio changed by 8 percentage points as well. However, the direction of change is consistent, showing a reduction in the efficiency ratio over two consecutive years.\n\nThe efficiency ratio for the period ending December 31, 2021, was 71%, a 8 percentage point decrease from 2020, and this change aligns with the prior year's trend where the efficiency ratio also decreased by 8 percentage points from 2019 to 2020.

However, it's important to note that the decrease in comprehensive income is more pronounced than the decrease in net income, indicating that there might have been non-operating factors affecting the company's overall financial position. Specifically, the other comprehensive loss in 2020, which includes gains and losses on foreign currency translation, cash flow hedges, and available-for-sale securities, amounted to $438 million, significantly higher than the $141 million in 2019 and $247 million in 2018 (see image3).\n\nThe decline in comprehensive income suggests that the company experienced more volatility in its non-operating activities, such as fluctuations in exchange rates and changes in the fair value of its investments. This could indicate that the company has a more diversified portfolio of financial instruments and international operations, which can expose it to greater market risks.\n\nMoreover, the changes in the balance sheet components, particularly in image7 and image8, provide insights into the company's cash flows and asset-liability structure. For instance, the cash and cash equivalents increased from $6,037 million in 2019 to $6,266 million in 2020, suggesting stable liquidity management. The decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities indicates tighter control over working capital management.\n\nOverall, the reduction in both comprehensive income and net income from 2018 to 2020 implies a slight decline in the company's profitability, but the substantial increase in other comprehensive loss points to heightened market risks. This trend suggests that while the core business may be stable, the company needs to manage its exposure to market risks more effectively.\n\n![The comprehensive income and net income decreased from 2018 to 2020, indicating a slight decline in profitability, while other comprehensive loss increased, highlighting heightened market risks.](image3)"}

This suggests that while both executives are incentivized based on performance, Shane has a greater portion of his compensation tied to achieving specific performance targets, likely reflecting his role as the Managing Director and the strategic importance of his performance to the company's success.\n\nThe long-term incentive schemes for both executives are detailed in the image showing the grants and vesting profiles. For Shane, the long-term incentives include performance rights/options granted over different periods with varying values and performance thresholds [10]. These grants aim to align his interests with those of the shareholders by rewarding him for achieving specific financial performance metrics, such as EBIT growth and EPS growth, over a defined performance period [12].\n\n![EBIT* over the Performance Period](image2)\n![EPS over the Performance Period % Exercisable](image5)\n![Company's diluted Earnings Per Share over the Performance Period % Exercisable](image8)\n\nIn conclusion, Shane Fallscheer's remuneration structure is more heavily skewed towards performance-based incentives, particularly through long-term incentive schemes, whereas Chris Lauder's remuneration is more evenly split between fixed and at-risk components, reflecting a different level of responsibility and performance expectations associated with their respective roles."}

The table clearly shows that in 2019, there was a net cash outflow of $(16,707) million, while in 2020, there was a net cash inflow of $11,632 million, and in 2021, there was a net cash outflow of $(10,529) million.\n\nThe visual layout of the table in image3 supports this analysis by presenting the data in a structured manner, making it easy to compare the net cash flows across different years. The columns for \"Net Cash (used in) provided by investing activities\" are aligned for each year, allowing for a straightforward comparison. Specifically, the negative values indicate net cash outflows, while positive values represent net cash inflows. This layout clearly illustrates the shift from a large outflow in 2019 to a significant inflow in 2020, followed by another outflow in 2021.\n\nThe trend indicates that the company experienced a substantial increase in cash inflow from investing activities in 2020, possibly due to the sale of investment securities and maturing of investment securities, which contributed to the $20,032 million inflow in 2020. However, in 2021, the net cash outflow increased compared to 2020, reflecting a combination of factors such as a decrease in the maturity and redemption of investment securities and a significant increase in the net decrease in Card Member loans and receivables and other loans.\n\nThe net cash outflows in 2019 and 2021 suggest that the company's investment activities involved significant expenditures, such as the purchase of premises and equipment and the acquisition/disposition of assets. Overall, the visual representation in the table allows for a clear understanding of the trends and specific factors influencing the net cash flows from investing activities over the three-year period.\n\nIn summary, the trend in Net Cash (used in) or provided by Investing Activities from 2019 to 2021 was from a net cash outflow of $(16,707) million in 2019, to a net cash inflow of $11,632 million in 2020, and then back to a net cash outflow of $(10,529) million in 2021."}

This substantial improvement in net income is evident from the table in `image4` where the net income (loss) for 2021 is shown as \\(+\\$15,689\\) million, compared to a loss of \\(-\\$5,561\\) million in 2020. This improvement can be attributed to several factors, including higher revenues, lower costs, and the absence of significant impairments and write-offs. The increase in net income also led to a corresponding increase in the income tax expense, which rose from a tax benefit of \\(-\\$1.58\\) billion in 2020 to a tax charge of \\(-\\$1.60\\) billion in 2021, as detailed in `image8`.\n\nMoreover, the comprehensive income also showed a marked improvement from 2020 to 2021.

This significant shift in comprehensive income is largely due to the positive changes in net income and the reversal of certain items that contributed to the previous year's comprehensive loss.\n\nThe financial activities contributing to these changes include:\n- Higher revenues and operating income, as indicated by the increase in sales and other operating revenues from \\(\\$94,471\\) million in 2020 to \\(\\$155,606\\) million in 2021, according to `image4`.\n- Lower costs and deductions, particularly in areas such as purchased crude oil and products, operating expenses, and exploration expenses.\n- The absence of significant impairments and write-offs, which were substantial in 2020 but nearly absent in 2021.\n\nIn conclusion, Chevron Corporation's net income and comprehensive income improved significantly from 2020 to 2021, primarily due to higher revenues, reduced costs, and the absence of major impairments and write-offs. ![Summary of financial activities contributing to the changes in net income and comprehensive income](image4)"}

Enhanced battery control models play a crucial role in achieving these goals by optimizing the use of battery capacity and ensuring efficient energy management.\n\nBy focusing on the development of advanced battery control models, Toyota not only aims to improve the performance and efficiency of its next-generation BEVs but also to reduce costs and enhance the overall driving experience, making electrified vehicles more accessible and appealing to a broader range of customers. This approach underscores Toyota's strategic vision for the future of electric mobility, as highlighted in quotes [4] and [12], where the company emphasizes the importance of diverse electrification strategies and continuous technological advancements."}

This reduction is primarily attributed to early retirements and debt maturities of $11,267 million, partially offset by issuances of $8,982 million. The decrease in non-Global Financing debt from $40,371 million to $38,173 million (a decrease of $2,198 million) suggests a strategic move to reduce non-financing-related debt. On the other hand, the Global Financing segment debt decreased from $24,727 million to $21,167 million (a decrease of $3,560 million).\n\nLastly, the noncurrent liabilities (excluding debt) (image8):\n\n```markdown\nAdditions/\nJanuary 1, 2020 * (Releases) ** Write-offs + Other ++ December 31, 2020\n$612 $108 $(85) $10 $644\n```\n\nThe noncurrent liabilities (excluding debt) increased by $1,621 million (or $251 million adjusted for currency) from 2019 to 2020. This increase is primarily driven by the rise in intercompany and external payables and the intercompany investment from IBM, as mentioned in the text quotes [1].\n\n### Implications on the Company's Financial Strategy\n\nThe reduction in total company debt and the specific decrease in non-Global Financing debt suggest that IBM is focusing on deleveraging and reducing its reliance on external financing. This aligns with the statement in text quote [5] that IBM aims to operate at a single A credit rating and continues to deleverage throughout 2021. The decrease in Global Financing segment debt indicates a shift in the company's Global Financing business, as mentioned in text quote [10], where IBM has wound down its OEM Commercial Financing business and entered into an agreement to sell its commercial financing receivables. \n\nThe increase in noncurrent assets reflects the company's ongoing investments in long-term assets, which could be related to its strategic initiatives such as expanding its hybrid cloud and AI offerings. The increase in noncurrent liabilities (excluding debt) might indicate growing operational obligations or investments in long-term projects.\n\nOverall, these changes reflect IBM's strategy to improve its balance sheet strength and liquidity while focusing on its core business areas and divesting less strategic segments. \n\n**Conclusion:** The reduction in debt and the strategic focus on non-Global Financing assets indicate IBM's commitment to financial prudence and strategic realignment."}

This decrease can be attributed to several factors as detailed in the text quotes.\n\n- **Excluding unfavorable currency movements of $0.5 billion**, the net cash provided by operating activities actually increased by $0.2 billion from 2019 to 2020 ([3]).\n- The increase in net earnings, excluding certain non-cash charges and other items, contributed to this positive change ([3]).\n- However, the rise in working capital requirements and higher cash payments for asset impairments and exit costs offset some of this increase ([3]).\n\nFor 2019, the net cash provided by operating activities was $7,728 million, which was an increase of $838 million from 2018. The text quotes explain that this increase was mainly due to higher net earnings after adjusting for certain non-cash charges and favorable currency movements, but it was partially offset by higher working capital requirements and cash payments for asset impairments and exit costs ([3], [9], [10]).\n\nTo summarize, the net cash provided by operating activities decreased from $8,286 million in 2018 to $7,728 million in 2019, and then further decreased to $8,592 million in 2020. This decrease from 2018 to 2020 was driven by the factors mentioned above, including changes in net earnings, working capital, and cash payments for specific activities.\n\n```markdown\n![Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities](image5)\n```\n\nThis table clearly shows the detailed breakdown of the changes in net cash provided by operating activities over the years, providing a visual representation of the financial health and operational cash flow dynamics of the company."}

The net interest yield on average Card Member loans was 11.1% in 2019, decreased to 10.7% in 2020, and then increased to 11.5% in 2021.\n\nTo understand the major factors influencing these changes, let's look at the detailed breakdowns. Image8 provides a clearer picture of the net interest yield on average Card Member loans for different regions and overall, while image2 gives us the overall trends.\n\nIn 2020, the net interest yield on average Card Member loans slightly decreased to 10.7% compared to 11.1% in 2019. This reduction might be attributed to a decline in interest income, as seen in the image2 where the interest income not attributable to the Card Member loan portfolio decreased from $(379) million to $(668) million. Additionally, the average Card Member loans decreased from $82.8 billion to $76.0 billion, leading to a slight drop in the net interest yield.\n\nHowever, in 2021, there was a noticeable improvement in the net interest yield, increasing to 11.5%. This improvement can be attributed to a significant rise in average Card Member loans to $76.0 billion, combined with an increase in interest income, as shown in image2. The net interest income for 2021 was $7,750 million, which is higher than the $7,985 million in 2020 and $8,620 million in 2019. \n\n![The net interest yield on average Card Member loans changed from 11.1% in 2019 to 10.7% in 2020 and then increased to 11.5% in 2021, influenced by changes in average Card Member loans and interest income.](image8)\n\nIn conclusion, the net interest yield on average Card Member loans increased from 2019 to 2021, primarily due to an increase in average Card Member loans and a rise in interest income, offsetting the effects of changes in the interest income not attributable to the Card Member loan portfolio."}

The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic further exacerbated the decline in 2020, leading to consistent volume and net selling price declines, as stated in quote [4]. This decline in sales is also evident from the specific breakdown in image7, where ENBREL sales in the U.S. fell by 4% from 2019 to 2020. Additionally, ENBREL continues to face increased competition from biosimilars and generics, as mentioned in quote [9], which further compounds its market share loss.\n\nIn contrast, Prolia's sales performance improved over the years, as indicated by the data in image5 and image6. Prolia sales increased by 3% from 2019 to 2020, driven by higher unit demand and net selling price.

This increase was partially offset by charge-offs. The provision for credit losses was driven by actual and forecasted changes in asset quality trends, as well as risks related to the uncertainty in the outlook for the sectors affected by the pandemic. Specifically, charge-offs in 2020 were primarily related to certain Commercial real estate and Corporate loans in the Institutional Securities business segment.\n\nAdditionally, the base scenario used in the ACL models assumed a continued recovery through 2021, supported by fiscal stimulus and monetary policy measures. This scenario is critical in understanding the sensitivity of the ACL to economic conditions, with the most sensitive model input being U.S. GDP.\n\nFrom the financial statements, we can see that at transition on January 1, 2020, the adoption of the new accounting standard resulted in an increase in the allowance for credit losses of $131 million, with a corresponding reduction in Retained earnings of $100 million, net of tax. This adoption impact was primarily attributable to a $124 million increase in the allowance for credit losses on employee loans.\n\nMoreover, the ACL for loans and lending commitments at December 31, 2020, increased significantly compared to December 31, 2019, as seen in the table provided in image1.

According to the TCFD implementation guidelines [10], the bank aims to fully implement the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) and has committed to achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions before 2050 across its operations, supply chain, and financing activities. This commitment is detailed in their TCFD Report available on their website [11].\n\n![Impact of Greenhouse gas emissions](image1)\n\nFor instance, in 2019, Bank of America reported its greenhouse gas emissions across various scopes, including Scope 1, Scope 2, and Scope 3 emissions [1]. They have significantly reduced their location-based emissions by 56% globally since 2010. The societal impact of their emissions in 2019 was estimated to be $238 million, calculated using the EPA's 2020 social cost of carbon of $42/metric ton CO2 [1].\n\nRegarding air pollution, Bank of America reported their 2019 air pollution emissions (metric tons) [2], including nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulfur oxides (SOx), particulate matter, and other significant air emissions. The valued impact of these emissions in 2019 was estimated to be $146,000, calculated using the social cost factors of each pollutant as reported in the World Resources Institute’s Transport Emissions & Social Cost Assessment (TESCA) Tool v1.0 [3].\n\nThese emissions have significant impacts on both the bank's operations and society. On the operational side, reducing emissions can lower energy costs and improve efficiency, leading to cost savings. Societally, reducing emissions helps mitigate climate change, which can have wide-ranging positive effects, including improved public health, reduced environmental degradation, and enhanced biodiversity.\n\nIn conclusion, Bank of America is actively working to reduce its environmental impact through comprehensive strategies and transparent reporting, ensuring that their operations align with global sustainability goals."}

Let's break down the details from the images and text quotes.\n\nFirstly, **Sales Prices** had a substantial impact on FY2021. According to image6, the net price impact for FY2021 was $16,965 million, which was attributed to higher average realized prices for iron ore, copper, nickel, oil, natural gas, and thermal coal. This increase was partially offset by lower average realized prices for metallurgical coal and LNG. Similarly, for FY2020, the net price impact was $16,095 million, indicating a similar trend but with slightly lower prices.\n\nSecondly, **Volumes** played a crucial role in FY2021. Image8 indicates that the change in volumes for FY2021 was $312 million, with record volumes at WAIO and strong performance across the supply chain. However, this was offset by natural field decline at Petroleum, the expected lower grades at Escondida and Spence, and adverse weather impacts in the Gulf of Mexico and NSWEC. In contrast, for FY2020, the volume impact was negative at $312 million, suggesting a decline in production or sales volumes.\n\nThese changes in sales prices and volumes had a direct effect on the Underlying EBITDA. For FY2021, the Underlying EBITDA increased to $37.4 billion, a 69% rise from the previous year. The primary driver was higher iron ore and copper prices, as stated in text quote [4]. Conversely, for FY2020, the Underlying EBITDA was $22.071 billion, as shown in image8.\n\nTo summarize, the increase in sales prices and the record volumes in FY2021 contributed to the significant rise in Underlying EBITDA, while the decline in volumes and lower prices in certain commodities partially offset these gains. This interplay between sales prices and volumes directly influenced the profitability and Underlying EBITDA of the company.\n\n![Summary of price and volume impacts on Underlying EBITDA](image6)"}

The comprehensive income attributable to UnitedHealth Group common shareholders increased from $12,382 million in 2018 to $15,403 million in 2020, as shown in the image6. This significant increase can be attributed to several factors.\n\nFirstly, the operating income increased from $17,344 million in 2018 to $22,405 million in 2019, and further to $22,405 million in 2020, indicating a strong operational performance. The increase in operating income is reflected in the growth of net earnings, which rose from $12,382 million in 2018 to $15,403 million in 2020.\n\nSecondly, the changes in comprehensive income also reflect the impact of other comprehensive income, which includes items like unrealized gains or losses on investment securities and foreign currency translation adjustments. For instance, in 2019, the gross unrealized gains on investment securities amounted to $1,212 million, while in 2020, it dropped to $805 million. Additionally, there was a significant increase in foreign currency translation losses from $242 million in 2018 to $1,517 million in 2019, and then a decrease to $242 million in 2020.\n\nFurthermore, the share-based compensation also played a role in the changes. While it remained relatively stable at around $2,891 million in 2018 and 2019, it increased slightly to $3,150 million in 2020.\n\nLastly, the reduction in interest expense from $1,704 million in 2018 to $1,663 million in 2020 also contributed positively to the comprehensive income.\n\nOverall, the comprehensive income of UnitedHealth Group saw a steady increase from 2018 to 2020, driven by improved operational performance, share-based compensation, and favorable changes in other comprehensive income, particularly in foreign currency translation adjustments. ![UnitedHealth Group's comprehensive income showed a steady increase from 2018 to 2020](image6)"}

According to the text, there are currently six GSM/WCDMA & CDMA operators, one LTE operator, and one WiMAX operator in Indonesia. However, CDMA operators are facing pressure to either merge, migrate to LTE, or be sold to GSM operators, with Smartfren being the best-performing CDMA operator and planning to transition to LTE by 2016. The transition to LTE is driven by the need to comply with international standards and improve service quality.\n\n![Indonesia's Telecom Landscape](image4) shows the current distribution of GSM and CDMA technologies among the major operators. As of 2014, the market share for GSM operators (Telkomsel, XL-Axiata, Indosat) was significantly larger compared to CDMA operators (Smartfren, Telkom Flexi, Esia, StarOne).\n\nTo provide a more precise market share distribution, let's look at the subscriber numbers. Image6 and Image7 depict the number of subscribers for different operators over the years. While Image6 provides a snapshot of the number of subscribers in millions, Image7 breaks down the subscriber base into GSM and CDMA segments. Based on these images, we can infer that GSM operators dominate the market. For instance, in 2013, Telkomsel, XL-Axiata, and Indosat together had around 139.3 million subscribers, while CDMA operators such as Smartfren and Telkom Flexi had a much smaller number of subscribers, approximately 13.8 million.\n\nIn conclusion, the market share distribution between GSM and CDMA technologies in Indonesia is heavily skewed towards GSM. GSM operators hold a dominant position, with CDMA operators having a smaller but significant presence, especially Smartfren, which is actively transitioning to LTE. This shift is expected to continue as CDMA operators are required to align with the evolving telecommunications standards."}

This is supported by the finding that the majority of third or higher generation self-identified Hispanics have a non-Hispanic spouse, as shown in image `![Self-Identified Non-Hispanics](image6)`.\n\nIn conclusion, the generational breakdown reveals that as individuals move further away from their immigrant origins, their identification with Hispanic heritage decreases, leading to a higher likelihood of identifying as non-Hispanic or American."}

By 2018, these numbers had risen to 28% and 37%, respectively. This trend aligns with the data presented in quote [11], where it's noted that the share of Democratic-leaning independents with a very unfavorable opinion of the Republican Party has more than quadrupled from 8% to 37% between 1994 and 2018. Similarly, the share of Republican leaners with a very unfavorable opinion of the Democratic Party increased from 15% to 39% during the same period.\n\n![Unfavorable views of both parties have increased over time](image1)\n\nThis increase in negative sentiment is consistent across various political affiliations, as illustrated by the data in image3. It shows that the percentage of Independents who have a favorable view of the Democratic Party but an unfavorable view of the Republican Party has grown significantly. Specifically, in 2018, 42% of all Independents viewed the Democratic Party favorably while 24% viewed both parties unfavorably. In contrast, only 28% of Independents viewed the Republican Party favorably in the same year, with 24% having an unfavorable view of both parties.

Initially, there was a general sentiment that anti-terror policies did not go far enough to protect the country, with the percentage expressing this concern peaking around early 2010 at 58%, shortly after the failed Christmas Day terrorist attack (see [1]). However, over the years, this perception evolved, and by 2015, a majority of the public believed that the government's anti-terror policies had gone too far in restricting civil liberties, with 56% holding this view (see [7]).\n\n![](image1) This graph shows the changing public opinion on the effectiveness of government anti-terror policies, with a notable increase in concern about insufficient protection from 2004 to 2015. The graph indicates that while public concern about inadequate policies was already present in 2004, it significantly rose by 2015, reaching a peak of 56% (see [7]). Conversely, the percentage of those who thought policies had gone too far in restricting civil liberties also increased, though it remained lower than the former concern.\n\nAdditionally, the data reveals that the shift towards the view that policies had not gone far enough was more pronounced among Republicans, with a 33-point increase since 2013 (see [9]). This can be observed in the political breakdown of opinions, where Republicans showed a higher percentage of concern about insufficient protection compared to Democrats (see [8]). The graph in image4 further illustrates this trend, showing that among Republicans, 71% were more concerned about insufficient protection in 2015, up from 57% in January of the same year.\n\n![](image4) This pie chart clearly shows the distribution of opinions among different age groups and political affiliations. It highlights that younger adults and Republicans were more likely to believe that anti-terror policies did not go far enough to protect the country, while older adults and Democrats were more concerned about civil liberties being restricted too much.\n\nOverall, the public's perspective on anti-terror policies shifted significantly from a belief that they did not provide adequate protection to a concern that they were overly restrictive, especially by 2015. This change reflects a broader societal debate on balancing security measures with civil liberties, influenced by events such as the Snowden revelations and the rise of ISIS (see [5], [11], [12]).\n\nIn conclusion, public opinion regarding anti-terror policies became more critical of the government's approach, with a greater emphasis on the need for better protection against terrorism without compromising civil liberties."}

The Transcontinental Railroad Act also played a crucial role, transforming the landscape and facilitating easier access to the region (quote [5]). Secondly, the introduction of power equipment and mechanization in agriculture, discussed in quote [6], allowed farmers to cultivate larger areas, which may have attracted more settlers and supported population growth. However, the consolidation of farms and the decline in the number of individual farms since 1900, as noted in quote [6], could have contributed to the subsequent population decline.

In fact, an astounding 85% of Americans support this type of policy, with nearly half (47%) favoring it strongly [4]. This indicates a significant preference for maintaining human control over technology in dangerous contexts.\n\nThe image `![Support for limiting dangerous jobs](image1)` visually reinforces this sentiment, showing a strong divide between those who support and oppose such limitations. Additionally, the data reveals that this support is consistent across different demographic groups, including both Democrats and Republicans, with 60% of Republicans and 61% of Democrats in favor [8].\n\nIn contrast, while there is broad support for other policies aimed at mitigating the effects of automation, such as providing a universal basic income (60% in favor) or a national service program for displaced workers (58% in favor), these policies receive less overwhelming support compared to the restriction on dangerous jobs [10]. The image `![Public support for various policies](image2)` illustrates this, showing higher levels of support for limiting dangerous jobs compared to other policies like universal basic income and national service programs.\n\nThe text [9] further highlights that while there are significant differences in support for various policies related to automation based on political affiliation, there is a notable consensus on the need to limit machines to dangerous and unhealthy jobs. This is evident in the consistent support levels across both Democrats and Republicans, indicating a shared belief in the importance of human safety.\n\nIn conclusion, Americans overwhelmingly support the idea of limiting machines to dangerous jobs, with an 85% approval rate, compared to 60% for a guaranteed basic income and 58% for a national service program [4][8][10]."}

Similarly, 76% of McCain's voters thought Republican leaders should work with Democrats [7]. However, the dynamics shifted dramatically in 2016, as seen in the image1, where only 47% of all voters agreed that leaders should work with the opposing side. The gender breakdown also showed a difference, with women being slightly more inclined to support such collaboration (54% of women vs. 43% of men) [1].\n\nMoreover, the image2 illustrates a stark contrast between the views of Trump and Clinton voters in 2016 compared to 2008. While 83% of Trump voters favored working with Democratic leaders to get things done, even if it meant disappointing their supporters, this view was shared by only 35% of Clinton voters. In 2008, 58% of McCain voters preferred working with Obama, indicating a higher level of bipartisanship [5].\n\nThe image3 provides further insight into the sentiment surrounding the election, showing a significant increase in the perception of mudslinging from 70% in 2008 to 92% in 2016, suggesting a more contentious political climate. This was paralleled by the emotions of voters, with a notable shift from hopeful and proud sentiments in 2008 (41% and 41% respectively) to more negative emotions like sadness and fear in 2016 [4].\n\nIn terms of collaboration, the image4 shows that in 2008, 59% of Republican voters and 36% of Democrats wanted their leaders to work with the other party. Conversely, in 2016, the percentages were reversed, with 47% of Democrats and 29% of Republicans preferring cooperation. This indicates a substantial change in voter attitudes towards bipartisan efforts [9].\n\nLastly, the image5 and image6 highlight the divergent feelings about the election outcomes. In 2008, 59% of Republican voters were positive about their party's leaders working with Obama, whereas in 2016, only 41% of Trump voters felt similarly about working with Democratic leaders. The image7 further emphasizes this shift, showing that in 2008, 65% of Democratic voters wanted their leaders to stand up to Obama, whereas in 2016, 63% preferred working with Trump. These data points collectively indicate a significant decline in bipartisan sentiment and an increased preference for intra-party unity among voters [11].\n\nOverall, voter opinions on political leaders working with the newly elected presidents saw a marked shift from 2008 to 2016, with a decrease in willingness to collaborate across party lines and an increase in intra-party support [12]."}

If we increase this to 6 cars per train, the capacity becomes 30 cars [4], which is an improvement but still falls short of the required capacity for significant ridership growth.\n\nLooking at the scenarios depicted in the image1, we see that increasing the number of cars per train from 5 to 6 results in a capacity of 36 cars, and further increasing to 8 cars per train brings the capacity to 48 cars. This shows that doubling the number of cars per train significantly increases the capacity. However, even with 48 cars, it might not be enough to meet the future demand.\n\nThe image1 also illustrates that increasing the frequency of trains can further enhance capacity. With 8 cars per train and 8 trains per hour, the total capacity reaches 64 cars [8]. This scenario represents the highest peak hour train car requirement among the given options and is likely to be necessary to accommodate future growth in ridership.\n\nHowever, the question of whether Caltrain can keep up with this demand is complex. As mentioned in the text, if Caltrain were to shut down, it would require 4-5 additional lanes on Highway 101 to handle the increased traffic [9]. This underscores the importance of maintaining and improving Caltrain's service to reduce reliance on personal vehicles.\n\nIn conclusion, the peak hour train car requirement for Caltrain significantly increases with improvements such as increasing the number of cars per train and the frequency of trains. To meet the goal of doubling ridership to 120,000 daily trips by the next decade, Caltrain will likely need to implement multiple improvements, including increasing train car capacity and frequency, to achieve a total peak hour train car requirement of 64 cars [5]."}

Specifically, 31% of college graduates hold this view, which is higher than those with some college experience (26%) or those without a college degree (20%) [5].\n\n![image4](image4) illustrates these differences clearly, showing that a larger percentage of independent voters and those leaning towards the Democratic Party believe that neither party has high ethical standards, whereas a smaller percentage of those leaning Republican believe the same.\n\nFurthermore, partisan differences are evident when considering ethical standards within the parties themselves. While majorities of Republicans (66%) and Democrats (64%) describe their respective parties as having high ethical standards, there are still considerable numbers who do not agree. Notably, among Democrats, there are modest differences along ideological lines, with 8% of conservative or moderate Democrats and 93% of liberal Democrats giving low marks for the ethical standards of the Trump administration [10].\n\nThe survey also highlights that there are sizable educational differences in early midterm vote preferences, with those holding a postgraduate degree favoring the Democratic candidate over the Republican by a wide margin (62% to 30%) [8]. This suggests that higher education may influence not only perceptions of ethical standards but also voting behavior.\n\nIn conclusion, the data indicates that perceptions of ethical standards vary significantly across different educational levels and political affiliations, with college graduates and independents being particularly critical of both parties' ethical standards."}

However, this rate drops sharply to 47% for those aged 80 and above, with only 21% having a broadband connection at home (image1).\n\nMoreover, the adoption of smartphones and tablets among seniors also decreases with age. For example, 84% of 65-69 year-olds own a smartphone, compared to just 61% of those 80 and older (image6). Similarly, tablet ownership follows a similar pattern, with 29% of 65-69 year-olds owning one, dropping to 5% among those 80 and older (image5).\n\nIn terms of social networking site (SNS) usage, the trend also indicates a decrease with age. While 41% of internet users aged 65-69 use SNS, this figure drops to 27% among those 80 and older (image4).\n\nThe data also highlights a notable correlation between education level and income with internet and broadband usage. Higher education and income levels correlate with higher rates of internet and broadband adoption. For example, 87% of those with a college degree go online, compared to 37% of those with a high school diploma or less (image2). Similarly, the highest broadband adoption rates are seen among those earning over $75,000 annually (82%), while the lowest rates are among those earning less than $30,000 (25%) (image2).\n\nOverall, these statistics indicate that younger and more affluent seniors are more likely to embrace technology, while older and less affluent seniors are less likely to do so. The decline in internet and broadband usage becomes particularly pronounced around age 75 (see image1 and image2).\n\nTo summarize, internet and broadband usage among seniors decreases significantly with age, with the sharpest declines observed after the age of 75. This trend is consistent across various technologies, including smartphones, tablets, and social networking sites.

Specifically, 79% of Republicans and Republican leaners held this view, up from 63% in October 2017, indicating a growing optimism among Republicans (see [7]). However, Democrats' views were more negative, with only 46% believing that Trump's policies had improved conditions, down from previous periods (see [7]).\n\nBy January 2019, the gap between Republican and Democratic perceptions had widened even further. According to [11], 40% of the public overall believed that Trump's policies had made economic conditions better since taking office, while 28% felt they had made conditions worse. The remaining 29% thought they had not had much of an effect. Among Republicans and Republican leaners, these views were more positive: 75% rated economic conditions as excellent or good, compared to just 32% of Democrats and Democratic leaners offering the same positive assessment (see [4] and [11]).\n\nThe image `image6` illustrates this change, showing that the percentage of Republicans who thought Trump's policies had made conditions worse dropped from 18% in October 2017 to 28% in January 2019, while the percentage of Democrats who held the same view increased from 28% to 46%. This shift is starkly depicted in the graph, which tracks the sentiment over time.\n\nIn summary, from October 2017 to January 2019, Republicans became increasingly positive about Trump's economic policies, while Democrats became more negative, leading to a significant polarization in views."}

As shown in the graph described in `image5`, the majority of Republicans and Democrats believe that U.S. efforts to solve problems around the world make things worse, with the percentages being 55% for the overall public, 62% for Republicans, and 51% for Democrats. Independents are somewhat in the middle, with 44% believing that U.S. efforts usually end up making things worse. This indicates a stark divide in perception between the two major parties.\n\nIn `image4`, we see a breakdown of the same sentiment, showing that the majority of Republicans and Democrats have become increasingly critical of U.S. efforts to solve problems globally, with the percentage of those who think such efforts usually end up making things worse increasing over time. For instance, in December 2015, 58% of Republicans and 34% of Democrats held this view, a trend that has continued since 2009.\n\nMoreover, the image `image1` provides a visual representation of these sentiments, with a clear majority of Democrats (66%) and a substantial portion of Independents (64%) believing that U.S. efforts to solve global problems would make things worse without them. In contrast, a smaller but still significant number of Republicans (26%) hold this view.\n\nThese trends are further reinforced by the data in `image6`, which shows that both Republicans and Democrats generally believe that the government is not doing enough to combat Islamic extremism both around the world and in the U.S., with the percentages being 82% and 83% respectively for Republicans and Democrats. However, Independents are more divided, with 61% believing the government is not doing enough.\n\nThe graphs in `image7` provide additional insight into the levels of concern about Islamic extremism, showing that a majority of Americans across all political affiliations are concerned about it, although there is a slight difference in the intensity of concern. The data indicates that 62% of Republicans and 62% of Democrats are very or somewhat concerned about Islamic extremism in the U.S. and around the world, while Independents are slightly less concerned at 53% and 49% respectively.\n\nIn summary, Democrats and Republicans tend to view U.S. involvement in solving global problems more negatively than Independents, with Democrats being the most critical. This perception is consistent across various issues, including the threat of terrorism and the effectiveness of government actions against Islamic extremism. The data also suggests that both Republicans and Democrats are increasingly skeptical of U.S. efforts to address global issues, though the reasons for this skepticism may differ between the two parties. ![The majority of Democrats and Republicans believe that U.S. efforts to solve global problems would make things worse without them](image5)"}

The energy efficiency of ICE vehicles is relatively low, with much of the energy from the fuel being lost as heat during the combustion process. In contrast, electric vehicles convert electrical energy into mechanical energy with higher efficiency.\n\nFrom the provided data, we can see that the energy efficiency from well-to-tank and tank-to-wheels for hydrogen fuel cell vehicles (FCVs) and battery electric vehicles (BEVs) varies. For instance, in image5, the well-to-tank efficiency for hydrogen fuel cell vehicles is around 80%, while for conventional vehicles it is around 16%. This indicates that FCVs and BEVs have a higher efficiency in converting energy from the source to the wheels, reducing the amount of energy wasted.\n\nHowever, the efficiency at the tank-to-wheels stage is also important. Image7 provides a breakdown of various fuels and their associated emissions per kilometer. For electric vehicles, the emissions from electricity generation depend on the source of the electricity. If the electricity is generated from renewable sources, the overall emissions and thus the efficiency are higher. On the other hand, if the electricity comes from fossil fuels, the efficiency is lower.\n\nIn conclusion, the overall energy efficiency from source to wheel for electric vehicles is generally higher than that of internal combustion engine vehicles, particularly when the electricity is sourced from renewable resources.

The shift towards streaming is evident in `image1` and `image5`, where streaming's share of total activity rose from 57% to 82% between 2014 and 2015. Moreover, the rise in popularity of streaming is reflected in the increased engagement with music, such as the higher likelihood of posting about live music and the increased number of tweets about music, especially for shows like \"Empire\" [6][8].\n\nTherefore, the market share of streaming experienced a significant increase from 2014 to 2015, outpacing the decline in physical album sales and solidifying its position as the leading format in the music business."}

For instance, the results in image2 and image3 show substantial gains in BLEU scores when pre-trained embeddings are applied. Specifically, for the low-resource language pairs such as Greek-Latin (GL-EN) and Azerbaijani-English (AZ-EN), pre-training yields notable improvements, with GL-EN achieving a gain of up to 11 BLEU points [1]. Similarly, the PT-EN (Portuguese-English) pair, which has a larger dataset, also benefits from pre-training, though the improvement is smaller [10].\n\n![BLEU score improvements](image1) illustrates the effect of pre-training on different language pairs, where the increase in BLEU scores is evident. The chart clearly shows that pre-training helps in improving the translation quality across various language pairs, with the largest gains observed in the most challenging pairs.\n\nMoreover, the results in image4 further confirm that aligning the word embeddings during pre-training can lead to even greater improvements in BLEU scores, especially for low-resource language pairs. For example, the GL-EN pair sees a significant increase in BLEU score when pre-training is applied and the embeddings are aligned [10].\n\nIn summary, pre-training consistently boosts the BLEU scores for different language pairs, with the magnitude of the improvement varying depending on the availability of training data and the similarity between the source and target languages."}

Specifically, the table in [9] contrasts the performance of the COMET-RANK model when it uses only the reference with the version that includes both the reference and source.

When the number of demonstration samples increases from 1 to 5, there is a noticeable improvement in the Micro-F1 score, but further increases beyond 5 do not yield substantial gains. Image1 also highlights that incorporating logical constraints into the LLM instructions provides a consistent improvement, particularly when the number of demonstrations is lower. For instance, using 5 demonstrations with logical constraints yields a Micro-F1 score of \\(25.7\\%\\), which surpasses the score obtained with 10 demonstrations without logical constraints (\\(24.5\\%\\)).\n\nAdditionally, as detailed in text quote [9], the experiments conducted with different numbers of demonstration samples (\\(\\{1,5,10,20\\}\\)) on the MAVEN-ERE dataset demonstrate that the performance gain from logical constraints is more pronounced with fewer demonstrations. This finding suggests that the relevance and quality of the logical constraints provided alongside a smaller set of demonstrations are crucial for enhancing the model's performance.\n\nIn summary, the number of demonstration samples affects the Micro-F1 performance in the MAVEN-ERE and CTB datasets with and without logical constraints. Incorporating logical constraints is particularly beneficial when the number of demonstrations is lower, leading to better performance outcomes.

Image Quote [6] shows that among the five types of errors, more than 90% occur during the reasoning step, with reasoning errors and math errors being the major loss buckets. This indicates that the primary challenge lies in the reasoning process rather than in abstracting the problem or retrieving facts.\n\nMoreover, Text Quote [11] mentions that Step-Back Prompting with RAG (Step-Back + RAG) can fix 39.9% of the predictions where the baseline prediction is wrong, while causing 5.6% errors. It also fixes 21.6% of errors coming from RAG, introducing only 6.3% of new errors. This suggests that Step-Back Prompting is effective in correcting reasoning errors and errors from RAG without significantly introducing new errors.\n\nFor instance, in the context of TimeQA, Step-Back Prompting with RAG improves accuracy compared to the baseline and RAG alone. Image Quote [7] provides an error example of Step-Back Prompting on MMLU high-school Physics, showing that the model can correctly identify the cause of the velocity difference but makes an error in the final reasoning step. This aligns with the identification of reasoning errors as the dominant issue.\n\nIn summary, the main error types in Step-Back Prompting on TimeQA are primarily reasoning errors and math errors, which make up over 90% of the total errors. Step-Back Prompting with RAG effectively addresses these issues while maintaining a relatively low introduction of new errors. \n\n![Step-Back Prompting is effective in correcting reasoning errors and errors from RAG without significantly introducing new errors.](image11)"}

These components include a multimodal retriever, an inference pipeline, and a ranking prompt. Let's delve into each component with the help of the provided quotes and images.\n\nFirstly, the **multimodal retriever** is responsible for querying a large multimodal external memory or database to find information relevant to the input query or context. As illustrated in **image1**, the retriever creates and stores multimodal embeddings, focusing on optimizing retrieval speed through index construction techniques such as the Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW) algorithm. This algorithm reduces the dimensionality of feature vectors, enhancing the speed of the retrieval process (quote [7]).\n\nSecondly, the **inference pipeline** based on the multimodal retriever involves the following steps: after the retrieval phase, the retrieved category labels along with image embeddings are integrated and sent to the MLLMs through a ranking prompt. The MLLMs then combine the internal knowledge with the retrieved information to make the final prediction of the image category. This process is depicted in **image2**, which compares the performance of different methods including CLIP, RegionCLIP, and RAR (Qwen-VL). The RAR method shows a significant improvement in performance across various datasets (quote [8]).\n\nLastly, the **ranking prompt** serves to merge the input image with the category information retrieved from memory, guiding the MLLMs to rank the retrieved candidate object categories based on similarity. An example of a ranking prompt is shown in **image6**, where categories are sorted from highest to lowest confidence. This helps in achieving a more accurate and contextually aware classification prediction (quote [2]).\n\nIn conclusion, the RAR pipeline effectively leverages the strengths of multimodal retrievers and MLLMs to enhance few-shot and zero-shot perception tasks, ensuring high precision and flexibility in visual recognition."}

The graph illustrates the micro-F1 scores before and after LLM reranking for different confidence levels.

These external feedback mechanisms can take various forms, such as external knowledge sources, tools, or even other trained models.\n\nFor instance, the image shows a process where the language model generates an output, and then a critic model or another tool evaluates this output. The evaluation provides specific feedback, which guides the refinement process. This external input allows for more nuanced and accurate corrections, as it can capture details that might be overlooked by the model alone. The refined output is then further improved through iterative processes, ensuring that the final output is more accurate and reliable.\n\nThis approach is particularly useful in tasks where the model's outputs need to be highly accurate and aligned with real-world facts or expert opinions.

The key difference lies in how they navigate and select nodes from the tree.\n\nIn Tree Traversal Retrieval, the model starts by selecting the top-k most relevant root nodes based on their cosine similarity to the query embedding. It then moves to the next layer, considering the children of the selected nodes and repeating the selection process. This layer-by-layer approach allows the model to gradually focus on finer details as it descends through the lower layers of the tree. The algorithm's steps are outlined in the pseudocode provided in Appendix F, and as shown in image3, the tree traversal method involves pruning and selecting the most relevant nodes at each level. This method provides control over the specificity and breadth of the information retrieved, starting with a broad outlook and progressively focusing on finer details (see quote [9]).\n\nOn the other hand, Collapsed Tree Retrieval considers all nodes in the tree simultaneously, effectively flattening the multi-layered tree into a single layer. This method evaluates nodes collectively across all layers to find the most relevant ones, as depicted in image3. The key advantage of this approach is its simplicity and efficiency in searching for relevant information without the need to traverse the tree layer-by-layer. This is illustrated in Figure 2, where the collapsed tree approach brings all nodes onto the same level for comparison (see quote [10]).\n\n![Tree Traversal vs. Collapsed Tree Retrieval](image3)\n\nIn summary, Tree Traversal Retrieval takes a step-by-step, layer-wise approach to selecting relevant nodes, providing flexibility and control over the information retrieved. In contrast, Collapsed Tree Retrieval simplifies the process by evaluating all nodes simultaneously, making it faster and more efficient for retrieval tasks."}

This categorization ensures that the model is exposed to a wide range of tasks and scenarios, thereby enhancing its generalization and robustness.\n\nFor instance, the Visual Chat and Interleaved Text/Image Generation categories emphasize the importance of high-quality data collection. As mentioned in quote [4], Chameleon focuses on collecting very high-quality data using third-party vendors, ensuring that the model can handle mixed-modal inputs effectively. This is crucial for the model's ability to understand and generate interleaved text and images, which is a core capability of Chameleon.\n\nThe dataset also includes a significant number of samples for Image Generation (64.3K) and Interleaved Text/Image Generation (16.9K), as seen in image5. This indicates that Chameleon is well-equipped to handle tasks that require the integration of text and images, such as generating captions for images or creating mixed-modal documents. The model's architecture, as described in quote [9], is designed to handle mixed sequences of arbitrary interleaved textual and image content, making it suitable for full multimodal document modeling.\n\nMoreover, the safety data, which includes prompts that can potentially provoke the model to produce unsafe content, helps in aligning the model's behavior and ensuring its reliability in real-world applications. The safety data covers a wide variety of sensitive topics, as mentioned in quote [7], further reinforcing the model's robustness and safety features.\n\nIn summary, the supervised fine-tuning dataset statistics, particularly the inclusion of diverse and high-quality data for various tasks, directly informs Chameleon's inference strategy, enabling it to handle complex mixed-modal inputs and generate coherent and relevant outputs. This is evident from the model's performance in tasks like image captioning and visual question-answering, as highlighted in quote [8]."}

Let's break down these differences using the provided quotes and images.\n\nIterative Retrieval, as described in Image2, involves a structured index to process and retrieve data in a hierarchical manner. It may include summarizing sections of a document or lengthy PDF before performing a retrieval based on this summary. Subsequently, a secondary retrieval within the document refines the search, embodying the recursive nature of the process (Chunk 4).\n\nRecursive Retrieval, depicted in Image11, aims to enhance the search experience by gradually converging on the most pertinent information through a feedback loop. It uses techniques like chain-of-thought (CoT) to guide the retrieval process and refine the CoT with the obtained retrieval results (Chunk 11). This method is particularly useful in complex search scenarios where the user’s needs are not entirely clear from the outset or where the information sought is highly specialized or nuanced.\n\nAdaptive Retrieval, exemplified by Flare [24] and Self-RAG [25] in Chunk 12, enables LLMs to actively determine the optimal moments and content for retrieval. This approach provides a more flexible and dynamic control over the retrieval process, allowing the system to adapt to different scenarios and refine its queries and retrieval strategies based on the generated context.\n\n![Iterative, Recursive, and Adaptive Retrieval processes differ in their strategies to enhance retrieval and generation. Iterative retrieval involves hierarchical summarization and refinement, while recursive retrieval uses feedback loops and chain-of-thought to converge on relevant information. Adaptive retrieval dynamically adjusts retrieval based on generated context.](image2)\n\nTo summarize, the iterative process involves structured summarization and refinement, recursive retrieval uses feedback loops and chain-of-thought, and adaptive retrieval dynamically adjusts based on generated context. These differences highlight the unique strengths and applications of each retrieval method in an RAG system."}

Specifically, the model's performance improves when gold paragraphs are included, while the presence of weak or irrelevant distractors can degrade the model's accuracy.\n\nIn the open-domain setting, as seen in `image4`, the single-paragraph BERT model struggles to achieve high F1 scores when only 10 paragraphs are retrieved (`38.40 F1`), but this improves to `39.12 F1` when 500 paragraphs are considered.

According to [7], for sentiment analysis tasks, both CNN and LSTM compositional functions perform better than SWEM, highlighting the necessity of word-order information for accurately predicting sentiment orientations. This is because word-order can significantly alter the meaning of phrases, as illustrated by the contrast between \"not really good\" and \"really not good,\" where the latter conveys a stronger negative sentiment ([7]).\n\nFor instance, when analyzing the Yelp polarity dataset, the SWEM model's performance drops notably when the word order is shuffled in the training set, indicating that the model heavily relies on the original word order to capture the correct sentiment orientation ([9]). This finding is consistent with [12], which states that the performance of LSTM on the Yelp dataset with a shuffled training set is very close to SWEM, suggesting that the main difference lies in LSTM's ability to capture word-order features.\n\n![Word-order information is crucial for sentiment analysis as it helps in distinguishing between similar phrases with different meanings.](image3)\n\nIn contrast, SWEM, which operates without considering word-order, performs well on other tasks like document classification and natural language sequence matching, where word embeddings alone provide sufficient information ([5], [6]). This indicates that while word-order is essential for sentiment analysis, it might be less critical for tasks focused on topic prediction or entailment, where longer documents offer more context to disambiguate word meanings ([11]).\n\nOverall, the effectiveness of LSTM in sentiment analysis is strongly tied to its ability to capture and utilize word-order information, making it a powerful tool for tasks requiring nuanced understanding of text sequences."}

This breadth is crucial as it ensures that the benchmark encompasses a wide array of visual inputs and subject-specific knowledge, making it a more robust test for large multimodal models (LMMs).\n\nCompared to other benchmarks, MMMU offers a much wider scope. For instance, `image4` highlights that MMMU covers 30 different image types, whereas existing benchmarks like VQA and GQA focus primarily on common sense and simpler visual tasks. MMMU's extensive range of image types, including diagrams, tables, charts, chemical structures, photographs, paintings, geometric shapes, music sheets, medical images, and more, tests the perceptual capabilities of LMMs in a variety of contexts. This is evident from the detailed breakdown in `image1`, which shows the distribution across different categories.\n\nMoreover, MMMU emphasizes the need for expert-level reasoning, as seen in the example questions provided in `image7`. Unlike previous benchmarks that rely on common sense or simple physical reasoning, MMMU requires models to apply domain-specific knowledge and perform complex step-by-step reasoning. For example, a question in `image8` involves interpreting MRI images to determine the etiology of a finding, which necessitates both expert-level visual perception and domain-specific knowledge in clinical radiology.\n\nThe implications for evaluating LMMs using MMMU are significant. As `image2` demonstrates, the performance of models like GPT-4V and others varies widely across different disciplines and image types, indicating that models struggle with complex visual inputs and heavy reasoning requirements. This suggests that MMMU can serve as a more stringent test for LMMs, pushing them to improve in areas where they currently fall short.\n\nIn conclusion, MMMU's breadth and depth make it a more comprehensive benchmark for evaluating LMMs. It not only tests basic perceptual abilities but also requires models to apply expert-level domain knowledge and perform sophisticated reasoning, setting a higher standard for multimodal understanding and reasoning capabilities."}

For non-categorical slots, a two-way linear mapping is utilized to find text spans within the dialog context (quote [6]).

The model then proceeds through three main stages: Problem Formulation, Symbolic Reasoning, and Result Interpretation.\n\nDuring the **Problem Formulation** stage, an LLM translates the problem and its goal into a task-specific symbolic language. This translation involves identifying key entities, facts, and rules present in the problem statement, as illustrated in image3 where predicates and premises are defined to represent the problem [3].\n\nIn the **Symbolic Reasoning** stage, a deterministic symbolic solver performs inference on the symbolic formulation generated in the previous stage. This solver executes logical operations to derive a symbolic-represented answer. The symbolic solver ensures that the reasoning process is faithful and transparent, as mentioned in text quote [2].\n\nFinally, in the **Result Interpretation** stage, either an LLM or a rule-based system interprets the symbolic answer and translates it back into natural language. This ensures that the final output is comprehensible and aligned with the original problem statement.\n\nThis framework effectively offloads complex reasoning tasks from LLMs to more reliable symbolic solvers, thereby enhancing the accuracy and reliability of the solutions. The use of in-context learning and self-refinement further improves the model's ability to accurately formulate problems symbolically and interpret results [10].\n\nIn summary, LOGIC-LM solves a problem by first formulating the natural language problem into a symbolic representation, then using a deterministic symbolic solver to derive a solution, and finally interpreting the symbolic answer back into natural language."}

Specifically, MedHop has a higher number of candidates and documents per sample compared to WikiHop.\n\nFor WikiHop, the average number of candidates per sample is 19.8, with a median of 14. Similarly, the average number of documents per sample is 13.7, with a median of 11. The average number of tokens per document is 91. These figures indicate that the WikiHop dataset is relatively smaller in terms of the number of samples and documents.\n\nIn contrast, for MedHop, the average number of candidates per sample is 8.9, with a median of 9. The average number of documents per sample is significantly higher at 836.4, with a median of 29. The average number of tokens per document is 253.9, with a median of 264. This suggests that MedHop contains much more extensive and complex information, leading to a larger number of documents and tokens per sample.\n\nTo visualize these differences, consider the following statistics summarized in image3:\n```markdown\nWIKIHOP 43,738 5,129 2,451 51,318\nMEDHop 1,620 342 546 2,508\n```\nHere, WIKIHOP has approximately 43,738 samples, 5,129 unique candidates, 2,451 unique documents, and 51,318 unique document paths.

Specifically, word-level embeddings capture semantic and syntactic information about words, while character-level embeddings provide information at the subword level, such as morphological variations and capitalization patterns [6].\n\nFor instance, the bilingual word embeddings (BWE) method projects word embeddings into a shared space, which helps in finding translations and aligning word representations across languages [5]. However, relying solely on word embeddings may lead to reduced tagging accuracy because character-level information is lost, making it difficult to capture nuances in surface forms and morphological variations [11].\n\nThe model architecture, as depicted in image3, includes a character-level bi-LSTM (Char Bi-LSTM) that processes character sequences to produce character-level embeddings. These embeddings are then concatenated with word embeddings to form a comprehensive representation for each word [6]. This combined representation allows the model to benefit from both the high-level semantic information provided by word embeddings and the low-level structural information offered by character embeddings.\n\nIn summary, the model uses both word-level and character-level embeddings as inputs to effectively capture a wide range of linguistic features, thereby improving its performance in tasks such as named entity recognition (NER) across different languages."}

Specifically, it involves two main operations: cropping and blurring (see image8). The cropping operation focuses on isolating the relevant object regions from the image, which helps the model to concentrate on the specific object rather than the entire image (image8a). Meanwhile, the blurring technique is applied to the non-target areas surrounding the objects of interest (image8b). This strategy ensures that the model's attention is directed towards the relevant parts of the image, making it easier to identify and classify the objects correctly (image8).\n\nThis approach is particularly effective in object detection datasets, where objects vary in size and position within the image. By employing blurring on the non-target areas, the system can maintain sufficient context information while keeping the foreground objects prominent (image8b). This balance is critical for improving the model's performance in recognizing objects of different scales and positions (image8).\n\nAs illustrated in the provided diagram, the combination of these pre-processing steps (cropping and blurring) significantly enhances the zero-shot recognition system's ability to handle diverse and complex visual inputs. This is evidenced by the improved classification accuracy observed in various datasets, including the LVIS dataset (Fig. 11 and Table 11), where blurring and adaptive crop scales were found to be effective techniques (quote [7]).\n\nIn conclusion, the pre-processing step contributes to the zero-shot recognition system by focusing the model's attention on the relevant object regions and maintaining the necessary context, thus improving the overall accuracy of the system."}

One significant development was the introduction of word embeddings, which revolutionized the way researchers approached the detection of semantic shifts. As mentioned in [5], the availability of large corpora and advancements in computational semantics led to a surge in research initiatives aimed at capturing these shifts in a data-driven manner. A pivotal work in this context is the one by Kim et al. (2014), who were among the first to apply prediction-based word embedding models to trace diachronic semantic shifts. They used incremental updates and Continuous Skipgram with negative sampling (SGNS), which was further validated by Hamilton et al. (2016a) who demonstrated the superiority of SGNS over explicit PPMI-based distributional models.\n\nAnother notable milestone was the publication of Kulkarni et al. (2015), where they introduced statistically significant detection of linguistic change. They utilized diverse datasets including Amazon Movie Reviews and Twitter data, indicating the robustness of computational methods for detecting semantic shifts even in shorter time spans. Furthermore, the work by Kutuzov et al. (2017b) on modeling cultural shifts using the yearly slices of the English Gigaword corpus was another important contribution, particularly in the context of predicting events like armed conflicts.\n\nThe timeline of these developments is clearly illustrated in Figure 1 (image1), showing the progression from 2016 to 2017, highlighting the key contributions and advancements in the field during this period.\n\n![2017](image1)\n\nIn conclusion, from 2010 to 2017, the field saw significant progress in tracing diachronic semantic shifts, driven by the adoption of advanced word embedding techniques and the use of diverse and rich corpora."}

This indicates that the citation-based pretraining objective in SPECTER is more effective than fine-tuning on task-specific signals for generating document-level embeddings.\n\nIn conclusion, the inclusion of certain features like the abstract and venues improves the performance of SPECTER, while the addition of authors or the use of BERT-Large instead of SciBERT leads to a decline in performance. This underscores the importance of carefully selecting and integrating features to optimize the model's effectiveness across different tasks."}

Pairwise comparison involves judges selecting the response that better addresses the question in terms of contextual appropriateness and accuracy [1].\n\n![Entity-Centric Answers](image7) illustrates how SnapNTell excels in providing entity-centric, knowledgeable answers compared to other models. For instance, when asked \"Where is the attraction located?\", the ground truth answer specifies that Abel Tasman National Park is located at the northern tip of the South Island of New Zealand, whereas other models provide less accurate or unrelated responses [1].\n\n[6] The architecture of SnapNTell, as shown in Figure 3, includes retrieval augmentation and entity-centric knowledge-based answer generation. First, the system retrieves relevant information about the entity in the image from knowledge sources. This information, along with the input question, is then processed through a word embedding layer, where text and image embeddings are merged. Finally, the combined information is fed into a large language model (LLM) to generate a knowledgeable answer [11].\n\n![Model Architecture](image6) provides a visual representation of the SnapNTell model architecture. It starts with retrieval augmentation to source relevant information about the entity in the image, which is then combined with the question and processed through a word embedding layer before being fed into the LLM [11].\n\nFrom these evaluations, it is evident that SnapNTell stands out in generating accurate and contextually appropriate responses. For example, when asked about the location of Abel Tasman National Park, SnapNTell correctly identifies it as being located in the northern tip of the South Island of New Zealand, whereas other models provide incorrect or less specific answers [1].\n\nIn conclusion, SnapNTell demonstrates superior performance in knowledge-driven VQA tasks by effectively integrating image data, questions, and retrieved information to generate precise and contextually rich answers."}

However, I will focus on the relevant parts of the quotes that discuss the number of questions needed to verify a claim.\n\nFrom the text quotes, we can see that the process of verifying a claim involves asking a series of questions. For instance, in quote [3], the next question to know the answer to after confirming that Superdrag is a rock band is whether Collective Soul is a rock band. Similarly, in quote [12], after confirming that Superdrag is a rock band, the next question is whether Collective Soul is a rock band, and this allows us to conclude the claim is true.\n\nIn the image quotes, particularly image1, the process of verifying the claim \"Lars Onsager won the Nobel prize when he was 30 years old\" involves asking two questions: the year Lars Onsager won the Nobel prize and the year he was born. This leads to the conclusion that the claim is false because Lars Onsager was 65 years old when he won the Nobel prize, not 30.\n\n![The process involves asking a series of questions to verify a claim.](image1)\n\nFrom the images, we can see that the QACHECK system visualizes the question-answering guided reasoning process, where the system generates questions to verify the claim about sunlight reaching the deepest part of the Black Sea. The system asks two questions: the greatest depth of the Black Sea and how far sunlight can penetrate water. Based on the answers, the claim is evaluated as false because the depth of the Black Sea is greater than the depth sunlight can penetrate.\n\n![The QACHECK system visualizes the question-answering guided reasoning process.](image2)\n\nThe number of blue-colored numbers in the example figure of question-guided reasoning is not explicitly mentioned in any of the provided quotes. However, based on the pattern observed in the text and image quotes, the number of questions needed to verify a claim typically ranges from one to several, depending on the complexity of the claim.\n\nTherefore, the number of blue-colored numbers mentioned in the example figure of question-guided reasoning is **not specified** in the provided quotes, but the process generally involves asking a series of questions to verify a claim."}

As illustrated in image6, MMMU features 11.5K questions, spanning 30 diverse subjects and 183 subfields, which is significantly larger in scale and breadth than other benchmarks like VQA, GQA, and SEED. Additionally, it includes a mix of disciplines such as Art & Design, Business, Science, Health & Medicine, Humanities & Social Sciences, and Technology & Engineering, making it more versatile and complex.\n\nMoreover, the MMMU benchmark emphasizes the need for models to handle diverse image types, from advertisements and diagrams to medical images and chemical structures, as shown in image1. This variety tests the perceptual capabilities of models and their ability to integrate visual and textual information effectively. Image4 further highlights the interleaved nature of text and images in questions, requiring models to perform complex reasoning and recall deep subject knowledge.\n\nIn terms of reasoning depth, the MMMU benchmark demands more than just basic visual perception; it requires models to apply expert-level reasoning, as exemplified in the example question involving a breast MRI screening (see image 1, 2, and 3). This contrasts with previous benchmarks that primarily focus on common sense and simple physical or temporal reasoning, as indicated in image7.\n\nIn summary, the MMMU benchmark is more extensive and complex in terms of dataset size, image types, and reasoning depth compared to other benchmarks, making it a more rigorous test for multimodal models. ![MMMU's Challenges](image4)"}

The Consulting department offers a broad array of services such as strategic and operational advice, digital transformation, and financial advisory services, and it supports a wide range of clients from the public and private sectors. This is evidenced by quote [9], which states, \"In Consulting, you'll get to work on a variety of clients, bringing fresh insights to the problems facing the public and private sector, as we help them optimise, transform and improve their business models and deliver better products and services.\"\n\nOn the other hand, the Deals department focuses on supporting clients in making key commercial and strategic valuation decisions, particularly in areas like mergers, acquisitions, and disposals. Quote [1] highlights this, noting, \"Our team works alongside clients to support them in making key commercial and strategic valuation decisions on business deals or restructuring, disputes, tax regulation and financial reporting.\"\n\nWhen it comes to the geographical presence and employee distribution, we can see from quote [12] that PwC operates in 155 countries and has over 284,000 employees. This suggests a significant scale and global reach, which is more prominently reflected in the Consulting department. Quote [8] further emphasizes this by stating, \"We help clients navigate any major financial event, from cross-border mergers and acquisitions, to economic crime investigations, insolvency and other business crises, which means you'll enjoy a breadth of experience and technology.\" This indicates that the Consulting department is heavily involved in cross-border activities.\n\nIn contrast, while Deals also operates internationally, its specific focus on mergers, acquisitions, and disposals may mean a more concentrated effort in certain regions rather than a globally distributed workforce.

For instance, the input low voltage (except for the EA pin) for the 8751H and 8751H-8 is specified as \\(-0.5\\) V to \\(0.8\\) V, as shown in the parameter table of `image1`. This range is consistent across the 8751H and 8751H-8 devices, indicating that the input sensitivity is relatively low, which is typical for microcontrollers designed to operate in environments with varying power supply voltages.\n\nOn the other hand, the output high voltage for the 8751H and 8751H-8 in external bus mode is specified as \\(2.4\\) V, while the output low voltage for these devices is \\(0.45\\) V, as illustrated in `image1`. These values suggest that the 8751H and 8751H-8 can handle significant voltage levels, which is crucial for reliable communication in bus-oriented systems.\n\nComparatively, the 8751BH and 8752BH have different specifications. The input high voltage to the EA pin for these devices is \\(4.5\\) V to \\(5.5\\) V, as seen in `image1`. Additionally, the output low voltage for these devices is \\(0.45\\) V, similar to the 8751H and 8751H-8, but the output high voltage is also \\(2.4\\) V, as detailed in `image1`.\n\nThe oscillator frequency for the 8751H and 8751H-8 is specified as \\(3.5\\) MHz to \\(12\\) MHz, as depicted in `image4`. The 8751BH and 8752BH have the same oscillator frequency range, indicating that these models share similar performance characteristics in terms of clock speed.\n\n`image2` provides more specific timing parameters for the 8751H and 8751H-8, showing that the ALE pulse width and other critical timing intervals are within certain ranges. For example, the ALE pulse width for the 8751H is \\(183\\) ns to \\(4TCLCL—150\\) ns, whereas for the 8751BH and 8752BH, it is \\(233\\) ns to \\(215\\) ns, as shown in `image5`.\n\nIn summary, the 8751H and 8751H-8 share many similar voltage and timing specifications, with some differences in input and output voltage ranges and the exact timing intervals.

In the context of the CTBT training program, the high number of clicks on lecture videos and the large number of registered participants can be seen as similar activities, indicating a strong engagement and interest in the training materials. Similarly, in the weekend activities data, watching films and fitness are also grouped together, showing that these activities are popular and attract significant time investment.\n\nThe Law of Proximity states that objects that are visually close together are perceived as being more closely related. For the CTBT training program, the proximity of registered participants and the number of countries where lectures were delivered suggests a widespread and connected network of participants. In the weekend activities data, the proximity of shopping and fitness activities indicates that these are often pursued together, perhaps due to their shared nature as leisure activities.\n\n![CTBT Training Program Participation](image2) shows a clear global reach and high engagement in the training program, while ![Weekend Activities](image4) reveals a preference for certain activities on weekends.

As we move through each level, the value derived from data increases, leading to actionable insights and ultimately, business impact.\n\nFirstly, data is collected and managed, ensuring it is of high quality and accessible to those who need it. This aligns with the concept of data quality and data management discussed in [4]. Once data is available, it undergoes analysis, which can range from descriptive analysis (looking at what happened) to predictive modeling (forecasting what might happen next). This progression is illustrated in the image of the analytics value chain, showing the transformation from data to insights and then to actions [5].\n\n![](image5) The analytics value chain illustrates the journey from raw data to impactful decisions.\n\nAs the data moves through the analytics value chain, it is analyzed and transformed into meaningful insights. These insights are then used to make informed decisions, which can lead to specific actions that drive business impact. The importance of this process is highlighted in quote [4], where it states that \"Analytics is about impact,\" meaning that without actionable outcomes, the analysis has no real value.\n\nMoreover, the role of strong data leadership is crucial in supporting the analytics organization. Data leaders, as mentioned in [6], actively promote the strategic importance of data, enabling the analytics team to perform optimally and contribute effectively to the business. This leadership ensures that there is a clear career path for analysts, fostering a data-driven culture where managers and business units rely on data insights to make informed decisions [8].\n\nThe image of the analytics value chain further reinforces this idea by depicting the various stages from data collection to decision-making and action.

The Levels of Analytics, shown in quotes [10] and [11], further elaborate on the different types of analytical processes involved in this transformation.\n\nThe Levels of Analytics, depicted in image1, cover descriptive, diagnostic, predictive, and prescriptive analytics. Descriptive analytics (What happened?) provides a snapshot of past events, while diagnostic analytics (Why did it happen?) seeks to understand the reasons behind those events. Predictive analytics (What will happen next?) uses historical data to forecast future trends, and prescriptive analytics (What actions are needed?) suggests specific steps to take based on those forecasts.\n\nFor instance, when a company collects data (step 1 in the Analytics Value Chain), it moves through the descriptive level, where reports, dashboards, and alerts provide a backward-looking view of what has occurred (image2). Moving into the diagnostic phase, analysts drill down into the data to find patterns and root causes (image3). This leads to the predictive phase, where statistical models and forecasting techniques help anticipate future trends (image4 and image5).\n\nOnce predictions are made, the prescriptive phase kicks in, suggesting actions to take based on these insights. For example, an organization might use A/B testing (quote [8]) to determine the most effective course of action. This entire process culminates in making decisions (quote [9]) that drive real-world impact, as seen in the final step of the Analytics Value Chain.\n\nIn summary, the Analytics Value Chain provides a structured framework for transforming raw data into actionable insights, while the Levels of Analytics offer a deeper understanding of the types of analyses required at each stage.

This shift suggests that organizations are increasingly focusing on both internal and external threats.\n\nLooking ahead, the future trends in security tools, as shown in the image `![Future Security Tools Adoption](image4)`, indicate a continued emphasis on identity management, bar code technology, speech recognition, and other innovative technologies. These tools are expected to enhance security, improve operational efficiency, and reduce medical errors. Specifically, single sign-on/identity management and automated alerts to clinicians are projected to see significant growth in adoption rates.\n\nIn summary, the perception of security concerns has shifted from primarily internal breaches to include external threats and unauthorized data usage, while the implementation of security tools has seen substantial growth, particularly in areas like firewalls, user access controls, and data encryption. Future trends suggest a continued focus on advanced security tools and technologies to address evolving security challenges."}

The image3 clearly illustrates the distribution of time spent on different activities, showing that in 2005, people spent 20% of their time watching films, while in 2010, this percentage dropped to 10%. On the other hand, the time allocated to fitness activities increased from 55% in 2005 to 60% in 2010.\n\n![Time spent on weekends](image3)\n\nThis trend suggests a shift towards a more health-conscious lifestyle, where people might have started valuing physical fitness more than leisure activities like watching films. The increase in time spent on fitness could indicate a growing awareness and prioritization of health and wellness, possibly due to increased health education, improved access to fitness facilities, or a broader cultural emphasis on maintaining a healthy lifestyle.\n\nFurthermore, the Gestalt principles of visual perception can help us understand how these patterns are perceived and interpreted. For instance, the principle of similarity (principle [6]) explains why similar activities, such as the bars representing different percentages, are grouped together and perceived as distinct categories. Similarly, the principle of proximity (principle [12]) makes it easier to recognize patterns and trends over time, as the bars for each year are placed closely together, making it straightforward to compare the data visually.\n\nOverall, the data and the principles of Gestalt psychology together suggest a significant shift in lifestyle trends towards a greater focus on fitness and well-being."}

In his experiments, Mendel crossed true-breeding parents with contrasting traits (e.g., purple flowers and white flowers), resulting in an F1 generation where all offspring exhibited the dominant trait (purple flowers). This observation led to the conclusion that the recessive trait (white flowers) was masked in the F1 generation but could reappear in the F2 generation.\n\n![](image4) This diagram illustrates the cross between true-breeding parents with purple and white flowers, leading to the F1 generation consisting entirely of purple-flowered plants. When these F1 plants self-pollinate, they produce the F2 generation, which exhibits a phenotypic ratio of 3 purple flowers to 1 white flower.\n\n![](image1) The Punnett square in this image further clarifies the genetic makeup of the F2 generation. Each F1 plant is heterozygous (Pp), and when they self-pollinate, the possible gametes are P and p. The resulting genotypes in the F2 generation include PP (purple), Pp (purple), and pp (white). This results in a genotypic ratio of 1 PP : 2 Pp : 1 pp, which corresponds to the observed phenotypic ratio of 3 purple : 1 white.\n\nThis pattern of inheritance can be explained by the principle of segregation, which states that each individual has two alleles for each trait, and during gamete formation, these alleles separate such that each gamete receives only one allele. The law of independent assortment further explains how different traits are inherited independently of one another, contributing to the diverse phenotypes observed in the F2 generation.\n\nThus, Mendelian inheritance accounts for the 3:1 phenotypic ratio and the 1:2:1 genotypic ratio in the F2 generation of pea plants."}

This is due to the segregation of alleles from the parents, resulting in three genotypes: PP (homozygous dominant), Pp (heterozygous), and pp (homozygous recessive). The corresponding phenotypes for these genotypes are purple flowers, purple flowers, and white flowers, respectively.\n\n![](image3)\n\nAs shown in image3, the genotypic ratio in the F2 generation is 1 PP : 2 Pp : 1 pp, which results in the phenotypic ratio of 3 purple flowers : 1 white flower.

When these gametes combine, they give rise to the observed phenotypic and genotypic ratios in the F2 generation.\n\nIn summary, the phenotypic ratio observed in the F2 generation of the plant cross is 3:1 (purple flowers : white flowers), while the genotypic ratio is 1:2:1 (PP : Pp : pp)."}

Quote [2] outlines several issues, including \"The wrong metrics-too much focus on reach and not enough on engagement\" and \"No 360-degree view-marketers and agencies are looking at tactical metrics in isolation and not looking at a complete 360-degree dashboard/picture of ALL their activities and importantly customer behavior.\" These points highlight the need for a more comprehensive and customer-focused approach rather than just focusing on traditional metrics like reach and frequency.\n\n![Management and Cultural Issues](image4)\n![Data and Technology Challenges](image5)\n![Focus on Wrong Metrics](image6)\n\nIn conclusion, the major barriers preventing the adoption of an integrated customer management approach include management and cultural issues, data and technology challenges, and a focus on the wrong metrics. Addressing these barriers requires a holistic and customer-centric approach, breaking down silos, improving data management, and focusing on actionable insights."}

Additionally, the part must be running with a 4 to 6 MHz oscillator since the internal bus is used to transfer address and program data to appropriate internal registers.\n\nThe programming sequence involves setting the appropriate pins and signals to specific states. For instance, during programming, Port 1 and pins P2.0-P2.4 are used to apply the address of the E PROM location to be programmed, while Port 0 is used to apply the code byte to be programmed into that location. Other relevant pins, such as RST, PSEN, and \\(\\overline{{\\mathsf{E A}}}/\\mathsf{v}_{\\mathsf{P P}}\\), should be held at the \"Program\" levels indicated in Table 3.\n\nFor the lock bits specifically, the setup and procedure are the same as for normal EPROM programming, with the exception that P2.6 must be held at a logic high. This ensures that the lock features are programmed correctly. During this process, Port 0, Port 1, and pins P2.0-P2.3 can be in any state, but the other pins should be held at the \"Security\" levels indicated in Table 3.

The conversion rates at each stage are as follows:\n\n- Lead to MQL: 52.07%\n- MQL to SAL: 1.50%\n- SAL to SQL: 83.08%\n- SQL to SWO: 6.67%\n\nThese percentages represent the effectiveness of the marketing and sales processes in moving leads through the funnel. For instance, the 52.07% conversion rate from Lead to MQL indicates that out of every 100 leads, approximately 52 would be considered marketing-qualified.\n\nNow, let's look at the average conversion rates from the marketing diagnostics provided in image4. This chart shows the conversion ratios for various lead sources, with the overall average conversion rate being 51.63%. Additionally, the average time to transition between stages varies, with Website having the highest conversion rate at 41.77% and the shortest time at 24 days, while Sponsorship has the lowest conversion rate at 5.44% and the longest time at 70 days.\n\nComparing these two sets of data, we can observe that the lead funnel progression provides specific conversion rates for each stage, which can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of the marketing and sales strategies at those particular points. The marketing diagnostics, on the other hand, offer an overall average conversion rate and the time taken to move through each stage, which can help identify the efficiency of the entire funnel process.\n\nThe lead funnel progression highlights the specific conversion rates and can help pinpoint areas where improvements are needed, such as the low MQL to SAL conversion rate of 1.50%. The marketing diagnostics, with their average conversion rates, can give a broader understanding of the overall performance of the marketing efforts and the time taken to convert leads.\n\nTherefore, the conversion rates in the lead funnel progression are directly related to the average conversion rates provided in marketing diagnostics, as they both serve to evaluate the effectiveness of the marketing and sales processes but at different granularities. The funnel progression provides detailed insights into the stages of the customer journey, while the diagnostics offer a high-level overview of the entire process."}

This means that each additional hot dog consumed provides less satisfaction than the previous one. As shown in the graph, the utility from consuming hot dogs decreases significantly after a certain point. For instance, while the first few hot dogs provide positive utility, consuming more leads to a decline in satisfaction, eventually reaching negative utility (e.g., eating 65th and 66th hot dogs results in -45 and -50 utility, respectively). This principle highlights why diversifying choices is beneficial, as switching to another option when enjoyment diminishes can enhance overall satisfaction [2].\n\nIn a competitive context, however, the dynamics change. Here, the graph in image1 illustrates a different scenario. It depicts the utility curve for hot dogs, but in this case, the context is more about achieving a championship title. The utility curve starts positively but then sharply declines, showing that excessive consumption of hot dogs might not contribute to winning the championship. Instead, the focus on other factors, such as training and strategy, becomes crucial. This aligns with the idea that in competition, the cumulative effect of focus can be advantageous. Just like the violinists in image6, who show that consistent practice over years leads to better performance, competitive success often relies on dedicated focus and specialization rather than broad consumption [9].\n\n![Diminishing marginal utility in competitive context](image1)\n\nIn conclusion, while diminishing marginal utility suggests that diversification is beneficial in standard consumption scenarios, in competitive contexts, focused effort and specialization can lead to greater success and satisfaction.

This extended operating time provides students with more flexibility in their shopping schedules, especially during busy academic periods.\n\nIn contrast, off-campus supermarkets such as Lotus Supermarket, BHG Supermarket, and Carrefour have a standard operating time of 9:00am to 9:00pm on weekdays and weekends, as illustrated in image4. This means that students need to plan their shopping trips around these hours, which might be challenging if they have early morning classes or late-night study sessions.\n\nFor instance, the Zhaolanyuan Market operates from 8:30am to 7:00pm daily, while the West Market is open from 8:00am to 7:00pm, as depicted in image7. These hours align more closely with traditional daytime activities, making them less convenient for students who need to shop after their classes or during evening hours.\n\n![On-campus vs Off-campus Supermarkets Opening Hours](image4)\n\nTherefore, students living on campus have greater convenience and more flexible shopping options due to the extended operating hours of on-campus supermarkets.

As shown in the image `![minutes watched online](image2)`, there was a substantial rise in online video consumption, suggesting an increased engagement with digital content, which could include educational resources.\n\nMoreover, the image `![Segregacao Proximidade Semelhanca](image3)` represents the application of Gestalt principles, particularly the law of proximity and similarity. These principles explain how elements that are close to each other or share similarities are perceived as a group, which can influence how people categorize and understand information. In the context of educational participation, this means that the increasing availability of online educational content (like video lectures) and the ease of access to capital for entrepreneurship (as shown in `![CAPITAL AND POLICY](image1)`) can lead to a greater integration of digital learning into people's lives.\n\nFurthermore, the image `![Time spent on weekends](image6)` illustrates the detailed breakdown of how people spend their time on weekends. The significant increase in time spent watching films suggests a preference for leisure and entertainment, which might correlate with a growing interest in self-improvement and lifelong learning. This aligns with the training program statistics, indicating a strong focus on educating the next generation of experts (as seen in `![TRAIN THE NEXT GENERATION](image2)`).\n\nIn conclusion, the distribution of weekend activities shifted towards more screen-based activities like watching films, reflecting broader trends in global educational participation and the increasing importance of digital learning platforms."}

This deep reflection is crucial for understanding how needs exploration and elicitation methods can contribute to addressing stakeholder needs in agile project management. For instance, the image1 illustrates the initial scope exploration, which is an essential part of needs exploration. It helps in defining what needs to be addressed and what can be deferred or excluded from the project.\n\nIn agile project management, the goal is to quickly and iteratively develop a product that meets stakeholder needs. The image2 provides a detailed view of the process, showing how different types of modeling strategies, such as domain modeling, usage modeling, and process modeling, can be used to explore and define these needs. These models serve as a common understanding among all stakeholders and help in refining the requirements throughout the project lifecycle.\n\nEliciting requirements from distributed stakeholders is another critical aspect of agile project management, especially when stakeholders are geographically dispersed [8]. Image3, which explores initial scope, highlights informal and formal modeling sessions, interviews, and other techniques that can be used to gather and validate requirements. These methods ensure that all stakeholders' needs are considered and that the project remains aligned with their expectations.\n\nThe image4 further emphasizes the importance of active stakeholder participation during the project. It shows various activities like just-in-time model storming and all-hands demos, which are crucial for ensuring that stakeholders remain engaged and informed about the progress of the project. This continuous engagement helps in validating the assumptions made during the requirements gathering phase and ensures that the final product meets the stakeholders' needs.\n\nIn summary, the processes of needs exploration and elicitation methods play a vital role in addressing stakeholder needs in agile project management. They involve defining the initial scope, using various modeling strategies to explore requirements, and actively involving stakeholders in the development process. By doing so, agile teams can create products that truly meet the needs of all stakeholders.\n\n![Needs exploration and stakeholder engagement are key in agile project management](image3)"}

This indicates that the number of rural users grew over the two-year span.\n\nFurthermore, the text quotes highlight the use of various measurement tools such as Twitter Analytics, Followerwonk, and Buffer. For instance, [1] mentions Twitter Analytics Follower, while [10] refers to Twitter Measurement Tools. These tools help in understanding follower growth and engagement metrics.\n\nThe image `image3` provides insight into the engagement metrics for Twitter, including Followers, Tweet Reach, Mentions, Retweets, Likes, and more. Similarly, `image5` offers a comparable view for Facebook, showing Engagement metrics like Pages Likes, Post Reach, Reactions, Shares, Comments, Post Clicks, Video Views, and Referral Traffic.\n\nConsidering the growth in rural users and the consistent use of measurement tools like Twitter Analytics, it can be inferred that the percentage of users from rural locations was lower in 2013 compared to 2014, while the measurement tools were already being utilized by these users. Therefore, the year with a lower percentage of rural users is 2013.\n\n2013 shows a lower percentage of rural users on the platform."}

These settings allow for better control over how the camera captures light and focuses on subjects, thereby enhancing the overall quality of the photograph under different scenarios.\n\nFor instance, when using the **Pro Mode**, the **metering mode** can be adjusted to suit the lighting conditions. The metering mode determines how the camera measures light across the scene. The three main metering modes are:\n\n- **Matrix (Oratrix)**: This mode measures light across the entire frame and is ideal for shooting natural landscapes where the lighting is consistent across the scene ([image3](image3)).\n- **Center-weighted (Le Jspot)**: This mode focuses on light near the center of the screen, making it suitable for portraits where the subject is typically centered ([image5](image5)).\n- **Spot (Focuses on light from a specific region)**: This mode focuses on light from a specific region, such as a subject's eyes, which is useful for ensuring accurate exposure on the subject's face in complex lighting situations.\n\nSimilarly, the **focus mode** can also be adjusted to cater to different shooting scenarios. The focus modes available include:\n\n- **AF-S (Single)**: This mode is ideal for stationary subjects like landscapes or still life, where the subject does not move ([image4](image4)).\n- **AF-C (Continuous)**: This mode is designed for moving subjects, continuously tracking and focusing on them ([image4](image4)).\n- **MF (Manual)**: This mode allows the photographer to manually focus on the subject of interest, such as the subject's face, ensuring precise focus even in challenging lighting conditions.\n\nBy combining these settings, photographers can achieve optimal results in various scenarios. For example, when shooting a portrait in a dimly lit environment, the **center-weighted metering mode** ensures accurate exposure on the subject's face, while the **AF-S focus mode** keeps the subject in sharp focus.\n\nIn summary, the different metering modes and focus modes in Pro Mode enhance photography by providing flexibility and precision in capturing the desired image under various scenarios. This allows photographers to tailor their settings to best fit the specific needs of each shot."}

The first dataset, represented in `image4`, shows the conversion rates for various stages of the lead funnel progression. Specifically, it illustrates the MQL to SAL conversion rate as 83.08%, indicating that a significant portion of MQLs are successfully transitioning to SALs.\n\nAnother dataset, `image5`, provides the conversion ratios for different lead sources. For instance, the AppExchange has the highest conversion ratio at 50.88%, followed closely by the Website at 41.77%. However, the Trade Show and Webinar sources have notably lower conversion rates at 14.49% and 17.03%, respectively. The difference in conversion rates between these sources suggests that the quality and nature of leads generated from different channels can vary significantly.\n\nThe third dataset, `image6`, offers insights into the cost and velocity of lead generation and conversion. It highlights that the AppExchange has the highest conversion rate of 78%, while the Trade Show — Virtual has a lower conversion rate of 17%. This implies that the leads from the AppExchange are more likely to be converted into sales opportunities compared to those from the Trade Show — Virtual.\n\nLastly, `image7` provides a broader view of the lead qualification process, showing the percentage of leads moving from MQLs to SALs. It indicates that approximately 20% of MQLs become SALs, which aligns with the more granular data provided in `image4`.\n\nThe differences in conversion rates observed across these datasets suggest that the effectiveness of lead nurturing and the quality of leads generated from different sources play crucial roles. Higher conversion rates from certain sources like AppExchange and Website imply that these channels are more effective at generating high-quality leads that are closer to becoming sales opportunities. Conversely, lower conversion rates from sources such as Trade Show and Webinar may indicate that additional efforts are needed to improve the lead quality or nurture these leads further.\n\nIn conclusion, the varying conversion rates from MQLs to SALs across different datasets highlight the importance of understanding and optimizing the lead generation process for better sales outcomes."}
