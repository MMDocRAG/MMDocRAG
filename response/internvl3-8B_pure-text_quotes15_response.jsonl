According to the text quotes, a majority of Americans (85%) have heard or read about this concept, with 24% indicating they have heard or read \"a lot\" about it [7]. Among those who have heard a lot about this concept, 48% find it extremely realistic that machines might one day perform many human jobs [6]. However, when it comes to enthusiasm, only 22% of Americans are enthusiastic about the idea, compared to 72% who are worried [9]. This indicates a higher level of concern than excitement.\n\nThe image quotes provide visual data that align with these findings. `![{Americans' perceptions of automation realism and enthusiasm}](image4)` shows that 47% of Americans are \"somewhat\" enthusiastic and 25% are \"very\" worried about the concept, while 20% are \"not too\" worried and 6% are \"very\" enthusiastic.

According to the text quotes, there is a significant portion of the public that supports limiting the number of jobs businesses can replace with machines. For instance, nearly six-in-ten Americans (58%) feel there should indeed be limits on how many jobs businesses can replace with machines, while 41% believe businesses are justified in replacing humans with machines if they can receive better work at lower cost [7]. This indicates a balanced view where a majority leans towards regulation but acknowledges the potential benefits of automation.\n\nThe image quotes provide further insight into these opinions. Image2, a pie chart, shows that 58% of U.S. adults believe there should be limits on the number of jobs businesses can replace with machines, even if machines are better and cheaper, while 41% think businesses are justified in replacing human workers under those conditions [2]. This aligns with the text, reinforcing the idea that while some support the use of machines, there is a strong preference for limiting their impact on human employment.\n\nImage4, a bar graph, illustrates public opinion on three policies: limiting machines to dangerous or unhealthy jobs, government offering a guaranteed income, and a national service program. A majority strongly favor limiting machines to dangerous or unhealthy jobs (47%) and are supportive of a national service program (58%) and a guaranteed income (31%) [4]. This suggests that the public is particularly concerned about the ethical and safety implications of automation, favoring policies that ensure human safety and provide support for displaced workers.\n\nAdditionally, the text [6] and [9] highlight that the public is strongly supportive of limiting robots and computers to \"dangerous and dirty\" jobs and responds favorably to policies like universal basic income or national service programs for displaced workers. This indicates a preference for targeted use of automation rather than widespread replacement of human jobs.\n\nIn summary, the public is divided on the extent of machine use in the workforce but generally supports policies that limit their impact on human jobs, especially in dangerous or unhealthy environments, and provides support for safety measures and economic support for workers displaced by automation.\n\n![Support for limiting machines to dangerous jobs](image4)  \n![Support for policies on machine use](image2)  \n\nThe public is generally supportive of limiting the use of machines to dangerous and unhealthy jobs and is favorable toward policies such as universal basic income and national service programs for displaced workers."}

According to the text and image quotes, Republican voters have consistently favored a more conservative direction for their party, with a majority (60%) wanting the GOP to move in a conservative direction, as noted in quote [4]. This preference has remained relatively stable over recent years. The image2 chart illustrates this trend, showing that in November 2016, 60% of Republican voters preferred a more conservative stance, consistent with previous years. In contrast, Democratic voters have become more divided, with a notable increase in support for a more liberal direction, as indicated in quote [7]. The image3 chart supports this, showing that by November 2016, 49% of Democratic voters favored a more liberal direction, up from 38% in 2014 and 33% in 2008.\n\nThe reactions to the 2016 election outcomes also highlight partisan differences. Republican voters overwhelmingly expressed happiness (94%) with the GOP retaining congressional control, as shown in quote [8] and image5.

The data highlights that voters, regardless of their party affiliation, viewed the 2016 campaign as exceptionally negative, with a significant majority perceiving more mudslinging than in past elections. This perception is vividly illustrated in `![Increasing Mudslinging](image1)`, where the percentage of voters who felt there was more mudslinging surged to 92% in 2016, marking a stark increase from previous highs. This trend underscores a pervasive atmosphere of hostility and distrust, which likely contributed to the overall negative evaluations of the campaign.\n\nMoreover, voter opinions on the conduct of political entities were uniformly harsh. As shown in `![Entity Grading](image4)`, only a small fraction of voters gave high grades to Trump, Clinton, the Republican Party, and the Democratic Party, with the majority awarding failing grades. This indicates a lack of confidence and respect for the major figures and institutions involved in the election.

This trend is visually represented in `![Changes in perception of Islam encouraging violence by political affiliation](image1)`, where the red line (Republicans) rises from 33% in 2002 to 68% in 2015, indicating a growing belief that Islam encourages violence more than other religions. In contrast, the blue line (Democrats) decreases from 22% in 2002 to 30% in 2015, reflecting a reduction in this belief. Independents, shown in light brown, have remained relatively stable, with a slight increase from 26% to 45%.\n\nComparatively, public opinions on party capabilities in handling terrorism, as depicted in `![Party capabilities on terrorism](image3)`, show a partisan divide. Republicans have a 12% advantage over Democrats in perceiving the Republican Party as better at dealing with the terrorist threat, with 46% favoring them and 34% favoring Democrats. This partisan gap mirrors the changes in perceptions of Islam encouraging violence, where Republicans are more likely to associate Islam with violence, aligning with their perceived effectiveness in combating terrorism.\n\nThe data from `![Changes in perception of Islam encouraging violence by political affiliation](image1)` and `![Party capabilities on terrorism](image3)` highlight a correlation between the perception of Islam's role in violence and the perceived effectiveness of political parties in addressing terrorism. The Republican Party's increased belief in Islam's encouragement of violence correlates with their perceived superiority in handling terrorism, while Democrats' declining belief in Islam's role in violence aligns with their lower perceived effectiveness in this area.\n\n**Answer:** Republicans have increasingly perceived Islam as more likely to encourage violence, while Democrats have seen a decline in this belief, with the Republican Party also being perceived as more effective in handling terrorism compared to Democrats."}

According to the text quotes, **Conservative Republicans** are the only major group where a majority (57%) believes Muslims should be subject to more scrutiny than people in other religious groups. In contrast, **Liberal Democrats** overwhelmingly reject this idea, with 87% stating Muslims should not face greater scrutiny. Moderate and liberal Republicans, independents, and conservative and moderate Democrats also predominantly oppose additional scrutiny, with percentages ranging from 59% to 67% in favor of not subjecting Muslims to more scrutiny. This indicates a strong partisan divide, with Republicans, especially conservatives, being more likely to support increased scrutiny compared to Democrats, who are more likely to oppose it.\n\nThe image quotes provide visual data that aligns with these findings. **Image3** shows a breakdown of opinions by political affiliation, confirming that Republicans are the only group where a majority supports greater scrutiny, while Democrats and independents are more likely to oppose it. The image also highlights that younger individuals (18-29) and non-whites are less likely to perceive Muslims as receiving additional scrutiny, as shown in **image2**, where younger demographics and non-whites have lower percentages of those who think there is \"additional scrutiny solely because of religion.\"\n\nRegarding the perceived importance of terrorism, **image4** and **image5** reveal that Republicans prioritize terrorism and national security more than Democrats and independents. In December 2014 and 2015, terrorism became a more prominent concern, increasing from 1% to 18%, while other issues like the economy saw a decrease. This heightened focus on terrorism among Republicans may correlate with their more permissive view of scrutinizing Muslims, as they might associate Muslims with terrorism concerns. However, the majority of Democrats and independents, who prioritize economic issues and are less concerned about terrorism, are more likely to oppose additional scrutiny of Muslims.\n\nIn summary, the data shows that political affiliation and age are significant factors in perceptions of Muslim scrutiny, with conservatives and older individuals more likely to support it. This aligns with the partisan divide on terrorism, where Republicans, who prioritize national security, are more inclined to support scrutinizing Muslims, while Democrats, focusing on economic issues, are less supportive.\n\n![Conservative Republicans support greater scrutiny of Muslims](image3)  \n![Younger and non-white demographics oppose religious scrutiny](image2)  \n![Republicans prioritize terrorism and national security](image4)  \n![Terror"}

The table in image1 shows that Republicans are more likely to prioritize terrorism and defense/national security, while Democrats focus more on economic issues, as indicated by the higher percentages in the \"Economic issues\" category for Democrats [4].

This partisan divide is evident in the table, where Republicans are more likely to mention terrorism, defense issues, and national security or ISIS as the most important problems, while Democrats and Independents are less likely to prioritize these issues. The image3 table also shows that the difference in prioritization between Republicans and Democrats is highlighted, with red indicating issues more prioritized by Republicans and blue for those prioritized by Democrats, emphasizing the partisan nature of these concerns.\n\nThis difference in prioritization relates to their perception of government efforts to address the terrorist threat, as seen in text quotes [2] and [4]. Republicans are more likely to give the government a negative rating for its performance in reducing the terrorist threat, with only 27% saying it is doing very or fairly well, down from 63% at the beginning of the year. In contrast, Democrats are more likely to give positive ratings, with 64% now saying the government is doing at least fairly well, though this is a significant drop from 85% in January. The image2 table further supports this, showing that evaluations of the government’s job reducing the threat of terrorism are more positive among those with a postgraduate degree than among other educational groups, with 58% rating the government positively, compared to 40% who rate it negatively. This suggests that while Republicans may prioritize terrorism more, their perception of government effectiveness is more negative, possibly due to broader dissatisfaction with government performance.\n\nThe image3 table also highlights that Democrats are more likely to cite partisan gridlock and division, which may influence their perception of government effectiveness. The text quote [7] notes that positive ratings of government efforts to reduce the threat of terrorism are now lower than at any point since the September 2001 terrorist attacks, with more people saying the government is doing not too well or not at all well (52%) than saying it is doing well (46%).

Republicans are more likely to believe the U.S. should focus on its own problems, with 76% of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents holding this view. In contrast, Democrats are more divided, with 64% of liberal Democrats supporting global engagement compared to 44% of conservative and moderate Democrats ([5][6][8][9]). This partisan divide is further emphasized by the fact that liberal Democrats are more critical of the U.S.'s handling of the coronavirus outbreak than moderate or conservative Democrats ([9]).\n- **Educational Backgrounds:** Education levels also play a role in these opinions. Those with higher education levels are more supportive of helping other nations. For instance, 60% of postgraduates believe the U.S. should help other countries deal with their problems, while majorities of those with some college experience and those with no more than a high school diploma prefer the U.S. to deal with its own problems ([10]).\n\n**Image Quotes:**\n- **Overall Global Engagement:** Image1 shows that a majority of Americans (64%) view the U.S. performance as only fair or poor, with a significant portion (33%) rating it as good or excellent.

For instance, around three-quarters of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents criticize the U.S.'s response, whereas similar shares of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents praise it ([3]). This partisan gap is further emphasized by the fact that Republicans who believe the U.S. can learn from other nations are more likely to view other countries' pandemic responses favorably ([5]).\n\nEducation also plays a role, particularly in how Americans view the U.S.'s handling of the pandemic.

The image2 chart illustrates this by showing that individuals with a \"Good financial condition\" are more likely to expect a lot or some improvement in their financial situation, with 30% expecting a lot and 59% expecting some improvement, compared to only 15% of those in a \"Poor financial condition\" who expect a lot of improvement [2].\n\nEducational attainment also plays a crucial role. The text [5] reveals that among Latinos with at least some college experience, 69% expect their children to be better off financially, while those with less than a high school education share a similar optimism at 71%. Interestingly, Latino high school graduates are more optimistic than those with some college experience or more, with 79% predicting their children will be better off financially [5]. This is visually supported by image5, which shows that high school graduates have a higher percentage (79%) of respondents expecting their children to be better off compared to those with some college or more (69%).\n\nThe image2 chart further supports this by showing that those in a \"Good financial condition\" are more likely to expect improvement, indicating that better current financial situations correlate with higher expectations for their children's future. Additionally, image5 highlights that demographic variations, such as age and generational status, also affect these expectations, but the core relationship between current financial status and educational level remains a significant factor.\n\nIn summary, Hispanics who are financially stable and have higher educational attainment tend to have more optimistic views about their children's financial futures, as evidenced by both the text and the visual data.\n\n![Hispanics with positive financial views lead to better expectations for children](image1)  \n![Financial expectations based on current financial condition](image2)  \n![Educational attainment and financial expectations](image5)"}

According to the text and image quotes, Latinos have shown significant optimism regarding their financial future, with a growing expectation that their children will be better off financially than they themselves are. For instance, 72% of Latino adults expect their children to be better off financially, a sentiment shared by 75% of immigrant adults and 70% of U.S.-born adults [5]. This optimism has increased over time, with the share of Latinos expecting their family finances to improve rising from 67% in 2008 to 81% in 2015 [7]. However, this optimism contrasts with the economic reality, as median household income for Hispanics has stagnated since the Great Recession, remaining at $42,491 in 2014, and the poverty rate stands at 23.6%, above pre-recession levels [1]. The disparity in wealth is stark, with Hispanic households having a median wealth of $13,700 in 2013 compared to $81,400 for all U.S. households [3].\n\nUnemployment trends also highlight a mixed picture. While the unemployment rate for Latinos has improved since the Great Recession, it remains above its low of 5% in 2006 and is higher than that for non-Hispanic workers in 2015 [4][6]. The image1 shows that the unemployment rate for Hispanics fell from 12.8% in 2010 to 6.4% in 2015, but it is still higher than the non-Hispanic rate of 4.8% in 2015 [5]. The pie chart in image2 illustrates the general sentiment, with 72% of Latinos feeling better off compared to a prior period, indicating a positive outlook despite economic challenges.\n\nThe line graph in image3 further shows that while the general public's perception of financial well-being declined during the recession and remained steady, the Hispanic population's perception improved, reflecting a resilience in optimism.

In contrast, non-Hispanic unemployment rates have also declined but remain lower, ending at 4.8% in 2015. This persistent higher unemployment rate among Hispanics is a critical factor in their economic challenges.\n\nEconomic perceptions, as depicted in `![Economic Attitudes Comparison](image4)`, show that Hispanics are more optimistic about their personal financial situation compared to the general public. In 2015, 56% of Latinos with some college experience or more, and 50% of U.S.-born Latinos, rated their personal finances as excellent or good, compared to lower percentages among those with less education or who are immigrants. Despite this optimism, the median household income for Hispanics has stagnated since the Great Recession, at $42,491 in 2014, compared to $53,700 for the general public, as illustrated in `![Income Comparison](image2)`. The poverty rate for Hispanics was 23.6% in 2014, significantly higher than the 14.8% for the general public, and their median wealth has declined more sharply, with a median of $13,700 in 2013 compared to $81,400 for all U.S. households, as shown in `![Wealth Comparison](image2)`.\n\nThe disparity in economic perceptions and unemployment rates contributes to the broader income and wealth gaps.

The purchasing power of the Hispanic community, though growing, is still less than that of the general public, reflecting the persistent economic disparities highlighted in the data.\n\nIn summary, the higher unemployment rates and lower economic perceptions among Hispanics, despite some optimism, contribute to their lower income and wealth compared to non-Hispanics, as evidenced by the data from both text and image quotes.\n\nThe"}

Still, it remains above its low of 5% in the fourth quarter of 2006 and is higher than that for non-Hispanic workers in the fourth quarter of 2015 [1]. Latinos have become considerably more upbeat about their personal finances and optimistic about their financial future since the Great Recession, according to newly released results from a national survey of Latino adults. The survey also shows that Latinos have pulled even with the general U.S. population in their views of their personal finances and continue to outpace them on optimism about the future. However, community economic indicators show limited progress since the Great Recession [2]. An analysis of 2008 and 2015 survey data finds that Latino perceptions of their economic well-being have increased among most major Latino demographic subgroups [3]. Economic issues have long been among the top issues identified by Hispanics when asked about those that are more important to them personally. For example, in 2014, the issues of education and the economy and jobs were rated more important than health care and immigration among registered voters. And on such issues as the minimum wage, Hispanics are more likely than the general U.S. public to support an increase – 84% versus 73%, according to the Pew Research Center’s December 2015 survey [4]. Between 2014 and 2015, Hispanic views of family income in relation to the cost of living were unchanged—about half of all Hispanic adults in both years said they were falling behind financially, as was true for the U.S. public as a whole [5]. The nation’s Latino population is its largest minority group, numbering 55.3 million in 2014. They are also one of its fastest-growing groups – the U.S. Latino population grew 57% between 2000 and 2014. With this fast demographic growth has come a growing impact on the nation’s economy.

According to the text quotes, an analysis of survey data from 2008 and 2015 reveals that Latino perceptions of their economic well-being have increased among most major Latino demographic subgroups [1]. In 2015, about half (53%) of Latinos reported that their family income is not keeping up with the cost of living, while 37% said it is staying about even, and 10% said it is going up faster [3]. This indicates a shift from a more negative outlook in 2008, where a higher percentage felt their income was falling behind. Additionally, the text highlights that between 2014 and 2015, Hispanic views of family income in relation to the cost of living remained unchanged, with about half of all Hispanic adults saying they were falling behind financially, similar to the U.S. public as a whole [4]. \n\nThe image1 provides a visual representation of these changes, showing that in 2015, 53% of Hispanic adults felt their income was falling behind, compared to 59% in 2014. This suggests a slight decrease in the perception of falling behind, indicating improvement. The image also shows that 37% of Hispanics felt their income was staying about even in 2015, up from 34% in 2014, and 10% felt their income was going up faster, up from 9% in 2014.

According to the data in `image3`, seniors with a college degree are around three times as likely to own both an e-book reader and a tablet compared to those who have not attended college. Specifically, 30% of college graduates own both devices, whereas the percentage is much lower for those with only a high school education or less, at 12% for e-book readers and 11% for tablets. This trend is consistent with the broader national pattern, where tablets and e-book readers are most popular among college graduates and higher-income Americans, as noted in text quote [4].\n\n`image3` also shows that tablet and e-book reader ownership increases with higher household income. For instance, seniors in households earning $75,000 or more per year are four times as likely to own these devices compared to those earning less than $30,000 per year. This aligns with the text quote [4], which states that seniors with higher incomes are more likely to own these devices.\n\nComparing this to the adoption trends across different age groups over time, as depicted in `image4`, younger age groups (18-29 and 30-49) have consistently higher adoption rates of technology. By 2013, the 18-29 age group had a 90% adoption rate, while the 65+ group reached 46%. This indicates that while education and income levels play a crucial role in technology adoption among seniors, younger age groups generally adopt technology at higher rates regardless of these factors.\n\nIn summary, education level is a key determinant of tablet and e-book reader adoption among seniors, with higher education levels leading to greater adoption. However, younger age groups continue to lead in overall technology adoption trends, as seen in the upward trends across all age groups in `image4`.\n\nSeniors with higher education levels are significantly more likely to adopt tablets and e-book readers compared to those with lower education levels, and this trend is consistent with higher-income seniors.

Similarly, 53% of college graduates believe technology has increased their career advancement opportunities, compared to 32% of those with a high school diploma or less [7]. This trend is consistent across different technologies, as seen in image2, which compares the perceived benefits of education level in terms of making work more interesting and increasing opportunities for advancement. \n\nImage4 provides a detailed breakdown of the impact of specific technologies. For example, word processing or spreadsheet software is viewed positively by 70% of workers with college degrees, compared to 5% with a negative impact, while 25% see no impact [4]. Smartphones are viewed positively by 67% of college graduates, with only 13% seeing a negative impact [4]. This indicates that higher education levels are associated with a more favorable perception of these technologies.\n\nIn contrast, workers without a college education are less likely to see these technologies as positive. For example, only 38% of those with a high school diploma or less find technology makes their work more interesting, and 32% believe it has increased their career advancement opportunities [7]. Image2 further illustrates this disparity, showing that individuals with higher education levels are more likely to feel that their education made their work more interesting and increased their opportunities for advancement.\n\nOverall, the survey highlights a clear correlation between higher education levels and a more positive perception of technology's impact on job interest and career advancement. Workers with college degrees are more likely to see technologies as enhancing their work and career prospects, while those without a college education are less likely to share this view [3][6][8].\n\n![The impact of education on making work more interesting and increasing career opportunities](image2)  \n![Perceived impact of specific technologies on workers](image4)\n\nEducation levels and specific technologies significantly influence workers' perceptions of their job's interest and advancement opportunities.

This perception has been consistently positive, with the highest share recorded since 2001 [3]. However, there is a notable gap when it comes to \"good jobs,\" with Democrats more likely to perceive them as less available [4].\n- **Economic Conditions:** Republicans are more likely to rate their personal financial situation as excellent or good [7], indicating a more positive view of economic conditions compared to Democrats. This aligns with the overall positive trend in job availability perceptions among Republicans [6].\n- **Trends Over Time:** Since 2001, perceptions of job availability have become more positive, with the share of people saying there are plenty of jobs rising from 42% to 60% [10]. This trend generally tracks with more positive views of the economy over the same period [10].\n\n**Image Analysis:**\n- **Image1:** The line graph from 2001 to 2019 shows that the percentage of people saying \"jobs are difficult to find\" peaked around 2009 at 85%, while \"plenty of jobs available\" reached its lowest at 10% [image1]. By 2019, \"plenty of jobs available\" peaked at 60%, and \"jobs are difficult to find\" dropped to 33%, reflecting a significant improvement in job availability perceptions.\n- **Image2:** The graph from 2004 to 2019 shows that Republicans/Lean Republicans (red line) have more dramatic fluctuations in their perception of job availability, starting at 65% in 2004 and rising to 62% in 2019.

This reflects a broader partisan divide in public perception of Trump's capabilities.\n\nThe public's confidence in Trump to handle a number of key issues remains mixed. Trump fares best on issues related to economic conditions, where about half of Americans say they are at least somewhat confident in his ability. By contrast, only about a third express confidence in his ability to work effectively with Congress.

Slightly more than six-in-ten (63%) now say this, while 36% say that voters should only be allowed to vote early or absentee if they have a documented reason for not voting in person on Election Day.\n- **[7]** Democrats and Democratic leaners are far more supportive of automatically registering all eligible citizens to vote (82%) and no-excuse early voting (84%); their views are virtually unchanged in recent years.\n- **[8]** Nearly half of U.S. adults say they approve of a proposal by House Democrats that would require states to put together redistricting commissions composed of equal numbers of Democrats and Republicans to draw their congressional maps instead of having state legislatures come up with their own plans. Just 13% disapprove of this proposal, while 38% say they are unsure about it.\n- **[9]** Among Republicans, moderates and liberals are about evenly divided, with 49% saying voters should be required to provide documented reasons for voting absentee or early and 51% saying this should not be necessary. Conservative Republicans are substantially more likely to say the former (70%) than the latter (30%). Ideological divides among Democrats are not nearly so pronounced on this issue.\n- **[10]** While about half of Republicans (52%) who voted absentee or by mail favor no-excuse absentee or early voting, only about a third of early, in-person GOP voters (35%) and just 22% of those who voted in person on Election Day say the same.

These factors are particularly relevant for the \"Foreign born\" and second-generation groups, where a significant portion does not identify as Hispanic.\n\nImage5 further supports this by showing that the percentage of self-identified Hispanics who do not speak Spanish increases with each generation. For example, 28% of the \"Foreign born\" speak Spanish, compared to 15% of the second generation and 7% of the third or higher generation [5]. Similarly, the percentage of those without a Spanish last name is higher in the \"Foreign born\" group (78%) compared to the second (91%) and third or higher (92%) generations [5].\n\nThe text and images together reveal that while language and cultural ties are important, they are not the sole determinants of self-identification.

This aligns with the text quote [9], which highlights concern about the rising cost of living by country.\n\nThe image3 further supports this by showing a comparison between GCC and Non-GCC, with the Non-GCC group having a slightly higher value of 62 compared to the GCC group's 63. This indicates that Non-GCC countries have a higher level of concern about the rising cost of living. Additionally, the image4 provides a detailed breakdown of concern levels across different countries, showing that in the \"All\" category, a majority of respondents are \"Very concerned\" about the rising cost of living, as indicated by the blue section in each bar.\n\nRegarding unemployment, the text quote [5] states that Arab youth believe civil unrest is the biggest obstacle facing the region, which may indirectly relate to unemployment concerns. The image5 shows unemployment levels over the years, with the GCC countries having lower unemployment rates compared to Non-GCC countries. For example, in 2014, the unemployment rate for GCC countries was 49%, while Non-GCC countries had a slightly higher rate of 44%. This suggests that while unemployment is a concern, it is not as high as the rising cost of living in Non-GCC countries.\n\nIn summary, Non-GCC countries have higher concerns about the rising cost of living, as shown in image1 and image3, while unemployment levels are relatively lower compared to Non-GCC countries, as indicated in image5. The specific concern levels in individual GCC countries, as shown in image4, indicate a high level of concern across all regions, with a predominance of the blue section representing \"Very concerned.\"\n\n![GCC vs Non-GCC Concerns](image1) ![Specific Concern Levels in GCC Countries](image4)\n\nThe concerns about the rising cost of living are higher in Non-GCC countries"}

According to text quote [7], there is rapid growth in Mountain View and Palo Alto, which is a significant factor contributing to the demand on public transportation. This growth is expected to lead to more people needing to use transit options like trains, as highlighted in text quote [1], which emphasizes the need to accommodate 80% of housing and 60% of job growth in just 5% of land with transit access. The text quote [4] further underscores the urgency by stating the need to double Cal train ridership from 60,000 to 120,000 daily trips by the next decade.\n\nThe image quotes provide visual context to these statistics. Image1 depicts a crowded train or bus, illustrating the \"standing room only\" situation typical of public transportation when demand exceeds capacity. This image directly correlates with the text quote [2] and [3], which both mention that trains are crowded, indicating that the current infrastructure is struggling to handle the growing number of passengers. Image5 shows a large crowd at a transportation hub, likely experiencing similar congestion, reinforcing the text quote [5] about platforms at 4th & King being a busy area.\n\nAdditionally, text quote [6] notes that more frequent service leads to stress at intersections, with 40 at-grade crossings remaining, and mentions funding differences between San Mateo and Santa Clara counties. This suggests that the capacity issues are not only due to increased ridership but also due to infrastructure limitations and funding disparities, which are critical factors in managing the growing demand in areas like Mountain View and Palo Alto.\n\nIn summary, the rapid growth in Mountain View and Palo Alto, as noted in text quote [7], is leading to increased ridership on trains, which is causing capacity issues, as shown in image1 and image5.

This encoding captures the meaning of the user's message and is crucial for understanding the context of the dialogue [4].\n\n2. **Dialogue State Tracking**: The dialogue state, represented by $s_k$, is updated after each turn by incorporating the encoding of the user's utterance and the previous system action. This state maintains a continuous representation of the conversation, including the user's goals and the current context [7].\n\n3. **Policy Network**: The policy network uses the dialogue state $s_k$, the log probabilities of candidate values from the belief tracker $v_k$, and the encoding of the query results $E_k$ to generate a probability distribution over candidate values for each goal slot. Based on this distribution, the system formulates a query command to retrieve information from a knowledge base [4].\n\n4. **Knowledge Base Interaction**: The system sends symbolic queries to the knowledge base, leaving the ranking of entities to an external recommender system. This interaction retrieves relevant information that is then encoded and fed back into the system [5].\n\n5. **Policy Network Output**: The policy network determines the next system action, which is conditioned on the dialogue state, the estimated user's goal, and the query results.

The F1-Score (green line with triangle markers) also shows a moderate increase, starting around 14 and ending around 18. This indicates that while the model's ability to filter out incorrect knowledge improves with more absent knowledge, the model's ability to identify the correct knowledge (recall) remains limited.\n\n![Conscious Incompetence](image3)\n\nThe text quote [5] supports this observation, stating, \"The recall is stable at about 15 regardless of the number of absent knowledge. This indicates that the current LLMs have ability to identify absent knowledge to a limited extent. While precision and F1-Score exhibit a clear upward trend, which shows that with more absent knowledge in KG, [NA] enables generated outputs to locate absent knowledge more accurately.\" This suggests that the model can handle the absence of knowledge to some extent, but recall remains a challenge, highlighting the importance of retrieval accuracy in generating high-quality attributed texts.\n\nIn the context of retrieval analysis, as shown in image4, the precision, recall, and F1-Score all decrease as retrieval accuracy drops. The text quote [7] notes, \"The results show clear downward trends in all metrics as expected when retrieval accuracy dropped. Among precision and recall, the impact of poor retrieval quality on recall (green) is much more significant than on precision (yellow).\" This indicates that while the model can filter out incorrect knowledge to a certain extent, the impact on recall is more pronounced, underscoring the difficulty in citing correct knowledge when retrieval accuracy is low.\n\nOverall, these changes imply that while models can improve their ability to filter out incorrect knowledge, their ability to identify the correct knowledge remains limited, especially when retrieval accuracy is low. The \"Conscious Incompetence\" setting plays an increasingly crucial role as the coverage problem of knowledge graphs becomes more serious, as highlighted in text quote [3].\n\n**Answer:** The removal of knowledge elements increases precision and F1-Score but has a minimal impact on recall, indicating that models can filter out incorrect knowledge"}

According to Figure 4, as the number of demonstration samples increases, models with logical constraints generally show improved performance. For instance, MAVEN-ERE with logical constraints demonstrates a noticeable increase in Micro-F1 scores when the number of demonstration samples rises from 1 to 5, as shown in the left graph. However, the improvement plateaus when the number of samples exceeds 10, indicating diminishing returns. This trend is consistent across models, suggesting that logical constraints provide a stable boost, especially with a smaller number of demonstrations.\n\nThe right graph in Figure 4 further illustrates that incorporating logical constraints reduces logical inconsistency over multiple iterations, as indicated by the decreasing trend in the blue line. This reduction in inconsistency is crucial for improving model performance, as highlighted in the text quote [2], where iterative retrieval shows a gradual decrease in logical inconsistency with more iterations. The combination of logical constraints and demonstrations thus enhances both the accuracy and consistency of model responses.\n\n![The impact of logical constraints and demonstration samples on model performance](image3)\n\nAdditionally, Table 3 in image3 provides a comparative analysis of model performance under different conditions. Models like Llama2-13B-PT and Vicuna-13B-PT achieve higher Micro-F1 scores when logical constraints are applied, particularly with a smaller number of demonstrations. For example, Llama2-13B-PT on MAVEN-ERE reaches a Micro-F1 of 26.4% with CoT and logical constraints, surpassing the performance of models without logical constraints. This underscores the importance of logical constraints in guiding models to produce more logically consistent and accurate answers.\n\nIn summary, logical constraints and demonstration samples work synergistically to enhance model performance on complex reasoning tasks. Logical constraints stabilize and improve performance, while demonstration samples provide context that helps models generalize better, especially when logical constraints are integrated into the model's instructions.\n\n**Answer:** The use of logical constraints and demonstration samples improves model performance on MAVEN-ERE and Causal-TimeBank datasets by enhancing both accuracy and logical consistency. Logical constraints reduce inconsistency, and demonstration samples provide context, leading to better reasoning abilities, as shown in Figure 4 and Table 3."}

This involves cropping the image based on proposal bounding box coordinates to isolate individual objects. Each cropped region is then resized to a fixed proportion to standardize the input size for the image encoder. This step is crucial because it helps in focusing on the relevant objects, which are often smaller and more varied in position compared to classification tasks.\n\nFollowing pre-processing, the system moves to the **Embedding & Retrieve** section, where the image embeddings are generated using an image encoder. These embeddings are then used in a k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) search to find relevant labels from the memory storage (`Memory M`). The diagram highlights how each bounding box is associated with possible labels, such as \"flower arrangement\" for Bbox1, \"saltshaker\" for Bbox2, and \"vase\" for Bbox3.

According to quote [5], data augmentation involves using negative training examples as templates, resulting in a training set with 21% positive and 79% negative examples. This imbalance is intended to simulate real-world scenarios where negative examples are more prevalent. The performance of BERT under these conditions is measured by comparing the augmented dataset to the original, as shown in quote [6], where \"+negative\" outperforms \"original\" on the \"+positive\" dataset but underperforms on the \"+negative\" dataset. This suggests that while \"+positive\" creates a balanced dataset, the reduced number of training examples leads to inferior performance, as the model struggles with the imbalance introduced by \"+negative\".\n\nIn sentiment analysis tasks, quote [1] and image1 highlight the performance of BERT with different loss functions. BERT+CE achieves the highest accuracy on both SST-2 and SST-5 datasets, indicating that cross-entropy loss is effective for balanced datasets. However, quote [9] explains that dice loss (DSC) is not suitable for accuracy-oriented tasks due to its inability to handle the dominance of easy-negative examples.

The dynamic weight adjustment strategy in DSC helps the model focus on hard-negative examples, mitigating the overwhelming effect of easy-negative examples.\n\nIn summary, data augmentation techniques like using negative examples as templates can improve BERT's performance on imbalanced datasets by making the model more robust to hard-negative examples. However, the effectiveness varies across tasks, with DSC being particularly beneficial for sentiment analysis and named entity recognition when dealing with imbalanced data.\n\n![The impact of data augmentation on BERT performance](image5) Different data augmentation techniques significantly impact the performance of BERT models on the QQP dataset and other sentiment analysis tasks.

According to **image1**, TRADE achieves the highest joint accuracy of 48.62% on the full MultiWOZ dataset and 65.35% on the restaurant subset, outperforming models like MDBT, GLAD, GCE, and SpanPtr. The slot accuracy for TRADE is also high, at 96.92% on the full dataset and 93.28% on the restaurant subset, indicating strong performance in both joint and slot accuracy metrics.

This is evident from the text quote [5], which states that fine-tuning TRADE with GEM maintains higher performance on the original four domains, with a drop of only 5.44% in joint accuracy for the hotel domain, compared to a 22.9% drop with naive fine-tuning. The text quote [2] also highlights that TRADE achieves better performance when expanding to a new domain with GEM, obtaining 59.83% joint accuracy with 1% of new-domain data, compared to 44.24% when training from scratch. This suggests that GEM's approach of keeping a small number of samples from the source domains and constraining the gradient to prevent loss increase on these samples helps retain performance on the original domains better than EWC, which uses the diagonal of the Fisher information matrix as a regularizer.\n\nSlot similarities, as shown in image5, affect performance by indicating how well the model can leverage shared attributes across domains. The heatmap visualizes cosine similarities between slot embeddings, with darker cells indicating higher similarity. For instance, \"destination\" and \"departure\" or \"price range\" and \"stars\" show high correlation, suggesting these slots have related attributes. This similarity can aid in transferring knowledge, as seen in image2, where the model successfully tracks slots like \"people,\" \"area,\" \"price range,\" and \"day\" in the hotel and restaurant domains, which were learned from other domains.

According to the text quotes, all tested systems show better performance with stereotypical gender roles compared to non-stereotypical ones, as evidenced by the consistently higher F1 scores for stereotypical roles [1]. This bias is observed across multiple languages and systems, indicating a widespread issue in machine translation.\n\n**Image3** visually supports this finding by showing a bar chart where the accuracy for stereotypical translations is consistently higher than for non-stereotypical translations across languages like Spanish, French, Italian, Russian, Ukrainian, Hebrew, Arabic, and German. For instance, in Spanish, stereotypical translations have 67% accuracy compared to 46% for non-stereotypical ones [3].\n\n**Image2** provides a detailed breakdown of accuracy and error metrics for Google Translate, Microsoft Translator, Amazon Translate, and SYSTRAN across languages such as Spanish, French, Italian, Russian, Ukrainian, Hebrew, Arabic, and German. It highlights that while Google Translate performs well in French (63.6% accuracy) and Hebrew (53.7%), it struggles with non-stereotypical translations in languages like Arabic (43.7% Δ_G) [2]. Similarly, Microsoft Translator shows high accuracy in German (74.1%) but significant Δ_S changes in Hebrew (30.2%) [2].\n\n**Image4** compares two studies, showing that the Δ_S metric is notably higher in German (8.4) than in French (16.1), suggesting stronger gender bias in German translations [4]. This aligns with the text's observation that German systems perform better due to its similarity to English [8].\n\n**Image5** shows that adding stereotypical adjectives improves accuracy in Spanish, Russian, and Ukrainian, indicating that the systems are more accurate with stereotypical roles [7]. The Δ values suggest that modifying the input can mitigate some bias, but the baseline performance remains skewed towards stereotypical roles.\n\nIn summary, all systems tested exhibit gender bias, with higher accuracy for stereotypical roles and significant Δ_S values indicating semantic changes that reflect bias. The data and methods presented in the text and images collectively demonstrate that gender bias is a prevalent issue in machine translation, affecting performance across diverse languages and systems.\n\n![Gender bias in machine translation across languages and systems](image2) ![Performance comparison of stereotypical vs. non-stereotypical translations](image3) ![Comparison of two studies on gender bias metrics](image4"}

For instance, when stereotypical adjectives are added to male and female entities, the translation accuracy improves. This is evident in **image2**, which shows the original and adjusted performance metrics for Spanish (ES), Russian (RU), and Ukrainian (UK). The \"+Adj\" column in the table indicates a notable increase in accuracy when stereotypical adjectives are included, demonstrating that such adjustments can correct gender bias. For example, in Spanish, the accuracy improves from 53.1% to 63.5%, a change of +10.4%, and in Russian, it improves from 37.7% to 48.9%, a change of +11.2%.\n\n**Text Quote [8]** provides further evidence, stating that adding adjectives like \"handsome\" and \"pretty\" can reduce bias by mixing signals, as seen in **image3**. The first row in the table shows a biased translation where the gender inflection does not match the pronoun, while the second row corrects this bias by using a stereotypically female adjective, resulting in a proper gender match. This adjustment effectively aligns the translation with the intended gender, reducing bias.\n\nHowever, the study also notes that such adjustments are impractical as a general debiasing scheme due to the need for coreference resolution, as mentioned in **text quote [8]**. The results in **image4** show that while stereotype-based adjustments can improve performance in some languages, the impact varies, with German (DE) showing a smaller improvement compared to Spanish and Russian. This suggests that the effectiveness of stereotype-based adjustments is not uniform across all languages.\n\nIn summary, stereotype-based adjustments can reduce gender bias in machine translation, particularly in languages with clear grammatical gender markers, as shown in **image1** and **image2**. However, their practicality as a general solution is limited due to the complexity of coreference resolution and varying effectiveness across languages.\n\n**Answer:** Stereotype-based adjustments in machine translation can reduce gender bias, as seen in languages like Spanish, Russian, and Ukrainian, where adding stereotypical adjectives improves accuracy.

For instance, the F1 score declines from 67.08 to 46.84 when using standard distractors but increases to 60.10 when using adversarial distractors [9]. This suggests that adversarial training helps the model generalize better to unseen distractors, enhancing its ability to handle multi-hop reasoning.\n\nAdditionally, the inclusion of gold paragraphs in the open-domain setting significantly boosts the F1 score. As shown in image2, the F1 score improves from 39.12 to 53.12 when a gold paragraph is added to the \"Open-domain 500 Paragraphs\" setting [4].

They show strong performance both when translating into English and out of English, as evidenced by the bolded scores in image1, the highlighted metrics in image2, and the significant wins in image3 and image4. This suggests that YiSi metrics effectively capture semantic understanding and achieve high correlation with human judgments, making them robust across diverse language pairs.\n\n**Answer:** The YiSi metrics, especially YiSi-1, consistently perform well across different language pairs in terms of statistical significance, showing strong performance both when translating into English and out of English."}

These tables highlight metrics that are not significantly outperformed by any other for each language pair.\n- **Table 4** focuses on system-level metrics, while **Table 5** focuses on segment-level metrics.\n- **Table 4** mentions that the series of YiSi metrics achieve the highest correlations in several language pairs and are not significantly outperformed by any other metrics for almost all language pairs.\n- **Table 5** shows that for segment-level evaluation, most language pairs have metrics with similar performance, except for en-gu, where sentBLEU is significantly worse.\n\n### Image Analysis\n\nFrom the image quotes, we can observe:\n- **Image1** shows a table with correlation results for various language pairs, including en-fi and en-kk. It highlights metrics like BEER, BLEU, sacreBLEU.BLEU, and sacreBLEU.chrF, which have strong correlations.\n- **Image4** provides a detailed breakdown of correlation values for system-level metrics, including en-fi and en-kk. It categorizes metrics into general metrics and QE metrics, showing their performance across different language pairs.\n\n### Interleaved Response\n\n**Image1** highlights the correlation results for various metrics across multiple language pairs. For the en-fi and en-kk pairs, we can see that metrics like BEER, BLEU, and sacreBLEU.BLEU generally show strong correlations. The table also indicates that some QE metrics, such as UNI and UNI+, have lower correlations compared to the general metrics.\n\n**Image4** further supports this by showing the correlation values for system-level metrics. For en-fi, metrics like BEER, BLEU, and YiSi variations achieve high correlation values, indicating strong alignment with human assessments. For en-kk, similar patterns are observed, with YiSi metrics performing particularly well.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBoth the text and image quotes indicate that for the en-fi and en-kk language pairs, metrics like BEER, BLEU, and YiSi variations show strong correlations with human assessments. These metrics are consistently performing well across"}

The company managed this risk by using financial instruments such as forward exchange contracts and currency options to hedge forecast transactions, assets, and liabilities, aiming to hedge the majority of total currency exposure [7][9]. Additionally, Novo Nordisk applied hedge accounting to match the impact of hedged items and hedging instruments in the consolidated income statement, classifying the result of hedging activities as part of financial items [8].\n\nThe changes in exchange rates had a notable effect on Novo Nordisk's comprehensive income and cash flow hedges.

This growth in AUM is significant as it directly influences the firm's revenues. The text also mentions that fee rates are based on asset management revenues, net of waivers, excluding performance-based fees and other non-management fees [4]. \n\nThe image quotes offer specific data on AUM and fee rates. According to image4, the Total AUM increased from $471 billion in 2018 to $657 billion in 2020, reflecting a substantial growth over the period. The fee rates, as shown in image1, generally decreased across most categories, with the exception of the Equity category, which remained constant. The fee rate for Total AUM, for instance, dropped from 47 bps in 2018 to 42 bps in 2020 [image1].\n\nThe combination of these factors suggests that while the firm's AUM grew significantly, the fee rates decreased. This could lead to a complex impact on revenues. On one hand, the increase in AUM could boost revenues due to higher management fees. On the other hand, the decrease in fee rates might reduce the revenue per unit of AUM. However, the text [4] notes that the payment of fees to third-party distributors is included in Non-compensation expenses, which might offset some of the fee rate reductions.\n\n![The table shows a general trend of decreasing fee rates over the three-year period across these categories, with the exception of the Equity category, which remains constant.](image1) The decrease in fee rates, despite the growth in AUM, could mean that the firm's revenue growth is not as high as the increase in AUM might suggest.

It contains the following information:](image1)\n\nThe comprehensive income attributable to common stockholders evolved significantly from 2018 to 2020. In 2018, the company reported a comprehensive loss of $(1,018) million. By 2019, this shifted to a comprehensive loss of $(890) million, and in 2020, it turned positive at $1,120 million. This change reflects a substantial improvement in the company's financial performance over the period.\n\n**Key Factors Contributing to the Change:**\n\n1. **Net Income Improvement**: The net income attributable to common stockholders increased from $(1,063) million in 2018 to $862 million in 2020. This improvement is a primary driver of the change in comprehensive income.\n\n2. **Foreign Currency Translation Adjustments**: The foreign currency translation adjustment, which is part of other comprehensive income, moved from a loss of $(42) million in 2018 to a gain of $399 million in 2020. This significant positive adjustment in 2020 contributed to the overall increase in comprehensive income.\n\n3. **Noncontrolling Interests**: The comprehensive income attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests decreased from a loss of $(87) million in 2018 to $141 million in 2020. This reduction in losses also positively impacted the comprehensive income attributable to common stockholders.\n\n4. **Stock-Based Compensation Expense**: The company capitalized stock-based compensation expense, which was $18 million in 2018, $52 million in 2019, and $89 million in 2020. While this expense increased, it was partially offset by the positive impact of the net income and foreign currency translation adjustments.\n\n5. **Operational Efficiency and Market Capitalization**: The company focused on operational efficiencies and experienced a rapid increase in market capitalization, leading to higher stock-based compensation expenses. However, these expenses were offset by other financial factors, contributing to the overall improvement in comprehensive income.\n\n![The table provides the financial performance data for a company over the years 2018, 201"}

The company's stock-based compensation expenses, as shown in image3, have generally decreased from $558 million in 2020 to $528 million in 2022. This reduction is attributed to the amortization of previously recognized compensation costs, as noted in text quotes [2] and [8], where the unamortized compensation cost related to stock options, RSUs, and PSUs decreased from $216 million in 2022 to $264 million in 2020.

The Sustainability Committee assists the Board in overseeing climate change performance and governance responsibilities, while the Risk and Audit Committee provides oversight of climate-related risk management [3]. This dual oversight ensures that climate-related risks are considered in key judgements and estimates, as evidenced by the Committee's review of financial statement disclosures and greenhouse gas emissions reduction commitments [7].\n\nIn terms of director training, BHP employs a rigorous and continuous succession planning process, as outlined in image1. This includes a structured approach to managing Board succession planning, focusing on diversity, skills, and experience necessary for effective governance and risk management [1]. The Nomination and Governance Committee plays a crucial role in outlining role descriptions, selecting search firms, and conducting interviews for new appointments [3, 4]. Directors are also engaged in briefings and development sessions to deepen their understanding of key issues, including climate change, as shown in image5.

The total recast revenue for full-year 2019 and 2018 was approximately $0.3 billion and $0.4 billion, respectively, with no impact on IBM’s consolidated results. The changes were aimed at improving the alignment with the company’s go-forward performance.\n\nFor Cloud & Cognitive Software, the external gross profit increased by 3.4% from 2018 to 2019, reaching $17,650 million, while the external gross profit margin decreased by 1.0 percentage point to 77.1%. However, the pre-tax income saw a 12.4% decrease to $7,811 million, and the pre-tax margin dropped by 5.2 percentage points to 30.4%. The decline in pre-tax income and margin was primarily driven by the revenue decline in Transaction Processing Platforms, ongoing investments in strategic areas like cloud and AI, and higher workforce rebalancing charges.\n\nIn contrast, Global Business Services experienced a slight increase in external gross profit by 3.0% to $4,655 million, and the external gross profit margin improved by 0.8 percentage points to 27.7%.

The decrease in transportation services revenue is attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic and lower rates on Zydeco committed contracts. Despite these challenges, the operating income still increased from 2019 to 2020. This suggests that the company managed to improve its operational efficiency or find other revenue streams to offset the declines in certain areas.\n  \n- **Cash from Investing Activities**: The text quotes state that capital expenditures decreased from $35 million in 2019 to $22 million in 2020, primarily due to the completion of the Houma tank expansion and directional drill projects for Zydeco. There were no contributions to investment in 2020, which likely contributed to the change in cash from investing activities.\n\n### Image Quotes Analysis:\n- **Operating Income**: The table in image3 shows that the operating income increased from $526 million in 2019 to $542 million in 2020. This aligns with the text's explanation of improved operational efficiency and new volumes brought online at NaKika and Odyssey, as well as regulatory approval for an increase in tariffs on Delta in 2020.\n  \n- **Cash from Investing Activities**: The table in image5 shows that cash provided by investing activities increased from ($87) million in 2019 to $64 million in 2020. This significant change is due to the completion of major projects and reduced capital expenditures, as mentioned in the text.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe operating income increased from 2019 to 2020 due to improved operational efficiency, new revenue streams, and regulatory approvals. The cash from investing activities improved from a negative $87 million in 2019 to a positive $64 million in 2020 because of reduced capital expenditures and the completion of major projects.\n\n![Operating Income Increase"}

According to the text quotes, commercial loans increased due to higher loan demand, while consumer loans decreased primarily because of loan paydowns and the transfer of mortgage loans to loans held for sale. The total deposits increased by 6%, with notable changes in the types of deposits, as shown in the image1 table. Noninterest-bearing demand deposits and savings deposits saw increases, while time deposits and interest-bearing deposits in non-U.S. offices declined significantly.\n\n![Deposit Changes](image1) illustrates the changes in deposit types. Noninterest-bearing demand deposits increased by 13%, interest-bearing demand deposits by 4%, and savings deposits by 9%. However, time deposits decreased by 41%, and interest-bearing deposits in non-U.S. offices dropped by 44%. This suggests a shift away from time deposits, possibly due to the entity's strategy to manage under the asset cap, as mentioned in image10.\n\nImage2 provides a breakdown of loan maturities, showing that commercial loans, particularly real estate mortgage loans, have varying maturities, with a significant portion maturing after one year. This indicates a strategic focus on long-term lending, which aligns with the increased commercial loans. The decrease in consumer loans, especially residential mortgage loans, suggests a strategy to reduce exposure to mortgage-related risks, possibly due to the low interest rate environment and the transfer of loans to LHFS.\n\nThe decrease in time deposits and non-U.S. interest-bearing deposits could reflect efforts to reduce risk or manage liquidity, as noted in image10. The increase in noninterest-bearing and savings deposits might indicate a strategy to attract more stable, lower-cost deposits, enhancing the entity's liquidity position.\n\nIn summary, the financial entity's strategy appears to focus on increasing commercial lending, managing deposit risk by reducing time deposits, and optimizing the deposit mix to improve liquidity and reduce interest rate risk.\n\nThe financial entity's loan and deposit figures changed from December 31, 2020, to December 31, 2021, with commercial loans increasing and consumer loans decreasing. Total deposits rose by 6%, but time deposits and non-U.S. interest-bearing deposits declined significantly.

The text explains that interest and other investment income declined by $470 million (44.4%) in 2021 compared to 2020, and this decline was further exacerbated by a $1.0 billion (49.0%) decrease from 2019. The main reasons cited were lower income from short-term investments and fixed maturity securities, which were affected by low short-term interest rates prevailing throughout 2020 and 2021. \n\nThe asset allocations, as shown in image1, reflect these changes.

The amounts for these categories increased from $67,082 million in 2020 to $90,688 million in 2021. However, the decline in interest income suggests that despite holding these assets, the low interest rates led to lower returns.

This substantial increase was driven by several factors, with changes in sales prices and operating cash costs playing crucial roles. \n\n**Sales Prices Impact:**\n- The table highlights a **$16,965 million increase** in sales prices due to higher commodity prices, including iron ore, copper, and nickel. This was a major driver of the EBITDA growth, as reflected in the **Net Price Impact** section of the table. The increase in commodity prices directly contributed to higher revenue and, consequently, higher EBITDA.\n\n**Operating Cash Costs:**\n- Despite a slight decrease in operating cash costs by **$34 million** due to inventory drawdowns and increased volumes post-maintenance shutdowns, the overall impact of these costs was relatively minor compared to the significant boost from sales prices. The **Change in Controllable Cash Costs** section shows a net decrease of $75 million, indicating effective cost management.\n\n**Net Total After Price Impact:**\n- After accounting for the price impact, the **Net total after price impact** was $16,095 million, which still contributed positively to the EBITDA. However, the **Change in Other Costs** section shows a negative impact of $1,491 million from exchange rates and inflation, partially offset by a positive impact from higher realized sales prices.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe increase in sales prices had a substantial positive impact on BHP's Underlying EBITDA, while the slight decrease in operating cash costs provided a modest additional benefit. The combination of these factors, along with other strategic cost management and asset sales, contributed to the overall significant increase in EBITDA from FY2020 to FY2021.\n\nThe Underlying EBITDA for BHP increased from $22,071 million in FY2020 to $37,379 million in FY"}

In 2019, unallocated revenues were $4,891 million, which decreased to $1,974 million in 2020 and further dropped to $182 million in 2021. This decline reflects a substantial reduction in revenues not attributed to specific segments. Correspondingly, unallocated expenses also decreased, with unallocated research and development expenses dropping from $989 million in 2019 to $1,820 million in 2021, and unallocated selling, general, and administrative expenses decreasing from $413 million to $538 million over the same period.\n\nDuring the acquisition of NUVIA in 2021, the net assets acquired amounted to $1,264 million, as shown in ![Net assets acquired during the acquisition of NUVIA in 2021](image4). This acquisition included cash of $174 million, in-process research and development (IPR&D) of $247 million, and goodwill of $885 million. The significant portion of the acquisition cost was allocated to goodwill, which is not deductible for tax purposes and is expected to be amortized over seven years.\n\nComparing the changes in unallocated revenues and expenses with the net assets acquired, the reduction in unallocated revenues and expenses from 2019 to 2021 aligns with the acquisition's impact on the company's financial structure. The acquisition of NUVIA contributed to the company's financial assets, particularly through the recognition of goodwill and IPR&D, which are key components of the net assets acquired. The decrease in unallocated revenues and expenses might reflect the integration of NUVIA's operations and the reallocation of resources, contributing to the overall financial adjustments observed in the company's financial statements.\n\nIn summary, the decline in unallocated revenues and expenses from 2019 to 2021 coincides with the acquisition of NUVIA, which significantly increased the company's net assets through the recognition of goodwill and IPR&D, indicating a strategic realignment of resources post-acquisition."}

This improvement in operating cash flow, combined with a decrease in net cash used for investing activities to $11.6 billion from $6.4 billion, resulted in a significant rise in free cash flow to $6.428 billion, up from $5.587 billion in 2019 [3][4]. The free cash flow increase of 15% highlights PepsiCo's enhanced operational efficiency and reduced capital expenditures.\n\nIn terms of contractual commitments, the table in image5 shows a substantial total of $66,321 million in commitments, with the majority due in 2026 and beyond.

The adjusted revenue for Global Markets increased by 27%, driven by higher volatility and increased client activity, particularly in the Fixed Income, Currencies, and Commodities (FICC) sector, where revenue rose by $1,541 million (33%) [9]. This was due to strong performance in Foreign Exchange and Credit, with Foreign Exchange revenue increasing by 26% and Credit revenue by 90% [4]. However, the Global Banking division experienced a decrease in revenue by $71 million (2%), reflecting lower real estate and structured finance fee income and losses on legacy corporate restructuring positions [2].\n\nThe net operating income for Global Markets improved by $392 million (60%) from 2019 to 2020, largely due to the increased revenue and the reallocation of costs [7]. The geopolitical and economic landscape, dominated by the Covid-19 outbreak, contributed to the changes, with the pandemic leading to a significant weakening in GDP and increased client activity in trading [6]. The economic environment also saw a partial rebound in 2021, but with uncertainties due to government restrictions and labor market recovery [6].\n\n![Net Operating Income and Adjusted Revenue Changes](image4) shows the detailed breakdown of revenue changes across various sectors, highlighting the 27% increase in Global Markets revenue and the 60% improvement in net operating income.

This decrease was primarily due to paydowns exceeding originations, as noted in text quote [8].

The Advanced Approach also saw an increase in Credit Valuation Adjustment (CVA) due to higher exposure in Derivatives and credit spread volatility. These increases reflect the institution's exposure to credit risk and the need for higher capital buffers to cover potential losses.\n\n**External TLAC as a Percentage of RWA:**\n- **Image5** indicates that the External Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity (TLAC) as a percentage of RWA decreased from 49.9% in 2019 to 47.7% in 2020.

The regulatory minimum for TLAC as a percentage of RWA is 18.0%, and the institution exceeded this requirement significantly, indicating robust capital buffers.\n\n**Impact on Capital Structure:**\n- The increase in Credit Risk RWA required the institution to hold more capital to meet regulatory requirements, which could have strained capital resources. However, the institution's decision to defer the adoption of CECL over a five-year transition period, as noted in **Text Quote [2]** and **Text Quote [9]**, allowed it to exclude the effect of CECL on its capital calculations for 2020.

The text also notes that unused tax losses for which no deferred tax asset has been recognized total $2,693,000 in 2020, compared to a decrease from the previous year [4].

Specifically, it states, \"Interest rate risks associated with the valuations of our equity index put option contract liabilities are no longer considered significant due to the short duration of remaining exposures as of December 31, 2021.\" This indicates that while interest rate changes can affect the fair value of these contracts, the impact is minimal because the contracts have short durations. \n\nThe image quote `![Impact of Interest Rates on Equity Index Put Options](image2)` provides a detailed breakdown of how interest rate changes affect the fair value of equity index put option contracts. For December 31, 2021, a 100 basis point (bp) decrease in interest rates results in a slight increase in the fair value from $99 to $105, while a 100 bp increase results in a decrease to $94. This sensitivity is further illustrated in the hypothetical price change scenarios, where a 30% increase or decrease in prices leads to minimal changes in fair value, with the equity index put option's fair value increasing to $5 or decreasing to $1,088, respectively.\n\n### Differences in Non-U.S. Denominated Debt Effects on Net Earnings\n\nThe text quote [8] highlights the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on non-U.S. denominated senior notes, noting that these effects are recorded in earnings as a component of selling, general, and administrative expenses.

According to the text quote [3], PMI recorded asset impairment and exit costs related to plant closures in Argentina, Colombia, Germany, and Pakistan as part of its global manufacturing infrastructure optimization. This indicates that the company was restructuring its operations, which likely contributed to higher costs and affected profitability. Additionally, the text quote [10] states that the total shipment volume decreased by 11.6% to 64.2 billion units in Latin America & Canada, or by 10.3% excluding the impact of the RBH deconsolidation. This decline in shipment volumes would have negatively impacted revenue and operating income.\n\nThe image quote [3] provides specific shipment volume data, showing a decrease of 11.8% in cigarettes and a significant increase of 50.8% in heated tobacco units. The overall shipment volume decreased by 11.6%, which aligns with the text. The increase in heated tobacco units, however, suggests a shift in product mix, which might have offset some of the revenue decline from cigarettes. However, the overall volume decrease would have likely pressured revenue and operating income.\n\nThe financial activities, as shown in image quote [4], indicate a decrease in net revenues by 22.9% and a significant increase in operating income by 100%. The variance in operating income shows that while net revenues decreased, the operating income increased due to factors like currency, price, and cost/other adjustments. The text quote [7] mentions that net cash provided by operating activities decreased by $0.3 billion, but excluding unfavorable currency movements, it increased by $0.2 billion. This suggests that currency fluctuations had a negative impact on cash flow, which could be related to the global economic environment influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nIn summary, the decline in shipment volumes and restructuring costs in Latin America & Canada led to lower revenues and increased operating income due to cost management and currency effects, as reflected in the financial data and shipment volume changes.\n\n![The overall shipment volume decreased by 11.6% from 2019 to 2020, with a significant increase in heated tobacco units](image3)\n\n![Net revenues decreased by 22.9% but operating income increased by 100% due to various factors](image"}

This could be due to competitive pressures, lower interest rates, or higher costs associated with managing the loan portfolio.\n- The decrease in net interest yield on average Card Member loans, as seen in the table, further supports the idea that the company's profitability from these loans was not as strong as expected.\n\nOverall, while the company managed to increase the amount of loans extended, the net interest income growth was modest, indicating a need to focus on improving the yield on these loans or managing costs more effectively to enhance profitability.\n\nThe company's financial performance was positively impacted by the increase in billed business and non-interest revenues, but the slower growth in net interest income highlights the need for"}

This reflects the company's investment in employee incentives, which not only enhances employee motivation but also contributes positively to shareholders' equity by increasing the value of equity instruments.

Adjustments for depreciation, amortization, and share-based compensation are included in the operating activities, impacting the net income. The net income, along with other comprehensive income, adds to the Retained Earnings, as seen in the shareholders' equity statement.

According to the table in image5, the sale of WFAM resulted in a substantial decrease in the total WFAM assets under management. In 2021, the balance of WFAM assets under management started at $603.0 billion, with inflows of $69.3 billion and outflows of $(96.8) billion, leading to a market impact of $11.6 billion. The most notable impact was the sale of WFAM itself, which reduced the balance by $(587.1) billion, bringing the end-of-period balance to $603.0 billion minus $587.1 billion, resulting in a net decrease of $26.1 billion.\n\n### Broader Effects on Income and Balance Sheet\n\n1. **Income Statement Impact**:\n   - **Noninterest Income**: The sale of WFAM contributed to an increase in noninterest income. According to text quote [2], the company recorded a net gain of $269 million from the sale of WFAM. This gain is reflected in the income statement as an increase in noninterest income, which is a significant factor in the overall financial performance.\n   - **Total Revenue**: The increase in noninterest income from the sale of WFAM contributed to the overall increase in total revenue.

This resulted in a net decrease in net interest income of $14,120 million. The net interest spread, which is the difference between the rates on earning assets and the cost of interest-bearing liabilities, was affected by these changes. The decrease in net interest income outpaced the decrease in net interest expense, leading to a reduction in the net interest spread.\n\nThe main contributing factors to these changes were lower interest rates and reduced deposit and funding costs. The text quote [6] mentions that the decrease in net interest income was primarily driven by lower interest rates, partially offset by reduced deposit and funding costs. Additionally, the deployment of excess deposits into securities and an additional day of interest accrual contributed to the decrease.

Additionally, the \"Other\" category contributed positively with a $364 million increase. \n\n![Cash flow summary table](image2) provides a detailed breakdown of cash flow activities. For the consolidated segment, the net cash provided by operating activities was $7.20 billion in 2021, up by $871 million compared to 2020. This increase was primarily due to higher profit before taxes adjusted for non-cash items, including higher accruals for short-term incentive compensation, and lower payments for short-term incentive compensation. However, this was partially offset by increased working capital requirements, particularly changes in accounts receivable and inventory.\n\nFor the Machinery, Energy & Transportation (ME&T) segment, the consolidated operating cash flow was $6 billion in 2021, meeting the targets set at the 2019 Investor Day. The segment's profit was $2.768 billion in 2021, a 15% increase from $2.405 billion in 2020, driven by higher sales volume and favorable price realization, despite higher manufacturing costs and SG&A/R&D expenses.\n\nIn summary, both the consolidated and ME&T segments showed improved operating profits and net cash provided by operating activities in 2021 compared to 2020, with the consolidated segment achieving a significant increase in operating profit and ME&T meeting its financial targets.\n\nThe consolidated operating profit for 2021 was $6,878 million, up from $4,553 million in 2020, while the net cash provided by operating activities was $7.20 billion, up by $871 million.

The gross unrecognized tax benefits increased from $1,056 million in 2019 to $1,829 million in 2020, as indicated in image3. This increase was driven by both current year tax positions, which rose from $512 million in 2019 to $416 million in 2020, and prior year tax positions, which increased from $2 million in 2019 to $120 million in 2020. The decrease in prior year tax positions from $96 million in 2019 to $130 million in 2020 was offset by settlements and statute of limitations lapses, which were minimal in 2020 compared to previous years. This suggests that the company faced more complex tax positions in 2020, potentially due to new or unresolved tax issues.\n\nIn terms of common share repurchases, the company repurchased 14 million shares in 2020 compared to 22 million in 2019, as shown in image1. The average price per share decreased from $245.97 in 2019 to $300.58 in 2020, and the aggregate cost of repurchases was $4,250 million in 2020 versus $5,500 million in 2019. The Board authorized remaining shares for repurchase increased from 72 million in 2019 to 58 million in 2020, indicating a slight reduction in the authorization.\n\nThe implications for the company's financial position are multifaceted. The increase in gross unrecognized tax benefits suggests potential future tax liabilities, which could impact cash flow and effective tax rates. However, the decrease in share repurchases and the lower average price per share might indicate a strategic shift in capital allocation, possibly to address tax liabilities or other financial obligations. The company's ability to maintain a share repurchase program despite the increase in tax liabilities reflects its commitment to optimizing capital structure and returns to shareholders, albeit with a cautious approach in 2020.\n\n![Gross Unrecognized Tax Benefits Increase](image3) ![Common Share Repurchases Decrease](image1)\n\nThe company's"}

Excluding unfavorable currency movements of $0.5 billion, the net cash provided increased by $0.2 billion. This indicates a slight decline in cash flow from operations.\n- **Investing Activities**: Net cash used in investing activities decreased by $0.7 billion in 2020 compared to 2019. This decrease was mainly due to lower capital expenditures and higher cash collateral posted for derivatives, partially offset by the deconsolidation of RBH.\n- **Financing Activities**: Net cash used in financing activities increased by $0.4 billion in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to higher payments to noncontrolling interests and dividends, offset by debt activity.\n\n### Image Analysis:\n- **Image2 (Cash Flow Table)**: This table provides detailed cash flow information for operating, investing, and financing activities over three years.

The evaluation method involves a comparative analysis of Toyota’s share price against the Nikkei stock average at the end of the previous fiscal year. The reference values are Toyota’s share price at 6,501 yen and the Nikkei average at 18,917 yen, which helps in assessing the corporate value and shareholder returns.\n\n**Shareholder Value Indicators:**\n- **Dividend Payments:** Toyota prioritizes stable and continuous dividend payments, aiming for a consolidated payout ratio of 30%, as mentioned in text quote [7].

According to the table in image1, the discount rate's increase led to a decrease in the defined benefit obligation by €242 million in 2021, while a decrease resulted in an increase of €271 million. Compensation increases had a minimal impact, with an increase of €16 million, and pension progression increased the obligation by €158 million. These changes reflect the sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to actuarial assumptions, as noted in text quote [1].\n\nImage2 provides insight into the plan assets, showing an increase in total plan assets from €2,813 million in 2020 to €3,259 million in 2021. This growth is partly due to the rise in fixed income securities, particularly corporate bonds, which increased from €1,175 million to €1,369 million. The table also highlights the use of derivatives, which were €189 million in 2021, up from €180 million in 2020, indicating efforts to manage risks as mentioned in text quote [8].\n\nText quote [3] discusses the Conditional Capital 2021, which was used to grant shares to bondholders, but this is not directly related to the impact of actuarial assumptions on the defined benefit obligation. However, it underscores the company's financial flexibility in managing liabilities.\n\nThe actuarial gains and losses in image3 show a significant change in financial assumptions, with a decrease of €26 million in 2021 compared to an increase of €72 million in 2020. This shift, along with demographic changes, contributed to a total actuarial loss of €22 million in 2021, contrasting with a gain of €67 million in 2020. These fluctuations in actuarial gains and losses are critical in understanding the volatility of the defined benefit obligation, as noted in text quote [4].\n\nIn summary, the changes in actuarial assumptions, particularly the discount rate and pension progression, directly affected the defined benefit obligation, while the growth in plan assets, including corporate bonds and derivatives, reflects the company's strategic financial management to mitigate risks and comply with pension regulations.\n\n![Impact of"}

The total revenues for both segments combined also decreased by 10% from 2019 to 2020. \n\nImage4 shows the pie charts for total revenues by segment, indicating that the U.S. segment's share decreased from 54% in 2019 to 50% in 2020, while the International Operated Markets segment's share decreased from 37% to 41%. This shift suggests a relative decline in the U.S. segment's contribution to total revenues.\n\nThe decline in the U.S. segment's sales can be attributed to the strategic marketing investments and promotional activities, as mentioned in text quote [4], which aimed to accelerate recovery and drive growth. However, these efforts were partly offset by the positive sales performance in the U.S. due to the free Thank You Meals, as noted in text quote [1]. The significant decrease in the International Operated Markets segment, particularly in countries like France, the U.K., Germany, Italy, and Spain, was driven by temporary closures and limited operations, as stated in text quote [3]. The image3 data also highlights that the International Operated Markets segment had a more substantial revenue decline compared to the U.S., reflecting the impact of COVID-19 on these international markets.\n\nText quote [10] further supports this, noting a 13% decrease in total restaurant margins in 2020, primarily due to sales declines in the International Operated Markets segment.

This expansion was driven by the company's ability to identify and secure quality retail sites in high-traffic locations, such as AA, A, or B-grade shopping centers and malls, which facilitated a rapid and cost-effective store roll-out. Lovisa's strategy emphasized the importance of a homogenized store layout and size, averaging 50 square meters, to streamline operations and reduce costs.

According to the image quotes, the net deferred tax asset increased from $119 million in 2019 to $253 million in 2020, a substantial rise of $134 million. This increase can be attributed to several factors:\n\n1. **Additions to Deferred Tax Assets**: The image quotes indicate that additions to deferred tax assets based on tax positions related to the current year were consistent at $3 million each year. However, additions for tax positions of prior years were higher in 2020, amounting to $35 million compared to $63 million in 2019 and only $1 million in 2018.

This substantial reduction in 2020 likely reflects the effective settlement of uncertain tax positions, which reduced the deferred tax liabilities and increased the net deferred tax asset.\n\n3. **Settlements with Tax Authorities**: Although there were no settlements in 2020, the reduction in deferred tax liabilities due to prior-year tax positions and the effective settlement of uncertain tax positions contributed to the increase in the net deferred tax asset.\n\n4. **Valuation Allowance**: The valuation allowance decreased by $1 million in 2020, which also positively impacted the net deferred tax asset by reducing the deferred tax liabilities.\n\nThe text quotes further support this analysis by mentioning that reductions for tax positions of prior years in 2020 included a $249 million tax benefit for the effective settlement of a depreciation-related uncertain tax position. This settlement, along with the decrease in valuation allowance, contributed to the increase in the net deferred tax asset.\n\n![Net Deferred Tax Asset Increase](image3) shows the net deferred tax asset figures, highlighting the significant rise from $119 million in 2019 to $253 million in 2020.

This indicates that IBM invested more in long-term assets, potentially to support its financing operations [4].\n- **Long-Term Debt:** The decrease in long-term debt by $3,560 million from December 31, 2019, to December 31, 2020, was primarily due to lower funding requirements as a result of the decline in financing assets, aligning with IBM's portfolio management strategy [6].\n- **Cash Flows:** The cash flow statement shows a net use of cash in financing activities of $9,721 million in 2020, compared to a net source of cash of $9,042 million in 2019. This change was driven by early retirements and debt maturities of $11,267 million, partially offset by issuances of $8,982 million [10].\n- **Equity:** Total equity decreased by $258 million in 2020, mainly due to dividends paid and a decline in accumulated other comprehensive income, partially offset by increases from net income and common stock [7].\n\n**Image Analysis:**\n- **Image2** shows that noncurrent assets increased from $113,767 million in 2019 to $116,806 million in 2020, and long-term debt decreased from $54,102 million in 2019 to $54,355 million in 2020.

This drop was primarily driven by the impact of COVID-19, with lower spending on travel and entertainment remaining lower compared to 2019. However, debit card purchase volumes increased by $23.8 billion to $384.5 billion, indicating a shift towards digital transactions as businesses reopened and spending improved in the second half of 2020.\n- **Outstanding Balances:** Credit card outstanding balances decreased by $18.9 billion to $78.7 billion, with 97% managed in Consumer Banking. This reduction was due to lower retail spending and higher payments, while net charge-offs decreased to $2.3 billion from $2.9 billion, partly due to government stimulus benefits and payment deferrals associated with COVID-19.\n\n**Home Equity Metrics:**\n- **Outstanding Balances:** Home equity outstanding balances decreased by $5.9 billion in 2020, with 80% in Consumer Banking.

The increase in debit card purchases indicates a shift towards safer, digital transactions as consumers adapted to new spending habits.

The report highlights that fluctuations in the market prices of these commodities directly affect the company's revenues, cash flows, and asset values. For coal, the financial impact is substantial, with a US$1 per tonne increase in metallurgical coal prices impacting profit after taxation by $24 million and underlying EBITDA by $35 million, as shown in `![{Financial Impact of Price Changes}](image1)`. Similarly, a US$1 per tonne increase in energy coal prices impacts profit after taxation by $9 million and underlying EBITDA by $13 million. The report also notes that lower volumes decreased Underlying EBITDA by US$168 million for Coal in FY2021, driven by increased maintenance costs and stripping volumes, which were partially offset by cost reduction initiatives.\n\nFor nickel, the impact is less pronounced but still notable. A US¢1 per pound increase in nickel prices impacts both profit after taxation and underlying EBITDA by $1 million, as indicated in `![{Financial Impact of Price Changes}](image1)`. The report mentions that nickel prices benefited from positive investor sentiment and strong demand, with a major nickel producer's announcement leading to a brief correction in March, followed by a rebound supported by supply disruptions and falling stocks.\n\nThe key drivers behind these impacts include market price volatility, which can affect the timing or feasibility of project developments and expansions. The report emphasizes that BHP's average realised sales price for FY2021 was US$16,250 per tonne, up from US$13,860 per tonne in FY2020, driven by strong demand and supply disruptions. Additionally, the report notes that BHP's focus on cost reduction and productivity initiatives aims to mitigate the effects of increased stripping requirements and maintenance costs, as seen in the Queensland Coal unit costs expected to be between US$80 and US$90 per tonne in FY2022, with mine plan optimisation and efficiency uplifts expected to offset these increases.\n\nIn summary, changes in commodity prices, particularly coal and nickel, have a direct and significant impact on BHP's financial results, with coal prices having a more substantial effect on EBITDA due to higher volumes and prices, and nickel prices contributing to profitability through market demand and investor sentiment.\n\nThe answer is that changes in commodity prices, especially coal and nickel, impact"}

In contrast, the noninterest income increased from $4,916 million in 2020 to $10,036 million in 2021, a notable 104% increase.

However, we can infer that dividends are paid out of retained earnings, which increased significantly from 2020 to 2021. The text states that retained earnings at December 31, 2021, increased by $17.6 billion, predominantly due to $21.5 billion of Wells Fargo net income, partially offset by $3.7 billion of common and preferred stock dividends. This indicates that dividends were paid out of the net income, which would affect the dividend payout ratio.\n- **Book Value**: The text does not provide direct information on the book value. However, the book value per common share is mentioned in the text, which is a component of the book value. The text states that the book value per common share was $4.99 in 2021, $0.43 in 2020, and $4.12 in 2019.\n\n**Image Quote Analysis:**\n- **Dividend Payout Ratio**: Image1 includes the Dividend Payout Ratio as a performance metric.

The image description does not provide specific values, but it mentions that the book value per common share is included in the table.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- **Dividend Payout Ratio**: The dividend payout ratio would have likely increased from 2019 to 2021 due to the significant increase in net income and the payment of dividends. The text indicates that dividends were paid out of the net income, which suggests a higher payout ratio in 2021 compared to 2020 and 2019.\n- **Book Value**: The book value per common share increased from $4.12 in 2019 to $4.99 in 2021, indicating a positive trend over the three-year period.\n\n![Trend in Div"}

The total shipment volume for the region decreased by 11.6% due to the decline in cigarette sales, which was offset by the growth in heated tobacco units.\n\nThe factors contributing to these changes are varied. In East Asia & Australia, the decline in cigarette sales was attributed to lower volume, while the increase in heated tobacco units was driven by higher shipment volume, particularly in Japan. In Latin America & Canada, the decline in cigarette sales was primarily due to lower market share and reduced product availability, as well as the impact of the pandemic on consumption patterns. The increase in heated tobacco units was likely due to favorable pricing and market trends favoring alternative tobacco products.\n\n![Comparison of sales changes in East Asia & Australia and Latin America & Canada](image2) ![Shipment volume changes in Latin America & Canada](image4)\n\nThe decline in cigarette sales and the increase in heated tobacco units in both regions highlight shifts in consumer preferences and market dynamics, with heated tobacco units gaining traction as a result of favorable pricing and product availability."}

ENBREL, a key product, experienced a decrease in sales in 2020, with a 4% drop from the previous year, totaling $4,996 million. This decline was primarily due to lower unit demand and a reduction in net selling price, as noted in text quotes [4] and [7]. The market share of ENBREL has been consistently declining, exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, which slowed the growth rate of the rheumatology market [4]. Additionally, the approval of biosimilar versions of ENBREL in April 2019 and ongoing patent litigations have posed competitive threats, as mentioned in text quotes [8] and [1]. The sales pattern for ENBREL historically shows lower sales in the first quarter due to benefit plan changes, insurance reverification, and increased co-pay expenses, which continued into 2021 [2] and [4].\n\nIn contrast, Prolia saw a significant increase in sales, particularly in 2020, with a 3% rise to $2,763 million.

In 2020, the gross margin percentage was 11.20%, while in 2022, it was 10.48%, a decrease of 0.72 percentage points. This decline was primarily due to several factors, including decreases in core merchandise categories, particularly in fresh foods and foods and sundries, a LIFO charge for higher merchandise costs, and increased rewards. However, the impact of gasoline price inflation on net sales was excluded, and warehouse ancillary and other businesses, especially gasoline, positively contributed to the gross margin, partially offset by e-commerce.

The statement of changes in equity (image1) shows that the company's total equity increased from DKK 57,593 million in 2019 to DKK 63,325 million in 2020. This increase is primarily due to the net profit of DKK 5,957 million and other comprehensive income, which includes adjustments like the transfer of cash flow hedge reserve to intangible assets.

This decrease is primarily due to a significant decline in retained earnings, which fell from $11,881 million to $11,495 million, a decrease of $386 million. The reduction in retained earnings is influenced by several factors, including a decrease in net income from $8,060 million in 2021 to $3,135 million in 2020, and the impact of foreign currency translation adjustments, which increased from a loss of $2,229 million in 2020 to a loss of $2,392 million in 2021. Additionally, the net unrealized pension and other postretirement benefits decreased from a loss of $731 million in 2020 to a loss of $576 million in 2021.\n\n![Summary of Shareholders' Equity Changes](image4) illustrates these changes, showing the detailed breakdown of retained earnings and other comprehensive income. The table highlights the impact of foreign currency translation adjustments, which are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI), a component of shareholders' equity. The substantial foreign currency translation adjustment of $163 million in 2021, compared to $40 million in 2020, further contributed to the decrease in shareholders' equity.\n\nThe decrease in retained earnings and the increase in foreign currency translation adjustments, along with other comprehensive income items, indicate that the company faced challenges in maintaining its equity position. Despite these adjustments, the company's total assets remained relatively stable, with a slight decrease from $191,367 million in 2020 to $188,548 million in 2021. This stability in assets, combined with the decrease in equity, suggests that the company's financial position is under pressure, particularly in managing foreign currency risks and maintaining profitability.\n\nIn summary, the decline in retained earnings and the increase in foreign currency translation adjustments in accumulated other comprehensive income significantly affected the company's shareholders' equity, reflecting broader economic and financial challenges faced during the period.\n\n![Summary of Shareholders' Equity Changes](image4)"}

This alignment is reflected in their perceptions of significant differences between the parties, as shown in image2, which indicates a considerable portion of the Latino community views the parties as distinct in their approaches and policies.\n\n![Alignment of Latino voters with parties](image1) ![Perceptions of party differences among Hispanics](image2)\n\nThe alignment of Latino registered voters with the Democratic and Republican parties has remained stable over recent years, with a two-to-one margin favoring the Democratic Party.

This suggests that those closer to their immigrant roots are more likely to perceive a higher concentration of Hispanic neighbors compared to those further removed from their immigrant heritage.\n\n![Perceptions of Hispanic Identity in Neighbors](image1)\n\nIn contrast, self-identified non-Hispanics with Hispanic ancestry are less likely to perceive a high concentration of Hispanic neighbors, with only 17% believing that \"All\" or \"Most\" of their neighbors are Hispanic, as shown in image1. This indicates a greater dispersion of Hispanic ancestry among non-Hispanics compared to self-identified Hispanics.\n\nFurthermore, image4 provides additional context on racial identification, showing that as generations progress, the percentage of self-identified Hispanics identifying as Hispanic or Latino decreases. For example, 69% of self-identified Hispanics identify as Hispanic or Latino, compared to 46% of third or higher generation Hispanics. This demographic shift may influence perceptions of neighborhood identity, as those with less direct ties to Hispanic origins might see fewer Hispanic neighbors.\n\nOverall, the data indicates that self-identified Hispanics who are closer to their immigrant roots are more likely to perceive a higher concentration of Hispanic neighbors, while those further removed from these roots are less likely to do so.\n\n**Answer:** Self-identified Hispanics who are closer to their immigrant roots are more likely to perceive a higher concentration of Hispanic neighbors, with foreign-born and second-generation Hispanics showing a higher percentage believing that \"All\" or \"Most\" of their neighbors are Hispanic compared to third or higher generation Hispanics."}

This preference is consistent across all age groups, but there is a notable difference in the degree of support. Younger Americans, particularly those aged 18 to 29, show a strong inclination towards prioritizing human rights, with 76% advocating for this stance. This is reflected in the image quote [3], which shows that among this age group, 76% prefer promoting human rights over economic relations. In contrast, older Americans, especially those aged 50 and older, also favor human rights, with 71% supporting this view, as indicated in the same image quote. \n\nThe text quote [2] further elaborates that majorities of every age group have an unfavorable view of China, with older Americans being more negative. This negative perception might contribute to their strong preference for human rights over economic relations. Additionally, quote [9] highlights that Americans aged 50 and older are more likely to have no confidence in Xi, the Chinese leader, which could also influence their stance on human rights.\n\nThe image quote [3] provides a detailed breakdown, showing that among those aged 50 and older, 71% prioritize human rights, compared to 24% who prioritize economic relations. This aligns with the text quote [10], which states that a majority favors promoting human rights in China over prioritizing economic relations. The image quote [3] also shows that among Republicans, 70% prioritize human rights, while Democrats lean more towards human rights with 78%, indicating a bipartisan agreement on this issue.\n\nIn summary, while all age groups prefer promoting human rights over economic relations with China, younger Americans are more inclined towards this preference compared to older Americans, who still strongly support human rights but are slightly more divided.\n\n![Preference for human rights over economic relations by age group](image3)\n\nThe image [3] clearly illustrates the preference for human rights over economic relations across different age groups, showing that younger Americans are more supportive of human rights compared to older Americans."}

According to the data, self-identified Hispanics are more likely to identify with their ancestral national origins compared to non-Hispanics. For instance, among self-identified Hispanics, 82% of immigrants and 69% of second-generation individuals feel very or somewhat connected to their country of origin. However, this connection drops to 44% among third or higher generations. In contrast, non-Hispanics with Hispanic ancestry are much less likely to identify with their heritage, with only 59% of self-identified non-Hispanics being seen as Hispanic by passersby, and this share falls further across generations.\n\n![Heritage Identification Differences](image4)\n\nThis trend is further illustrated by the generational makeup of self-identified Hispanics and non-Hispanics. A majority of self-identified Hispanics are from the third or higher generation (65%), whereas a significant portion of self-identified non-Hispanics are from the third or higher generation (96%). This indicates that as Hispanics assimilate and distance themselves from their immigrant roots, their identification with Hispanic heritage diminishes, leading to a higher proportion of non-Hispanics in the later generations.\n\n![Generational Makeup](image4)\n\nAdditionally, the data shows that the foreign-born and second-generation self-identified Hispanics are more likely to have Hispanic spouses, with 93% of married immigrant Hispanics having a Hispanic spouse, compared to 63% of second-generation married Hispanics and only 35% of third or higher generation married Hispanics. This suggests that as generations progress, the likelihood of maintaining Hispanic heritage through marriage decreases.\n\n![Marriage Patterns](image6)\n\nIn summary, the generational breakdown highlights that self-identified Hispanics are more likely to maintain a strong connection to their Hispanic heritage, especially in the earlier generations, while non-Hispanics with Hispanic ancestry tend to assimilate and distance themselves from their heritage over time.\n\n**Answer:** The generational breakdown reveals that self-identified Hispanics are more likely to maintain a strong connection to their Hispanic heritage, especially in the earlier generations, while non-Hispanics with Hispanic ancestry tend to assimilate and distance themselves from their heritage over time."}

By 2015, this perception had reversed, with 56% of the population concerned that policies had gone too far in restricting civil liberties, and only 28% worried that they had not gone far enough to protect the country [3][8].

This aligns with the text quote that younger Americans approve of the WHO’s performance more than older Americans [1].\n\nThe text also notes that evaluations of the U.S. COVID-19 response are heavily colored by partisanship, but education plays a significant role in shaping these views. More educated Americans are more likely to believe the U.S. should help other countries deal with their problems and think the U.S. can learn from other countries about effective ways to combat coronavirus [2, 6]. This suggests that higher education levels correlate with a more global perspective, which may influence how they perceive the U.S.'s domestic response.\n\nIn summary, the data from both text and images indicate that higher educational attainment is associated with a more critical view of the U.S. COVID-19 response, with a greater emphasis on learning from other countries and a belief in the U.S.'s global responsibilities.\n\n![More educated Americans are more critical of the U.S. COVID-19 response](image4)"}

Initially, the population surged dramatically in the late 1800s, peaking at 14,096 in 1890, as indicated by the population data in image3. This rapid growth was influenced by the Transcontinental Railroad Act and the Homestead Act of 1862, which transformed the region into a booming agricultural state, as mentioned in text quote [9]. The railroad facilitated westward expansion, and the Homestead Act encouraged settlement by providing land to pioneers, leading to a surge in population.\n\nHowever, after reaching its peak, the population began to decline. Text quote [2] notes that while Aurora experienced recent population gains, other towns struggled, likely due to farm consolidation, which is further detailed in text quote [4].

This consolidation, driven by mechanization and increased operational costs, is a key factor in the population decline.\n\nThe ethnic diversity of the county, with clusters of Danish, Swedish, German, Irish, and Russian Mennonite settlers, contributed to the establishment of strong religious congregations and rural school districts, as described in text quotes [7] and [8]. These communities, such as the Danish Lutheran Church in Kronborg (image1) and the Swedish culture in Hordville (image4), served as focal points for the area, but as the agricultural landscape changed, these communities faced challenges that contributed to the population decline.\n\nThe overland travel and railroads, which initially brought settlers, later intensified travel and migration, as noted in text quote [5]. The image of the St. John’s Lutheran Church in Kronborg (image1) and the St. John’s complex (text quote [7]) highlight the cultural and religious significance of these communities, which may have struggled to maintain their numbers as the agricultural economy evolved.\n\nIn summary, the population trends in Hamilton County were shaped by initial growth due to railroad and land policies, followed by a decline due to agricultural consolidation and mechanization, which are reflected in both the text quotes and the population data in image3.\n\n![Population Trends in"}

In image1, which breaks down the responses by political affiliation, Hispanic Democrats (Dem/Lean Dem) show a higher percentage of those who view the Democratic Party as caring \"Somewhat well\" (22%) and \"Very/Extremely well\" (13%) compared to Hispanic Republicans (Rep/Lean Rep), who have 38% viewing it \"Somewhat well\" and 34% viewing it \"Very/Extremely well.\" This visual representation underscores the text's findings, showing that Hispanic Democrats are more likely to perceive the Democratic Party positively.\n\nAdditionally, [10] reveals that among Hispanic Democrats and Democratic leaners, a strong majority of conservatives and moderates (75%) and liberals (84%) alike say the statement \"the Republican Party really cares about Hispanics\" does not describe their views well. Meanwhile, among Hispanic Republicans and Republican leaners, 41% of conservatives say the statement describes their views well, while 25% of moderates and liberals say it describes their views somewhat well.

According to the text, internet use and broadband adoption among seniors each fall off notably starting at approximately age 75. For instance, 74% of seniors aged 65-69 go online, and 65% have broadband at home, while this drops to 37% and 21% for those aged 80 and older, respectively. This trend is visually represented in `image4`, which shows a clear decline in both online usage and broadband availability as age increases.\n\nAdditionally, the text highlights that social networking site usage among seniors also decreases with age. For example, 54% of internet users aged 65-69 use social networking sites, compared with just 27% of those aged 80 and older. `image1` illustrates this further with a pie chart showing that 27% of seniors use social networking sites, while 32% go online without using such services, and 41% do not go online at all.\n\nThe text also notes that other subgroups of older adults, such as those with low household incomes or those who have not attended college, tend to be much less likely to use the internet and broadband. `image2` supports this by showing that only 18% of those aged 65 and over own a smartphone, compared to 55% of all adults, and 27% own a tablet or e-reader compared to 43% of all adults.\n\nOverall, the data from both text and images indicate a significant drop-off in internet and broadband usage among seniors starting around age 75, with even more pronounced declines in older age groups. This trend is consistent across various aspects of online activity, including social networking and device ownership.\n\nIn conclusion, internet and broadband usage among seniors decreases significantly with age, with the most substantial drop-off occurring around age 75.

Overall adoption levels are similar among seniors who have not attended college, as well as among those with an annual household income of less than $30,000 per year. [2] In total, some $39\\%$ of older adults fall into one of these two categories, and they are significantly less likely than seniors who do not face these physical challenges to go online ($49\\%$ vs. $66\\%$), to have broadband at home ($38\\%$ vs. $53\\%$), to own a cell phone ($69\\%$ vs. $82\\%$), and to have a smartphone ($13\\%$ vs. $22\\%$). [3] Many seniors face physical challenges to using new digital devices. Not only do seniors use many common technologies at relatively low rates, they also face unique barriers and challenges to increasing those adoption levels. For example, many seniors have physical conditions or health issues that make using these tools a challenge: $23\\%$ of older adults indicate that they have a “physical or health condition that makes reading difficult or challenging,” while $29\\%$ have a “disability, handicap, or chronic disease that prevents them from fully participating in many common daily activities.” [8] \n\n![The image is a bar chart comparing two groups: \"All adults\" and \"65+\" for two categories. 1. **Physical or health condition makes reading difficult or challenging:** - All adults: 16% - 65+: 23% 2. **Disability"}

Women account for the majority of healthcare practitioners and technicians but are underrepresented in several other STEM occupational clusters, particularly in computer jobs and engineering.\n- **Text [7]** highlights that among college-educated workers, the share of women earning a STEM degree varies widely and generally corresponds with the share of women in these occupational clusters. Among all college-educated workers who majored in a health professions field, 81% are female, but just 16% of college-educated workers who majored in engineering are women.\n- **Text [9]** notes that on average, women’s representation in STEM jobs is lower among those employed with advanced degrees.

This component is crucial for encoding visual information into a format that can be efficiently stored and retrieved.\n   - **Feature Index**: Stores the embeddings and indexes them for quick retrieval. The use of an index system, such as the HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World) algorithm, reduces the dimensionality of the embeddings, making the retrieval process faster and more efficient.\n   - **Memory ($\\mathcal{M}$)**: External storage for embeddings. This memory bank holds a large volume of multimodal embeddings, allowing the system to access a broad range of information beyond the immediate context window of the MLLMs.\n\n2. **Retrieving & Ranking**:\n   - **Inference Stage**: An image is encoded into embeddings, similar to the process in the multimodal retriever.\n   - **Top-K Categories**: Retrieved from memory based on similarity. The system retrieves the top-$k$ class names most similar to the input image using a k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) approach.\n   - **Ranking**: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are used to refine and rank these categories. The MLLMs leverage their extensive knowledge base to rank the retrieved candidates, ensuring more accurate and contextually aware classification predictions.\n   - **Final Prediction**: Outputs the predicted label, such as \"Monarch butterfly,\" after the ranking process.\n\n![The RAR pipeline combines a multimodal retriever and ranking process to enhance recognition tasks.](image3)\n\nThe pipeline integrates these components to bridge the gap between the broad generalization capabilities of MLLMs and the need for precise, fine-grained categorization.

The critic model provides feedback, which can come from various sources such as external knowledge bases, trained models, code interpreters, or search engines. These external tools assist in refining the outputs, ensuring they are more accurate and factually correct.

The text quotes and image4 provide key insights into this relationship.\n\nFrom the text quotes, it is evident that adversarial training significantly improves the model's performance when evaluated on adversarial distractors. For instance, when the model is trained on adversarial distractors, its performance on adversarial evaluation data improves from 46.84 F1 to 60.10 F1. This indicates that adversarial training helps the model to better handle distractors that are selected in a way that challenges its ability to identify the correct answer, thereby enhancing its robustness and generalization capabilities.\n\nImage4 further supports this conclusion by showing a detailed comparison of F1 scores under different training and evaluation conditions. The table in image4 highlights that the model trained on adversarial data (Adversarial) and evaluated on adversarial data (Adversarial) achieves a higher F1 score of 60.10 compared to the model trained on original data (Original) and evaluated on adversarial data, which scores 46.84. This improvement underscores the effectiveness of adversarial training in preparing the model to handle adversarial scenarios.\n\nAdditionally, the text quote [4] mentions that when the model is re-trained on adversarial distractors, its accuracy increases from 46.84 F1 to 60.10 F1 on adversarial distractors, reinforcing the notion that adversarial training is beneficial for improving performance on challenging evaluation data.\n\n![Impact of Adversarial Training on Model Performance](image4)\n\nIn summary, adversarial training helps the model to recover its original accuracy on adversarial distractors, indicating that it becomes more robust and capable of handling distractors that are selected to challenge its reasoning abilities. This is crucial for improving the model's performance in real-world scenarios where distractors may be adversarially selected.\n\n**Answer:** Adversarial training significantly improves the model's performance on adversarial distractors, as evidenced by the increase in F1 score from 46.84 to 60.10 when evaluated on adversarial data."}

Specifically, quote [3] mentions that YiSi-1 and UNI can reach high system-level correlations, up to .947 (Chinese-English) or .936 (English-German). However, quote [9] states that the YiSi metrics achieve the highest correlations in several language pairs and are not significantly outperformed by any other metrics for almost all language pairs. This suggests that YiSi metrics are strong candidates for high correlation values.\n\nLooking at the image quotes, image2 is a table that presents performance metrics for different language pairs on the \"newstest2019\" dataset. The table includes both correlation metrics and QE metrics. The QE metrics are marked especially in QE tasks, and the correlation values are bolded if they are particularly strong.

According to the text quotes, when gold paragraphs are withheld, the performance of single-paragraph BERT drops to 38.06 F1 in the open-domain setting [3], highlighting the model's struggle with multi-hop reasoning without these critical pieces of information. However, when gold paragraphs are reintroduced, the F1 score improves to 53.12 F1, demonstrating their crucial role in enhancing model accuracy [5]. This indicates that gold paragraphs are essential for guiding the model to the correct answers, especially in open-domain settings where TF-IDF retrieval often fails to locate them [10].\n\nThe text also discusses the use of adversarial distractors, where the model's accuracy drops to 46.84 F1 when evaluated on adversarial distractors but recovers to 60.10 F1 when re-trained on these distractors [4]. This suggests that while adversarial distractors can challenge the model, re-training on them can mitigate some performance loss, though they are still insufficient for inducing multi-hop reasoning [7]. The table in image3 further supports this, showing that models like QFE and DFGN + BERT achieve higher F1 scores in the distractor setting compared to the open-domain setting, with scores like 68.06 and 68.49 respectively [3].\n\nImage5 provides a visual representation of these findings, showing that the \"Distractor\" setting yields the highest F1 score of 67.08, while the \"Open-domain 500 Paragraphs\" setting without gold paragraphs results in a lower score of 39.12.

The ongoing challenge is developing methods to select strong distractors that induce multi-hop reasoning, as indicated by the persistent performance gaps in open-domain settings [7].\n\n![The impact of gold paragraphs and distractors on F1 scores](image5)\n\nThe inclusion of gold paragraphs and distractors affects F1 scores by enhancing model"}

The performance drop when shuffling words in the training set (as shown in quote [3] and reflected in the \"Shuffled\" condition in image1) underscores the importance of word-order for sentiment analysis. This is consistent with the findings in quote [2], where the positional information of words is hypothesized to be beneficial for predicting sentiment. The results on the Yelp dataset in image1 also show a slight decrease in performance when the training set is shuffled, reinforcing the conclusion that word-order is vital for sentiment analysis accuracy in LSTM models.\n\n![The table shows performance metrics for different datasets](image1) ![The table compares model performance on various NLP tasks](image3)\n\nIn summary, word-order information significantly affects sentiment analysis accuracy in LSTM models. The performance metrics in image1 and the detailed analysis in quotes [2] and [3] demonstrate that LSTM models, which can leverage word-order, achieve better results in sentiment analysis tasks compared to models like SWEM, which do not. The drop in performance when word-order is removed (as seen in the \"Shuffled\" condition) highlights the critical role of word-order in capturing nuanced sentiment differences.\n\n**Answer:** Word-order information significantly enhances sentiment analysis accuracy in LSTM models by allowing"}

This means that there is a single path from the first variable to the last variable, with each variable having exactly one parent and one child, except for the first and last variables in the chain.\n\nFrom the image quotes, `image1` provides a flowchart describing the data-generating process, which includes options for common causal graphs such as confounding, mediation, collision, diamond, chain, and fork. The chain-type graph is explicitly mentioned as one of these options. \n\nIn a chain-type causal graph, the number of directed edges is equal to the number of variables minus one. For example, if there are three variables in the chain (X1 → X2 → X3), there are two directed edges (X1 to X2 and X2 to X3).\n\nGiven this information, the chain-type causal graph has a specific structure that can be visualized and counted directly from the description provided in the paper and the flowchart in `image1`.\n\n![Chain-type causal graph with two directed edges](image1)\n\n**Answer:** According to the definition in the paper, a chain-type causal graph has two directed edges."}

According to the text quote [4], when repetition control is introduced, the setting that should produce 100% questions (z=10) now only produces 79.67% questions. This reduction is primarily due to the weighted decoding feature extrep bigram, which discourages bigrams that have appeared in previous utterances. This feature prevents the model from producing common question-related bigrams like \"do you\" and \"what is,\" which are frequently used in questions. To address this issue, an extra setting z=10 (boost) was introduced, where the extrep bigram is not used during beam search but is still applied during reranking. This modification allows the model to produce necessary question-asking bigrams, resulting in a 99.54% question-asking rate, albeit at the cost of slightly increased external bigram repetition.\n\n![The effect of repetition control on question-asking rate](image4) illustrates this phenomenon. The graph shows that without repetition control, the question-asking rate increases steeply as the control level (z) increases, approaching 100% at higher levels. However, with repetition control, the rate plateaus at around 80% even at the highest control level (z=10), indicating the impact of repetition control on limiting the production of certain bigrams.\n\nIn summary, repetition control reduces the question-asking rate at the highest control level by discouraging the use of common question-related bigrams, but this can be mitigated by adjusting the decoding process to allow necessary question-asking bigrams while maintaining overall question frequency.\n\nThe introduction of repetition control reduces the question-asking rate at the highest control level (z=10) from 100% to 79.67%. This is due to the weighted decoding feature extrep bigram discouraging common question-related bigrams, which are essential for generating questions. However, by modifying the decoding process to allow these bigrams during reranking, the question-asking rate can be restored to nearly 100%. \n\n![The effect of repetition control on question-asking rate](image4) shows that without repetition control, the question-asking rate increases sharply, but with repetition control, it plateaus at around 80% at z=10."}

In the original dataset, BERT achieves a peak performance of 77%, as highlighted in the text [1]. However, when evaluated on the adversarial dataset, BERT's peak performance drops to 53%, as shown in the text [3] and confirmed in Table 4 [8]. This drastic reduction indicates that BERT's high performance on the original dataset was largely due to exploiting spurious statistical cues rather than genuine understanding of argument comprehension. The adversarial dataset, which mirrors the distribution of statistical cues over both labels, eliminates these cues, leading to random performance across all models, including BERT [3]. \n\nThe table in image1 [image1] further illustrates this by showing that BERT's mean performance on the adversarial test set is 0.504 ± 0.01, with a median of 0.505, and a maximum of 0.533. This is a stark contrast to its original performance metrics, where the mean was 0.671 ± 0.09, the median was 0.712, and the maximum was 0.770. The adversarial transformation effectively removes the reliance on spurious cues, making BERT's performance more robust and aligned with its true capabilities.\n\nIn comparison to other models, BERT's performance on the adversarial dataset is also lower than on the original dataset.

The FLAN-T5 model, while also an LLM, is presented as an alternative to the retriever–reader model but is not explicitly stated to be the default implementation for the QA module in the provided text.\n\n![The system relies on elements like the Wikipedia Corpus to provide context and evidence, and loops through its components to ensure accurate verification.](image4) The flowchart in Figure 4 illustrates the architecture of the QACHECK system, showing the integration of LLMs in the claim verifier and question generator modules. The image highlights the iterative process of verifying claims through question-guided reasoning, where LLMs play a crucial role in assessing context and generating relevant questions.\n\n![The image shows a user interface of a fact-checking demo called \"QACheck: Question-Guided Multi-hop Fact-Checking Demo.\" It's annotated to highlight its key functions: Users can either select a predefined claim or input a custom claim that they want to verify.](image1) The user interface in Figure 1 demonstrates the interactive nature of the system, where users engage with LLMs to input claims and receive step-by-step reasoning, further emphasizing the system's reliance on LLMs for dynamic claim verification.\n\nIn summary, the system implements at least three modules with LLM backbones: the claim verifier, the question generator, and the retriever–reader QA module. The GPT Reciter–Reader is also an LLM-based implementation, making a total of four modules that utilize LLMs.\n\n**Answer:** The proposed system implements four modules with Large Language Models (LLMs) as their backbone: the claim verifier, the question generator, the retriever–reader QA module, and the GPT Reciter–Reader QA module."}

For both LSTUR-ini and LSTUR-con, the AUC values increase as the mask probability \\( p \\) increases from 0.0 to 0.5. However, when \\( p \\) is too small, the model tends to overfit on the LTUR, leading to suboptimal performance. Conversely, when \\( p \\) is too large, the performance of both methods starts to decline. This indicates that a moderate value of \\( p \\), such as 0.5, is most appropriate for both methods to balance the learning of LTUR and STUR effectively.\n\nThe text quote [8] also supports this observation, stating that a moderate choice on \\( p \\) (e.g., 0.5) is most appropriate for both LSTUR-ini and LSTUR-con methods, which can properly balance the learning of LTUR and STUR.

Initially, the **Problem Formulator** module, which leverages large language models (LLMs) and in-context learning, translates the natural language description of the problem into a symbolic representation. This involves identifying key entities, facts, and rules present in the problem statement, as described in the text [2] and depicted in image4, where different types of logical reasoning problems are mapped to specific symbolic formulations. For instance, deductive reasoning is formulated using LP (Logical Programming), first-order logic problems use FOL, constraint satisfaction problems use CSP, and analytical reasoning employs SAT.\n\n![LOGIC-LM Modules](image5) shows the three main modules: Problem Formulator, Symbolic Reasoner, and Result Interpreter. The **Symbolic Reasoner** then performs logical inference on the formulated problem using deterministic symbolic solvers like Pyke for LP, Prover9 for FOL, python-constraint for CSP, and Z3 for SAT. This stage ensures that the reasoning is faithful and transparent, as the text [1] emphasizes the use of deterministic algorithms within the symbolic reasoner.\n\nFinally, the **Result Interpreter** translates the symbolic answer back into natural language, ensuring the output is understandable and accurate. This process is designed to reduce the burden on LLMs by shifting their focus from step-by-step reasoning to symbolic representation, as highlighted in text [1]. The self-refinement module, also mentioned in the text [2], iteratively revises the symbolic formulation using error messages from the symbolic solver, enhancing the accuracy of the parsing.\n\nIn summary, LOGIC-LM effectively combines the strengths of LLMs and symbolic solvers to achieve robust logical reasoning, as demonstrated by its performance improvements over pure LLMs and chain-of-thought prompting techniques, as noted in text [6].\n\nThe answer to the question is: The LOGIC-LM model solves a problem by first formulating it symbolically using LLMs, then performing logical inference with deterministic solvers, and finally interpreting the result back into natural language."}

According to the text [9], MedHop has a majority of samples with 9 candidates, while WikiHop has fewer candidates, with most samples having less than 9 candidates. This is due to the way documents are selected in MedHop, ensuring that the number of support documents does not exceed 64, which can lead to a higher number of candidates. The text [4] also mentions that MedHop is specifically designed for cross-document RC and multi-step inference, which might contribute to the complexity and number of candidates.\n\nImage4 provides a detailed breakdown of these statistics. For WikiHop (WH), the average number of candidates is 19.8, with a median of 14, and the maximum number of candidates is 79.

In contrast, WikiHop has a more balanced number of candidates and documents, with a lower average and maximum number of documents per sample.\n\nIn summary, MedHop has more candidates and documents per sample compared to WikiHop, reflecting its design for complex cross-document reasoning, while WikiHop maintains a more streamlined approach with fewer candidates and documents.\n\nThe candidate and document statistics differ significantly between WikiHop and MedHop, with MedHop having a higher number of candidates and documents per sample due to its design for complex cross-document reasoning."}

This step isolates individual objects of interest from the rest of the image, ensuring that the model focuses on the relevant regions. This is particularly important in object detection datasets, where objects can vary in size and position, and some may dominate the image while others are smaller and less prominent. By cropping, the system ensures that the model's attention is directed toward the objects of interest, reducing noise and irrelevant information.\n\nSecond, the cropped regions are **resized** to a fixed proportion. This standardization helps in maintaining consistency across different object sizes, which is essential for the model to process them uniformly. Additionally, the diagram shows that a **blurring technique** is applied to the non-target areas surrounding the objects.

According to the ablation study described in the text quotes, removing the abstract from the input to SPECTER results in a substantial decrease in performance, as noted in the top four rows of Table 2 [4]. This indicates that the abstract is a crucial feature for the model to effectively capture document-level relatedness. Conversely, adding authors as an input, along with the title and abstract, surprisingly hurts performance. This could be due to the sparsity of author names in the corpus, making it difficult for the model to infer document-level relatedness from them. Additionally, tokenization issues with author names, where they might be split into subwords and shared across names that are not semantically related, could lead to noisy correlations [4]. The image4 quote further supports this, showing that removing the abstract (denoted as \"− abstract\") leads to lower performance across most metrics, while adding venues (denoted as \"+ venue\") slightly decreases performance except for document classification [4].\n\nThe image4 quote also highlights that the base SPECTER model (without any modifications) achieves the highest scores in most categories, as indicated by the bolded numbers. This suggests that the default configuration of SPECTER, which includes the abstract, is optimal for performance.

According to the table in image5, GPT-4 consistently achieves higher scores in alignment (Align.) and correctness (Corr.) across both settings. In the general setting, GPT-4 scores 90.9 in alignment and 97.6 in correctness, compared to ChatGPT's 82.7 and 94.5, respectively. This indicates that GPT-4 is better at aligning generated text with the knowledge graph and ensuring the correctness of its answers. However, in the specific setting, GPT-4's alignment score increases to 92.0, and correctness remains the same, showing a slight improvement in handling more explicit knowledge requirements.\n\nConversely, ChatGPT demonstrates superior performance in text evaluation metrics such as coherence (Coh.), conciseness (Con.), fluency (Flu.), and relevance (Rel.) in the general setting. For instance, ChatGPT scores 4.64 in coherence and 4.89 in conciseness, compared to GPT-4's 4.38 and 4.48, respectively. This suggests that ChatGPT is more adept at producing coherent, concise, and fluent text, even when the knowledge context is less explicit. In the specific setting, ChatGPT's scores in these metrics improve slightly, indicating that it can maintain high text quality when the knowledge requirements are more clearly defined.\n\nThe implications of these differences are significant. For citation evaluation, GPT-4's higher alignment and correctness scores make it more reliable for tasks requiring precise knowledge integration, such as academic or technical writing. However, for text evaluation, ChatGPT's strengths in coherence and conciseness make it preferable for applications where the naturalness and readability of the text are crucial, such as content creation or customer support.

This is a critical step where the chromosomes, which were previously aligned at the metaphase plate, begin to condense and the nuclear envelope reforms around them. The cell then prepares to divide its cytoplasm, leading to cytokinesis.\n\nCytokinesis, as shown in the same image, involves the division of the cytoplasm. The plasma membrane grows inward at the midpoint of the cell, forming a cleavage furrow that eventually pinches the cell into two daughter cells. This process ensures that each new cell receives a complete set of organelles and cytoplasmic components necessary for its function.\n\nThe text quote [2] further elaborates on these processes: \"The cell elongates, and the chromosomal copies separate further.

In the parental (P) generation, one plant is homozygous dominant (PP) for purple flowers, and the other is homozygous recessive (pp) for white flowers. During gamete formation, the homozygous PP plant produces gametes with the P allele, while the homozygous pp plant produces gametes with the p allele. The F₁ generation consists of heterozygous (Pp) plants, all displaying the dominant purple phenotype. When these F₁ plants self-pollinate, the F₂ generation results in a 3:1 phenotypic ratio of purple to white flowers, with a genotypic ratio of 1 PP: 2 Pp: 1 pp. This is illustrated in the image, which shows the segregation of alleles and the resulting phenotypic outcomes.\n\n![Mendelian inheritance explaining F2 ratios](image5) Mendel's experiments with pea plants demonstrated that traits are inherited as discrete units, now known as genes, which are located at specific positions (loci) on chromosomes. The image shows a cross between purple-flowered and white-flowered plants, resulting in all purple-flowered F₁ plants. In the F₂ generation, the segregation of alleles leads to ¾ purple-flowered and ¼ white-flowered plants, illustrating how dominant and recessive alleles interact to produce these ratios.\n\nThe key to understanding these ratios is the independent assortment of alleles during gamete formation and fertilization, as depicted in the diagrams. The image4 shows the step-by-step process, from parental to F₂ generation, highlighting how the combination of alleles leads to the observed phenotypic and genotypic ratios.\n\nMendel's work established that parents pass heritable factors (now called genes) to offspring, and these factors can be dominant or recessive.

This approach allows for a comparative view of different volcanic regions worldwide, emphasizing the global spread of volcanic activity.\n\nIn contrast, public libraries in the Netherlands are represented using a map interface from the Wikidata Query Service, as shown in `image1` and `image4`. `image1` is a screenshot of the Wikidata Query Service interface, displaying a table with columns like \"dplLabel,\" \"dplDescription,\" and \"dplLoc,\" which provide detailed information about each library, including its name, description, and geographical coordinates. The interface includes a dropdown menu with visualization options, and a red arrow points to the \"Map\" option, indicating the user's intention to display the data on a map. `image4` further illustrates this by showing a table listing public libraries with their unique identifiers, names, descriptions, and coordinates. The map in `image1` likely visualizes these data points, showing the distribution of public libraries across the Netherlands with red dots, similar to the approach used for volcanoes but focused on a specific country.\n\nThe comparison in data presentation highlights that both use red dots to mark locations, but the global volcanoes map provides a collage of specialized maps for different regions, while the Netherlands libraries map uses an integrated interface with detailed metadata and a single map view. This difference reflects the scope and focus: global volcanoes maps offer a comparative global perspective, whereas the Netherlands libraries map provides detailed, localized information within a specific country.\n\n![Volcanoes globally represented with red dots on multiple maps](image3) ![Public libraries in the Netherlands on a map interface](image1)\n\nThe visual representation of volcanoes globally and public libraries in the Netherlands both use red dots to mark locations, but the former employs a collage of specialized maps for different regions, while the latter uses an integrated interface with detailed metadata and a single map view, focusing on a specific country."}

According to the text quotes, management and cultural barriers are significant, as highlighted in quote [2], which states, \"Adoption barriers relate to management & culture, not data & technology!\" This indicates that the lack of alignment in organizational culture and management practices is a primary obstacle. The image1 chart reinforces this by showing that \"There is no single ownership of the experience resulting in siloed approaches and misaligned goals\" is a prominent concern, with 52% of respondents identifying it as a challenge. This siloed approach is further emphasized in quote [3], which identifies a \"Siloed Approach as the Greatest Barrier to Adoption of a Customer Management Approach.\"\n\nAdditionally, the text [6] lists several specific issues, such as \"No 360 degree view\" and \"No taxonomy,\" which contribute to the complexity and fragmentation of data management. The image2 chart supports this by showing that a \"Customer Focused\" approach is less prevalent than a \"Product/Brand Focused\" one, with 44% versus 35%, suggesting a bias towards product-centric metrics over customer-centric insights. This aligns with quote [8], which notes that traditional metrics fail to capture engagement and sentiment, highlighting the need for a more holistic view.\n\nFurthermore, the text [5] and [10] stress the importance of engagement and qualitative data, which are often overlooked in favor of quantitative metrics. The image3 chart indicates that \"Often a Factor\" in decision-making is 32%, showing that while engagement is recognized, it is not always prioritized. The image4 chart, labeled \"47%,\" could represent the percentage of respondents who face challenges in measuring customer behavior, as mentioned in quote [5], where measurement is noted as a significant hurdle.\n\nIn summary, the major barriers include siloed approaches, lack of single ownership, insufficient resources, and inadequate measurement capabilities, all of which hinder the transition to an integrated customer management approach.\n\n![52% Siloed Approaches](image1)  \n![Customer Focused vs Product/Brand Focused](image2)  \n![Engagement as a Factor](image3)  \n\nThe major barriers preventing the adoption of an integrated customer management approach are siloed approaches, lack of single ownership, and inadequate measurement capabilities."}

In meiosis I, homologous chromosomes separate, reducing the chromosome number by half. This process is depicted in the diagram and images as follows:\n\n- **Meiosis I** involves the separation of homologous chromosomes, which are pairs of chromosomes that carry the same genes at the same loci. This separation occurs during anaphase I, where homologous chromosomes are pulled to opposite poles of the cell. The diagram in image4 shows this process with the label \"Anaphase I\" (الطور الانفصالي الأول), where chromatids are separating and moving to opposite poles. The image also highlights the formation of tetrads, which are groups of four chromatids, each consisting of two sister chromatids, as shown in the \"Tetrad\" stage.\n\n- **Meiosis II** follows meiosis I and involves the separation of sister chromatids. This separation occurs during anaphase II, where the sister chromatids are pulled apart to opposite poles of the cell. The diagram in image4 shows this process with the label \"Anaphase II\" (الطور الانفصالي الثاني), where chromatids are separating and moving to opposite poles. The image also depicts the formation of haploid daughter cells, each with a single set of chromosomes, as shown in the \"Telophase II\" (الطور الانفصل الثاني) stage, where the cell is finishing division, forming two new nuclei.\n\nIn contrast, mitosis, as depicted in image2, involves the separation of sister chromatids during anaphase, but it does not involve the separation of homologous chromosomes.

Reporting and analysis are foundational steps that transform raw data into actionable insights, ultimately leading to strategic decision-making and organizational impact.\n\n**Reporting** focuses on providing a descriptive overview of what has happened, addressing questions like \"What?\" and \"How many, how often, where?\" [10]. It involves generating reports, dashboards, and alerts that summarize historical data, offering a backward-looking perspective. This stage is crucial for establishing a baseline understanding of business performance and identifying areas that require further investigation. Reporting ensures that stakeholders have access to the necessary information to make informed decisions, setting the stage for deeper analysis.\n\n**Analysis**, on the other hand, is prescriptive, aiming to answer questions like \"Why?\" and \"Where exactly is the problem?\" [10]. It involves examining data and information to derive insights and recommendations. Analysis is forward-looking, seeking to understand the underlying causes of observed trends and patterns. By combining data with context and storytelling, analysis provides a narrative that guides decision-makers in addressing current issues and planning for the future. This stage is essential for moving beyond mere data presentation to actionable strategies.\n\nThe progression from business intelligence to business analytics is illustrated by the diagram in image3. Starting with standard reports and ad-hoc reports, which focus on descriptive insights, the journey advances through query drilldown, alerts, and statistical analysis. As one moves up the hierarchy, the degree of intelligence increases, culminating in predictive modeling and optimization. Reporting and analysis are integral to this progression, bridging the gap between data collection and strategic decision-making. Reporting lays the groundwork with descriptive insights, while analysis elevates these insights into prescriptive actions, driving the organization toward higher-value outcomes.\n\n![Reporting and Analysis in Analytics Value Chain](image4) shows the flow from data to reporting, then to analysis, and finally to action, highlighting how these stages contribute to the overall value chain.

The duplicated copies begin to separate from each other, as shown in `![Chromosome distribution to daughter cells](image1)`. This ensures that each new cell will receive an identical copy of the genetic material.\n\n2. **Cell Elongation and Chromosomal Separation**: After the chromosome duplication and separation, the cell elongates. This elongation is crucial for positioning the duplicated chromosomes at opposite ends of the cell, facilitating their distribution to the daughter cells. `![Binary fission of a prokaryotic cell](image4)` illustrates this elongation and the movement of chromosomal copies towards the cell poles.\n\n3. **Plasma Membrane Growth and Division**: The final step is the growth of the plasma membrane inward at the midpoint of the cell, which leads to the division of the cell into two separate daughter cells. This process is visually represented in `![Binary fission of a prokaryotic cell](image4)`, where the cell is shown dividing into two distinct cells with genetic material evenly distributed.\n\nThese steps ensure that a single prokaryotic cell divides into two identical cells, each inheriting the same genetic material.\n\n**Answer**: The three steps of binary fission of a prokaryotic cell are: duplication of the chromosome and separation of copies, cell elongation and chromosomal separation, and plasma membrane growth and division."}
