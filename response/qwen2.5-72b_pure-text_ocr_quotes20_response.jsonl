For instance, in 2008, a majority of Republican voters (58%) believed that Republican leaders should work with Obama, indicating a willingness to cooperate across party lines [10]. However, by 2016, this sentiment had shifted dramatically. According to the data, 46% of Trump voters gave a failing grade to the Democratic Party, reflecting a more polarized and adversarial stance [2].\n\nSimilarly, the preferences within the Democratic Party have also evolved. In 2008 and 2012, a majority of Democratic voters (57% in both years) favored a more moderate direction for their party [5]. However, by 2016, the party became more divided, with 49% of Democratic voters supporting a more liberal direction, a significant increase from just 38% two years prior [4]. This shift is further illustrated by the fact that following Obama's victories, only a third of Democratic voters wanted the party to move to the left, whereas in 2016, nearly half (49%) favored a more liberal stance [11].\n\nThese changes are also reflected in the broader trends of voter satisfaction and party grading. In 2016, only 40% of registered voters were satisfied with the candidates in the race, indicating a general dissatisfaction with the choices [1]. Additionally, the grading of the opposing party has become more harsh, with 49% of Clinton voters giving the GOP a failing grade, compared to 32% of Romney voters in 2012 [2].\n\n![{Republican voters increasingly favor a more conservative direction, while Democratic voters are more divided, with a growing preference for a more liberal stance.}](image4)\n\nIn summary, from 2008 to 2016, Republican voters have become more aligned with a conservative direction, while Democratic voters have become more divided, with a notable shift towards favoring a more liberal approach."}

As of the latest survey, 46% of Americans believe that Islam is more likely to encourage violence, while 45% do not [6].\n\nHowever, there are stark differences when we break down the data by political affiliation. Republicans have consistently held the view that Islam is more likely to encourage violence, with 68% of Republicans holding this belief, which is a historical high but little changed from the previous year [11]. This percentage has increased from 67% in September 2014 [1].\n\nIn contrast, the share of Democrats who associate Islam with violence has declined significantly. Only 30% of Democrats now hold this view, down from 42% in September 2014 [11]. This decline is part of a broader trend where the partisan divide on this issue has widened, making it one of the most polarized topics in recent years [11].\n\nThe ideological divide is even more pronounced. About three-quarters (77%) of conservative Republicans believe that Islam is more likely to encourage violence, while only 16% of liberal Democrats share this view [4]. This stark difference highlights the growing polarization along ideological lines.\n\nAge also plays a role in these perceptions. Younger adults (ages 18 to 29) are less likely to believe that Islam encourages violence, with only 32% holding this view, compared to about half of those in other age groups [3]. The age gap in these views has narrowed somewhat, but it remains significant.\n\nReligious affiliation also influences these perceptions. White evangelical Protestants are the most likely to believe that Islam encourages violence, with 70% holding this view, which is the highest percentage among all religious groups [9]. This percentage has remained relatively stable since 2014.\n\nTo visualize these trends, consider the following graphs:\n\n![{Republicans are more likely to believe Islam encourages violence, while Democrats' views have declined.}](image2)\n![{Perceptions of Islam encouraging violence have fluctuated over time, with a slight decrease from 2014 to 2015.}](image5)\n\nIn conclusion, perceptions of whether Islam encourages violence more than other religions have become increasingly polarized along political and ideological lines, with Republicans and conservatives more likely to hold this view, while Democrats and liberals are less likely to do so."}

This worry is particularly pronounced when considering algorithms that can make hiring decisions without human involvement, with 67% expressing worry and only 22% showing enthusiasm [1].\n\nThe concept is broadly familiar to the American public, with 85% having heard or read about it before, and 77% considering it at least somewhat realistic [2]. However, only 20% find it extremely realistic [3], and this perception varies significantly based on the level of familiarity with the concept. Among those who have heard a lot about it, 47% express some level of enthusiasm, which is higher than those with lower levels of familiarity [4].\n\nDespite the general familiarity and realism, a majority of Americans (65%) are unfamiliar with efforts to develop robot caregivers for the elderly, with only 6% having heard a lot about it [11]. Nevertheless, 59% view the concept of robot caregivers as realistic, with 10% describing it as extremely realistic [11].\n\nWhen it comes to the broader implications of automation, Americans anticipate significant changes in the job market. Roughly three-quarters (77%) think it's realistic that robots and computers might one day be able to do many of the jobs currently done by humans, with 20% finding this extremely realistic [8]. They also express more worry than enthusiasm about the prospect of machines performing many human jobs and anticipate more negative than positive outcomes from this development [6].\n\nSpecifically, Americans are concerned about potential negative outcomes such as increased inequality between rich and poor and difficulties in finding meaningful activities [image1]. On the positive side, they see potential benefits like a more efficient economy and the ability to focus less on work and more on what really matters [image1].\n\nTo mitigate the impacts of automation, there is support for measures such as limiting machines to dangerous or unhealthy jobs (86% of Democrats/lean Democrats and 61% of Republicans/lean Republicans), guaranteeing all citizens a basic income (38% of Democrats/lean Democrats and 46% of Republicans/lean Republicans), and creating a national service program for displaced workers (61% of Democrats/lean Democrats and 46% of Republicans/lean Republicans) [image2].\n\nIn summary, Americans are more worried than enthusiastic about the prospect of machines performing many human jobs, but they also see the need for regulatory and social measures to address the potential negative impacts of automation. ![Americans are more worried than enthusiastic about the concept of machines performing jobs currently done by humans](image6)"}

For example, 60% of Americans are in favor of providing all Americans with a guaranteed income to meet their basic needs, and 58% support a national service program that would pay people to perform tasks even if machines could do them faster or cheaper [4]. These policies reflect a desire to ensure economic security and meaningful employment for all, even in an increasingly automated world.\n\nHowever, there are notable differences in support for these policies based on political affiliation.

This is consistent across different groups, but there are notable differences when we break down the data by education level. Among those with at least a college degree, 31% say “high ethical standards” does not describe either party, while 43% say it describes one and not the other, and 17% think it describes both [3]. In contrast, fewer of those with some college experience (26%) or a high school degree or less (20%) think neither party has high ethical standards [12].\n\nThese findings are visually supported by the chart in image4, which shows that a quarter of the public says “high ethical standards” describes neither the Republican Party nor the Democratic Party, 47% say it describes one party but not the other, and 17% say the description applies to both ![{A quarter of the public says neither party has high ethical standards, while 47% say it describes one party but not the other, and 17% say it applies to both.}](image4).\n\nWhen it comes to perceptions of extremism, more Americans view the Republican Party as “too extreme” (48%) compared to the Democratic Party (42%) [7]. However, the share of Americans who view the Republican Party as too extreme has declined since last June (from 54%), while views of the Democratic Party are little changed (45% then, 42% now) [7].\n\nPolitical affiliation plays a significant role in these perceptions. Overwhelming shares of both Republicans and Republican-leaning independents (more than 80%) and Democrats and Democratic leaners (more than 80%) say their own party has good policy ideas, while less than a quarter say this describes the opposing party [11]. Similarly, only about two-in-ten Republicans or Democrats think their own party is “too extreme,” but about three-quarters in each party think the other party can be described this way [11].\n\nThis is further illustrated in image3, which shows that 88% of Democrats and 93% of liberal Democrats disapprove of the Republican Party, while 81% of Republicans and 89% of conservative Republicans approve of the Republican Party. Conversely, 84% of Democrats and 93% of liberal Democrats approve of the Democratic Party, while 88% of Republicans disapprove of the Democratic Party ![{Overwhelming shares of partisans disapprove of the opposing party, while they strongly approve of their own party.}](image3).\n\nIn conclusion, perceptions of ethical standards and extremism differ between the Republican and Democratic parties, with more people viewing the Republican Party as too extreme. These perceptions are heavily influenced by education and political affiliation, with higher education levels and partisan leanings leading to more critical views of both parties."}

For instance, only 41% of Americans believe the GOP has high ethical standards, and a nearly identical share (42%) say this about the Democratic Party [1]. This suggests a general skepticism towards the ethical standards of both major parties.\n\nWhen we look at educational differences, the data shows that college graduates are more critical of both parties. Nearly a third of college graduates (31%) say neither party has high ethical standards [5]. In contrast, fewer of those with some college experience (26%) or a high school degree or less (20%) hold this view [12]. This indicates that higher education is associated with a more critical stance on the ethical standards of political parties.\n\nAdditionally, there are notable differences in early midterm vote preferences based on education. Those with a postgraduate degree favor the Democratic candidate over the Republican by roughly two-to-one (62% to 30%), and those with a four-year college degree favor the Democrat (53% to 40%). Preferences are more divided among voters without a college degree [8].\n\nPolitical affiliation also plays a crucial role. Independents are significantly more likely than partisans to say neither party has high ethical standards. About a third of independents (34%), including equal shares of Republican leaners and Democratic leaners (33% each), hold this view. By comparison, only about two-in-ten Republicans (19%) or Democrats (18%) say this [9].\n\nFurthermore, among those with at least a college degree, 31% say “high ethical standards” does not describe either the GOP or the Democratic Party, 43% say it describes one and not the other, and 17% think it describes both [10]. This breakdown highlights the nuanced views of educated individuals regarding the ethical standards of political parties.\n\nIn terms of political party preferences, the data from the survey shows that among all registered voters, 48% of Democrats and 43% of Republicans have favorable views of their respective parties' policy ideas and ethical standards [4]. However, the perception of extremism varies, with more Americans viewing the Republican Party as \"too extreme\" [2].\n\n![{College graduates are more critical of both parties' ethical standards.}](image5)\n\nIn conclusion, higher education levels and independent political affiliations are associated with more critical views of the ethical standards of both the Republican and Democratic parties, while partisans tend to be more positive about their own party's ethical standards."}

However, when it comes to ethical standards, the divide is stark.\n\nFor instance, just 41% of Americans say the GOP has high ethical standards, and a nearly identical share (42%) say this about the Democratic Party [1]. This suggests a general skepticism about the ethical standards of both major political parties.\n\nWhen we look at the breakdown by political affiliation, the differences become even more pronounced.

According to the data, about four-in-ten Americans rate the ethical standards of Trump administration officials as excellent (9%) or good (30%), while 58% say they are not good (21%) or poor (36%) [1]. This indicates a generally negative view of the ethical standards of the Trump administration.\n\nWhen we break this down by party, we see significant differences. Among Republicans and Republican leaners, 38% say they like the way Trump conducts himself as president, while 45% say they have mixed feelings about his conduct, and 16% do not like it [8]. This suggests a divided opinion within the Republican base, with a slight majority having some level of approval or neutrality.\n\nIn contrast, among Democrats, 85% say they don’t like the way Trump conducts himself in office, with only 10% having mixed feelings and 5% saying they like his behavior [4]. This shows a strong and consistent disapproval from Democrats.\n\nTo see how these opinions have changed over time, we can look at the data from different points. In May 2018, 88% of Democrats and 58% of Democratic leaners disapproved of Trump's job performance, with 75% strongly disapproving [image2]. This is consistent with the earlier data showing strong disapproval from Democrats.\n\nFor Republicans, the data from May 2018 shows that 19% of Republicans and Republican leaners disapproved of Trump's job performance, while 80% approved [image2]. This indicates a high level of support from Republicans, which has remained relatively stable over time.\n\nThe image also provides a breakdown by ideology. Among conservative Republicans, 44% say they like Trump’s conduct, compared to 25% of moderate or liberal Republicans [6]. Additionally, 32% of moderate or liberal Republicans say they do not like his conduct in office [6]. This suggests a more nuanced view within the Republican party, with conservative Republicans being more supportive.\n\nAnother important point is the change in agreement with Trump on policy issues. In May 2018, 80% of Republicans and Republican leaners said they agree with Trump on many or all issues, up 11 percentage points from August 2017 [12]. This indicates a growing alignment between Trump and his base.\n\nIn summary, while Republicans have shown a relatively stable and largely positive view of Trump's conduct and the ethical standards of his administration, Democrats have consistently held a strong and negative view. The data from May 2018 and August 2017 shows that these opinions have remained fairly consistent over time, with a slight increase in Republican support for Trump's policies. ![Opinions among Republicans and Democrats have remained consistent, with Republicans showing more support and Democrats showing strong disapproval.](image2)"}

According to the data, just 25% of all voters believe that Trump's election will lead to better race relations, while 46% expect them to worsen [8]. This stark contrast is further emphasized by the fact that among Clinton voters, 84% expect race relations to worsen under Trump [2], [9].\n\nIn comparison, the expectations for partisan relations are more balanced. About 27% of all voters think that relations between the two parties will improve in the coming year, while another 27% expect them to worsen, and 45% anticipate they will stay about the same [11]. This suggests a more moderate outlook on partisan relations compared to the highly negative expectations for race relations.\n\nThe perceived implications of having enthusiastic supporters for a president are significant. Trump voters are much more optimistic about the potential for better partisan relations, with nearly half (47%) expecting improvements [10]. This optimism is in sharp contrast to the broader voter sentiment, where only 27% of all voters share this view [11]. The enthusiasm of Trump's base may lead to a more polarized political environment, as supporters believe less will get done if there is less cooperation [image1]. This polarization could exacerbate the already tense racial climate, given the high percentage of Clinton voters who expect race relations to deteriorate [image5].\n\nIn conclusion, voters are more pessimistic about race relations than partisan relations after the 2016 election, and the enthusiasm of Trump's supporters may contribute to further political division. ![Supporters mean less gets done](image1)"}

For Republicans, there has been a consistent preference for a more conservative direction. According to the data, 60% of Republican and Republican-leaning voters in 2016 wanted to see the GOP move in a more conservative direction, compared to 36% who favored more moderation [9]. This trend has remained relatively stable over recent years, as shown in the image depicting the percentage of Republican voters preferring a more conservative direction across multiple election years `![{Republicans prefer a more conservative direction consistently}](image1)`.\n\nOn the other hand, Democratic voters have become more divided over the direction of their party. In 2016, 49% of Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters wanted the party to move in a more liberal direction, while 47% preferred a more moderate approach [10]. This is a significant shift from previous years, where only 38% of Democrats wanted a more liberal stance two years prior, and even fewer following Obama's presidential victories [10]. The image showing the percentage of Democratic voters preferring a more liberal direction over the years further illustrates this trend `![{Democrats increasingly favor a more liberal direction}](image2)`.\n\nThese shifts in party orientation have also influenced voter reactions to the 2016 election outcomes. While 52% of voters were happy that the Republican Party maintained control of the U.S. Congress, 45% were unhappy [4]. This reaction is highly polarized along party lines, with 94% of Trump voters being happy about the GOP retaining control, while 87% of Clinton supporters were unhappy [2]. The image depicting voter happiness or unhappiness with the Republican Party maintaining control of Congress highlights this stark divide `![{Voters are deeply divided based on party affiliation}](image3)`.\n\nAdditionally, the image showing the grades given to the parties by voters over the years indicates that both parties have received more failing grades in 2016 compared to previous years `![{Both parties received more failing grades in 2016}](image5)`. This suggests a growing dissatisfaction among voters with the current state of both major political parties.\n\nIn conclusion, Republican voters have maintained a strong preference for a more conservative direction, while Democratic voters have become more divided but increasingly favor a more liberal approach. These shifts have contributed to the polarized reactions to the 2016 election outcomes, with a significant portion of the electorate expressing dissatisfaction with the status quo."}

Similarly, 78% of Obama's voters and 76% of McCain's voters felt that Democratic leaders should work with Republicans, even at the risk of disappointing their supporters [6]. This reflects a general desire for bipartisanship and collaboration during that period.\n\nIn contrast, the 2016 election saw a starkly different mood. Voters viewed the contest as extraordinarily negative, with 92% feeling there was more mudslinging and negative campaigning than in past elections [7]. This sentiment is also reflected in the image showing that 92% of voters perceived more mudslinging ![More mudslinging 92](image1).

In 2016, more than half of Republican and Republican-leaning voters (53%) said Trump should work with Democratic leaders, while 39% wanted him to stand up to them [5]. However, Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters were more inclined to resist cooperation. Nearly two-thirds (65%) of these voters believed Democratic leaders should stand up to Trump on issues important to Democratic supporters, even if it meant less getting done in Washington [12]. This is a significant shift from 2008, where 52% of Obama's supporters wanted him to appoint Republicans to his cabinet [3].\n\nThe image comparing voter sentiments in 2008 and 2016 further illustrates this shift. In 2008, a majority of voters, including both Democrats and Republicans, favored working with the new president [image8]. By 2016, the sentiment had shifted, with a higher proportion of voters, especially Democrats, favoring a more confrontational approach [image8].\n\nIn summary, voter expectations and sentiments towards political leaders working with or against newly elected presidents differed significantly between 2008 and 2016, with 2008 marked by a greater willingness for bipartisanship and 2016 characterized by increased polarization and resistance to cooperation."}

For instance, Democrats are now the only partisan group where a majority still believes the government is doing at least fairly well, though this has dropped from 85% in January to 64% currently [3]. Independents' positive ratings have also fallen from 69% to 44%, and Republicans' positive ratings have plummeted from 63% to 27% [3].\n\nAge also plays a role in these perceptions.

A majority (57%) of those 50 and older say the government is not doing well, compared to 42% who say it is [6]. In contrast, younger adults (18-29 years old) are more positive, with 53% saying the government is doing very or fairly well [6].\n\nThese changes are also reflected in concerns about the balance between security and civil liberties.

In 2013, there was a notable shift in concerns about civil liberties versus security. As of the latest data, adults under 30 are nearly evenly split between concerns that U.S. policies place too many restrictions on civil liberties (43%) and that they do not go far enough to protect the country (44%) [8].

This is in stark contrast to liberal Democrats, where 87% believe Muslims should not be subject to greater scrutiny [5].\n\nYounger adults, particularly those aged 18-29, are more likely to reject the idea of additional scrutiny for Muslims, with 80% saying it should not be part of the government's efforts to prevent terrorism [10]. This trend continues among those aged 30-49, with 63% opposing additional scrutiny [10]. However, the divide becomes more pronounced among older age groups, with 50% of those aged 50 and older supporting greater scrutiny [11].\n\nRacial and ethnic differences also play a role. Non-whites, including blacks and Hispanics, are more likely to reject the idea of scrutiny of Muslims based on religion. Specifically, 74% of blacks and 66% of Hispanics oppose additional scrutiny [4]. In contrast, a narrower majority of 57% of whites hold the same view [4].\n\nEducational attainment also influences these perceptions. Postgraduates and college graduates are more likely to oppose additional scrutiny, with 69% and 65%, respectively, saying Muslims should not face more scrutiny [7].

Independents and Democrats, however, show clear majorities opposing additional scrutiny, with 62% and 76%, respectively [9].\n\nThese differences in perception are closely related to the perceived importance of terrorism as a national issue. Republicans are more likely to cite terrorism, defense, and national security as the most important problems facing the nation, with 41% mentioning these issues [6].

According to the data, Americans' ratings of the government's efforts to reduce the threat of terrorism have declined sharply since January, with more people now expressing dissatisfaction. Specifically, 52% of Americans now say the government is doing not too well or not at all well in reducing the threat of terrorism, compared to 46% who say it is doing very or fairly well [4].\n\nThis decline in positive ratings is evident across different demographic groups. For instance, older Americans and those with less education are more likely to give the government lower marks for its efforts to combat terrorism. Among those 50 and older, 57% say the government is not doing well, while only 42% say it is [11]. Similarly, those with less education are more critical, with 44% giving positive ratings compared to 58% of those with a postgraduate degree [3].\n\nPolitical affiliations also play a significant role in shaping these perceptions. Democrats are now the only partisan group in which a majority (64%) still say the government is doing at least fairly well, though this is down from 85% in January [12]. In contrast, just 27% of Republicans now hold positive views, a substantial drop from 63% at the beginning of the year [12].

By a two-to-one margin, 56% of Americans now express more concern that these policies have not gone far enough to protect the country, compared to 28% who worry that these policies have gone too far in restricting civil liberties [8]. This shift in concern is reflected in the increasing number of Americans who cite terrorism, national security, or ISIS as the most important problem facing the country, rising from 4% a year ago to 29% today [10].\n\nIn conclusion, perceptions of terrorism and government efforts to combat it have become more negative over time, with older, less educated, and Republican individuals being more critical. These perceptions vary significantly across different demographic and political groups, reflecting broader societal and political dynamics."}

Additionally, Republicans are more likely to say that Islam is more likely to encourage violence, with 68% of Republicans holding this view, compared to just 30% of Democrats [2].\n\nOn the economic front, while both parties are concerned about economic issues, the specific concerns differ. Democrats are more likely to cite dissatisfaction with the government and political gridlock as major problems, with 8% of Democrats mentioning political gridlock compared to only 2% of Republicans [8]. However, when it comes to general economic issues, the survey shows that both Republicans and Democrats are relatively close in their concerns, with 21% of Republicans and 20% of Democrats citing economic issues as important [7].\n\nThe data also reveals that Republicans are more critical of the government's efforts to combat terrorism. Only 27% of Republicans say the government is doing very or fairly well in reducing the terrorist threat, down from 63% at the beginning of the year [6]. In contrast, 64% of Democrats still believe the government is doing at least fairly well, though this is down from 85% in January [6].\n\nFurthermore, Republicans are more likely to support the use of overwhelming military force to defeat terrorism, with 72% of Republicans favoring this approach, compared to only 27% of Democrats [4]. Democrats, on the other hand, are more likely to believe that relying too much on force creates hatred that leads to more terrorism, with 66% of Democrats holding this view [4].\n\nIn summary, Republicans are more focused on terrorism and national security, more critical of the government's anti-terrorism efforts, and more supportive of military force, while Democrats are more concerned with economic issues and political gridlock, and are more skeptical of military solutions to terrorism. ![{Republicans are more focused on terrorism and national security, while Democrats are more concerned with economic issues and political gridlock.}](image7)"}

According to the data, around three-quarters of Americans believe that China's initial handling of the coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan contributed significantly to the global spread of the virus [7]. This sentiment is particularly strong among Republicans, with 73% believing China's early handling contributed a great deal to the pandemic's spread, compared to 38% of Democrats [7].\n\nOlder Americans, specifically those aged 50 and older, are also more critical of China's response. A significant 81% of this age group holds an unfavorable view of China, which is a 10 percentage point increase since March [6]. In contrast, younger age groups, such as those under 30, are less critical, with 56% holding an unfavorable view [6].\n\nThis trend aligns with the broader unfavorable views of China in recent years. Republicans have consistently held more unfavorable views of China than Democrats, with 83% of Republicans and 68% of Democrats having an unfavorable opinion of China [11]. The gap between the parties has widened, with negative views among Republicans increasing by 11 percentage points and Democrats by 6 points over the past four months [2].\n\nThese differences are also reflected in the specific responses to China's handling of the pandemic. For instance, 82% of Republicans and 54% of Democrats believe China has done a bad job dealing with the coronavirus [10]. Similarly, 61% of Republicans and 30% of Democrats think China has done a very bad job [10].\n\nThe data also shows that older Americans are more likely to criticize China's response, with 73% of those aged 50 and older finding fault in China’s handling of the pandemic [10]. This is higher than the 59% of those aged 30 to 49 and 54% of those under 30 who share the same view [12].\n\nIn summary, the perception of China's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic is more critical among older Americans and Republicans, reflecting a broader trend of increasingly unfavorable views of China in recent years, particularly among these groups. ![Older Americans and Republicans are more critical of China's handling of the pandemic](image8)"}

However, these views vary notably across different demographic groups.\n\nRepublicans and Republican-leaning independents are significantly more critical of China's response compared to Democrats and Democratic leaners. Specifically, 82% of Republicans and Republican leaners say China has done a bad job, including 61% who say it has done a very bad job. In contrast, 54% of Democrats and Democratic leaners say China has done a bad job, with only 30% saying it has done a very bad job [12]. This aligns with the trend that Republicans are more likely to hold China responsible for the pandemic's spread [4].\n\nAge also plays a role in these perceptions. Older Americans, particularly those aged 50 and older, are more critical of China's response. For instance, 73% of those aged 50 and older find fault in China’s handling of the outbreak, compared to 59% of those aged 30 to 49 and 54% of those under 30 [9].

On the other hand, Democrats place more emphasis on Canada and Mexico as key partners [2].\n\nWhen it comes to cooperation, Democrats in the U.S. are more likely to want greater cooperation with Germany, with 66% preferring close ties, compared to 57% of Republicans [11]. Additionally, Republicans are more open to increased cooperation with Russia, with 41% supporting it, compared to 32% of Democrats [10].

Supporters of the CDU/CSU, SPD, and Greens all name France as their top or second-most important partner, followed by the U.S. [7]. However, there are notable differences when it comes to cooperation with specific countries. For instance, supporters of the CDU/CSU are more willing to want greater cooperation with the U.S. compared to those who support the Greens and the SPD [12]. This reflects a general trend where those on the ideological right in Germany tend to be more favorable toward the U.S. overall [12].\n\nMoreover, there is a significant divide between East and West Germans regarding their preferences for close relationships. Nearly four-in-ten East Germans prefer close ties with Russia, compared to only 23% who prefer the U.S. In contrast, West Germans are twice as likely to prefer a close relationship with the U.S. over Russia [4].

This partisan divide is also reflected in the preference for closer ties with Germany versus Russia. About two-thirds of Democrats (66%) prefer close ties with Germany, while 57% of Republicans share this view, and 31% of Republicans prefer closer relations with Russia compared to 21% of Democrats [4].\n\nIn Germany, the situation is somewhat different. East Germans are more likely to support closer ties with Russia, with 75% of East Germans preferring increased cooperation, compared to 63% of West Germans [3]. This regional difference is significant, as it reflects historical and cultural ties that still influence current preferences.\n\nRegarding cooperation with China, the preferences diverge even more. Americans are almost equally divided, with 41% preferring a close relationship with Germany and 44% preferring a close relationship with China [8]. In contrast, Germans are about twice as likely to prefer a close relationship with the U.S. over China (50% to 24%) [8].\n\nThese differences are also influenced by age in the U.S. Younger Americans (ages 18 to 29) are more likely to want a close relationship with China (58%) over Germany (32%), while older Americans prefer closer ties with Germany [7]. \n\nIn terms of political party affiliations, Democrats in the U.S. are more likely to want greater cooperation with Germany than Republicans [9]. Similarly, in Germany, supporters of the CDU/CSU are more willing to want greater cooperation with the U.S. than those who support the Greens and the SPD [9].\n\nTo summarize, Americans and Germans have distinct preferences for increased cooperation with Russia and China, influenced by political party affiliations and regional differences. Americans show a more divided stance, with a notable partisan divide, while Germans, especially those in the former East, are more inclined towards closer ties with Russia. ![East Germans are more likely to support closer ties with Russia](image10)"}

Conversely, Republicans are more inclined to favor Russia, with 31% preferring close relations with Russia and 57% favoring Germany [1].\n\nThis partisan divide extends to views on China as well. Younger Americans, aged 18 to 29, are more likely to want a close relationship with China over Germany, with 58% preferring China and 32% preferring Germany [5].

This partisan divide is evident in the broader context of U.S. politics, where conservative Americans are generally more favorable toward Russia than liberal Americans [6].\n\nIn Germany, the influence of political affiliations on attitudes toward Russia is also notable but manifests differently. The data shows that support for a close relationship with Russia varies by region and political party. East Germans, who have historical ties to Russia, are more likely to view Russia favorably and support closer ties. For instance, 75% of East Germans favor increased cooperation with Russia, compared to 63% of West Germans [8]. This regional difference reflects the lasting impact of the Cold War on German attitudes.\n\nMoreover, within Germany, supporters of different political parties also exhibit varying levels of support for cooperation with Russia. For example, supporters of the CDU/CSU (Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union) are more likely to favor closer ties with the U.S. than with Russia, while supporters of the Greens and SPD (Social Democratic Party) are more divided [11].\n\nThese trends are further illustrated by the image showing the preferences of Republicans and Democrats in the U.S. for cooperation with Russia, where a higher percentage of Republicans (63%) favor such cooperation compared to Democrats (75%) who favor cooperation with Germany instead [image6].

This divide is even more pronounced among ideological subgroups, with 64% of liberal Democrats supporting international aid, compared to 44% of conservative and moderate Democrats [3].\n\nEducational background also plays a role in these views. Higher levels of education correlate with a greater willingness to support international engagement. For example, 60% of postgraduates believe the U.S. should help other countries, while only 29% of those with a high school diploma or less agree [6]. This trend is consistent across various issues, including the handling of the coronavirus outbreak. More educated Americans are more critical of the U.S. response, with two-thirds of those with a postgraduate degree saying the U.S. has done a poor job, compared to 43% of those with a high school degree or less [10].\n\nThese differences are also reflected in broader attitudes towards U.S. global influence. Liberal Democrats are particularly pessimistic, with 56% believing the U.S. will have less influence in world affairs, which is 20 percentage points higher than the share of moderate and conservative Democrats who hold this view [12].

For instance, 71% of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents believe the U.S. has done a good or excellent job, while only 27% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents share this view [7]. This stark difference is further emphasized by the fact that conservative Republicans are particularly critical of China's handling of the pandemic, with 80% saying China has not done a good job [9].\n\nEducational background also plays a role in shaping these perceptions. More educated Americans, such as those with postgraduate degrees, are more critical of the U.S.'s response to the pandemic. About two-thirds of those with postgraduate degrees (66%) and around 60% of college graduates say the U.S. has done a poor job [10]. In contrast, only about 43% of those with a high school degree or less share this critical view [10].\n\nRegarding China, the data shows that while a majority of Americans across all educational levels are critical of China's handling of the pandemic, the intensity of this criticism varies. For example, 69% of Americans aged 65 and older say China has done a fair or poor job, compared to 59% of those under 30 [11]. This age-related trend aligns with the general finding that older Americans tend to have less favorable attitudes toward China.\n\nAdditionally, the partisan divide is evident in the perception of China's response. While 54% of Republicans say the U.S. can learn from other countries, only 33% of Democrats hold this view [6]. This suggests that Republicans are more likely to see value in learning from other countries' approaches, which may influence their critical stance on China's handling of the pandemic.\n\nIn summary, both political affiliation and educational background significantly influence how Americans perceive the U.S. and China's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, with Republicans and more educated individuals being more critical of the U.S. and China, respectively. ![Americans' perceptions of the U.S. and China's handling of the pandemic vary by political affiliation and education level](image4)"}

Americans who have completed higher levels of education are more likely to think the country’s global influence will recede. For example, 45% of those with postgraduate degrees believe the U.S. will have less influence, compared to 42% of college graduates and those with some college education [10].

Despite this, 77% of older adults do have a cell phone of some kind, though these tend to be more basic devices [7].\n\nInterestingly, tablets and e-book readers are as popular as smartphones among older adults, with 18% owning a smartphone and 27% owning a tablet or e-book reader [4]. This suggests that older adults may prefer devices that are easier to use for reading and entertainment, rather than more complex smartphones.\n\nWhen it comes to internet usage frequency, 71% of older adults who use the internet go online every day or almost every day, and an additional 11% go online three to five times per week [5]. This indicates that once older adults start using the internet, they tend to integrate it into their daily routines.\n\nThese trends are also reflected in the demographic breakdowns. For example, older adults aged 65-69 have higher rates of internet usage (74%) and broadband at home (65%) compared to those aged 80+ (37% and 21%, respectively) [image2]. Similarly, education and income levels play a role, with college graduates and those in higher income brackets having higher rates of internet and broadband usage [image2].\n\nIn summary, while older adults have lower rates of smartphone ownership compared to the general population, they show a strong preference for simpler devices like tablets and e-book readers. Once they start using the internet, they tend to use it frequently, integrating it into their daily lives. ![Older adults have lower rates of smartphone ownership but high rates of cell phone ownership and a preference for simpler devices like tablets and e-book readers.](image5)"}

These social network adopters tend to have more persistent social connections with the people they care about, indicating a strong engagement in online social activities [1].\n\nWhen it comes to device ownership, the trends show that tablets and e-book readers are particularly popular among older adults. Specifically, 27% of seniors own a tablet, an e-book reader, or both, while only 18% own a smartphone [7]. This suggests that seniors are more inclined towards devices that are easier to use for reading and entertainment, rather than the more complex and multifunctional smartphones.\n\nInterestingly, the adoption of tablets and e-book readers among seniors is somewhat more modest when it comes to those with physical or health conditions that make reading difficult. Despite this, 22% of seniors with such conditions still own either a tablet or an e-book reader [5], highlighting the accessibility and appeal of these devices even among physically challenged individuals.\n\nThe data also shows that device ownership and internet usage among seniors vary significantly by age, education, and income. For instance, seniors with higher education and higher incomes are more likely to own tablets and e-book readers [10]. This trend is reflected in the ownership rates, where college graduates and those with higher incomes are three to four times more likely to own these devices compared to their less educated and lower-income counterparts [10].\n\nIn terms of online social networking, the data indicates that 27% of older adults use social networking sites [4], and this usage is more prevalent among those who are already active online. The chart showing the breakdown of online activity among seniors further supports this, with 41% of online seniors using social networking sites and 32% not going online at all [4] ![27% of online seniors use social networking sites, while 32% do not go online at all.](image4).\n\nOverall, the trends suggest that while seniors are increasingly adopting various devices, their usage of social networking sites is more closely tied to their overall online engagement and access to technology. \n\nSeniors who are more tech-savvy and have better access to the internet are more likely to use social networking sites, and they tend to own devices like tablets and e-book readers more frequently."}

These discrepancies suggest that the public is more concerned about the potential biases and lack of human oversight in these systems rather than their technical capabilities.\n\n![{The personal finance score is seen as the least fair, with only 32% of respondents finding it fair to consumers, despite 54% believing it would be effective.}](image3)\n\nThe automated resume screening of job applicants and the criminal risk assessment for parole also show interesting contrasts. While 43% of respondents think the resume screening is fair, 47% believe the criminal risk score is fair, despite similar effectiveness ratings [9]. This suggests that the context and the stakes involved in the decision-making process play a crucial role in shaping public perceptions.\n\nMoreover, demographic differences further complicate these perceptions. For example, Black and Hispanic respondents are more likely to find the personal finance score fair compared to white respondents, while Black respondents express more concern about the fairness of the criminal risk score [10]. This indicates that the social and historical context of racial and ethnic groups influences their trust in these systems.\n\n![{A majority of Americans find the personal finance score and video job interview algorithms unacceptable, with 68% and 67% respectively, citing concerns about fairness and privacy.}](image2)\n\nOverall, these differences in perceptions of fairness and effectiveness imply that public trust in automated decision-making systems is low, particularly when these systems are perceived as lacking transparency, human oversight, and the ability to capture the nuance of individual circumstances. The public's skepticism highlights the need for more robust regulatory frameworks and transparent practices to address these concerns and build trust in these technologies.\n\nIn conclusion, the public's varying perceptions of fairness and effectiveness across different automated systems suggest a deep-seated mistrust, driven by concerns about bias, privacy, and the removal of human judgment from critical decisions."}

In stark contrast, 90% of Democrats and Democratic leaners rate these standards as not good or poor, with 67% specifically labeling them as poor [3].

This criticism is more widespread than the declining positive evaluations of state and local government officials, which have dropped from 70% to 56% and from 69% to 60%, respectively [8].\n\nMoreover, the partisan divide is evident in these perceptions. Republicans are more likely to give positive ratings to state and local government officials, while Democrats are more critical [1]. This is also reflected in the wider gap in views on the federal government's response, with 82% of Democrats viewing it as inadequate compared to only 21% of Republicans [4].\n\nAdditionally, a majority of Americans (75%) believe that not enough people are adhering to social distancing and mask-wearing guidelines, and 58% think that lifting restrictions too quickly is a major reason for the continued outbreak [6]. These concerns are more pronounced among Democrats, with 82% citing inadequate federal response and 82% citing premature lifting of restrictions as major reasons [4].\n\nIn summary, while there is a general concern about the speed at which state governments are lifting restrictions, the criticism of Trump's handling of the pandemic is more severe and widespread, particularly among Democrats. ![Not enough people social distancing and mask-wearing](image4)\n\nAmerican perceptions of the state government's COVID-19 response are more mixed, but they are still more critical of Trump's handling of the pandemic."}

This decline is reflected in broader negative assessments of the overall U.S. response to the coronavirus outbreak, with 62% of Americans believing the U.S. response has been less effective compared to other wealthy countries [3].\n\nWhen it comes to the factors contributing to the continued outbreak, a significant majority of Americans (75%) believe that not enough people are following guidelines on social distancing and mask-wearing [2].

Other top issues include health care (71%), violent crime and education (70% each), and gun policy (66%) [12].\n\nDemographic factors also play a significant role in shaping these preferences. For example, the strength of Hispanic identity is linked to how Hispanic registered voters would vote. Most Hispanics who say being Hispanic is extremely or very important to how they think of themselves (60%) would vote for the Democratic candidate in their local congressional district [6]. Additionally, religious affiliation can influence political views. Catholics and Evangelical Protestants tend to have higher disapproval rates of certain policies compared to those with no religious affiliation [8].\n\nThese trends are visually represented in the data, showing that while the overall party affiliation has remained stable, the importance of specific issues like abortion has increased significantly. The visual representation also highlights the varying levels of trust and perception of the Democratic and Republican parties among Latino voters, with the Democratic Party generally viewed more positively in terms of caring about Latinos and working hard to earn their votes [image3].\n\nIn conclusion, Latino voters' party affiliations have remained relatively stable, but the importance of issues such as abortion has increased, particularly in the lead-up to the 2022 midterm elections. Demographic factors, including the strength of Hispanic identity and religious affiliation, significantly influence these preferences. ![Latino voters' perceptions of the Democratic and Republican parties vary significantly](image3)"}

On the other hand, 63% of Hispanic Republicans and GOP leaners want Trump to remain a national political figure, including 41% who support him running for president in 2024 [4].\n\nWhen it comes to perceptions of racial discrimination, the differences are also stark. About 73% of Hispanic Democrats and Democratic leaners say that people not seeing racial discrimination where it really exists is a bigger problem, whereas only 62% of Hispanic Republicans and GOP leaners agree with this sentiment [10]. This indicates that Hispanic Democrats are more likely to see racial discrimination as a significant issue that is often overlooked.\n\nThese differences highlight the contrasting views within the Hispanic community based on party affiliation, with Democrats more critical of Trump's political presence and more concerned about racial discrimination. \n\n![{Hispanic Democrats and Republicans have significantly different views on Trump's political future and racial discrimination.}](image6)"}

This sentiment is mirrored in their concerns about racial discrimination, where a higher percentage of Hispanics who say being Hispanic is important to their identity (66%) also believe that people not seeing racial discrimination where it exists is a significant problem [8].\n\nMoreover, Hispanic Democrats and Democratic leaners are more likely to prioritize controlling gun ownership (85%) over protecting the right to own guns, compared to Hispanic Republicans and Republican leaners (45%) [9]. This aligns with the broader trend of Hispanic Democrats being more progressive on social issues, including support for gun control and recognition of racial discrimination.\n\nThe image data further reinforces these trends. For instance, among Hispanic registered voters, a higher percentage of those who are Democrats or lean Democratic disapprove of Trump remaining a national political figure, with 94% of Latino Democrats strongly opposing it `![{94% of Latino Democrats strongly oppose Trump remaining a national political figure}](image5)`.

This positive view extends to the perception that the Democratic Party works hard to earn the votes of Latinos and cares about them, with 71% and 63% of Latinos agreeing, respectively [9].\n\nHowever, when it comes to the perception of differences between the parties, fewer than half of Hispanics (45%) say they see a great deal of difference between the Democratic and Republican parties [10]. This lack of perceived difference is consistent across political affiliations, with about equal shares of Hispanic Democrats and Republicans saying there is a great deal of difference between the parties (47% and 48%, respectively) [6]. \n\nThe survey also highlights that the party affiliation of Latino registered voters has remained largely unchanged over the past few years.

In contrast, women in more gender-balanced settings report lower rates of these issues [![44% of women in other settings have experienced gender-related discrimination](image7)].\n\nIn summary, women in STEM jobs in male-dominated environments face significantly higher rates of workplace discrimination and gender inequities compared to those in more gender-balanced settings."}

For instance, among adults with Hispanic ancestry who do not self-identify as Hispanic, 81% report never considering themselves Hispanic or Latino [1]. This can be attributed to several reasons, including a mixed Hispanic and non-Hispanic background (27%), limited contact with Hispanic relatives (16%), lack of Spanish language skills or cultural links (15%), and physical appearance or racial identification (12%) [1].\n\nThese factors are further illustrated in an image showing the breakdown of reasons why individuals with Hispanic ancestry do not identify as Hispanic or Latino `![Mixed background/Hispanic ancestry too far back, Upbringing/No contact with Hispanic relatives, Does not speak Spanish/Has no cultural link, Identifies as other race/Does not look Hispanic, Born in U.S./Idenfities as American](image3)`.\n\nAdditionally, the importance of having a Spanish last name is often seen as a characteristic of Hispanic identity, but only 16% of self-identified Hispanics consider it essential [2]. This is reflected in another image that shows the varying importance of a Spanish last name among different generations of Hispanics `![Speak Spanish No Yes Among self-identified Hispanics Second Third or higher generation Self-identified Hispanics Foreign born Have a Spanish last name No Yes Self-identified 15 Hispanics Among self-identified Hispanics Foreign born 20 Second Third or higher generation](image1)`.\n\nThe generational differences in self-identification are also significant.

This trend is further highlighted in an image showing the increasing sense of American identity across generations `![Foreign born Second generation Third or higher generation 36](image8)`.\n\nMoreover, the requirement of speaking Spanish to be considered Hispanic is a contentious issue. A majority of self-identified Hispanics, especially those in the third or higher generation (92%), believe that speaking Spanish is not necessary to be considered Latino [7]. This is supported by an image that demonstrates the decreasing importance of speaking Spanish among different generations `![Self-identified enti Hispanics Among self-identified Hispanics Foreign born 7 generation Third or higher generation Self-identified non-Hicenanice](image7)`.\n\nIn conclusion, the self-identification of Hispanics in the U.S. is influenced by a combination of cultural, linguistic, and personal factors, with significant variations across generations.

For foreign-born self-identified Hispanics, 59% report that their parents often took them to these celebrations [4]. This participation rate is maintained at 49% among the second generation but drops to 35% among the third or higher generation [5].

For instance, in the Non-GCC region, a significant portion of the population is either very or somewhat concerned about the rising cost of living, with countries like Egypt, Jordan, and Lebanon showing particularly high levels of concern `![{Concerns about rising costs of living are higher in Non-GCC countries}](image3)`. In contrast, GCC countries, while still expressing some concern, show relatively lower levels of worry. This difference can be attributed to the stronger economic stability and higher standards of living in GCC countries, which may provide more financial buffers against rising costs.\n\nSimilarly, when it comes to unemployment, the data reveals a similar pattern. Non-GCC countries exhibit higher levels of concern about unemployment compared to GCC countries. For example, countries like Egypt, Jordan, and Tunisia have a substantial number of young people who are very or somewhat concerned about unemployment `![{Concerns about unemployment are also higher in Non-GCC countries}](image4)`. In GCC countries, while unemployment is still a concern, the levels are generally lower, likely due to the robust job markets and government support systems in place.\n\nThese variations in concern levels highlight the differing economic and social priorities across the region. Non-GCC countries, often facing more immediate economic challenges such as inflation and job scarcity, prioritize issues related to daily survival and economic stability. On the other hand, GCC countries, with their more stable economies and better social safety nets, may focus more on long-term development and quality of life issues.\n\nIn conclusion, the higher levels of concern about rising costs of living and unemployment in Non-GCC countries compared to GCC countries reveal that economic stability and job security are more pressing issues in the former, while the latter may have more resources to address broader developmental goals."}

According to the data, the number of daily Caltrain riders in these areas has grown substantially over the years. For instance, in 2012, the number of riders in Palo Alto was 4,461, and in Mountain View, it was 3,670 [image5]. This growth aligns with the broader trend of increasing ridership, which is reflected in the high load factors of many trains, often exceeding 100% [image6].\n\nThe crowding issue is evident, with trains frequently operating at or above their maximum seated capacity. For example, the northbound train departing at 7:03 AM from San Jose has a maximum load of 878 passengers, which is 158% of its seated capacity [image6]. This level of overcrowding not only affects passenger comfort but also the overall efficiency and reliability of the service.\n\nTo address these capacity issues, it is crucial to implement strategies such as grade separations and increased funding to support more frequent and reliable service. These measures are essential to accommodate the growing demand and ensure that the system can handle the expected doubling of daily trips from 60,000 to 120,000 over the next decade [10]. ![Ridership growth in Mountain View and Palo Alto has led to overcrowded trains](image6)"}

According to the data, the transportation sector is a significant contributor to CO2 emissions, accounting for 30% of emissions in OECD countries and about 20% worldwide [12]. This highlights the importance of the transportation sector in overall CO2 emissions.\n\nWhen we examine the global motor vehicle demand, the USA, China, and Germany are prominent players. The USA has a significant share in global motor vehicle demand, followed by China and Germany [image3]. This indicates a high level of motor vehicle ownership in these countries, which can contribute to higher CO2 emissions.\n\nNext, let's consider the CO2 emissions per capita. The graph showing the energy consumption in different sectors provides a visual representation of the CO2 emissions from various countries [image6]. The USA and China stand out with relatively high CO2 emissions, while Germany also has notable emissions but is generally more efficient in its energy use compared to the USA and China.\n\nThe size of the bubbles in the image represents the total CO2 emissions from energy use in different sectors of the respective nations. The larger the bubble, the greater the CO2 emissions [8]. In this context, the USA and China have significantly larger bubbles, indicating higher CO2 emissions. Germany, while still a significant emitter, has a smaller bubble, suggesting relatively lower emissions.\n\nAdditionally, the transportation sector's contribution to CO2 emissions is evident in the pie chart [image2]. Transport accounts for 24% of CO2 emissions, which aligns with the high motor vehicle ownership in the USA, China, and Germany.\n\nGiven these data points, it is clear that the USA and China have higher CO2 emissions per capita and higher motor vehicle ownership compared to Germany. This implies that the USA and China may have a greater environmental impact due to their higher CO2 emissions and motor vehicle usage.\n\nIn conclusion, the USA and China have higher CO2 emissions per capita and motor vehicle ownership, which suggests a greater environmental impact compared to Germany. ![Higher CO2 emissions and motor vehicle ownership in the USA and China](image6)"}

According to the data, Europe has been producing higher exit multiples despite having average exit values that are about 25% smaller compared to the USA [1]. This higher capital efficiency in Europe overcompensates for the disadvantages in exit value, making European venture capital a strong and fundamentally sound industry [2].\n\nTo illustrate this, let's look at the median exit valuation and the percentage of exits with a multiple of cash greater than 5. The median exit valuation in Europe is significantly lower than in the USA, but a higher percentage of European exits achieve a multiple of cash greater than 5, with 57.26% of European exits achieving this compared to 41.27% in the USA ![More European exits achieve higher multiples](image4).\n\nAdditionally, the number and quality of venture-backed liquidity events in Europe have been impressive. For instance, Germany, a key player in the European venture ecosystem, has produced the highest number of venture-backed exits in Europe over the past 24 months [9]. Some notable examples include companies like XING, COREVALVE, and VistaPrint, which have achieved significant liquidity events ![Notable European venture-backed exits](image5).\n\nIn contrast, the USA has a more established venture capital ecosystem with a larger number of private investors, including pension and endowment funds, which account for roughly 65% of the US VC industry [4]. However, the European market has been characterized by a scarcity of VC money, leading to lower entry valuations and higher capital efficiency [11]. This scarcity has also driven up the hit rate, as investors can be more selective, resulting in better overall performance [11].\n\nIn summary, while the USA has a more mature and well-funded venture capital market, Europe has been demonstrating strong fundamentals and higher capital efficiency, leading to impressive exit multiples and liquidity events over the last 24 months."}

This outperformance can be attributed to lower entry valuations and higher capital efficiency, which overcompensates for the disadvantages in exit value [10].\n\nTo illustrate this further, consider the median exit valuation and the percentage of deals with a multiple of cash greater than 5. The data shows that in Europe, the median exit valuation is €50 million, and 57.26% of deals have a multiple of cash greater than 5, compared to the USA where the median exit valuation is $75 million, and 41.27% of deals have a multiple of cash greater than 5 ![Higher exit multiples in Europe compared to the USA](image4).\n\nAdditionally, the scarcity of VC money in Europe has led to low entry valuations and driven up capital efficiency, which is roughly 70% higher than in the US [11]. This higher capital efficiency and selectivity among investors contribute to the strong performance of European VC.\n\nIn conclusion, European VC performance in terms of investment multiples and exit values is robust and often surpasses that of the USA, driven by efficient capital usage and strategic investment practices."}

According to the data, nearly 62% of internet users access the internet through mobile devices, and less than 10% have internet access at home [12]. This indicates a strong reliance on mobile devices for internet connectivity, which extends to various online activities, including shopping.\n\nMobile users in Indonesia are highly engaged with instant messaging (IM) platforms, with 90% using IM daily and 60% using it multiple times daily [10]. This high engagement with IM platforms suggests that these tools are not only used for communication but also for social commerce, such as through BBM Group \"online shops\" and Instagram \"shops\" [10]. These platforms serve as important channels for e-commerce, where users can browse and purchase products directly from their mobile devices.\n\nMoreover, the popularity of mobile apps and games is evident, with 49% of mobile content downloads being games or apps [image2]. This high engagement with mobile apps indicates that users are comfortable and familiar with using their mobile devices for a variety of activities, including shopping.\n\nWhen it comes to online shopping, the data shows that shoes and bags are the most commonly purchased items online, followed by watches and airline tickets [image4]. This aligns with the broader trend of increasing mobile internet usage, as more users are leveraging their mobile devices to make purchases. The convenience and accessibility of mobile devices make them a preferred choice for online shopping, especially in a country where many users do not have reliable internet access at home.\n\nAdditionally, the growth of mobile ads in Indonesia, with 200 billion mobile ad impressions recorded in 2012, further underscores the importance of mobile devices in driving e-commerce [12].

By 2014, there were 240 million mobile subscribers in Indonesia, with a continuous growth rate of 31.9% from 2006 to 2010 [1]. This indicates a rapidly expanding market for mobile services and content.\n\n### Demographics and Content Preferences\n\n#### Age Distribution\nThe age distribution of mobile internet users in Indonesia is diverse, with a notable concentration of younger users. According to data from 2012, the majority of mobile internet users fall into the 18-35 age range, with 11.6% being under 18 and 4% over 35 [image8]. This young demographic is highly engaged with mobile content, particularly instant messaging (IM) and social media platforms. For instance, 90% of mobile users use IM daily, with 60% using it multiple times a day, and the top three IM applications are WhatsApp, BlackBerry Messenger (BBM), and LINE [12].\n\n#### Usage Patterns\nMobile devices account for 36% of the 5 hours of media content consumed daily by Indonesian users, with an average of 106 minutes spent on mobile devices [5]. This high engagement with mobile content suggests a strong preference for interactive and multimedia content such as games, videos, and music. Games and apps are the most downloaded mobile content, followed by videos and music [image3].\n\n### Business Opportunities\n\n#### E-commerce\nThe growing mobile internet user base presents significant opportunities for e-commerce.

Additionally, 27% of e-commerce users prefer shopping through social media and IM groups like BBM and Instagram, indicating a strong trend towards social and mobile commerce [12].\n\n#### Advertising\nThe mobile advertising industry in Indonesia is also burgeoning. In 2013, the mobile ads industry was worth $9.5 million, with XL owning 25% of the market at $2.3 million [5]. Mobile ads are expected to account for 5-10% of the total ads industry by 2015. The most popular forms of mobile ads are intrusive ads (interstitial and off-deck ads), which, despite controversy, remain effective due to their high visibility [5].\n\n#### Payment Solutions\nThe predominantly prepaid market in Indonesia offers unique opportunities for payment solutions. Services like Coda Payments and Mimopay provide carrier billing, allowing users to pay for goods and services using their mobile phone numbers and airtime balance [image6]. These solutions are particularly useful for the large unbanked population, making mobile payments more accessible and convenient.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe demographics of mobile internet users in Indonesia, characterized by a young, highly engaged population, align closely with their preferences for interactive and multimedia content. This presents substantial business opportunities in e-commerce, advertising, and payment solutions. The rapid growth in mobile internet usage and the increasing reliance on mobile devices for information and transactions underscore the potential for innovative mobile-based services and products in the Indonesian market.\n\nTo summarize, the young and active mobile internet user base in Indonesia, coupled with their strong preferences for social media, IM, and multimedia content, creates a fertile ground for businesses to capitalize on e-commerce, mobile advertising, and payment solutions. ![Mobile content preferences and business opportunities are closely linked to the young and active user base in Indonesia.](image8)"}

The number of subscribers and data users for these operators has been significant and evolving over time.\n\n![{Telkomsel, XL, and Indosat have a large subscriber base, with Telkomsel leading in both subscribers and data users.}](image6)\n\nFrom the chart, it is evident that Telkomsel has the highest number of subscribers and data users among the three. As of the latest data, Telkomsel has around 132 million subscribers and 65 million data users, while XL and Indosat have fewer but still substantial numbers. Specifically, XL has around 43 million subscribers and 38 million data users, and Indosat has around 12.3 million subscribers and 13.8 million data users.\n\nAdditionally, the trend shows a consistent increase in the number of smartphone users across all three operators, indicating a growing adoption of mobile data services. For instance, the number of Android users, which is a significant indicator of smartphone penetration, has also seen a rise, particularly with Telkomsel leading the pack [11].\n\nIn summary, Telkomsel leads in both subscriber base and data users, followed by XL and then Indosat.

The number of subscribers grew, reflecting the overall trend of increasing mobile subscriptions in Indonesia during this period [8]. However, the ARPU showed a more complex pattern, influenced by several factors.\n\nOne key factor affecting ARPU was the shift from traditional voice and SMS services to data-based services such as instant messaging and VoIP. This shift was driven by the widespread adoption of smartphones, particularly Android devices, which became increasingly popular among Indonesian users [10]. As more users transitioned to data-intensive services, the usage of voice and SMS declined, leading to a reduction in voice and SMS ARPU [2], [5].\n\nThe impact of this transition can be seen in the ARPU trends over the years. The graph showing the ARPU for voice, SMS, and mobile data indicates that while voice and SMS ARPU continued to decline, mobile data ARPU initially fell but was expected to pick up as data consumption increased [5]. This trend is evident in the image depicting the ARPU changes from 2013 to 2017, where voice and SMS ARPU show a downward trajectory, while mobile data ARPU shows a more volatile but ultimately upward trend ![Voice and SMS ARPU continue to decline, while mobile data ARPU shows initial decline followed by recovery](image2).\n\nAdditionally, the competitive landscape played a role in these changes. CDMA operators forced GSM operators, including Telkomsel, to reduce their tariffs, contributing to the overall decline in ARPU [6]. The initial price war, initiated by the government, also led to reduced ARPU [7].\n\nDespite these challenges, Telkomsel's subscriber base continued to grow, as shown in the image depicting the number of subscribers and smartphone users across different operators. By 2014, Telkomsel had a substantial number of subscribers and a growing base of smartphone users, indicating a strong market presence ![Telkomsel's subscriber base and smartphone users grew significantly](image6).\n\nIn conclusion, Telkomsel's subscriber base grew from 2013 to 2014, while its ARPU was affected by the shift towards data-based services and increased competition, leading to a decline in voice and SMS ARPU but an eventual recovery in mobile data ARPU."}

According to the data, the number of smartphone users in Indonesia grew substantially during this period. The graph shows that the number of smartphone users, particularly Android users, increased significantly, outpacing BlackBerry users. By 2014, the number of Android users had surpassed BlackBerry users, indicating a strong shift towards Android devices. This trend is evident in the subscriber base of major telecom operators like Telkomsel and XL. ![{Smartphone users, especially Android, saw significant growth from 2013 to 2014}](image3)\n\nIn terms of ARPU trends, the data indicates that the Voice ARPU and SMS ARPU were on a decline, while Mobile Data ARPU showed a more complex pattern. Voice ARPU continued to flatten, and SMS ARPU continued to decrease due to the increasing use of data-based messaging services. On the other hand, Mobile Data ARPU initially fell but was expected to pick up as data consumption increased. ![{Voice ARPU flattened, SMS ARPU declined, and Mobile Data ARPU showed initial decline followed by expected increase}](image1)\n\nThese trends can be attributed to several factors. One key factor is the widespread adoption of smartphones, which led to a higher usage of data-based services such as instant messaging (IM) and Voice over IP (VoIP). This shift reduced the reliance on traditional voice calls and SMS, thereby impacting the ARPU from these services. Additionally, the competitive market dynamics, including price wars initiated by the government, contributed to the reduction in tariffs and, consequently, the ARPU. [2], [7], [11]\n\nMoreover, the growth in e-commerce and social media usage on mobile devices further drove the demand for data services. E-commerce platforms like lojai.com and Tokobagus/OLX reported significant growth in mobile transactions, indicating a shift towards mobile internet usage. [9]\n\nIn conclusion, the number of smartphone users for Telkomsel and XL increased significantly between 2013 and 2014, driven by the popularity of Android devices and the growing importance of data-based services. This shift led to a decline in Voice and SMS ARPU but set the stage for a future increase in Mobile Data ARPU as data consumption continued to rise."}

The image depicting the genre breakdown shows country music maintaining a steady presence in both physical and digital album sales, as well as streaming ![Country music has balanced consumption](image1).\n\nThese trends suggest that the way music is consumed is highly genre-dependent. Rock fans prefer the traditional album format, while R&B and hip-hop fans are more inclined towards streaming. Pop music fans enjoy both streaming and purchasing individual songs, and country music fans have a balanced approach to both formats.

This rapid adoption is a testament to Apple's strong ecosystem and user base.\n\nOn the other hand, Android's adoption rates are more fragmented. While the latest version of Android, Lollipop, has gained momentum, it only accounts for 35 percent of total Android users [6]. The majority of Android devices are still running on KitKat, which stands at 39.2 percent [2]. This fragmentation can make it challenging for developers to optimize their apps for a wide range of devices and versions.\n\nThe developer mindshare for these platforms further reflects the market dynamics. Android developers outnumber iOS developers by a ratio of 4 to 3 [11], indicating a larger community of developers working on the Android platform. This could be due to the broader reach and potential user base of Android, despite the fragmentation issues.\n\nThe growth in the number of apps in the Google Play Store, which increased by more than 50 percent last year, now stands at over 1.6 million available apps [9].

First, the user's natural language input is processed by a bidirectional LSTM (utterance-level LSTM) to produce a continuous vector representation of the user utterance [2]. This vector captures the semantic meaning of the user's request.\n\nNext, this user utterance vector, along with the encoding of the previous system action, is fed into a dialogue-level LSTM. This dialogue-level LSTM maintains a continuous representation of the dialogue state, which is updated after each dialogue turn [10]. The dialogue state tracker then uses this representation to estimate the user's goal, represented as a list of slot-value pairs [10].\n\nBased on the dialogue state, the policy network generates a system action in the form of a dialogue act. This action is conditioned on the dialogue state, the estimated user's goal, and the encoding of the query results [5]. For example, if the user requests a movie for the day after tomorrow, the system might respond with a request for the preferred time, as shown in the interaction depicted in the image [![{System dialogue act at turn k: \"Ok, what time do you prefer?\"}](image6)].\n\nFinally, the emitted system action, along with the user goal tracking results and the retrieved knowledge base entities, is used to generate the final natural language system response via a natural language generator (NLG). The NLG uses templates to replace delexicalized tokens with the appropriate values from the user's goal or the knowledge base [6].\n\nIn summary, the system generates a response by encoding the user's input, updating the dialogue state, generating a system action, and producing a natural language response through a template-based NLG."}

Unlike existing datasets, SnapNTell is designed to evaluate models' abilities to recognize and provide detailed, entity-specific knowledge.\n\nFirstly, the SnapNTell dataset encompasses a diverse range of fine-grained entities, each accompanied by corresponding representative images. This is a significant departure from datasets like VQA 2.0, GQA, and OK-VQA, which often use broad terms and lack the specificity needed for fine-grained entity recognition [1][2]. For instance, while VQA 2.0 and GQA focus on a narrower range of categories and often use generic terms, SnapNTell includes 22 categories such as landmarks, paintings, sculptures, food, fruits, vegetables, mammals, fish, birds, reptiles, amphibians, insects, celebrities, instruments, plants, electronics, tools, transportation, sports, books, household items, and cars [5].\n\nMoreover, the SnapNTell dataset is meticulously curated to include a wide array of entities, with 7,568 unique entities in total. Each entity is represented by 10 illustrative images, and the dataset contains 75,680 knowledge-intensive QA pairs [10]. This level of detail and specificity is unmatched by other datasets. For example, ViQuAE and Encyclopedic VQA, while incorporating entity-level knowledge, have fewer categories and entities. ViQuAE has 3 categories and 2,400 unique entities, while Encyclopedic VQA has 12 categories and 5,750 unique entities [9].\n\nAdditionally, the SnapNTell dataset emphasizes knowledge-intensive responses over simple binary answers. The QA pairs in SnapNTell are designed to require a deep understanding of the specific entities depicted in the images, as illustrated by the example question and answer pair: \"What is the current status of it?\" \"The Mendenhall Glacier is currently experiencing a negative glacier mass balance and will likely continue to retreat.\" ![The Mendenhall Glacier is currently experiencing a negative glacier mass balance and will likely continue to retreat.](image1)\n\nIn contrast, datasets like WebQA, while introducing real-world knowledge-seeking questions, often lack the fine-grained entity categorization and granularity found in SnapNTell [7]. The performance of various baseline models on the SnapNTell dataset also highlights its effectiveness in evaluating models' capabilities in recognizing entities and producing entity-specific responses. The significant performance disparities observed on the SnapNTell dataset, compared to traditional VQA datasets, further underscore its unique challenges and the need for more advanced models [12].\n\nIn summary, the SnapNTell dataset is uniquely positioned to address the gap in VQA by focusing on fine-grained entity recognition and knowledge-intensive responses, making it a valuable resource for advancing research in entity-centric VQA."}

(2016), Ma and Hovy (2016), and Yang et al. (2017).\n\nNext, we examine the features that contribute to the high performance of the \"CCNN+WLSTM+CRF\" model. According to the table in image4, the baseline model \"WLSTM+CRF\" achieves an F1-value of 89.15. Adding part-of-speech (POS) tags improves the F1-value to 89.94. Incorporating capitalization (Cap) further enhances the F1-value to 90.59. However, the most significant improvement comes from adding character-level LSTM (CLSTM) and character-level CNN (CCNN) features. Specifically, adding CLSTM boosts the F1-value to 91.20, and adding CCNN further increases it to 91.35.\n\nThese findings are consistent with the text quote [9], which states that character information can significantly improve model performance, and using LSTM or CNN gives similar improvements. The \"CCNN+WLSTM+CRF\" model combines the strengths of character-level CNN and word-level LSTM, leading to the highest F1-value.\n\nTherefore, the model that achieves the highest F1-value for NER is the \"CCNN+WLSTM+CRF\" model, and the key features contributing to its performance are the combination of character-level CNN and word-level LSTM, along with the CRF inference layer. ![Character-level CNN and word-level LSTM combined with CRF achieve the highest F1-value for NER](image4)"}

The model's performance is significantly influenced by the type and placement of positional encodings. For instance, when no spatial positional encodings are used, the model's AP drops by 7.8 points [6]. This highlights the critical role of spatial positional encodings in maintaining high performance. \n\nWhen fixed sine spatial positional encodings are passed at the input and output encodings are learned at the input, the model experiences a minor 1.4 AP drop [6]. This suggests that while fixed sine encodings are effective, they are not as optimal as learned encodings. On the other hand, passing learned spatial encodings at every attention layer results in a slight 1.0 AP drop [6], indicating that learned encodings are robust but slightly less effective when applied at every layer.\n\nThe importance of output positional encodings (object queries) is also evident. When these encodings are not used, the model's performance drops significantly, achieving only 32.8 AP [8]. This underscores the necessity of output positional encodings for the model to function effectively.\n\nNext, let's examine the effect of loss components. The DETR model uses a set-based loss, which inherently avoids the need for Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) by design [11]. However, applying NMS can still provide insights into the model's behavior. For the first decoder layer, NMS improves performance, likely because a single layer lacks the ability to compute cross-correlations and thus makes multiple predictions for the same object [11]. As the number of decoder layers increases, the self-attention mechanism helps inhibit duplicate predictions, reducing the need for NMS [11].\n\nTo visualize these findings, consider the following graph showing the AP with and without NMS at different decoder layers:\n![{AP with and without NMS at different decoder layers}](image4)\nThis graph demonstrates that NMS provides a significant boost in AP for the first few layers but becomes less beneficial as the model depth increases, eventually leading to a slight decrease in AP due to the removal of true positive predictions.\n\nIn summary, the configuration of positional encodings and the choice of loss components significantly affect the Average Precision (AP) in the DETR-DC5 model for object detection. Spatial positional encodings and output positional encodings are crucial for maintaining high performance, while the set-based loss and self-attention mechanism in the decoder layers help reduce the need for NMS, improving overall efficiency and accuracy."}

This indicates that the high-level reasoning plan provided by reasoning programs substantially alleviates the demands on the subsequent sub-task solvers.\n\nMoreover, the performance of FLAN-T5 decreases significantly with decreasing model size, while this trend is less notable for ProgramFC. For example, on the HOVER 4-hop dataset, the F1 score for FLAN-T5-XXL is 68.18%, whereas for ProgramFC with FLAN-T5-small, it is 68.56%. This highlights the effectiveness of program-guided reasoning in maintaining performance even with smaller models [5].\n\nIn terms of retrieval recall, ProgramFC also outperforms one-step retrieval methods. The recall of the gold paragraphs for the top-10 retrieved paragraphs (recall @10) is notably higher for ProgramFC compared to one-step retrieval on all datasets, with the largest improvement of 37.1% on HOVER 4-hop [8]. This improvement is due to the iterative retrieval guided by the reasoning program, which allows for the discovery of information that may not be present in the original claim but is revealed during the reasoning process [8].\n\nTo summarize, ProgramFC not only maintains high performance across different model sizes but also significantly enhances the retrieval of relevant evidence, making it a robust choice for complex fact-checking tasks. ![ProgramFC outperforms one-step retrieval on all datasets, with the largest improvement of 37.1% on HOVER 4-hop.](image8)"}

Error analysis reveals that as the complexity of the claims increases, the proportion of semantic errors in the programs also rises, with structural errors becoming particularly prevalent. For example, in the 4-hop claims, 71% of the errors are semantic, with 57% being structural errors [image7].

These errors underscore the need for further improvements in the generation and execution of reasoning programs to handle more complex and nuanced claims.\n\nIn conclusion, ProgramFC demonstrates superior performance in fact-checking complex claims and enhancing evidence retrieval, but it faces challenges with increasing claim complexity, particularly in generating and executing correct reasoning programs."}

For instance, in the example shown in the image, the claim about A's productivity requires understanding that \"productivity\" corresponds to the \"Prod.\" column and performing a simple subtraction to verify the claim [1][image1].\n\nHowever, the dataset also presents several challenges:\n\n- **Numerical Reasoning**: Many claims require numerical calculations, such as the difference between percentages, which can be complex and error-prone [4][image1].\n- **Ambiguity and Partial Truths**: Some claims are partially right or contain incorrect approximation words, making them difficult to verify [5][image8].\n- **Lack of Evidence**: A significant portion of claims are not enough information (NEI) due to insufficient evidence in the table or the lack of necessary background knowledge [8][image8].\n\nThese challenges underscore the need for advanced reasoning capabilities and the integration of external knowledge sources to enhance the fact-checking process. The diversity and complexity of the reasoning types in SciTAB make it a more comprehensive and realistic representation of the challenges faced in real-world scientific fact-checking [10][image7].\n\nIn conclusion, the most common reasoning steps in the SciTAB dataset are simple lookup, comparison, and closed-domain knowledge, while the main challenges include numerical reasoning, ambiguity, and insufficient evidence."}

The dataset includes a wide range of reasoning steps, with some claims requiring up to 11 hops of reasoning, as shown in the statistics of different datasets [image1]. This high number of reasoning steps underscores the intricate nature of the claims and the need for sophisticated reasoning capabilities.\n\nAdditionally, the error analysis reveals that common issues include grounding errors, ambiguity, and calculation errors, which further emphasize the complexity of the dataset [image6]. These errors often arise due to the need for multiple reasoning steps and the integration of various types of knowledge, making the task particularly challenging for both models and human annotators.\n\nIn conclusion, the main reasoning functions in the SciTab dataset and their usage proportions reflect the dataset's complexity, which requires a combination of basic and advanced reasoning skills to accurately verify scientific claims. ![The dataset includes a wide range of reasoning steps, with some claims requiring up to 11 hops of reasoning.](image1) ![Common issues include grounding errors, ambiguity, and calculation errors, which further emphasize the complexity of the dataset.](image6)"}

According to the provided data, the main reasoning types and their proportions in the ScITab dataset are as follows:\n\n- **Grounding errors**: 50% of the errors occur because the program incorrectly associates data with the respective cells in the table. This highlights the difficulty in accurately referencing the specific cells to which a claim refers [8][image5].\n- **Ambiguity errors**: 22% of the errors arise from the ambiguous nature of scientific claims, such as the use of vague pronouns or unclear expressions. This emphasizes the challenges posed by the complexity and variability of scientific language [8][image5].\n- **Calculation errors**: 20% of the errors are due to incorrect floating-point arithmetic calculations, leading to inaccurate results [8][image5].\n- **Program errors**: 8% of the errors involve mistakes in the program itself, such as incorrect or missing arguments/variables, and erroneous operations [8][image5].\n\nThese error types are closely related to the distribution of reasoning steps in the dataset. The distribution of reasoning steps, as shown in the image, indicates the complexity of the tasks involved in fact-checking. For instance, the most common reasoning steps include simple lookups, comparisons, and the extraction of closed-domain and open-domain knowledge [image6]. This aligns with the high proportion of grounding and ambiguity errors, as these steps require precise and unambiguous data association and interpretation.\n\nAdditionally, the dataset's complexity is reflected in the diverse reasoning patterns for unverifiable claims. Common reasons for claims being marked as \"Not Enough Information\" (NEI) include insufficient evidence in the table, the lack of background knowledge, and the use of vague pronouns [6][image3]. These factors contribute to the overall challenge of scientific fact-checking, making the ScITab dataset a more comprehensive and realistic representation of real-world scenarios.\n\nIn conclusion, the main reasoning types in the ScITab dataset and their proportions are closely tied to the distribution of reasoning steps and common error types, reflecting the intricate and varied nature of scientific fact-checking."}

According to the analysis, 41.7% of refuted claims are due to incorrect calculation results, 33.3% involve incorrect approximation words, 10.0% are cases where the claim is partially right, and 8.3% involve values in the claim that do not match the data [10]. This diversity highlights the challenges in verifying scientific claims, which often require nuanced reasoning and domain-specific knowledge.\n\nWhen it comes to the performance of large language models (LLMs) in fact-checking these claims, the results show significant variability. In the 2-class setting (supported vs. refuted), the best-performing open-source LLM, Vicuna-7B, achieves an F1 score of 63.62%, which is only moderately better (+13.62%) than random guessing [2]. In the 3-class setting (supported, refuted, and not enough information), the best open-source model, FLAN-T5-XL, reaches an F1 score of 38.05%, again only slightly better (+4.72%) than random guessing [2].\n\nInterestingly, the inclusion of the NEI class significantly diminishes the models' performance, particularly in the 3-class setting. This is because distinguishing between 'refuted' and 'NEI' claims is inherently difficult, even for trained human annotators [5]. The models tend to default to the safer choice of 'NEI' when faced with complex cases, leading to a shift in their predictions from 'supported/refuted' to 'NEI' [5].\n\nTo illustrate, the table in Image 5 shows the label distribution percentages for InstructGPT and GPT-4. In the 3-class setting, both models predict a higher percentage of NEI claims, which aligns with the observed tendency to default to 'NEI' when uncertain [image5]. This behavior is consistent with the challenges highlighted in the error analysis, where grounding errors, ambiguity, and calculation errors are the most common issues [image3].\n\nIn summary, the primary reasons for refuted claims in the SciTab dataset are incorrect calculations, incorrect approximations, partial correctness, and mismatched values. Large language models, particularly in the 3-class setting, struggle with these claims due to the difficulty in distinguishing between 'refuted' and 'NEI' claims, often defaulting to 'NEI' when uncertain."}

According to the text [3], the refuted claims in ScITaB exhibit a greater diversity compared to other datasets. The primary reasons for refuted claims include:\n\n- **Incorrect calculation results**: 41.7% of refuted claims involve errors in calculations.\n- **Incorrect approximation words**: 33.3% of refuted claims contain incorrect approximation words.\n- **Partially right claims**: 10.0% of refuted claims are partially correct but not entirely accurate.\n- **Mismatched values**: 8.3% of refuted claims have values that do not match the data.\n- **Wrong operation type**: 6.7% of refuted claims involve the wrong type of operation.\n\nThese reasons highlight the complexity and nuance in scientific claims, making them challenging to verify automatically. ![{Refuted claims in ScITaB are diverse and often involve calculation errors or incorrect approximations.}](image6)\n\nNext, let's consider the reasons for NEI claims. The text [5] indicates that NEI claims in ScITaB also exhibit diverse reasoning patterns. The main reasons for NEI claims are:\n\n- **Insufficient evidence in the table**: 33.3% of NEI claims lack sufficient evidence within the table.\n- **Lack of open-domain knowledge**: 25.0% of NEI claims require additional information beyond the table.\n- **Lack of closed-domain knowledge**: 15.0% of NEI claims need domain-specific knowledge.\n- **References to other tables**: 11.7% of NEI claims refer to other tables not provided.\n- **Vague pronouns**: 8.3% of NEI claims contain ambiguous pronouns.\n- **Omission of specific information**: 6.7% of NEI claims omit necessary details.\n\nThese reasons underscore the importance of context and background knowledge in verifying scientific claims. ![{NEI claims often lack sufficient evidence or require additional domain-specific knowledge.}](image6)\n\nNow, let's examine how these reasons impact the performance of different models in zero-shot 3-class classification. The text [7] and the confusion matrices in the image [7] provide insights into the performance of InstructGPT and GPT-4.\n\n- **InstructGPT** often defaults to the 'NEI' label, showing a pattern of \"less confident\" predictions. This suggests that InstructGPT struggles with the complexity and ambiguity of the claims, particularly when insufficient evidence or domain knowledge is required.\n- **GPT-4**, on the other hand, exhibits overconfidence, incorrectly categorizing NEI claims as either supported or refuted. This indicates that GPT-4 might be overestimating its ability to handle complex claims without sufficient context.\n\nThe performance discrepancies in the 3-class setting, as shown in the table in image [1], further highlight the challenges. Models generally perform better in the 2-class setting, where NEI claims are excluded, compared to the 3-class setting. This is because the inclusion of the NEI class adds significant complexity, requiring models to distinguish between verifiable and unverifiable claims, a task that even human annotators find challenging [10].\n\nIn conclusion, the primary reasons for refuted and NEI claims in ScITaB, such as incorrect calculations, ambiguous language, and insufficient evidence, significantly impact the performance of models in zero-shot 3-class classification. These challenges highlight the need for more sophisticated reasoning and context understanding in automated scientific fact-checking."}

According to the data, InstructGPT achieves a macro-F1 score of 41.41, while GPT-4 achieves a score of 64.80 [10]. This indicates that GPT-4 outperforms InstructGPT by a significant margin.\n\nThe performance difference can be attributed to the types of errors each model makes. Let's delve into the error analysis to understand these differences better.\n\nFirst, we can see from the confusion matrices in Figure 4 that both models struggle with the NEI (Not Enough Information) class. InstructGPT tends to classify supported and refuted claims as NEI, indicating a pattern of \"less confident\" predictions. On the other hand, GPT-4 exhibits overconfidence, often misclassifying NEI claims as either supported or refuted [6].\n\nTo further break down the errors, we can refer to the error types identified in the dataset. The main categories of errors are grounding errors, ambiguity errors, calculation errors, and program errors [5]. The estimated proportions of these errors are as follows:\n\n- Grounding errors: 50%\n- Ambiguity errors: 22%\n- Calculation errors: 20%\n- Program errors: 8%\n\nGrounding errors, where the program incorrectly associates data with the respective cells in the table, are the most common [5]. This type of error is particularly challenging in the S CI T AB dataset, as it requires accurate referencing of specific cells to which a claim refers.\n\nAmbiguity errors, where the claim contains ambiguous expressions that the program fails to represent, are also significant [5]. This is especially relevant for scientific claims, which often involve nuanced language and context-dependent interpretations.\n\nCalculation errors, where incorrect floating point arithmetic calculations lead to inaccurate results, and program errors, which encompass mistakes in the program logic, further contribute to the overall error rate [5].\n\nGiven these error types, we can infer that InstructGPT's \"less confident\" approach might be a result of its difficulty in handling grounding and ambiguity errors, leading it to default to the NEI class more frequently. Conversely, GPT-4's overconfidence might stem from its stronger ability to handle grounding and ambiguity but at the cost of making more calculation and program errors.\n\nTo summarize, GPT-4 outperforms InstructGPT on the zero-shot 3-class classification task due to its better handling of grounding and ambiguity errors, although it still struggles with calculation and program errors. ![Grounding errors are the most common type of error in the dataset](image3)"}

This is further illustrated by the label distribution percentage for InstructGPT, where a significant portion of the predictions are labeled as 'NEI' ![InstructGPT has a higher tendency to predict 'NEI'](image3).\n\nOn the other hand, GPT-4 displays overconfidence, often misclassifying NEI claims as either supported or refuted [1]. The label distribution percentage for GPT-4 shows a more balanced distribution among the three classes, but with a notable bias towards supported and refuted claims ![GPT-4 has a higher tendency to predict 'supported' or 'refuted'](image3). This overconfidence can lead to more frequent misclassification of NEI claims, which are inherently more difficult to verify.\n\nThese differences suggest that InstructGPT is more cautious and less certain in its classifications, leading to a higher rate of 'NEI' predictions. Conversely, GPT-4's overconfidence results in more definitive but potentially incorrect classifications, especially for NEI claims. The challenge of distinguishing between 'refuted' and 'NEI' claims is a common issue for both models, reflecting the inherent difficulty of this task in scientific fact-checking [10].\n\nIn terms of error types, the error analysis of the Program-of-Thought (PoT) model provides insights into the broader issues faced by these models. Grounding errors, where the program incorrectly associates data with the respective cells in the table, and ambiguity errors, where the claim contains ambiguous expressions, are particularly prevalent [12]. These errors highlight the challenges in accurately referencing specific cells and handling ambiguous scientific claims, which are critical for the performance of both InstructGPT and GPT-4 [12].\n\nOverall, InstructGPT's cautious approach leads to a higher rate of 'NEI' predictions, while GPT-4's overconfidence results in more definitive but potentially incorrect classifications. Both models struggle with the inherent difficulty of distinguishing between 'refuted' and 'NEI' claims, which is a key challenge in scientific fact-checking."}

These challenges are rooted in the models' handling of ambiguity and their confidence levels in making predictions.\n\nFor InstructGPT, the primary issue is its tendency to be \"less confident.\" As noted, InstructGPT frequently classifies supported and refuted claims as 'NEI' [5]. This behavior suggests that the model struggles to confidently determine whether a claim can be verified or refuted based on the given table information. This lack of confidence is likely due to the model's difficulty in accurately parsing and grounding the claims to the specific cells in the table, leading to a higher rate of grounding errors [2]. Additionally, the ambiguity in scientific claims poses a significant challenge, as the model may find it difficult to interpret and represent these claims correctly [2].\n\nOn the other hand, GPT-4 exhibits a different pattern of errors. GPT-4 is described as being \"overconfident,\" often incorrectly categorizing NEI claims as either supported or refuted [5]. This overconfidence can be attributed to the model's stronger reasoning capabilities, which sometimes lead it to make incorrect assumptions about the availability of information in the table. Despite its advanced abilities, GPT-4 still faces grounding errors and ambiguity issues, but it tends to overestimate its ability to resolve these issues [2]. This overconfidence can result in more frequent misclassifications of NEI claims as supported or refuted, even when the table does not provide sufficient evidence.\n\nTo summarize, the main challenges faced by InstructGPT and GPT-4 in classifying NEI claims are grounding errors and ambiguity in scientific claims. InstructGPT tends to be less confident and frequently defaults to the NEI class, while GPT-4 is overconfident and often misclassifies NEI claims as supported or refuted. ![InstructGPT and GPT-4 exhibit different patterns of errors in classifying NEI claims](image7)"}

According to the table in the image, the performance of the vanilla in-context learning (ICL) method is summarized as follows:\n\n- **SST-2**: GPT2-XL achieves 61.28% accuracy, while GPT-J achieves 64.75%.\n- **TREC**: GPT2-XL achieves 57.56% accuracy, while GPT-J achieves 60.40%.\n- **AGNews**: GPT2-XL achieves 73.32% accuracy, while GPT-J achieves 52.52%.\n- **EmoC**: GPT2-XL achieves 15.44% accuracy, while GPT-J achieves 9.80%.\n\nWhen using the anchor re-weighting method, the performance improves significantly:\n\n- **SST-2**: GPT2-XL achieves 90.07% accuracy.\n- **TREC**: GPT2-XL achieves 60.92% accuracy.\n- **AGNews**: GPT2-XL achieves 81.94% accuracy.\n- **EmoC**: GPT2-XL achieves 41.64% accuracy.\n\nThese results indicate that the GPT2-XL model generally performs better than GPT-J in the vanilla ICL setting, except for the EmoC dataset, where both models struggle but GPT-J performs slightly worse. However, the anchor re-weighting method significantly boosts the performance of GPT2-XL across all datasets, highlighting the effectiveness of this approach.\n\nNext, let's consider the confusion matrices to gain deeper insights into the classification accuracies of these models. The confusion matrices for the TREC dataset are particularly informative. The matrix for the TREC dataset shows the following:\n\n- **Abbreviation** is often confused with **Description** and **Person**.\n- **Entity** is frequently misclassified as **Description** and **Location**.\n- **Description** is commonly mistaken for **Abbreviation** and **Person**.\n- **Person** is often confused with **Description** and **Location**.\n- **Location** is frequently misclassified as **Entity** and **Person**.\n- **Number** is less frequently confused with other categories but still has some overlap with **Entity** and **Description**.\n\nThis pattern of confusion suggests that the models struggle with distinguishing between categories that have similar semantic characteristics. For instance, **Abbreviation** and **Description** are both short and descriptive, leading to frequent misclassifications.\n\nSimilarly, the confusion matrix for the GPT-J model on the TREC dataset shows a similar pattern but with slightly different degrees of confusion, as indicated by the values in the matrix. The higher values in the confusion matrix for GPT-J suggest that it may have more difficulty in distinguishing between these categories compared to GPT2-XL.\n\nIn conclusion, the performance metrics and confusion matrices provide valuable insights into the strengths and weaknesses of the GPT2-XL and GPT-J models across different datasets. GPT2-XL generally outperforms GPT-J in vanilla ICL settings, and the anchor re-weighting method significantly enhances its performance. The confusion matrices reveal that both models struggle with categories that share similar semantic properties, highlighting areas for further improvement in in-context learning. ![The confusion matrix for the TREC dataset shows the degree of confusion between different categories, indicating the models' difficulties in distinguishing between similar semantic classes.](image5)"}

As shown in the experiment results, the precision and recall metrics exhibit distinct trends when knowledge is removed from the knowledge graph (KG).\n\nFrom the data in Table 5, we see that the removal of required knowledge has a minimal impact on correctness but significantly affects citation precision and recall. As more knowledge is absent from the provided KG, both precision and recall drop drastically, indicating that the coverage issue poses a considerable challenge to generating answers with high-quality citations [9].\n\n![{The recall remains stable at about 15 regardless of the number of absent knowledge elements, while precision and F1-Score increase.}](image1)\n\nThis trend is further illustrated in Figure 4, where the recall is stable at about 15 regardless of the number of absent knowledge elements. This suggests that the current LLMs have a limited ability to identify absent knowledge. However, precision and F1-Score exhibit a clear upward trend, showing that with more absent knowledge in the KG, the model's ability to locate absent knowledge more accurately improves [10].\n\nThe stability of recall and the increasing precision and F1-Score as more knowledge is removed indicate that the 'Conscious Incompetence' setting plays an increasingly crucial role when the coverage problem of the knowledge graph is more serious. This implies that LLMs can, to some extent, recognize when they lack necessary information and can adapt their responses accordingly.\n\nIn conclusion, the removal of knowledge elements significantly affects precision, recall, and F1-Score, highlighting the models' limitations in handling absent knowledge and the importance of the 'Conscious Incompetence' setting in improving their performance."}

According to the findings in [1], when the number of demonstrations increases from 1 to 5, there is a noticeable improvement in performance. However, further increases beyond 5 demonstrations yield limited additional benefits. For instance, the performance of using 5 demonstrations with logical constraints (25.7%) surpasses that of 10 demonstrations without logical constraints (24.5%). This suggests that a moderate number of demonstrations combined with logical constraints can be more effective than a larger number of demonstrations alone.\n\nAdditionally, the addition of logical constraints into the model instructions provides stable improvements, especially with more demonstrations. This is evident from the performance metrics in [1] and [4], where models that incorporate logical constraints consistently outperform those that do not. For example, the model with logical constraints and 5 demonstrations achieves a higher Micro-F1 score on MAVEN-ERE compared to the model with 10 demonstrations but no logical constraints.\n\nThe importance of logical constraints is further highlighted in [2] and [8]. These studies show that directly using chain-of-thought (CoT) to infer logic does not help much for event relation extraction (ERE) tasks. The logical constraints generated by LLMs themselves are often inaccurate, leading to a high rate of logical inconsistency. For instance, Figure 2 (as shown in [4]) demonstrates that over 60% of the answers from ChatGPT on the MAVEN-ERE dataset are logically inconsistent. This indicates that while LLMs have powerful reasoning capabilities, they need explicit guidance through logical constraints to improve accuracy.\n\nMoreover, the retrieval-based approach, as discussed in [7] and [12], shows that incorporating logical constraints iteratively can reduce logical inconsistency, although the overall micro-F1 remains relatively stable. This is illustrated in `![{the logical inconsistency of answers decreases with iterations, but the overall micro-F1 is stable}](image1)`. The iterative retrieval method helps in refining the model's predictions by providing relevant logic, but it can also introduce redundancy and overthinking, as noted in [5].\n\nFinally, the pre-training-based approach, as described in [6] and [12], demonstrates that training LLMs on a specialized dataset (LLM-LR) involving multi-hop reasoning can significantly improve performance. For example, LlaMA2-13B and Vicuna-13B, when trained on LLM-LR, show substantial improvements compared to their baseline performances without logical constraints. This is evident from the results in `![{LLMs trained on LLM-LR outperform baselines without logical constraints}](image3)`.\n\nIn conclusion, the use of logical constraints and a moderate number of demonstration samples significantly enhances the performance of different models on the MAVEN-ERE and Causal-TimeBank datasets. Explicitly teaching LLMs with logical constraints and using a well-curated dataset for pre-training are effective strategies to improve logical consistency and overall performance."}

For example, for the MAVEN-ERE dataset, the model with all logical constraints has a LI of 30.9% and a micro-F1 of 20.8%, whereas the model with retrieved logical constraints has a slightly lower LI of 30.2% and a higher micro-F1 of 22.3%. Similarly, for the Causal-TimeBank dataset, the model with all logical constraints has a LI of 36.8% and a micro-F1 of 20.0%, while the model with retrieved logical constraints has a lower LI of 11.3% and a higher micro-F1 of 22.0%.\n\n- **Post-Processing**: Post-processing, which guarantees the absence of logical conflicts, severely affects the quality of the generated answers. For instance, for the MAVEN-ERE dataset, the model with post-processing has a LI of 0% but a much lower micro-F1 of 14.0%. Similarly, for the Causal-TimeBank dataset, the model with post-processing has a LI of 0% but a micro-F1 of 15.0%.\n\nThis trend is consistent across different models and datasets, indicating that logical constraints are more effective in reducing logical inconsistency while maintaining or improving performance, whereas post-processing, while ensuring no logical conflicts, significantly degrades the quality of the generated answers.\n\nAdditionally, the figure [image6] provides further insight into the relationship between the number of demonstration samples and logical inconsistency. The figure shows that adding logical constraints to the prompts consistently improves performance and reduces logical inconsistency, especially with fewer demonstrations. For example, the performance of using 5 demonstrations with logical constraints (25.7%) surpasses that of 10 demonstrations without logical constraints (24.5%).\n\nIn conclusion, logical constraints are more effective in reducing logical inconsistency in LLMs across different datasets compared to post-processing, as they maintain or improve performance while ensuring logical consistency. ![Logical constraints reduce logical inconsistency more effectively than post-processing](image1)"}

According to the data, the questions are categorized into three difficulty levels: Easy, Medium, and Hard. Specifically, the distribution is as follows: 28% of the questions are Easy, 45% are Medium, and 27% are Hard [3]. This distribution ensures that the benchmark covers a wide range of difficulty levels, thereby providing a comprehensive evaluation of the models' capabilities.\n\nTo understand how this distribution relates to the disciplines covered, we can look at the detailed breakdown of questions by discipline. The dataset spans six core disciplines: Art & Design, Business, Science, Health & Medicine, Humanities & Social Science, and Tech & Engineering. Each discipline has a varying number of questions, and the difficulty levels are distributed across these disciplines to maintain a balanced challenge.\n\nFor instance, in the discipline of Science, which constitutes 23% of the total questions, the difficulty levels are distributed as follows: 28% Easy, 45% Medium, and 27% Hard. Similarly, in the discipline of Health & Medicine, which makes up 17% of the questions, the same difficulty distribution is maintained. This consistent distribution across disciplines ensures that the benchmark tests models' ability to handle a variety of challenges, from straightforward to complex, across multiple domains.\n\nThe distribution of difficulty levels is crucial for ensuring that the benchmark is both comprehensive and challenging. By including a mix of Easy, Medium, and Hard questions, the MMMU dataset aims to evaluate the models' performance across a broad spectrum of tasks, from basic perception and reasoning to expert-level understanding and complex problem-solving [2].\n\nIn summary, the MMMU dataset is designed with a balanced distribution of difficulty levels to ensure a thorough and fair evaluation of multimodal models across various disciplines. ![Balanced distribution of difficulty levels across disciplines](image3)"}

For instance, Engineering and Science, which together account for nearly half of the questions, are known for their intricate visual data and complex reasoning requirements. This is evident from the types of questions and images used in these disciplines. For example, in the Engineering discipline, questions often involve diagrams and technical illustrations, such as circuit diagrams and mechanical designs [image5]. Similarly, in Science, questions frequently include charts, graphs, and chemical structures [image5].\n\nOn the other hand, disciplines like Art & Design and Humanities & Social Science, which have fewer questions, tend to involve more natural and less complex visual data. For instance, in Art & Design, questions may include images of paintings, drawings, and sheet music [image5]. In Humanities & Social Science, questions might feature political cartoons and historical photographs [image5].\n\nThe format of the questions in the MMMU dataset is also varied, with 94.03% being multiple-choice and 5.97% being open-ended [image1]. The majority of questions (97.52%) include images, which are often placed at the beginning, middle, or end of the question [image1]. This interleaved text and image format is crucial for assessing the models' ability to integrate and reason with both textual and visual information.\n\nFor example, a question in the Health & Medicine discipline might show multiple MRI scans and ask for the etiology of a finding [image3]. This type of question requires the model to interpret the medical images and apply domain-specific knowledge to arrive at the correct answer. Similarly, a question in the Business discipline might present a chart and ask for a probability calculation [image3], testing the model's ability to analyze visual data and perform mathematical reasoning.\n\nIn summary, the distribution of questions across different disciplines in the MMMU dataset is designed to reflect the varying complexities and types of visual and textual data encountered in college-level education, ensuring a thorough evaluation of multimodal models' capabilities. ![The dataset includes a diverse range of questions and images, reflecting the complexity of college-level subjects.](image1)"}

Unlike other benchmarks that primarily focus on basic perception and commonsense reasoning, MMMU is designed to test advanced multimodal understanding and reasoning at an expert level [4]. It covers a wide range of subjects and disciplines, ensuring a comprehensive evaluation of a model's capabilities.\n\n### Reasoning Depth\nMMMU requires models to engage in deliberate reasoning with subject-specific knowledge, which is a significant step up from the simpler reasoning tasks found in other benchmarks. For instance, while benchmarks like VisWiz, TextVQA, and OKVQA primarily test basic visual perception and commonsense reasoning, MMMU tasks often involve applying complex theories and principles, such as Fourier Transform or Equilibrium Theory, to derive solutions [4]. This level of reasoning is crucial for domains like Science, Health & Medicine, and Tech & Engineering, where the visual data is more complex and the reasoning required is more intricate [2].\n\n### Knowledge Breadth\nMMMU covers 30 subjects across 6 disciplines, including Art & Design, Business, Science, Health & Medicine, Humanities & Social Science, and Tech & Engineering, making it one of the most comprehensive benchmarks in terms of subject coverage [3]. This breadth ensures that models are tested on a wide array of topics, from art theory and design to advanced scientific concepts and medical diagnostics [7]. In contrast, other benchmarks like ScienceQA, which focuses on science questions, or TextVQA, which primarily deals with text and visual questions, have a more limited scope [6].\n\n### Unique Features of Image Usage\nMMMU features a diverse range of image types, including diagrams, tables, plots, charts, photographs, chemical structures, paintings, medical images, sheet music, and more [5]. This diversity is crucial for testing a model's perceptual capabilities across different visual formats. For example, in the Health & Medicine discipline, models are presented with MRI images and must diagnose conditions based on the visual data [5]. This is a significant departure from benchmarks that typically use a narrower range of image types, such as VisWiz, which mainly uses real-world photographs [6].\n\n### Question Formats\nMMMU questions are carefully crafted to interleave text and images, requiring models to jointly understand both modalities and integrate them with domain-specific knowledge [4]. This is evident in the structure of the questions, where images can appear at the beginning, middle, or end of the text, and multiple images can be used in a single question [1]. For instance, a question might start with an image of a chemical structure, followed by a text description requiring the application of chemical principles to solve a problem [1]. This interleaved format is designed to test the model's ability to handle complex, real-world scenarios where visual and textual information are often intertwined.\n\n### Conclusion\nIn summary, the MMMU benchmark is uniquely positioned to evaluate the advanced multimodal understanding and reasoning capabilities of models across a broad and deep range of subjects. Its emphasis on expert-level reasoning, comprehensive subject coverage, diverse image types, and interleaved question formats sets it apart from other benchmarks, making it a valuable tool for advancing the field of multimodal AI [1]. ![{MMMU covers a wide range of subjects and image types, requiring advanced reasoning and knowledge integration.}](image1)"}

For instance, tasks may involve applying complex theories such as \"Fourier Transform\" or \"Equilibrium Theory\" to derive solutions, which goes beyond basic visual perception and simple reasoning [3]. This is illustrated in the benchmark's requirement for models to handle intricate problems that demand deep understanding and step-by-step reasoning [7].\n\nRegarding **knowledge breadth**, MMMU covers a wide array of subjects and subfields. It includes 30 different subjects spanning six major disciplines: Art & Design, Business, Science, Health & Medicine, Humanities & Social Science, and Tech & Engineering. This comprehensive coverage ensures that the benchmark tests a broad spectrum of expertise [8]. The diversity of subjects is further emphasized in the distribution of questions across these disciplines, as shown in the figure [![Comprehensive Disciplines](image3)].\n\nMoreover, MMMU introduces a significant variety of **image types**. It encompasses 30 different image formats, including diagrams, tables, charts, chemical structures, photographs, paintings, medical images, and more. This diversity challenges models to handle a wide range of visual inputs, making it a more robust and comprehensive benchmark [3]. The inclusion of such a diverse set of image types is highlighted in the benchmark's design, as seen in the figure [![Heterogeneous Image Types](image3)].\n\nIn contrast, other benchmarks like VisWiz, TextVQA, and MMBench focus more on basic perception abilities and do not require the same level of expert knowledge or deliberate reasoning [4]. For example, VisWiz and TextVQA primarily test OCR and basic visual understanding, while MMBench and MM-Vet are limited to simpler tasks and fewer image types [4].\n\nIn summary, the MMMU benchmark is uniquely positioned to assess the advanced multimodal understanding and reasoning capabilities of models, setting a new standard in the field."}

The correct answer is (B) 2, where the adult puts the mask on the child first while struggling for breath. However, GPT-4V incorrectly identified the correct sequence, leading to a perceptual error. This error highlights the importance of accurately mapping visual elements to their corresponding descriptions [image1].\n\n### Conclusion\nGPT-4V leads in performance across various difficulty levels and image types in the MMMU benchmark, but it faces significant challenges in handling complex tasks and less common image types. The key errors encountered by GPT-4V include perceptual, knowledge, and reasoning errors, which provide valuable insights for future model improvements."}

Cropping involves selecting image regions based on proposal bounding box coordinates and resizing these regions to a fixed proportion. This step helps to focus the model on specific objects of interest, even if they occupy a small part of the image [5]. Blurring the non-target areas around the objects further directs the model's attention to the relevant parts, making it easier to identify and classify the objects [5].\n\nAfter pre-processing, the system extracts image embeddings \\( e_{\\mathrm{img}} \\) using a visual encoder. These embeddings are then used to retrieve the top-\\( k \\) similar results from the multimodal memory, which contains a large volume of pre-stored image and text embeddings [10]. The retrieved top-\\( k \\) categories are passed to the multimodal large language model (MLLM) for ranking [7].\n\nThe MLLM combines its internal knowledge with the retrieved information to rank the categories based on their contextual appropriateness with the input image. This ranking process leverages the MLLM's advanced linguistic and semantic analysis capabilities to ensure a more accurate and contextually aware classification prediction [7].\n\nTo illustrate, consider the pre-processing and retrieval steps applied to an image containing multiple objects.

According to Figure 6, Step-Back + RAG is able to fix 39.9% of the predictions where the baseline prediction is wrong, while causing only 5.6% errors. Additionally, Step-Back + RAG fixes 21.6% of the errors coming from RAG, with a relatively low error introduction rate of 6.3% [10]. This indicates that Step-Back + RAG significantly improves the accuracy of predictions on the TimeQA dataset, which is a knowledge QA task with a focus on temporal reasoning.\n\nNow, let's look at the error analysis for StrategyQA. According to Figure 7, Step-Back + RAG turns 15.4% of wrong predictions into correct predictions, while leading to 6.1% errors the other way around. Furthermore, Step-Back + RAG fixes 12.7% of the errors coming from RAG, with an error introduction rate of 4.4% [9]. This shows that Step-Back + RAG also improves the accuracy on StrategyQA, but the improvement is slightly less pronounced compared to TimeQA.\n\nThe significance of these differences can be understood by considering the nature of the datasets and the tasks they represent. TimeQA involves complex temporal reasoning and requires the model to handle a large number of examples (5226 in total, with 2613 easy and 2613 hard) [6]. The higher improvement rate in TimeQA suggests that the abstraction and step-by-step reasoning provided by Step-Back + RAG are particularly effective for handling the complexity and variability of temporal reasoning tasks.\n\nOn the other hand, StrategyQA involves strategic reasoning and decision-making, which might be less dependent on the step-by-step abstraction approach. The dataset size for StrategyQA is smaller (229 examples) [6], and the tasks might involve more straightforward logical steps that are already well-handled by the baseline models. Therefore, the improvement from Step-Back + RAG is still positive but not as dramatic as in TimeQA.\n\nIn summary, the error analysis results show that Step-Back + RAG is more effective in improving the accuracy of predictions on the TimeQA dataset compared to StrategyQA, likely due to the greater complexity and larger dataset size of TimeQA. ![Step-Back + RAG significantly improves accuracy on TimeQA, with a higher error correction rate and lower error introduction rate compared to StrategyQA](image10)"}

The text mentions that the average pageview per entity within each category is used as a metric for popularity [1]. The 'celebrity' category has the highest average popularity, as shown in Figure 11 [4]. This indicates that entities in the 'celebrity' category not only have a high number of entities but also receive a high number of pageviews on average.\n\nFor a more detailed comparison, we can refer to the specific number of entities in each category from the dataset statistics [8].

The ablation study in the text quote [2] highlights the importance of ED in the model's performance. The study shows that the model incorporating ED significantly outperforms the version without it. This is further supported by the data in the image quote `![{Entity detection improves performance metrics}](image7)`. The table in the image shows that with ED, the model achieves higher scores in ROUGE, BLEU, METEOR, and BELURT, indicating a substantial improvement in the quality of the responses.\n\nNext, we examine the impact of retrieval augmentation (RA). The text quote [6] provides insights into how RA affects the model's performance across different entity types. The results indicate that RA significantly enhances performance, especially for torso and tail entities, which are less common and more challenging to handle. This is corroborated by the image quote `![{Retrieval augmentation reduces hallucination rates and increases accuracy}](image8)`. The table in the image shows a clear reduction in hallucination rates and an increase in accuracy when RA is included. For head entities, the accuracy improves from 24.4% to 27.1%, and the hallucination rate decreases from 75.6% to 72.9%.

This is evident from the results presented in the comparative analysis of different VQA datasets and the specific metrics used to evaluate model performance.\n\nFirstly, the SnapNTell model outperforms existing baselines on the SnapNTell dataset, achieving a significant 66.5% improvement in the BELURT score [7]. This improvement is particularly notable because the SnapNTell dataset is designed to be more challenging, with a focus on entity-centric questions that require extensive knowledge [8].\n\nTo understand the key components contributing to this performance, let's delve into the architecture and evaluation methods used. The SnapNTell model incorporates retrieval augmentation, which enhances the model's ability to retrieve and incorporate relevant information about entities in the images [10]. This is crucial for addressing the challenge of hallucinations in long-tailed entities, where the model tends to produce erroneous responses [1]. The retrieval augmentation process involves sourcing information from a database and integrating it with the input question and image embeddings, leading to more accurate and contextually appropriate answers [10].\n\nAdditionally, the model includes an entity detection (ED) component, which significantly improves its performance. An ablation study comparing the model with and without the ED component showed that the version with ED markedly outperformed the variant without it [2]. This highlights the importance of accurately identifying the entities in the images, which is essential for generating correct and detailed responses [2].\n\nThe effectiveness of the SnapNTell model is further supported by the human evaluation results, which show that the model's responses are more aligned with human judgments. Specifically, the model's performance was evaluated using metrics such as ROUGE and BLEURT, which were found to be highly indicative of the model's capabilities [5]. These metrics demonstrated strong agreement with human evaluations, indicating that the model's responses are not only factually correct but also contextually appropriate [5].\n\nMoreover, the SnapNTell model's architecture, as illustrated in the diagram, shows how the input question and image are processed through the retrieval augmentation and word embedding layers before being fed into the LLM. This ensures that the model has access to the necessary information to produce knowledgeable and accurate answers [10] ![The model architecture includes retrieval augmentation and word embedding layers to process the input question and image.](image1).\n\nIn summary, the SnapNTell model outperforms other models in terms of accuracy and handling long-tail entities due to its retrieval augmentation and entity detection components, which enhance its ability to generate detailed and contextually appropriate responses."}

These improvements highlight the critical role of entity detection in enhancing the model's ability to generate accurate and coherent responses.\n\nTo further illustrate this point, consider the following table, which summarizes the performance metrics with and without entity detection:\n![{Entity detection significantly improves performance metrics}](image1)\n\nThis data clearly demonstrates that the inclusion of entity detection is essential for improving the model's performance in the SnapNTell task, making it more effective in recognizing and providing detailed, entity-specific knowledge."}

This indicates that SnapNTell is effective in evaluating the capabilities of models to recognize entities and produce entity-centric responses.\n\nOur proposed model demonstrates superior performance on the SnapNTell dataset, achieving a 66.5% improvement in the BELURT score [2]. This improvement is further supported by the ablation study, which shows that incorporating entity detection (ED) significantly enhances the model's performance.

For SQuAD v1.1, BERT+DSC achieves an F1 score of 91.97, which is +1.07 higher than BERT, and XLNet+DSC achieves an F1 score of 95.77, which is +1.25 higher than XLNet [image8].\n\nFor the QuoRef dataset, BERT+DSC achieves an F1 score of 67.52, which is +2.57 higher than BERT, and XLNet+DSC achieves an F1 score of 72.90, which is +1.41 higher than XLNet [image8].\n\nFinally, let's look at the performance on the paraphrase identification task. According to the results shown in Table 8 [7], BERT+DSC outperforms other methods on the QQP dataset. For the original dataset, BERT+DSC achieves an F1 score of 92.11, which is +0.81 higher than BERT [image5].\n\nFrom these comparisons, we can draw several insights:\n1. The DSC loss consistently improves the performance of both BERT and XLNet across various datasets and tasks.\n2. The improvements are particularly significant on NER and MRC tasks, where the DSC loss helps in handling imbalanced datasets and improving recall.\n3. The DSC loss is less effective on accuracy-oriented tasks like text classification, as shown in the SST-2 and SST-5 datasets [image7].\n\nIn conclusion, the DSC loss enhances the performance of BERT and XLNet models, especially in tasks where F1 score is a more relevant metric, such as NER and MRC. ![The DSC loss significantly improves F1 scores on NER and MRC tasks](image8)"}
{"q_id": 401, "model": "qwen2.5-72b-instruct_llm", "in_tok": 4765, "out_tok": 1044, "total_tok": 5809, "response": "To understand the impact of different data augmentation techniques on the performance of BERT models, particularly on the QQP dataset, we need to consider the experimental results and the nature of the tasks involved. The QQP dataset is known for its imbalance, with 37% positive and 63% negative examples. This imbalance can significantly affect the performance of models, especially in terms of F1 score, which is a common metric for evaluating tasks like sentiment analysis and named entity recognition (NER).\n\nFrom the provided text and image quotes, we can see that various data augmentation techniques were applied to the QQP dataset, and their effects were measured using BERT models fine-tuned with different training objectives.\n\n### Data Augmentation Techniques and Their Impact\n\n1. **Original Dataset**:\n   - The original QQP dataset without any augmentation serves as the baseline. The performance of BERT on this dataset is 91.3 for F1 score [2].\n\n2. **+Positive**:\n   - This technique involves augmenting the dataset with additional positive examples. The performance of BERT on this augmented dataset improves slightly to 92.27 for F1 score [2]. This suggests that adding more positive examples helps balance the dataset, leading to better performance.\n\n3. **+Negative**:\n   - This technique involves augmenting the dataset with additional negative examples. The performance of BERT on this augmented dataset decreases to 90.08 for F1 score [2]. This is expected because adding more negative examples further skews the dataset, making it harder for the model to learn effectively.\n\n4. **-Negative**:\n   - This technique involves removing some negative examples. The performance of BERT on this augmented dataset decreases to 89.73 for F1 score [2]. Reducing the number of negative examples results in a smaller training set, which negatively impacts performance due to the reduced amount of training data.\n\n5. **+Positive & Negative**:\n   - This technique involves augmenting the dataset with both positive and negative examples. The performance of BERT on this augmented dataset improves to 93.14 for F1 score [2]. This balanced approach seems to provide the best results, as it addresses the imbalance issue while maintaining a sufficient amount of training data.\n\n### Training Objectives and Their Impact\n\nDifferent training objectives were used to fine-tune BERT on these augmented datasets, and their effects were measured as follows:\n\n1. **Cross-Entropy (CE)**:\n   - BERT fine-tuned with CE on the original dataset achieves an F1 score of 91.3 [2].\n\n2. **Focal Loss (FL)**:\n   - BERT fine-tuned with FL on the original dataset achieves an F1 score of 91.86, showing a slight improvement [2].\n\n3. **Dice Loss (DL)**:\n   - BERT fine-tuned with DL on the original dataset achieves an F1 score of 91.92, also showing a slight improvement [2].\n\n4. **Dynamic Soft Dice Loss (DSC)**:\n   - BERT fine-tuned with DSC on the original dataset achieves an F1 score of 92.11, which is the highest among the training objectives tested [2].\n\n### Performance Across Different Tasks\n\n1. **Sentiment Analysis (SST-2 and SST-5)**:\n   - For SST-2, BERT with CE achieves an accuracy of 94.90, while BERT with DL and DSC achieve 94.37 and 94.84, respectively [6]. For SST-5, BERT with CE achieves an accuracy of 55.57, while BERT with DL and DSC achieve 54.63 and 55.19, respectively [6]. These results indicate that DL and DSC are not as effective for accuracy-oriented tasks like sentiment analysis.\n\n2. **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**:\n   - For the Chinese MSRA dataset, BERT-MRC+DSC achieves the highest F1 score of 96.72, outperforming other methods [1]. For the Chinese OntoNotes 4.0 dataset, BERT-MRC+DSC achieves the highest F1 score of 84.47, again outperforming other methods [1]. These results suggest that DSC is particularly effective for NER tasks, especially in imbalanced datasets.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe different data augmentation techniques and training objectives have varying impacts on the performance of BERT models on the QQP dataset and other tasks. The +Positive & Negative augmentation technique, combined with the Dynamic Soft Dice Loss (DSC) training objective, provides the best overall performance. This approach effectively balances the dataset and addresses the issues caused by data imbalance, leading to significant improvements in F1 scores across various tasks.\n\nThe best performance is achieved with the combination of balanced data augmentation and the DSC training objective. ![Balanced data augmentation and DSC training objective lead to the best performance](image2)"}

The table compares BERT and XLNet models with different loss functions (FL, DL, and DSC):\n\n- **BERT + DSC** shows significant improvements over the baseline BERT for both MRPC and QQP datasets. Specifically, BERT + DSC achieves an F1 score of 88.92 for MRPC and 92.11 for QQP, representing improvements of +0.92 and +0.81, respectively, compared to the baseline BERT.\n- **XLNet + DSC** also shows notable improvements, achieving an F1 score of 89.78 for MRPC and 92.60 for QQP, with gains of +0.58 and +0.79, respectively, over the baseline XLNet.\n\nNext, let's examine the results from the sentiment classification tasks on the SST-2 and SST-5 datasets, as shown in image8:\n\n- **BERT + DSC** performs slightly worse than the baseline BERT + CE for both SST-2 and SST-5. For SST-2, BERT + DSC achieves an accuracy of 94.84, which is slightly lower than the 94.90 of BERT + CE. For SST-5, BERT + DSC achieves an accuracy of 55.19, which is also slightly lower than the 55.57 of BERT + CE.\n\nNow, consider the results from the NER tasks on the English CoNLL 2003 and Chinese OntoNotes 4.0 datasets, as shown in image3 and image6:\n\n- **English CoNLL 2003**: BERT-MRC + DSC achieves the highest F1 score of 93.33, outperforming BERT-MRC + FL (93.11) and BERT-MRC + DL (93.17).\n- **Chinese OntoNotes 4.0**: BERT-MRC + DSC also performs the best, achieving an F1 score of 84.47, which is higher than BERT-MRC + FL (83.30) and BERT-MRC + DL (84.01).\n\nFinally, let's look at the results from the MRC tasks on the SQuAD v1.1, SQuAD v2.0, and QuoRef datasets, as shown in image4:\n\n- **SQuAD v1.1**: BERT + DSC achieves an F1 score of 91.97, which is higher than BERT + FL (91.25) and BERT + DL (91.86).\n- **SQuAD v2.0**: BERT + DSC achieves an F1 score of 82.95, which is higher than BERT + FL (82.20) and BERT + DL (82.88).\n- **QuoRef**: BERT + DSC achieves an F1 score of 67.52, which is higher than BERT + FL (66.19) and BERT + DL (66.88).\n\nIn summary, the BERT model with the DSC loss function generally outperforms other configurations across various datasets and augmentation techniques, particularly in tasks like NER and MRC. However, for accuracy-oriented tasks like sentiment classification, the DSC loss function does not provide significant improvements and may even perform slightly worse than the baseline. ![BERT + DSC consistently outperforms other configurations in most tasks](image4)"}

The table in Image 1 provides a detailed comparison of different configurations of DeClarE and baseline models:\n\n- **Snopes Dataset**:\n  - **LSTM-text**: 64.65% accuracy for true claims, 64.21% for false claims, 0.66 macro F1-score.\n  - **CNN-text**: 67.15% accuracy for true claims, 63.14% for false claims, 0.66 macro F1-score.\n  - **Distant Supervision**: 83.21% accuracy for true claims, 80.78% for false claims, 0.82 macro F1-score.\n  - **DeClarE (Full)**: 78.96% accuracy for true claims, 78.32% for false claims, 0.79 macro F1-score.\n\n- **PolitiFact Dataset**:\n  - **LSTM-text**: 63.19% accuracy for true claims, 61.96% for false claims, 0.63 macro F1-score.\n  - **CNN-text**: 63.67% accuracy for true claims, 63.31% for false claims, 0.64 macro F1-score.\n  - **Distant Supervision**: 62.53% accuracy for true claims, 62.08% for false claims, 0.62 macro F1-score.\n  - **DeClarE (Full)**: 67.32% accuracy for true claims, 69.62% for false claims, 0.68 macro F1-score.\n\nFrom these results, we can see that DeClarE (Full) outperforms the baseline models on both datasets, particularly in terms of macro F1-score and AUC. However, on the Snopes dataset, Distant Supervision slightly outperforms DeClarE (Full) in terms of accuracy, though DeClarE (Full) has a higher macro F1-score and AUC.\n\n### NewsTrust Dataset\nFor the NewsTrust dataset, the performance is evaluated using mean squared error (MSE) for credibility rating prediction. The table in Image 6 shows the results:\n\n- **CNN-text**: 0.53 MSE.\n- **CCRF+SVR**: 0.36 MSE.\n- **LSTM-text**: 0.35 MSE.\n- **Distant Supervision**: 0.35 MSE.\n- **DeClarE (Plain)**: 0.34 MSE.\n- **DeClarE (Full)**: 0.29 MSE.\n\nHere, DeClarE (Full) significantly outperforms all other models, achieving the lowest MSE of 0.29, which is a 17% decrease compared to the best-performing baselines (LSTM-text and Distant Supervision) [2].\n\n### SemEval Dataset\nOn the SemEval dataset, the performance is evaluated using RMSE and macro F1-score. The table in Image 2 shows the results:\n\n- **IITP (Open)**: 0.39 RMSE, 0.746 macro F1-score.\n- **NileTMRG (Close)**: 0.54 RMSE, 0.673 macro F1-score.\n- **DeClarE (Plain)**: 0.46 RMSE, 0.687 macro F1-score.\n- **DeClarE (Full)**: 0.57 RMSE, 0.604 macro F1-score.\n\nIn this case, DeClarE (Full) performs worse in terms of RMSE and macro F1-score compared to the best-performing baseline models. This suggests that while DeClarE (Full) excels in other tasks, it may face challenges with the SemEval dataset.\n\n### Conclusion\nOverall, the DeClarE model, especially in its full configuration, outperforms baseline models on the Snopes, PolitiFact, and NewsTrust datasets. However, its performance on the SemEval dataset is less competitive. This highlights the model's strengths in handling specific types of credibility assessment tasks and the need for further improvements in others.\n\n![{DeClarE (Full) outperforms other models on Snopes and PolitiFact datasets, but performs less competitively on SemEval.}](image1)\n![{DeClarE (Full) achieves the lowest MSE on the NewsTrust dataset, outperforming all other models.}](image6)\n![{DeClarE (Full) performs worse on the SemEval dataset compared to the best-performing baseline models.}](image2)\n\nThe DeClarE model performs best on the Snopes, PolitiFact, and NewsTrust datasets, but less so on the SemEval dataset."}

According to the data, our approach achieves a stop distance of 8.43 and a task completion rate of 36.9% on the LANI task [3]. In contrast, on the CHAI task, our approach has a slightly lower stop distance of 3.34 but a much higher manipulation accuracy (MA) of 39.97% [3]. This indicates that while navigation is more challenging in the CHAI environment, manipulation tasks are more accurately executed.\n\n![{LANI and CHAI performance comparison}](image3)\n\nHowever, when comparing our approach to other methods, the performance gap becomes more evident.

Specifically, our approach outperforms the CHAPLOT18 method by 5% in task completion on the LANI task [4].\n\nIn terms of **linguistic categories**, the tasks handled by LANI and CHAI differ in complexity and frequency.

According to the data, the proposed approach achieves a TC of 35.72% [7]. This is notably higher than the TC of 31.0% achieved by the method of Chaplot et al. (2018) [7], and significantly better than the 22.9% achieved by the method of Misra et al. (2017) [7]. The improvement over these baselines indicates that the proposed approach is more effective in completing navigation tasks accurately.\n\nFor the manipulation accuracy (MA) on the C HAI  task, the proposed approach achieves an MA of 37.53% [7]. This is on par with the performance of Chaplot et al. (2018), which also achieves 37.53% [7], but significantly better than the 32.25% achieved by Misra et al. (2017) [7].

For C HAI , humans achieve a manipulation accuracy of 100% [11], which is far superior to the 37.53% achieved by the proposed approach. This gap indicates that while the proposed approach has made significant improvements over previous methods, there is still a substantial gap to human-level performance.\n\nAdditionally, the performance of the proposed approach with oracle goals [7] provides further insight. When given oracle goals, the proposed approach achieves a TC of 94.60% on L ANI  and a manipulation accuracy of 41.07% on C HAI . This significant improvement highlights the importance of accurate goal prediction in achieving high performance. The fact that the model performs much better with oracle goals suggests that the main challenge lies in the goal prediction phase rather than the action generation phase.\n\nIn conclusion, the proposed approach outperforms other methods in task completion for L ANI  and manipulation accuracy for C HAI , but there is still a considerable gap to human-level performance, particularly in the C HAI  task.

For instance, the STOP baseline has an SD of 15.18 and a TC of 8.29%, while the RANDOMWALK baseline has an SD of 14.63 and a TC of 9.76%. Even compared to more sophisticated methods like MISRA17 (SD: 10.23, TC: 23.2%) and CHAPLOT18 (SD: 8.78, TC: 31.9%), 'Our Approach' shows better performance, particularly in task completion [6].\n\nOn the CHAI dataset, the performance is more nuanced. 'Our Approach' achieves a Stop Distance (SD) of 3.34 and a Manipulation Accuracy (MA) of 39.97%. While the SD is slightly better than the STOP baseline (SD: 3.59), the manipulation accuracy is comparable to the best-performing method, CHAPLOT18 (MA: 39.76%). However, the overall performance on the CHAI dataset is lower, highlighting the complexity of manipulation tasks [5].\n\nThe potential factors influencing the performance of 'Our Approach' include the decomposition of instruction execution into goal prediction and action generation. This decomposition allows for more interpretable and modular goal representations, which can improve the model's ability to navigate and execute tasks accurately [1].

The linguistic categories, such as spatial relations, temporal coordination, and co-reference, play a significant role in the complexity of instructions and, consequently, the accuracy of goal prediction.\n\nFor instance, Table 8 [8] shows the mean goal prediction error for L ANI instructions with and without certain linguistic categories. The presence of spatial relations, temporal coordination, and co-reference significantly affects the error rates. Specifically, the p-values indicate that these categories have a statistically significant impact on the goal prediction error.

Let's delve into the specific metrics and insights.\n\nIn the entity recognition task, the SciIE model outperforms several baselines. According to the results shown in Table 2, the SciIE model achieves an F1 score of 68.1 on the development set and 64.2 on the test set, which is a significant improvement over the LSTM+CRF model (F1 scores of 66.5 and 62.0) and the E2E Rel model (F1 scores of 66.4 and 61.2) [6]. This improvement is even more pronounced when compared to the E2E Rel model with ELMo, where the SciIE model shows a relative improvement of 1.3% and 2.4% on the development and test sets, respectively [6].\n\nFor relation extraction, the SciIE model again outperforms the baselines. On the development set, the SciIE model achieves an F1 score of 39.5, compared to 35.3 for the E2E Rel model and 37.4 for the E2E Rel model with ELMo [6]. The relative improvement over the E2E Rel model is 13.1%, and over the E2E Rel model with ELMo, it is 7.4% [6]. These improvements highlight the effectiveness of the multitask learning approach in capturing complex relationships between entities.\n\nIn coreference resolution, the SciIE model also shows notable improvements. The F1 score on the development set is 58.0, compared to 55.4 for the E2E Coref model [6]. The relative improvement is 4.5%, which underscores the model's ability to handle coreference links effectively.\n\nThe multitask learning approach used in the SciIE model leverages shared span representations and cross-sentence information, which contributes to its superior performance. An ablation study further confirms the importance of each component. For instance, the inclusion of entity recognition, relation extraction, and coreference resolution tasks individually and collectively enhances the model's performance [8]. Specifically, the combination of all three tasks (multi-task learning) leads to the highest F1 scores across all tasks, as shown in the ablation study results [8].\n\nAdditionally, the SciIE model outperforms previous state-of-the-art models on the SemEval 17 dataset for span identification, keyphrase extraction, and relation extraction. For span identification, the SciIE model achieves an F1 score of 58.6, significantly higher than the best SemEval model's F1 score of 55 [7]. For keyphrase extraction, the F1 score is 46.0, and for relation extraction, it is 27.8, both of which are competitive with the state of the art [7].\n\nHowever, the performance gap between the SciIE model and human performance remains substantial, indicating the ongoing challenges in scientific information extraction [12]. Future work could focus on incorporating semi-supervised techniques and in-domain features to further enhance the model's capabilities [12].\n\nIn conclusion, the SciIE model outperforms other models in precision, recall, and F1 score across various NLP tasks, and its multitask learning approach, which shares span representations and leverages cross-sentence information, is a key factor in its success. ![The SciIE model outperforms other models in precision, recall, and F1 score across various NLP tasks.](image2)"}

When coreference links are included, the precision and recall curves for the knowledge graph are consistently higher, indicating better performance. The precision of the system with coreference links remains high (above 84%), but the recall is significantly improved, as shown in the precision/recall curves [10]. This is further supported by the ablation study, which demonstrates that each added task, including coreference resolution, enhances the performance of the primary tasks [1].\n\nFor instance, the ablation study in Table 3 shows that entity recognition (65.7) benefits from both coreference resolution (67.5) and relation extraction (66.8).

For instance, when comparing the CNN Large model with and without fine-tuning on the Named Entity Recognition (NER) task, the fine-tuned model shows a notable improvement in F1 scores. Specifically, the CNN Large model with ELMo stacking achieves a dev F1 score of 95.1 and a test F1 score of 95.2, while the fine-tuned version reaches a dev F1 score of 95.5 and a test F1 score of 95.6 [5]. This indicates that fine-tuning provides a substantial boost in performance.\n\nSimilarly, on the constituency parsing task, the fine-tuned CNN Large model outperforms the ELMo-stacked version. The ELMo-stacked model achieves a dev F1 score of 95.7 and a test F1 score of 92.2, whereas the fine-tuned model attains a dev F1 score of 96.9 and a test F1 score of 93.5 [6]. These results highlight the effectiveness of fine-tuning in enhancing the model's performance on structured prediction tasks.\n\nMoreover, the GLUE benchmark results further support this trend. The CNN Large model, when fine-tuned, shows significant improvements over the ELMo-stacked version across multiple tasks. For example, on the CoLA task, the fine-tuned model achieves a Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) of 56.3, compared to 52.6 for the ELMo-stacked model [7]. On the RTE task, the fine-tuned model reaches an accuracy of 68.4, while the ELMo-stacked model scores 65.5 [7].\n\nThese findings are consistent with the broader observation that fine-tuning and stacking task-specific architectures can lead to new state-of-the-art performance levels for parsing and named entity recognition tasks [1]. The results also suggest that having multiple sentences in each training example is crucial for many tasks, and pre-training continues to improve performance with up to 18B tokens [1].\n\nIn summary, the CNN models with additional fine-tuning or stacking architectures consistently outperform those without such enhancements across various NLP tasks, demonstrating the importance of these techniques in achieving higher performance. ![Fine-tuning significantly improves performance on NER and parsing tasks](image5)"}

The CNN Large model performs comparably in SST-2 and slightly better in QQP.\n\nNext, let's examine the impact of increasing training data size on the average GLUE score.

For instance, the choice of pretraining data, such as Common Crawl versus News Crawl, has a substantial impact on the effectiveness of the models. Common Crawl, which contains multi-sentence training examples, generally performs better than News Crawl, which consists of individual sentences [3]. This is evident in the performance gap on tasks like RTE, where Common Crawl outperforms News Crawl by 14 points even with the same amount of data [3].\n\nMoreover, the structure of the training data is crucial. Pretraining on data that retains paragraph structure, such as Wikipedia and BooksCorpus, leads to better performance on tasks like QNLI and MNLI compared to other tasks [1]. This suggests that the context provided by multi-sentence examples is beneficial for certain NLP tasks.\n\nThe modeling approach, particularly the cloze-driven training regime, is more effective than predicting left and right tokens separately [4]. This is supported by the results shown in the table, where the cloze loss outperforms the bilm loss and combining both does not provide additional benefits [4] `![{cloze loss outperforms bilm loss}](image1)`.\n\nAdditionally, the amount of pretraining data plays a critical role. As shown in the graph, increasing the amount of training data from 562M tokens to 18B tokens can significantly increase accuracy [7] `![{more training data increases accuracy}](image7)`.

According to the findings, the alignment of word embeddings was not generally beneficial for training in bilingual scenarios, as indicated in the results from Table 4 [7]. Specifically, the gains or losses from alignment were essentially insignificant across all languages, suggesting that a priori alignment of embeddings may not be necessary in bilingual settings.\n\nHowever, the impact of alignment can vary across different language pairs and datasets. For instance, in the multilingual scenario, aligning the word embeddings helped to increase the BLEU scores for all three tasks, as noted in the results from Table 5 [2]. This is intuitive because a single encoder is used for both source languages, and the encoder would have to learn a significantly more complicated transform of the input if the word embeddings for the languages were in a semantically separate space. Pre-training and alignment ensure that the word embeddings of the two source languages are put into similar vector spaces, allowing the model to learn in a similar fashion as it would if training on a single language.\n\nTo illustrate, consider the BLEU scores for different language pairs when using aligned and unaligned embeddings. The table in image3 shows the BLEU scores for various language pairs, indicating that the impact of alignment is minimal and sometimes even slightly negative. For example, for the GL-EN pair, the BLEU score decreased from 12.8 to 11.5 when alignment was applied. Similarly, for the TR-EN pair, the BLEU score decreased from 17.9 to 17.7.

This is because RU and HE have lower baseline BLEU scores, indicating larger headroom for improvement [1]. \n\nThis trend is further supported by the data in the image, which shows the BLEU score improvements for different language pairs. For instance, the Portuguese-English (PT-EN) and Turkish-English (TR-EN) pairs show significant gains with pre-training, especially as the training set size increases [image2]. However, the gains are most pronounced when the training set size is moderate, typically around 3-4 BLEU scores, suggesting that pre-training is most effective when there is enough data to capture the basic characteristics of the language but not so much that the system is already highly accurate [4].\n\nLanguage similarity also plays a crucial role. The hypothesis that pre-training is more effective for more similar language pairs is supported by the data in Table 5, which shows that the gains in BLEU scores are roughly in order of language similarity. For example, the Galician-Portuguese (GL-PT) pair, which are highly similar, shows the largest gains, while the Belarusian-Russian (BE-RU) pair, which are less similar, shows a small decrease [11]. This is further illustrated in the image, where the BLEU score improvements are higher for more similar language pairs like ES-PT and FR-PT compared to more dissimilar pairs like RU-PT and HE-PT [image1].\n\nIn multilingual systems, pre-training and alignment of word embeddings are particularly beneficial. The results in Table 5 show that aligning the word embeddings helps to increase the BLEU scores for all three tasks, which is intuitive because a single encoder is used for both source languages. Without alignment, the encoder would have to learn a more complicated transformation, making the task more difficult [11]. This is evident in the image, where the aligned systems consistently outperform the unaligned ones, especially for low-resource languages [image6].\n\nFinally, the qualitative analysis of translations from GL to EN, shown in the image, highlights that pre-training not only helps the model capture rarer vocabulary but also generates sentences that are more grammatically well-formed. For example, the best system successfully translates a person's name (\"Chris\") and multi-word phrases (\"big lawyer\" and \"patent legislation\"), indicating the usefulness of pre-trained embeddings in providing better representations of less frequent concepts [image7].\n\nIn conclusion, pre-training significantly affects translation accuracy, with the greatest benefits observed when the training set size is moderate and the source and target languages are more similar. ![Pre-training improves translation accuracy more for similar language pairs and moderate training set sizes.](image1)"}

On the other hand, for AZ-EN, the BLEU score increased slightly from 2.0 to 2.1, and for TR-EN, it decreased from 17.9 to 17.7. For BE-EN, the BLEU score remained unchanged at 3.0, and for RU-EN, it increased slightly from 21.1 to 21.4 [image4].\n\nRegarding the F-measure scores for target words based on their frequency in the training corpus, Figure 2 shows that pre-training manages to improve the accuracy of translation for the entire vocabulary, but particularly for words that are of low frequency in the training corpus [10]. This indicates that pre-trained embeddings are especially effective in improving the translation of rare words.\n\nIn conclusion, the alignment of word embeddings affects translation performance differently across language pairs, with significant benefits in multilingual scenarios but minimal impact in bilingual scenarios. Pre-trained embeddings, however, consistently improve the translation of low-frequency words [image6]."}

This highlights the critical role of the R-GCN component in enhancing the model's performance.\n\nFurthermore, the ablation study reveals the importance of different types of relations in the entity graph. When the DOC-BASED connections are removed, the model's performance decreases slightly compared to removing MATCH or COREF connections [7]. This is because the majority of the connections are between mentions in the same document, and removing these connections eliminates important contextual information. The model also makes better use of DOC-BASED connections than MATCH or COREF connections, likely due to the higher frequency and closer proximity of mentions within the same document.\n\nAdditionally, the removal of coreference links and complement edges has a marginal impact, although it is surprising for coreference edges given that the MATCH heuristic already captures the easier coreference cases. On the test set, using coreference actually leads to performance degradation, possibly because the coreference system is less reliable on the test documents [7].\n\nThe impact of removing specific relation types is summarized in the table from image4, which shows the performance metrics for various ablations:\n![{Performance metrics for ablations of specific relation types}](image4)\n\nIn summary, the removal of R-GCN, relation types, and specific relation types like MATCH and COREF generally leads to a decline in model performance, with the most significant drop observed when R-GCN is removed."}

However, in the masked setting, the performance actually degrades when coreference information is included. The Entity-GCN with coreference scores 70.5% on the development set, while the model without coreference achieves 71.6% [8].\n\nThis discrepancy can be attributed to the nature of the masked setting, where coreference links are already captured by the unique surface forms (e.g., MASK1) used for entities, making additional coreference information redundant and potentially confusing [5]. In contrast, the unmasked setting benefits more from coreference information because mentions of the same entity can vary in surface form (e.g., \"US\" vs \"United States\"), and the coreference system helps in linking these mentions [5].\n\nIn summary, the inclusion of coreference information slightly improves performance in the unmasked setting but leads to a slight degradation in the masked setting. ![Coreference impacts performance differently in unmasked and masked settings](image8)"}

For entity extraction, coreference propagation (CorefProp) plays a crucial role. On the ACE05 dataset, coreference propagation is primarily beneficial for entity extraction, as shown in the ablation study [4]. Specifically, the best performance for entity extraction is achieved when coreference propagation is applied first, followed by relation propagation (RelProp) [3].\n\nIn contrast, relation propagation (RelProp) is more effective for relation extraction. This is illustrated in the ablation study where removing relation propagation leads to a drop in relation extraction performance, while removing coreference propagation has a lesser impact [4]. For example, on the ACE05 dataset, removing relation propagation results in a decrease in relation F1 score from 63.2 to 58.0 [image4].\n\nThe effectiveness of these propagation mechanisms is further highlighted in the SciERC dataset, where DyGIE advances the state of the art by 5.9% for relation extraction and 1.9% for named entity recognition (NER) [9].

On the ACE04-O and ACE05-O datasets, DyGIE achieves relative improvements of 11.6% and 11.3%, respectively, over the previous state of the art [7].

For example, on the ACE05 dataset, coreference propagation (CorefProp) is primarily beneficial for entity extraction, while it seems to have a detrimental effect on relation extraction [8]. This is further supported by the results shown in Table 4, where DyGIE with CorefProp achieves higher entity F1 scores but lower relation F1 scores compared to the base model [4].\n\nOn the other hand, relation propagation (RelProp) significantly benefits both entity and relation extraction in both the ACE05 and SciERC datasets [8]. This is particularly noticeable in sentences with multiple relation instances, where relation propagation helps improve the model's ability to capture complex relationships [9]. The figure in image6 illustrates this point, showing that relation propagation achieves significant improvement in sentences with more entities, where broader context is crucial [9].\n\nTo quantify these effects, consider the performance metrics in image4 and image8.

The model achieves an F1 score of 84.7 for ACE2004 and 82.9 for ACE2005, outperforming previous methods by 11.6% and 11.3%, respectively [9]. This improvement is evident in the performance metrics provided in the table [image5], where the DyGIE model outperforms other systems like Katiyar and Cardie (2018) and Wang and Lu (2018).\n\nHowever, in the SciERC dataset, where pronouns are uniformly labeled as \"Generic\" and coreference annotations are not available, the coreference propagation layer has minimal impact on entity recognition performance [8]. This is reflected in the performance metrics shown in the table [image8], where the improvement in entity F1 scores is less pronounced compared to datasets with coreference annotations.\n\nAdditionally, the number of iterations for coreference propagation also plays a crucial role. The model achieves the best performance on the second iteration (N=2) for coreference propagation in the entity extraction task [6], as illustrated in the graph [image4]. This indicates that the model benefits from a moderate number of iterations to effectively propagate coreference information.\n\nIn summary, the presence of coreference annotations in datasets significantly enhances the performance of the DyGIE model in entity recognition tasks, particularly in datasets like ACE2004 and ACE2005, where the model can leverage coreference propagation to achieve state-of-the-art results. ![The DyGIE model outperforms other systems in datasets with coreference annotations.](image5)"}

As shown in Figure 3a, the coreference layer achieves the best performance on the second iteration (N=2). This indicates that after the first iteration, the model benefits from additional propagation, but beyond the second iteration, there is no significant improvement [4]. \n\n![{Coreference propagation achieves the best performance on the second iteration (N=2).}](image1)\n\nSimilarly, for relation propagation (RelProp), the model achieves the best performance on the second iteration (M=2) for the relation extraction task, as shown in Figure 3b. This suggests that the relation propagation layer also benefits from a single additional iteration beyond the initial one [6].\n\n![{Relation propagation achieves the best performance on the second iteration (M=2).}](image6)\n\nNow, let's compare this to the impact of the number of entities in a sentence on the relation F1 score. Figure 5 provides insight into this relationship. It shows that the relation F1 score improves as the number of entities in a sentence increases, up to a certain point. Specifically, the model performs better when there are more entities in the sentence, likely because more entities provide more context and opportunities for the model to identify relations accurately [5].\n\n![{The relation F1 score improves as the number of entities in a sentence increases.}](image5)\n\nIn summary, both CorefProp and RelProp achieve their best performance on the second iteration, indicating that a single additional iteration significantly enhances the model's performance for both entity and relation extraction.

According to the experimental results, SWEM models often exhibit comparable or even superior performance to CNN models, especially in tasks involving longer documents and certain types of text classification.\n\nFor instance, in the topic prediction tasks using the Yahoo! Answers and AG News datasets, the SWEM-concat model outperforms a 29-layer deep CNN model, achieving accuracies of 73.53% and 92.66%, respectively, compared to the deep CNN's 73.43% and 91.27% [2]. Similarly, on the DBpedia dataset, the SWEM-concat model achieves an accuracy of 98.57%, which is comparable to the deep CNN's 98.71% [2].\n\nHowever, the performance dynamics change when dealing with shorter texts and sentiment analysis tasks. As shown in the results for the MR, SST-1, and SST-2 datasets, SWEM models generally yield lower accuracies compared to CNN models. For example, on the SST-2 dataset, SWEM-aver achieves an accuracy of 83.9%, while the CNN model reaches 88.1% [3].\n\nIn the context of sentence matching tasks, such as the SNLI dataset, SWEM models, particularly the SWEM-max variant, demonstrate strong performance. The SWEM-max model achieves a test accuracy of 83.8% on the SNLI dataset, outperforming both the CNN and LSTM models [4]. This suggests that max-pooling over word embeddings can effectively capture the necessary semantic features for these tasks.\n\nWhen it comes to the efficiency and parameter usage, SWEM models are significantly more efficient. The subspace training results indicate that SWEM models require fewer parameters to achieve decent performance. For example, on the AG News dataset, SWEM exhibits a lower intrinsic dimension \\(d_{\\text{int}}\\) than CNN, meaning it can achieve a similar level of performance with fewer parameters [5]. This is further supported by the computational complexity analysis, which shows that SWEM is faster and more parallelizable compared to CNN and LSTM models [6].\n\nTo visualize these findings, the comparison of accuracies across different subspace dimensions is illustrated in the following graph:\n![{SWEM models show higher accuracy with fewer parameters on the AG News dataset, indicating greater parameter efficiency.}](image10)\n\nAdditionally, the sparsity of word embeddings learned by the SWEM-max model is another critical insight. As shown in the plot of word embedding amplitudes, the embeddings learned by SWEM-max are highly concentrated around zero, indicating sparsity. This suggests that the model relies on a few key words for predictions, making it more interpretable [3]. The plot is shown below:\n![{Word embeddings learned by SWEM-max are highly sparse, indicating reliance on key words for predictions.}](image7)\n\nIn summary, SWEM models generally perform comparably or better than CNN models in tasks involving longer documents and certain types of text classification, while being more parameter-efficient and computationally efficient. However, for shorter texts and sentiment analysis, CNN models tend to outperform SWEM models."}

For instance, transferring only the LSTM layer results in an accuracy of 78.09% and a macro-F1 score of 67.85% on dataset D1, while transferring only the embedding layer leads to an accuracy of 71.41% and a macro-F1 score of 66.68% on the same dataset.

The improvements in accuracy are stable across all datasets, but the macro-F1 scores show more significant gains on datasets D3 and D4 when the percentage of document-level examples increases from 0 to 0.4. This trend suggests that document-level knowledge is particularly beneficial for datasets with fewer training examples and unbalanced label distributions [4]. ![Performance improves with more document-level examples](image3)\n\nIn conclusion, the inclusion of different components in the model, such as the LSTM and embedding layers, significantly enhances performance, especially on datasets with unbalanced label distributions.

When focusing specifically on the restaurant domain, TRADE also outperforms other models, achieving a joint goal accuracy of 65.35% and slot accuracy of 93.28% [10].\n\nIn domain adaptation scenarios, the TRADE model's performance is further highlighted.

When considering the attraction domain as a new domain, GEM achieves a joint accuracy of 34.73%, outperforming naive fine-tuning, which only reaches 29.39% [4]. Similarly, in the zero-shot analysis of the hotel and restaurant domains, knowledge about common slots such as \"people,\" \"area,\" \"price range,\" and \"day\" is successfully transferred from the other four domains [2]. However, for unseen slots that are unique to a specific domain, such as \"parking,\" \"stars,\" and \"internet\" in the hotel domain, the model struggles to track them correctly [2].\n\nThe effectiveness of GEM in preventing catastrophic forgetting is further highlighted in the domain expansion experiments. GEM consistently outperforms naive and EWC fine-tuning in maintaining performance on the four pre-trained domains while adapting to the new domain [5]. For example, when fine-tuning on 1% of the new domain data, GEM achieves 53.54% joint accuracy on the four pre-trained domains, compared to 36.08% for naive fine-tuning and 40.82% for EWC [5].\n\nThe impact of slot similarities on performance is also notable. Slots that are shared across multiple domains, such as \"price range\" and \"area,\" are more easily transferred and tracked, leading to better performance. This is evident in the zero-shot analysis where these common slots show higher accuracy [2]. Conversely, unique slots like \"parking\" and \"internet\" in the hotel domain are harder to track, as they do not benefit from the transfer of knowledge from other domains [2].\n\nIn summary, GEM is more effective than EWC and naive fine-tuning in adapting the model to new domain data while maintaining performance on previously learned domains, and slot similarities play a crucial role in the success of knowledge transfer. ![GEM outperforms EWC and naive fine-tuning in domain expansion](image3)"}

Table 2 provides a comprehensive overview of the performance metrics for several commercial MT systems on the WinoMT corpus, covering languages such as Spanish, French, Italian, Russian, Ukrainian, Hebrew, Arabic, and German [1]. The table includes overall gender accuracy ($Acc$), the difference in performance between masculine and feminine scores ($\\Delta_{G}$), and the difference in performance between pro-stereotypical and anti-stereotypical gender role assignments ($\\Delta_{S}$).\n\nFor instance, in Spanish, Google Translate has an overall gender accuracy of 53.1%, with a significant difference in performance between masculine and feminine scores (23.4% vs. 21.3%) and a notable bias towards pro-stereotypical roles [image4]. Similarly, in French, Google Translate shows a higher overall accuracy of 63.6%, but still exhibits a strong bias towards pro-stereotypical roles [image4].\n\nThe impact of gender bias is further illustrated in a specific example from the Spanish translation of \"The janitor does not like the baker because she always messes up the kitchen.\" Initially, the translation incorrectly assigns a male inflection to \"baker,\" but adding the adjective \"pretty\" before \"baker\" corrects the translation to a female inflection [image2]. This demonstrates that even minor changes in the input can significantly affect the gender bias in the output.\n\nAnother example from the French translation of \"The counselor asked the guard a few questions and praised her for the good work\" shows that French uses the same term \"garde\" for both male and female guards, which can lead to more accurate and less biased translations [image2].\n\nOverall, the data and examples indicate that while some MT systems perform better in certain languages, they generally exhibit significant gender biases, particularly in translating anti-stereotypical gender roles. The addition of stereotypically gendered adjectives can sometimes mitigate these biases, but it is not a practical solution for real-world applications [5].\n\nIn conclusion, the translation accuracy and gender bias vary across different MT systems and languages, with most systems showing a tendency towards gender stereotypes, especially in languages with grammatical gender. ![All tested MT systems exhibit significant gender biases, particularly in translating anti-stereotypical gender roles.](image4)"}

According to the study, when stereotypical adjectives like \"handsome\" for males and \"pretty\" for females were added to the sentences, the performance of the translation systems improved in some languages. Specifically, this approach significantly reduced bias in Spanish, Russian, and Ukrainian [9].\n\nFor instance, in Spanish, the addition of a stereotypical adjective \"pretty\" to the sentence \"The janitor does not like the baker because she always messes up the kitchen\" resulted in a more accurate translation: \"Al conserje no le gusta la panadera bonita porque ella siempre desordena la cocina.\" This adjustment helped the translation system correctly identify the gender of the baker, aligning with the context provided by the adjective [5].\n\nSimilarly, in Russian and Ukrainian, the addition of such adjectives also led to improvements in gender accuracy. The table below shows the accuracy improvements in these languages when stereotypical adjectives were added:\n\n| Language | Original Accuracy (%) | Accuracy with Adjectives (%) | Improvement (%) |\n|----------|-----------------------|------------------------------|-----------------|\n| ES       | 53.1                  | 63.5                         | +10.4           |\n| RU       | 37.7                  | 48.9                         | +11.2           |\n| UK       | 38.4                  | 42.9                         | +4.5            |\n\nThese improvements suggest that providing additional context through stereotypical adjectives can help reduce gender bias in machine translation [9]. However, it is important to note that this method is not practical as a general debiasing scheme, as it assumes perfect coreference resolution and may not be applicable in all scenarios [9].\n\nTo further illustrate the impact of stereotypes on gender bias, consider the following example from the study. In the original sentence \"The doctor asked the nurse to help her in the procedure,\" the translation to Spanish was biased, incorrectly assigning a male inflection to the doctor: \"El doctor le pidió a la enfermera que le ayudara con el procedimiento.\" When the sentence was modified to include a stereotypical adjective, \"The pretty doctor asked the nurse to help her in the procedure,\" the translation became more accurate: \"La doctora le pidió a la enfermera que le ayudara con el procedimiento\" [7].\n\nIn summary, stereotype-based adjustments can significantly improve gender bias accuracy in machine translation, particularly in languages like Spanish, Russian, and Ukrainian. However, this method has limitations and is not a comprehensive solution to the broader issue of gender bias in machine translation systems.\n\n![{Stereotype-based adjustments improve gender bias accuracy in Spanish, Russian, and Ukrainian.}](image7)"}

When the model is trained on the original distractors and evaluated on adversarial distractors, the F1 score drops significantly from 67.08 to 46.84 [4]. However, when the model is re-trained on the adversarial distractors, the F1 score improves to 60.10 [4]. This indicates that adversarial training can help the model recover some of its lost accuracy, suggesting that the model benefits from being exposed to more challenging distractors during training.\n\nNext, let's look at the effect of filtering by entity type. When the model is trained on the original distractors and evaluated on adversarial distractors with entity type filtering, the F1 score drops to 40.73 [1]. However, when the model is re-trained on adversarial distractors with entity type filtering, the F1 score increases to 58.42 [1]. This suggests that entity type filtering can make the task more difficult, but the model can still adapt and improve with appropriate training.\n\nThe importance of evidence in multi-hop reasoning is highlighted in the context of the HOTPOT QA dataset [6]. Even though the dataset is designed for multi-hop questions, a single-hop BERT-based model can achieve a competitive F1 score of 67, indicating that many questions can be answered with single-hop reasoning. This finding underscores the need for careful construction of multi-hop datasets to ensure that multi-hop reasoning is genuinely required.\n\nTo further illustrate the complexity of multi-hop reasoning, consider the performance of the single-paragraph BERT model in the open-domain setting. The model achieves an F1 score of 38.40 when given 10 paragraphs and 39.12 when given 500 paragraphs [8]. However, when the two gold paragraphs are added, the F1 score jumps to 53.12 [8]. This demonstrates that the retrieval of relevant paragraphs is crucial for the model's performance, and current retrieval methods like TF-IDF may not be sufficient for multi-hop questions.\n\nAdditionally, the distribution of question types in the HOTPOT QA dataset provides insight into the nature of the tasks. Multi-hop questions account for 45% of the dataset, context-dependent questions for 36%, and single-hop questions for 17% [image1]. The higher F1 scores for single-hop questions (70.54%) compared to multi-hop (54.46%) and context-dependent (56.16%) questions further support the idea that single-hop reasoning is easier and more prevalent.\n\nIn summary, different training and evaluation strategies significantly affect F1 scores in multi-hop and single-hop question answering tasks. Adversarial training and entity type filtering can make the task more challenging but also help the model improve. The effectiveness of retrieval methods and the careful construction of datasets are crucial for ensuring that multi-hop reasoning is genuinely required. ![The F1 scores for different training and evaluation strategies are summarized in Table 4.](image8) The key takeaway is that robust training and evaluation practices are essential for improving model performance in complex question answering tasks."}

When BERT is trained and evaluated on the original dataset, it achieves a peak performance of 77%, which is just three points below the average untrained human baseline [1]. However, this high performance is attributed to BERT's exploitation of spurious statistical cues in the dataset [1][2].\n\nTo address this issue, an adversarial dataset is constructed by negating the claim and inverting the label for each data point, effectively mirroring the distribution of cues around both labels [8][9]. When BERT is trained and evaluated on this adversarial dataset, its performance drops dramatically. Specifically, BERT's peak performance on the adversarial test set is reduced to 53%, with a mean and median of 50% [6][8].\n\nThis significant drop in performance indicates that the original high scores were not due to genuine argument comprehension but rather to the exploitation of superficial statistical cues [10]. The adversarial dataset thus provides a more robust evaluation of machine argument comprehension and should be adopted as the standard in future work [3][8].\n\nThe results from the adversarial setup clearly show that BERT has not learned to genuinely comprehend arguments. Instead, it relies heavily on spurious cues, which are eliminated in the adversarial dataset.

The COMET model with pre-training has a PPL of 4.32, which is significantly lower than the COMET model without pre-training (PPL of 15.18) [image2].

According to the word statistics provided in Table 2 [4], the Seq2Seq model produces shorter sentences with more common words compared to human utterances. Specifically, the Seq2Seq model has a word count of 11.7 and a character count of 40.5, with only 0.4% rare words (frequency < 100) and 5.8% words with frequency < 1000. This contrasts with human responses, which have a word count of 13.0, a character count of 54.6, and use 3.0% rare words and 11.5% words with frequency < 1000.\n\nThe RetNRef model, which incorporates retrieval, improves these statistics. For instance, the RetNRef model increases the use of rare words to 1.1% and the use of words with frequency < 1000 to 6.9%. The RetNRef++ model further enhances these metrics, bringing the word count to 12.7, the character count to 48.1, and increasing the use of rare words to 2.3% and words with frequency < 1000 to 10.9%. These improvements suggest that the RetNRef++ model is more capable of generating longer, more nuanced sentences that are closer to human-like conversations.\n\nIn terms of performance metrics, the RetrieveNRefine (RetNRef) models consistently outperform the Seq2Seq and Memory Network models in human evaluations. Table 3 [9] shows that the RetNRef++ model has a high word overlap with the retriever output, indicating that it effectively uses the retriever while still generating novel content. This balance is crucial for maintaining engaging and coherent conversations.\n\nThe engagingness scores in Table 4 [3] further support this. The RetNRef++ model achieves higher scores in engagingness, fluency, and consistency compared to the Seq2Seq and Memory Network models. Specifically, the RetNRef++ model scores 3.80 in engagingness, 3.74 in fluency, and 3.80 in consistency, while the Seq2Seq model scores 2.70 in engagingness, 3.50 in fluency, and 3.90 in consistency. The Memory Network model scores 3.66 in engagingness, 3.83 in fluency, and 3.61 in consistency.\n\nAdditionally, the A/B tests in Table 5 [11] provide direct comparisons between the models. The RetNRef++ model has a win rate of 54.5% against the Memory Network model and 53.7% against the Seq2Seq model, indicating that it is more likely to be chosen as the better model in human evaluations. This is statistically significant, as shown by the p-values (0.027 and 0.016, respectively).\n\nHowever, it's important to note that while the RetNRef++ model excels in many areas, it still faces challenges in using persona information effectively, as indicated by the lower scores in the persona metric compared to the Seq2Seq model.\n\nIn conclusion, the RetNRef++ model significantly improves word statistics and performance metrics, making it more capable of generating human-like conversations. ![RetNRef++ model outperforms others in word statistics and human evaluations](image4)"}

These instruments were recognized in the income statement and other comprehensive income, reflecting the company's efforts to hedge against foreign exchange risk.\n\nThe financial risk profile of Novo Nordisk also indicates that foreign exchange risk is the most significant financial risk, with high exposure compared to other risks like credit, interest rate, and liquidity risks:\n![{Financial risk profile of Novo Nordisk in 2020}](image4)\n\nThe company's credit risk exposure to financial counterparties was DKK 15,089 million, with the majority of these counterparties having a satisfactory long-term credit rating:\n![{Credit exposure to financial counterparties in 2020 and 2019}](image5)\n\nFinally, the impact of exchange rate adjustments on the cash flow hedges and other comprehensive income is summarized:\n![{Impact of exchange rate adjustments on the cash flow hedges and other comprehensive income from 2018 to 2020}](image7)\n\nIn 2020, the reserve at the end of the year showed a significant decrease in other comprehensive income, net for 2020, by DKK 1,689 million, which was partially offset by adjustments and transfers.\n\nIn conclusion, the changes in exchange rates and financial risks in 2020 had a substantial impact on Novo Nordisk's comprehensive income and cash flow hedges, with the company actively managing these risks through various hedging strategies."}

This change can be attributed to several key factors.\n\nFirstly, the income/(charge) to the income statement significantly contributed to this reduction. Specifically, the income/(charge) to the income statement was DKK (47) million, which represents a charge that reduced the net deferred tax asset [3]. Additionally, the income/(charge) to other comprehensive income further reduced the net deferred tax asset by DKK (577) million [3].\n\nSecondly, the effect of exchange rate adjustments played a role. The effect of exchange rate adjustments resulted in a decrease of DKK (307) million [3]. This indicates that unfavorable exchange rate movements negatively impacted the net deferred tax asset.\n\nLastly, the acquisition of subsidiaries added DKK 276 million to the net deferred tax asset, but this was not enough to offset the other reductions [3].\n\nIn summary, the main contributing factors to the decrease in the net deferred tax asset from the beginning to the end of 2020 were charges to the income statement, charges to other comprehensive income, and adverse exchange rate adjustments. ![Net deferred tax asset/(liability) decreased by DKK 678 million from the beginning to the end of 2020](image3)"}

According to the data, the total AUM increased from $471 billion in 2018 to $657 billion in 2020, representing a substantial growth of $186 billion. This growth can be attributed to increases in both long-term AUM and liquidity. Specifically, long-term AUM grew from $313 billion in 2018 to $405 billion in 2020, while liquidity increased from $158 billion in 2018 to $252 billion in 2020 [image4]. This significant rise in AUM suggests that the firm has been successful in attracting more investments and expanding its client base.\n\nHowever, the fee rates have shown a slight decline over the same period. The fee rate for total AUM decreased from 47 basis points (bps) in 2018 to 42 bps in 2020 [image7]. This reduction in fee rates can be attributed to various factors, such as competitive pressures and changes in the mix of assets managed. For instance, the fee rate for fixed income and alternative/other categories decreased, which might reflect a shift towards lower-fee products or a more competitive market environment.\n\nThe impact of these changes on the firm's revenues is nuanced. On one hand, the substantial increase in AUM has likely led to higher asset management revenues, as the firm earns fees based on the amount of assets it manages. According to the text, asset management revenues in 2020 increased by 15% compared to the prior year, primarily due to higher average AUM, driven by strong investment performance and positive net flows [2]. This indicates that the growth in AUM has had a positive effect on the firm's top line.\n\nOn the other hand, the slight decline in fee rates could moderate the revenue growth. Lower fee rates mean that the firm earns less per unit of AUM, which can offset some of the benefits of the increased asset base. However, given the significant growth in AUM, the overall impact on revenues is still likely to be positive, but the margin of improvement might be smaller than it would have been if fee rates had remained stable or increased.\n\nIn conclusion, the firm's revenues have benefited from the substantial growth in AUM, despite a slight decline in fee rates. The combination of these factors suggests a positive but moderated impact on the firm's financial performance. ![The firm's AUM grew significantly from 2018 to 2020, while fee rates slightly declined.](image4)"}

Specifically, the total operating lease liabilities rose from $719 million to $974 million, representing an increase of $255 million [8]. This change can be broken down into the current and long-term portions of the operating lease liabilities.\n\nFor the current portion, the operating lease liabilities increased from $158 million to $189 million, a rise of $31 million [8]. For the long-term portion, the operating lease liabilities increased from $639 million to $785 million, a rise of $146 million [8].\n\nThese increases can be attributed to several factors. One key factor is the acquisition activity, particularly the Cytiva Acquisition in 2020, which likely added to the company's lease obligations [11]. Additionally, the company's overall growth and expansion could have led to more leasing activities, such as new facilities or equipment leases.\n\nFurthermore, the weighted average remaining lease term remained consistent at 7 years, but the weighted average discount rate decreased from 3.1% to 2.8%, which could also influence the present value of the lease liabilities [8]. A lower discount rate would result in a higher present value of future lease payments, contributing to the increase in lease liabilities.\n\n![{The total operating lease liabilities increased from $719 million in 2019 to $974 million in 2020, reflecting a rise in both current and long-term portions.}](image8)\n\nIn summary, the company's operating lease liabilities increased from $719 million in 2019 to $974 million in 2020, primarily due to acquisitions and a lower discount rate."}

For fiscal year 2021, the net income was $9,043 million, a substantial increase from $5,198 million in 2020 and $4,386 million in 2019 [6]. Similarly, the comprehensive income for 2021 was $8,964 million, up from $5,305 million in 2020 and $4,272 million in 2019 [7].\n\nThe key factors contributing to these changes include:\n\n1. **Revenue Growth**: Qualcomm experienced a 43% increase in total revenues, reaching $33.6 billion in 2021, compared to $23.5 billion in 2020 [9]. This growth was primarily driven by a 64% increase in QCT (Qualcomm CDMA Technologies) revenues, which rose from $16.1 billion in 2020 to $26.6 billion in 2021 [6]. The increase in QCT revenues can be attributed to higher demand for 5G products across handsets and RFFE (Radio Frequency Front End), reflecting a recovery from the negative impacts of COVID-19 [10].\n\n2. **Licensing Revenues**: QTL (Qualcomm Technology Licensing) revenues also saw a 26% increase, from $7.233 billion in 2020 to $6.825 billion in 2021 [6]. This growth was primarily due to an increase in estimated sales of 3G/4G/5G-based multimode products, again reflecting a recovery from the negative impacts of COVID-19 [10].\n\n3. **Operational Efficiency**: The company's operational efficiency improved, with operating income increasing from $6,255 million in 2020 to $9,789 million in 2021 [6]. This was supported by effective cost management, as seen in the controlled growth of research and development expenses and selling, general, and administrative expenses [6].\n\n4. **Investment Gains**: Qualcomm benefited from net gains on marketable securities and other investments, which contributed positively to the overall financial performance [1].\n\n5. **Acquisitions and Strategic Investments**: The acquisition of NUVIA for $1.1 billion in March 2021 added to the company's technological capabilities and potential future revenue streams [7]. Additionally, the planned acquisition of Veoneer, Inc., valued at approximately $4.5 billion, further demonstrates Qualcomm's strategic focus on expanding its presence in the automotive and IoT markets [10].\n\nThese factors collectively contributed to the strong financial performance of Qualcomm in fiscal year 2021, leading to significant increases in both net income and comprehensive income compared to the previous years. ![Net income and comprehensive income increased significantly in fiscal year 2021](image7)"}

This increase can be attributed to several key areas:\n\n- **Unpaid Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses**: These increased from $79,854 billion in 2020 to $86,664 billion in 2021, reflecting higher reserves set aside for potential future claims [image1].\n- **Unearned Premiums**: These also saw a slight increase, from $21,395 billion in 2020 to $22,452 billion in 2021, indicating a rise in premiums received in advance for insurance policies [image1].\n- **Notes Payable and Other Borrowings**: The total for insurance and other businesses decreased slightly from $41,522 billion in 2020 to $39,272 billion in 2021, while the railroad, utilities, and energy segment saw a significant increase from $15,373 billion to $74,990 billion [image1].\n\n### Shareholders' Equity\nThe total shareholders' equity rose from $451,336 billion in 2020 to $514,930 billion in 2021. This substantial increase is primarily due to:\n\n- **Retained Earnings**: Retained earnings grew significantly from $444,626 billion in 2020 to $534,421 billion in 2021, driven by strong net earnings of $89,8 billion in 2021, which included substantial after-tax gains on investments of approximately $61.6 billion [1][image1].\n- **Treasury Stock**: The cost of treasury stock increased from $32,853 billion in 2020 to $59,795 billion in 2021, indicating that Berkshire repurchased a larger amount of its own shares [image1].\n- **Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income**: This improved from $(4,243)$ billion in 2020 to $(4,027)$ billion in 2021, primarily due to positive foreign currency translation adjustments and unrealized appreciation of fixed maturity securities [image8].\n\n### Key Factors Contributing to These Changes\n\n1. **Strong Financial Performance**: The significant increase in retained earnings was a result of robust net earnings, which were bolstered by investment gains and operational performance [1].\n2. **Share Repurchase Program**: Berkshire continued its share repurchase program, which led to a higher cost of treasury stock, reflecting the company's confidence in its valuation [image1].\n3. **Foreign Currency Translation**: Positive foreign currency translation adjustments contributed to the improvement in accumulated other comprehensive income [image8].\n4. **Investment Gains**: After-tax gains on investments played a crucial role in enhancing the company's financial position, particularly in retained earnings [1].\n5. **Insurance Reserves**: The increase in unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses reflects the company's conservative approach to reserving for potential future claims, ensuring financial stability [image1].\n\nIn conclusion, the changes in liabilities and shareholders' equity from 2020 to 2021 for Berkshire Hathaway Inc. were primarily driven by strong financial performance, significant investment gains, and strategic share repurchases. ![Berkshire Hathaway's liabilities and shareholders' equity increased from 2020 to 2021, with notable changes in unpaid losses, retained earnings, and treasury stock.](image1)"}

Additionally, the impact from changes in dealer inventories and favorable price realization also contributed significantly to the revenue growth [10].\n\nThe decrease in dealer inventories during 2020, which was much more substantial compared to 2021, indicates that dealers were restocking in 2021, further boosting sales [11]. This trend is consistent across various regions, including North America, Latin America, EAME, and Asia/Pacific [11].\n\nMoreover, the financial performance across different segments also supports this analysis. For instance, the Construction Industries saw a significant increase in sales, driven by higher end-user demand and changes in dealer inventories [8]. Similarly, the Resource Industries experienced a 26% increase in sales, primarily due to higher end-user demand in mining and heavy construction [5].\n\nThe impact of favorable currency impacts, particularly from the Chinese yuan, euro, and Australian dollar, also contributed to the overall revenue growth [8].

Specifically, capital investments in the Downstream sector decreased by $0.2 billion to $4.2 billion in 2020, while Chemical capital expenditures decreased by $0.5 billion to $2.7 billion [10]. These reductions were part of the Corporation's broader strategy to manage costs and preserve liquidity during the economic downturn caused by the 2020 industry conditions [2].\n\nThe financial implications of these changes in capital expenditures are evident in the Corporation's ability to maintain a strong financial position despite the challenging environment. By reducing Capex, ExxonMobil was able to conserve cash and reduce debt levels, which is crucial for maintaining financial stability and flexibility [2].\n\nRegarding taxes, the total taxes on the Corporation’s income statement in 2020 were $22.8 billion, a significant decrease from $38.5 billion in 2019 [9]. This reduction was primarily due to a decrease in income tax expense, which turned into a benefit of $5.6 billion in 2020 compared to an expense of $5.3 billion in 2019. The effective tax rate dropped from 34% in 2019 to 17% in 2020, largely influenced by the mix of results in jurisdictions with varying tax rates and the impact of asset impairments [9].\n\nAdditionally, total other taxes and duties decreased by $4.8 billion to $28.4 billion in 2020 [9]. This reduction in taxes, coupled with the decrease in capital expenditures, helped ExxonMobil to manage its financial obligations more effectively and maintain a stronger liquidity position.\n\nThese changes in capital expenditures and taxes highlight ExxonMobil's proactive approach to navigating the economic challenges of 2020, ensuring the company remains financially resilient and positioned for future growth.\n\n![{ExxonMobil's total taxes and effective tax rate decreased significantly from 2019 to 2020, reflecting the impact of lower income and strategic financial management.}](image1)\n\nIn summary, ExxonMobil's capital expenditures and taxes both decreased from 2019 to 2020, with the company strategically reducing Capex and benefiting from lower tax obligations, which helped maintain financial stability during a challenging year."}

According to the details provided, Berkshire Hathaway's common stock repurchase program allows the company to repurchase its Class A and Class B shares at prices below its intrinsic value, as determined by Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger [12]. In 2021, Berkshire paid $27.1 billion to repurchase shares of its Class A and B common stock [12]. This significant amount indicates a strong belief in the company's intrinsic value and a commitment to returning capital to shareholders. The repurchase program has no expiration date and no specified maximum number of shares, emphasizing the company's flexibility in managing its capital [12].\n\nNow, let's look at the net earnings across different segments over the same period. The table in the provided data shows the net earnings attributable to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders for the years 2019 to 2021 [4]. The insurance underwriting segment saw an increase in after-tax earnings from $657 million in 2020 to $728 million in 2021, despite facing challenges from significant catastrophe events [9]. The insurance investment income, however, decreased by 4.6% in 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to declining interest rates on substantial holdings of cash and U.S. Treasury Bills [6].\n\nThe railroad segment's after-tax earnings rose by 16.1% in 2021 compared to 2020, driven by higher freight volumes, improved productivity, and higher average revenue per car/unit, although these gains were partially offset by higher fuel prices and volume-related costs [10]. The utilities and energy segment also performed well, with after-tax earnings increasing by 13.1% in 2021 compared to 2020, thanks to higher earnings from utilities and natural gas pipelines businesses, including the effects of a business acquisition [10].\n\nThe manufacturing, service, and retailing businesses experienced a significant recovery in 2021, with earnings increasing by 34.0% compared to 2020, despite ongoing global supply chain disruptions and higher input costs [7]. This recovery is particularly notable given the severe impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on these sectors in 2020 [2].\n\nTo visualize the performance, consider the chart comparing the subsequent value of $100 invested in Berkshire common stock on December 31, 2016, with similar investments in the S&P 500 Index and the S&P 500 Property & Casualty Insurance Index [8]. This chart illustrates the relative performance of Berkshire's stock over the period, highlighting its resilience and growth [8].\n\nIn summary, Berkshire Hathaway's stock repurchase program and its net earnings across different segments demonstrate a robust financial strategy and operational recovery post-pandemic. The significant repurchases in 2021 reflect confidence in the company's intrinsic value, while the earnings growth in key segments like insurance, railroad, utilities, and manufacturing indicate a strong rebound and continued financial strength. ![Berkshire Hathaway's diverse energy sources highlight its commitment to various forms of renewable and traditional energy.](image1)"}

This decline can be attributed to several factors, including the impact of the pandemic on international markets.\n\nThe International Operated Markets segment experienced a significant revenue decline, driven by temporary restaurant closures and limited operations, particularly in key markets such as the U.K., France, Germany, Italy, and Spain [2]. These closures and operational limitations led to a 19% decrease in revenues for the International Operated Markets segment in 2020, as shown in the image detailing the financial performance of different segments ![Revenue declines in International Operated Markets](image2).\n\nIn contrast, the U.S. market showed a more resilient performance, with total company-operated sales and franchised revenues decreasing by only 4% in 2020 [3]. However, this was partially offset by the support provided to franchisees for marketing and other initiatives to accelerate recovery and drive growth, which amounted to over $200 million, primarily recorded in Selling, General and Administrative Expenses [11].\n\nThe overall decrease in revenues and the additional expenses incurred to support franchisees and manage the impact of the pandemic contributed to the decline in both GAAP and Non-GAAP earnings per share.

In 2020, McDonald's reported a total other comprehensive loss of $104.1 million, which contrasts with a gain of $126.8 million in 2019 and a loss of $431.1 million in 2018 [7]. The main components of this other comprehensive income (loss) include foreign currency translation adjustments and defined benefit pension plan adjustments.\n\nFor instance, the foreign currency translation adjustments resulted in a net loss of $77.3 million in 2020, compared to a net gain of $107.1 million in 2019 and a net loss of $404.7 million in 2018 [7].

The primary factors contributing to this decrease include:\n\n- **Lower Cost of Funds**: Despite the decrease in net interest income, the cost of funds was lower in 2021, which helped mitigate the decline [12].\n- **Interest Expense**: The interest expense decreased from $1,731 million in 2019 to $717 million in 2021, a reduction of $1,014 million or about 58.6% [3]. This significant reduction in interest expense was due to lower market interest rates, which reduced the cost of borrowing.\n- **Average Revolving Card Member Loan Balances**: However, the average revolving Card Member loan balances were lower in 2021, which contributed to the overall decrease in net interest income [12].\n\nNext, let's examine the changes in card member receivables.

The contributing factors for this change include:\n\n- **Improved Portfolio Quality and Macroeconomic Outlook**: The reserve for credit losses decreased in 2021 due to improved portfolio quality and a better macroeconomic outlook, particularly driven by improvements in unemployment rate projections [7, 9].\n- **Net Write-Off Rates**: The net write-off rates for both principal only and principal and fees decreased significantly from 2019 to 2021. For example, the net write-off rate for principal only decreased from 1.7% in 2019 to 0.3% in 2021, and the net write-off rate for principal and fees decreased from 1.9% in 2019 to 0.4% in 2021 [image5]. This indicates better credit performance and lower default rates.\n- **30+ Days Past Due**: The percentage of accounts 30+ days past due also decreased from 2% in 2019 to 0.5% in 2021, further reflecting improved credit quality [image5].\n\nIn summary, the net interest income decreased from 2019 to 2021 primarily due to lower average revolving Card Member loan balances, despite a significant reduction in interest expense. The card member receivables showed a slight decrease, driven by improved portfolio quality, lower net write-off rates, and a better macroeconomic outlook. ![Net interest income and card member receivables changes from 2019 to 2021](image5)"}

While there was a slight increase in profit, it does not fully explain the significant decrease in retained earnings.\n- **Dividends and Other Distributions**: The financial statements do not explicitly mention dividends paid, but it is possible that significant distributions were made to shareholders or other stakeholders, reducing retained earnings.\n- **Reinvestments and Capital Expenditures**: The company may have reinvested a large portion of its earnings into capital expenditures, acquisitions, or other strategic initiatives, as indicated by the significant cash outflows in investing activities shown in Image 5.\n\n#### Total Comprehensive Income for the Year\nThe increase in 'Total Comprehensive Income for the Year' from 2019 to 2020 can be attributed to:\n\n- **Profit for the Year**: As mentioned, the profit for the year increased from RMB 3,977 million in 2019 to RMB 4,176 million in 2020.\n- **Other Comprehensive Income**: The other comprehensive income components, such as fair value changes on financial assets and currency translation differences, also contributed to the increase. Specifically, the fair value changes on financial assets and currency translation differences are noted in Image 7 and Image 8, showing positive contributions in 2020.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe decrease in 'Retained Earnings' from 2019 to 2020 by RMB 1,928 million can be attributed to potential distributions, reinvestments, and capital expenditures. The increase in 'Total Comprehensive Income for the Year' from 2019 to 2020 by RMB 2,832 million is primarily due to an increase in profit and positive contributions from other comprehensive income components. ![The financial statements show a decrease in retained earnings and an increase in total comprehensive income](image3)"}

In contrast, the non-U.S. defined benefit plans had $126 million in fixed income securities and cash equivalents and $671 million in equity securities.\n\nAdditionally, Image 1 provides a percentage breakdown of the asset composition for the U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit plans as of 2019:\n\n- **U.S. Defined Benefit Plan**:\n  - Fixed income securities and cash equivalents: 35%\n  - Equity securities: 65%\n\n- **Non-U.S. Defined Benefit Plans**:\n  - Fixed income securities and cash equivalents: 24%\n  - Equity securities: 76%\n\nThese percentages indicate that the U.S. defined benefit plan had a higher proportion of equity securities (65%) compared to fixed income securities and cash equivalents (35%). Conversely, the non-U.S. defined benefit plans had a higher proportion of equity securities (76%) compared to fixed income securities and cash equivalents (24%).\n\nIn summary, the U.S. defined benefit plan had a higher percentage of equity securities and no fixed income securities and cash equivalents in 2019, while the non-U.S. defined benefit plans had a higher percentage of equity securities but also a significant amount of fixed income securities and cash equivalents. ![U.S. defined benefit plan had no fixed income securities and $347 million in equity securities in 2019, while non-U.S. defined benefit plans had $126 million in fixed income securities and $671 million in equity securities.](image4)"}

Specifically, the provision for income taxes in 2020 was $4,973 million, representing a 24.0% effective tax rate, compared to $3,742 million and $3,562 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively, with effective tax rates of 20.8% and 22.3% [3][image3]. This trend indicates a higher tax burden in 2020 relative to the previous years.\n\nTo understand the contribution of deferred income tax assets and liabilities to these trends, we need to examine the changes in these accounts over the same period. The deferred income tax assets increased from $2,868 million in 2019 to $3,391 million in 2020 [8][image8]. This increase is primarily driven by growth in accrued expenses and allowances, lease liability, and other non-U.S. assets. For instance, the lease liability grew from $892 million in 2019 to $1,200 million in 2020, reflecting the impact of new lease accounting standards.\n\nOn the other hand, deferred income tax liabilities also increased significantly from $5,861 million in 2019 to $6,758 million in 2020 [8][image8]. The primary contributors to this increase include higher U.S. federal and state intangible assets, capitalized software, and lease right-of-use assets. The U.S. federal and state intangible assets alone increased from $2,370 million to $2,588 million, while the lease right-of-use asset liability rose from $887 million to $1,179 million.\n\nThe net effect of these changes is an increase in net deferred income tax liabilities from $2,993 million in 2019 to $3,367 million in 2020 [8][image8]. This increase in net deferred income tax liabilities suggests that the company expects to pay more taxes in the future, aligning with the higher provisions for income taxes observed in 2020.\n\nIn conclusion, the trends in the company's provisions for income taxes from 2018 to 2020 are influenced by the growing deferred income tax liabilities, particularly from intangible assets and lease right-of-use assets, which outweigh the increases in deferred income tax assets. ![The deferred income tax assets and liabilities have significant impacts on the company's tax provisions.](image8)"}

According to the data provided in the image descriptions, particularly in image3, we can see the following:\n\nFor the year 2020:\n- **Current Liabilities**: $5,342 million\n- **Noncurrent Liabilities**: $1,189 million\n\nFor the year 2019:\n- **Current Liabilities**: $3,205 million\n- **Noncurrent Liabilities**: $5,351 million\n\nThe total current liabilities increased from $3,205 million in 2019 to $5,342 million in 2020, a significant increase of $2,137 million. On the other hand, the total noncurrent liabilities decreased from $5,351 million in 2019 to $1,189 million in 2020, a decrease of $4,162 million.\n\nNow, let's examine how these changes relate to the changes in total debt over the same period. According to the text quote [4], the total debt was approximately $21.2 billion as of December 31, 2020, and $21.7 billion as of December 31, 2019. This indicates a slight decrease in total debt of $0.5 billion from 2019 to 2020.\n\nThe increase in current liabilities and the decrease in noncurrent liabilities can be attributed to several factors, including the reclassification of some long-term debt to short-term debt. Specifically, the text quote [4] mentions that the company classified $611 million of its borrowings under the euro-denominated commercial paper program and $290 million of borrowings under the 2021 Yen Notes as long-term debt, but these amounts are still reflected in the current liabilities due to the company's intent and ability to refinance them for at least one year. This is further supported by the detailed breakdown of the debt in image2, which shows the specific amounts and maturities of various debt instruments.\n\nAdditionally, the cross-currency swap derivative liabilities, which are part of the noncurrent liabilities, show a significant increase from $112 million in 2019 to $622 million in 2020, as seen in image7. This increase in derivative liabilities likely contributed to the overall increase in current liabilities and the decrease in noncurrent liabilities.\n\nIn summary, the total current liabilities increased significantly from 2019 to 2020, while the noncurrent liabilities decreased substantially. This shift is related to the reclassification of some long-term debt to short-term debt and the increase in cross-currency swap derivative liabilities, reflecting the company's financial strategy and market conditions. ![Total current liabilities increased by $2,137 million, while noncurrent liabilities decreased by $4,162 million from 2019 to 2020.](image3)"}

Specifically, total revenues increased from $125 million to $280 million, operating income increased from $78 million to $202 million, and net income increased from $78 million to $201 million.\n\nThis improvement indicates a strong financial performance for Amberjack in 2020 compared to 2018. The increase in revenues likely contributed to the higher operating and net income, reflecting a more robust business environment or successful operational strategies.\n\nAdditionally, the balance sheet data for Amberjack as of December 31, 2020, shows:\n- Current assets: $44 million\n- Non-current assets: $836 million\n- Total assets: $880 million\n- Current liabilities: $10 million\n- Non-current liabilities: $124 million\n- Equity: $746 million [7]\n\nThese figures further support the positive financial health of Amberjack in 2020, with a strong asset base and a healthy equity position.\n\n![{Amberjack's financial performance improved significantly from 2018 to 2020, with increases in total revenues, operating income, and net income.}](image7)\n\nIn conclusion, Amberjack's financial performance improved significantly from 2018 to 2020, with total revenues, operating income, and net income all showing substantial increases."}

The net discrete tax benefits in 2020 were $122 million, significantly lower than the $475 million in 2019 [5]. This reduction in tax benefits can be attributed to the conversion of employee share-based awards, which contributed to the higher effective tax rate [3].\n\nThese changes in the tax rate and tax benefits are closely tied to the overall compensation expenses. In 2020, the total compensation and benefits expenses were $20,854 million, representing an 11% increase from the prior year [1]. This increase was driven by higher discretionary incentive compensation, formulaic payouts to Wealth Management representatives, and expenses related to deferred compensation plans linked to investment performance [1]. Additionally, the acquisition of E*TRADE also contributed to the rise in compensation expenses [1].\n\nThe relationship between these changes is further illustrated in the breakdown of recognized compensation expenses across different segments. For instance, the Wealth Management segment saw a significant increase in recognized compensation expenses from $760 million in 2019 to $1,000 million in 2020, reflecting the higher compensation and benefits [image1]. Similarly, the Institutional Securities segment's recognized compensation expenses rose from $1,878 million in 2019 to $2,119 million in 2020 [image1].\n\nIn summary, the increase in the effective tax rate and the decrease in net discrete tax benefits from 2019 to 2020 are directly related to the higher compensation expenses, which were influenced by various factors including higher revenues, discretionary incentives, and the E*TRADE acquisition [1]. ![{The Wealth Management segment's recognized compensation expenses increased significantly from 2019 to 2020.}](image1)"}

Additionally, the reserve for credit losses decreased, reflecting improved portfolio quality and a more optimistic macroeconomic outlook [11].\n\nFor Card Member receivables, there was a 23% increase from $43.7 billion to $53.6 billion [5]. This increase was also driven by higher spending, particularly in the U.S., where receivables grew by 26% [5].\n\nComparing these changes to network volumes and card member spending, the data shows a consistent trend of growth. Network volumes increased by 24% from $1,037.8 billion to $1,284.2 billion [8]. Billed business, which is a key indicator of card member spending, increased by 25% from $870.7 billion to $1,089.8 billion [8]. This aligns with the increases in Card Member loans and receivables, indicating that the growth in these areas is supported by higher transaction volumes and spending.\n\nTo visualize these trends, consider the following charts:\n\n![Card Member loans and receivables increased significantly from 2020 to 2021, reflecting higher spending and improved financial health of customers.](image1)\n\n![Network volumes and billed business also showed substantial growth, aligning with the increases in Card Member loans and receivables.](image8)\n\nIn summary, the key changes in Card Member loans and receivables from 2020 to 2021 reflect a strong recovery and growth in customer spending and financial health, which is consistent with the increases in network volumes and card member spending during the same period."}

This decrease in net income can be attributed to several factors, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on operating earnings, as well as specific strategic gains and charges. Specifically, the company experienced a reduction in operating income due to lower sales and increased costs associated with the pandemic [9].\n\nAdditionally, the comprehensive income for 2020 was $4,626.4 million, down from $6,152.2 million in 2019, a decrease of about 24.8%. Comprehensive income includes net income and other comprehensive income (loss), such as foreign currency translation adjustments and cash flow hedges. The decrease in comprehensive income was influenced by a significant loss in foreign currency translation adjustments, which went from a gain of $127.5 million in 2019 to a loss of $46.0 million in 2020 [image1]. Furthermore, there was a substantial loss from cash flow hedges, amounting to $123.3 million in 2020, compared to a gain of $20.4 million in 2019 [image1].\n\nThese financial metrics reflect the challenging economic environment faced by McDonald's in 2020, particularly due to the global pandemic, which impacted their operational performance and financial results.\n\nTo summarize, the net income and comprehensive income both decreased significantly from 2019 to 2020, primarily due to the adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on sales and operating earnings, as well as unfavorable foreign currency translations and cash flow hedges. ![Net income and comprehensive income decreased in 2020 due to the pandemic and foreign currency impacts](image1)"}

According to the data in image6:\n\n- **LatAm**: 10% Beverage, 90% Food/Snack\n- **Europe**: 55% Beverage, 45% Food/Snack\n- **AMESA**: 30% Beverage, 70% Food/Snack\n- **APAC**: 25% Beverage, 15% Food/Snack\n- **PepsiCo Overall**: 45% Beverage, 55% Food/Snack\n\n### Analysis\n1. **FLNA and QFNA**:\n   - Both divisions saw significant increases in net revenue and operating profit.\n   - FLNA and QFNA are primarily focused on food and snacks, which suggests that the demand for these products remained strong, contributing to their growth.\n\n2. **PBNA**:\n   - Despite an increase in net revenue, there was a decrease in operating profit.\n   - This could be due to increased operating costs, higher advertising and marketing expenses, and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to certain pre-tax charges [5].\n\n3. **LatAm**:\n   - There was a slight decrease in both net revenue and operating profit.\n   - Given the high focus on food and snacks, this decline might be attributed to economic challenges or competition in the region.\n\n4. **Europe**:\n   - Both net revenue and operating profit increased, indicating a positive trend.\n   - The balanced distribution between beverages and food/snacks might have helped stabilize performance.\n\n5. **AMESA and APAC**:\n   - Both regions saw increases in net revenue but decreases in operating profit.\n   - The higher proportion of food/snacks in AMESA and the lower proportion in APAC suggest that while revenue grew, profitability was affected by various factors, possibly including increased costs or market competition.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe changes in net revenue and operating profit across divisions from 2018 to 2020 are closely tied to the distribution of beverage and food/snack categories. Divisions with a stronger focus on food and snacks, such as FLNA and QFNA, generally performed better in terms of both revenue and profit. However, divisions like PBNA and AMESA, despite revenue growth, faced challenges that impacted their operating profit, likely due to increased costs and market conditions. ![Net Revenue and Operating Profit trends show mixed results across divisions, influenced by category focus and market conditions.](image2)"}

This substantial increase was primarily driven by the acquisition of Varian, which required a significant cash outlay [6].\n\nAdditionally, the company's cash flows from financing activities saw a dramatic shift, changing by €12,087 million to €11,839 million [5]. This positive change was largely due to the financing of the Varian acquisition, which included inflows from borrowings amounting to €10 billion and an additional financing of €850 million provided by the Siemens Group [9]. These inflows were partially offset by cash outflows from the repayment of matured loans and other financing activities [9].\n\nThe acquisition of Varian was a key factor in driving these changes, as it required significant capital outlays and financing arrangements to complete the deal [6][5]. The company also repurchased an increased number of treasury shares to fulfill share-based payment programs, further impacting its financial activities [10].\n\nTo summarize, the primary drivers of the changes in cash flows from financing and investing activities were the acquisition of Varian, significant borrowings, and the repurchase of treasury shares.\n\n![{Cash flows from investing activities increased by €12,228 million to €14,140 million, primarily due to the acquisition of Varian.}](image3) ![{Cash flows from financing activities changed by €12,087 million to €11,839 million, mainly due to the financing of the Varian acquisition.}](image5)"}

However, there were some minor changes within the categories of public shareholders:\n\n- **Mutual Funds and UTI:**\n  - Beginning: 93,357,668 shares (2.5%)\n  - End: 95,698,803 shares (2.6%)\n\n- **Financial Institutions / Banks:**\n  - Beginning: 712,342 shares (0.1%)\n  - End: 1,849,839 shares (0.1%)\n\n- **Insurance Companies:**\n  - Beginning: 196,172,807 shares (5.2%)\n  - End: 200,941,420 shares (5.4%)\n\n- **Foreign Institutional Investors and Foreign Portfolio Investors:**\n  - Beginning: 588,110,025 shares (15.7%)\n  - End: 589,641,314 shares (15.7%)\n\nThese changes indicate slight increases in the shareholdings of mutual funds, financial institutions, insurance companies, and foreign institutional investors. However, these changes are relatively small and do not significantly alter the overall public shareholding percentage. ![Minor changes in public shareholding categories](image7)\n\nIn conclusion, the key changes in the shareholding percentages and numbers over the fiscal year 2019-2020 are minimal. The promoters' shareholding remained constant at 72.02%, while the public shareholders' shareholding also remained unchanged at 28.0%. There were slight increases in the shareholdings of certain categories of public shareholders, but these did not affect the overall shareholding pattern significantly."}

According to the data provided:\n\n- In 2020, the net earnings attributable to P&G were $13,027 million.\n- In 2022, the net earnings attributable to P&G were $14,742 million.\n\nThis represents an increase of $1,715 million, or about 13.2%. The key factors contributing to this increase are outlined in the text:\n\n- **Earnings Before Income Taxes**: Earnings before income taxes increased by $0.4 billion, or 2%, to $18.0 billion, primarily due to a prior year loss on early-debt extinguishment and lower interest expense [10].\n- **Tax Rate Decrease**: The decrease in the effective income tax rate also contributed to the higher net earnings [10].\n- **Foreign Exchange Impacts**: Foreign exchange impacts reduced net earnings by approximately $274 million in fiscal 2022 due to a weakening of certain currencies against the U.S. dollar [10].\n\nNext, let's examine the changes in stock-based expenses. The data provided shows:\n\n- In 2020, the total stock-based expense was $558 million.\n- In 2022, the total stock-based expense was $528 million.\n\nThis represents a decrease of $30 million, or about 5.4%. The contributing factors for this change are:\n\n- **Stock Options Expense**: The stock options expense decreased from $219 million in 2021 to $271 million in 2022, but the overall trend shows a slight fluctuation [image1].\n- **RSUs and PSUs Expense**: The expense for RSUs and PSUs decreased from $261 million in 2021 to $257 million in 2022, indicating a minor reduction [image1].\n- **Income Tax Benefit**: The income tax benefit increased from $102 million in 2021 to $88 million in 2022, which can be attributed to the overall decrease in stock-based expenses [image1].\n\nAdditionally, the fair value and intrinsic value of options exercised and vested also provide context:\n\n- **Grant-Date Fair Value of Options Vested**: The grant-date fair value of options vested increased from $1,705 million in 2021 to $1,930 million in 2022, indicating a higher value of options vesting [image4].\n- **Intrinsic Value of Options Exercised**: The intrinsic value of options exercised increased from $236 million in 2021 to $1,886 million in 2022, suggesting a significant increase in the value of options exercised [image4].\n\nIn summary, the net earnings attributable to P&G increased by $1,715 million from 2020 to 2022, primarily due to a prior year loss on early-debt extinguishment, lower interest expense, and a decrease in the effective income tax rate, despite negative foreign exchange impacts. The stock-based expenses decreased by $30 million from 2020 to 2022, driven by a slight reduction in the expense for RSUs and PSUs and an increase in the income tax benefit. ![Net earnings and stock-based expenses data](image5)"}

According to the text quote [12], the Media segment, which includes NBCUniversal, saw a significant increase in revenue. Specifically, the Media segment revenue increased by 20.3% to $22.8 billion in 2021, compared to 2020. This increase was primarily due to the broadcast of the Tokyo Olympics, which contributed $1.8 billion in revenue. Excluding the Olympics, the revenue still increased by 11.0%, driven by growth in distribution, advertising, and other revenue, including the effects of COVID-19 in the prior year period.\n\nHowever, the specific revenue changes for the NBCUniversal Headquarters segment are not explicitly mentioned in the text. To get a clearer picture, we can refer to the image quotes. Image 1 provides a breakdown of revenue changes for a segment that appears to be related to the NBCUniversal Headquarters. The image shows that revenue increased from $248 million in 2020 to $461 million in 2021, representing an 86.1% increase. This significant jump aligns with the broader trends mentioned in the text, indicating strong growth in the segment.\n\nNext, let's look at the revenue changes for the Sky segment. The text quote [12] mentions that the Sky segment experienced an increase in expenses, primarily due to increases in direct network costs and other expenses. However, it does not provide specific revenue figures. To find this information, we can refer to Image 2, which provides detailed revenue and expense data for the Sky segment.\n\nAccording to Image 2, the Sky segment's total revenue increased from $18,594 million in 2020 to $20,285 million in 2021, representing a 9.1% increase. This growth was driven by increases in direct-to-consumer revenue (8.1%) and advertising revenue (24.6%), partially offset by a slight decrease in content revenue (2.3%).\n\nIn summary, the revenue for the NBCUniversal Headquarters segment increased by 86.1% from $248 million in 2020 to $461 million in 2021, while the revenue for the Sky segment increased by 9.1% from $18,594 million in 2020 to $20,285 million in 2021. ![Revenue increased significantly for both segments](image1) ![Sky segment also showed a notable increase in revenue](image2)"}

According to the data, the Systems external revenue decreased by 8.2% year to year as reported (8.7% adjusted for currency) [6]. This decline was driven primarily by decreases in Power Systems and Storage Systems, with partial offset from growth in IBM Z [6].\n\nThe pre-tax income for the Systems segment also saw a significant decline, decreasing by 36.0% year to year [8]. This decline was primarily due to higher workforce rebalancing charges, which had a 2.5-point impact on the pre-tax margin [8]. The Systems gross profit margin, however, increased by 2.8 points to 55.9%, driven by margin improvements in IBM Z and Power Systems [8].\n\nNow, let's examine the regional performance. The total revenue for IBM decreased by 4.6% year to year as reported (4.7% adjusted for currency and 3.5% excluding divested businesses and adjusted for currency) [7]. Breaking this down by region:\n\n- **Americas**: Revenue decreased by 6.0% year to year as reported (4.8% adjusted for currency) [2].\n- **Europe/Middle East/Africa (EMEA)**: Revenue decreased by 3.3% year to year as reported (4.7% adjusted for currency) [2].\n- **Asia Pacific**: Revenue decreased by 3.5% year to year as reported (4.3% adjusted for currency) [2].\n\nThese regional declines reflect a consistent trend of reduced revenue across all major regions, with the Americas experiencing the most significant drop.\n\nNext, we'll look at the Global Financing segment. The external revenue for Global Financing decreased by 23.4% year to year, with internal revenue also declining by 27.5% [6]. The pre-tax income for Global Financing decreased by 27.8% year to year, reflecting a decline in gross profit and an increase in expenses [6].\n\nTo summarize, the year-to-year percent changes in external revenue and pre-tax income for IBM in 2020 show a general trend of decline across different systems and regions. The Systems segment experienced a notable decrease in both external revenue and pre-tax income, while regional revenues also declined, with the Americas showing the most significant drop. The Global Financing segment also saw substantial decreases in both external revenue and pre-tax income.\n\n![{Systems external revenue and pre-tax income changes for 2020}](image7) [6]\n\nIn conclusion, the year-to-year percent changes in external revenue and pre-tax income for IBM in 2020 were predominantly negative, reflecting the challenging economic environment and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic."}

This adjustment is significant in reducing the gross profit and, consequently, the operating income. The image `![{Amortization of intangible assets significantly reduced gross profit and operating income in 2020}](image7)` shows that the amortization of intangible assets in 2020 resulted in a reduction of gross profit by USD 2,935 million and operating income by USD 2,999 million.\n\n- **Impairments**: The same text [2] mentions that cost of goods sold and research and development include impairment charges related to intangible assets. These impairments further reduce the operating income. The image `![{Impairments had a substantial negative impact on operating income in 2020}](image7)` indicates that impairments reduced operating income by USD 1,080 million.\n\nFor the year 2021, the adjustments are as follows:\n\n- **Amortization of Intangible Assets**: The text [12] states that the cost of goods sold includes the amortization of acquired rights to currently marketed products and other production-related intangible assets. This continues to be a significant factor in reducing the gross profit and operating income. The image `![{Amortization of intangible assets significantly reduced gross profit and operating income in 2021}](image4)` shows that the amortization of intangible assets in 2021 resulted in a reduction of gross profit by USD 3,655 million and operating income by USD 3,764 million.\n\n- **Impairments**: The same text [12] notes that cost of goods sold and research and development include impairment charges related to intangible assets. These impairments also contribute to the reduction in operating income. The image `![{Impairments had a substantial negative impact on operating income in 2021}](image4)` indicates that impairments reduced operating income by USD 653 million.\n\nIn summary, the adjustments in amortization of intangible assets and impairments significantly reduced the operating income from IFRS results to core results for both 2020 and 2021.

This suggests a higher level of other liabilities in 2020. ![{Other liabilities increased more in 2020 compared to 2019.}](image4)\n\nThese financial elements affect the company's financial statements in several ways:\n- **Derivative Financial Instruments**: The significant increase in positive fair values for certain forward contracts in 2020 suggests better hedging effectiveness and potentially lower financial risk. However, the increase in negative fair values for fair value hedges indicates higher volatility and potential future financial expenses.\n- **Cash Flow Changes**: The more significant decreases in trade receivables and trade payables in 2020 indicate improved cash flow management, with faster collections and payments. The increase in other liabilities suggests higher short-term obligations, which could impact liquidity.\n\nIn conclusion, the derivative financial instruments and cash flow changes in 2020 generally indicate improved financial performance and better cash flow management compared to 2019, although there are some areas of increased risk and higher short-term liabilities."}

According to the financial statements, SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 77 basis points compared to 2021 [9]. This decrease is attributed to leveraging increased sales and ceasing of incremental wages related to COVID-19, despite additional wage and benefits increases [9]. The overall trend indicates a more efficient management of SG&A expenses relative to net sales, which is a positive sign for the company's cost control measures.\n\nTo visualize this trend, consider the following chart:\n![SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 77 basis points compared to 2021](image7)\n\nNext, let's look at the Interest Income and Other, Net.

According to the provided data, the total actuarial gains and losses for fiscal year 2021 were -22 million euros, while for fiscal year 2020, they were 67 million euros [7]. Specifically, the changes in financial assumptions contributed to a decrease of 26 million euros in actuarial gains and losses in 2021, compared to an increase of 72 million euros in 2020 [7].\n\nTo further understand the impact, it is important to note that financial assumptions, such as discount rates, play a crucial role in the calculation of the defined benefit obligation (DBO). Changes in these assumptions can lead to significant variations in the DBO and, consequently, in the actuarial gains and losses. For instance, a decrease in the discount rate would increase the DBO, leading to higher actuarial losses [4].\n\nThe sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to changes in the discount rate is evident from the data showing the effect of a half-percentage-point change in the discount rate. As of September 30, 2021, a decrease in the discount rate by half a percentage point would increase the DBO by 242 million euros, while an increase would decrease the DBO by 271 million euros [image1]. This highlights the significant impact that changes in financial assumptions, particularly the discount rate, can have on the actuarial gains and losses.\n\nIn summary, the changes in financial assumptions led to a decrease in actuarial gains and losses by 26 million euros in fiscal year 2021, compared to an increase of 72 million euros in fiscal year 2020. ![Changes in financial assumptions significantly impacted actuarial gains and losses](image7)"}

Specifically:\n\n- **Retained Earnings**: Net income contributes to retained earnings, which increased significantly each year, reflecting the growing profitability of the company.\n- **Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss**: The negative OCI in 2019 and 2018 led to an accumulated other comprehensive loss, which was partially offset by the positive OCI in 2020.\n\nThe balance sheet data from the consolidated shareholders' equity statements also supports these trends. For instance, the retained earnings section shows a steady increase:\n\n- **2020**: $7,167,227$\n- **2019**: $5,804,448$\n- **2018**: $4,870,764$\n\nAdditionally, the accumulated other comprehensive loss decreased from 2019 to 2020, reflecting the positive OCI in 2020.\n\nIn conclusion, the trends in comprehensive income and its components over the fiscal years 2018 to 2020 show a significant improvement, particularly in 2020, driven by positive foreign currency translation and defined benefit plan adjustments. These trends positively impacted shareholders' equity, especially retained earnings and the reduction in accumulated other comprehensive loss. ![Comprehensive income and OCI trends are reflected in the financial statements and equity sections.](image5)"}

This increase can be attributed to various factors, such as higher unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, and other policyholder liabilities. ![{Total liabilities increased by $21,461 million from 2020 to 2021}](image4)\n\nNext, let's examine the changes in shareholders' equity:\n- **Total Shareholders' Equity in 2020**: $451,336 million\n- **Total Shareholders' Equity in 2021**: $514,930 million\n- **Change in Shareholders' Equity**: $514,930 million - $451,336 million = $63,594 million\n\nThis represents a significant increase in shareholders' equity by $63,594 million from 2020 to 2021. The primary driver of this increase is the net earnings and the adoption of new accounting standards, as well as other comprehensive income. ![{Shareholders' equity increased by $63,594 million from 2020 to 2021}](image6)\n\nNow, let's consider the net earnings and comprehensive income:\n- **Net Earnings in 2020**: $43,253 million\n- **Net Earnings in 2021**: $90,807 million\n- **Change in Net Earnings**: $90,807 million - $43,253 million = $47,554 million\n\nThe net earnings more than doubled from 2020 to 2021, contributing significantly to the increase in shareholders' equity. This substantial increase in net earnings can be attributed to various factors, including investment gains and operational improvements. ![{Net earnings increased by $47,554 million from 2020 to 2021}](image2)\n\n- **Comprehensive Income in 2020**: $44,272 million\n- **Comprehensive Income in 2021**: $91,041 million\n- **Change in Comprehensive Income**: $91,041 million - $44,272 million = $46,769 million\n\nComprehensive income also saw a significant increase, reflecting the positive impact of unrealized gains on investments and other comprehensive income items. ![{Comprehensive income increased by $46,769 million from 2020 to 2021}](image2)\n\nThe relationship between these changes and the overall financial health of Berkshire Hathaway is evident. The substantial increase in net earnings and comprehensive income directly contributed to the growth in shareholders' equity. This growth in equity, coupled with a moderate increase in liabilities, suggests that Berkshire Hathaway maintained a strong financial position, with a significant portion of the increase in equity coming from retained earnings and other comprehensive income items.\n\nIn conclusion, the increase in total liabilities by $21,461 million and the substantial increase in shareholders' equity by $63,594 million from 2020 to 2021 are closely tied to the significant rise in net earnings and comprehensive income, indicating robust financial performance and a strong capital base."}

This strategic approach is reflected in Toyota's commitment to stable and continuous dividend payments, with a target consolidated payout ratio of 30% [1].\n\nThe company's financial stability is evident in the consistent and increasing dividend payments over the years, as shown in the dividend per share data from 2017 to 2021, which increased from 210 yen to 240 yen, and the total amount of payment, which grew from 627.5 billion yen to 671.0 billion yen `![{Dividend payments have increased steadily over the years}](image1)`.\n\nToyota's response to climate scenarios is integrated into its broader financial and operational strategies. The company has set ambitious goals to reduce CO2 emissions and promote electrification, as outlined in the Toyota Environmental Challenge 2050. By 2030, Toyota aims to reduce CO2 emissions by 25% or more throughout the vehicle life cycle compared to 2013 levels, and by 2050, it plans to completely eliminate all CO2 emissions throughout the entire vehicle life cycle `![{Toyota aims to significantly reduce CO2 emissions by 2030 and eliminate them by 2050}](image4)`.\n\nTo achieve these goals, Toyota is investing heavily in next-generation growth, including environmental technologies and safety technologies, and utilizing retained earnings for these investments [1]. The company is also expanding its electrified vehicle lineup and has already achieved cumulative global sales of 16.98 million electrified vehicles, exceeding its 2020 target of 15 million units `![{Toyota has exceeded its 2020 target for electrified vehicle sales}](image4)`.\n\nIn the context of climate scenarios, Toyota recognizes the potential risks and opportunities associated with climate change. The company has identified and organized risks related to climate change, such as fines for failing to meet fuel efficiency regulations and increased production costs due to carbon taxes. However, it also sees opportunities, including increased sales of electrified vehicles and reduced energy costs through the adoption of energy-saving technologies `![{Toyota identifies both risks and opportunities in climate scenarios}](image5)`.\n\nBy maintaining a strong financial foundation and actively investing in electrification and environmental technologies, Toyota aims to ensure sustainable growth and enhance its corporate value, thereby benefiting its shareholders and contributing to a carbon-neutral society.

According to the data, the total amortisation and impairment loss for 2020 was DKK 1,446 million, while for 2019 it was DKK 1,469 million [4]. This indicates a slight decrease in total amortisation and impairment losses from 2019 to 2020.\n\nBreaking this down further, the total impairment losses for 2020 were DKK 350 million, compared to DKK 982 million in 2019 [10]. This significant reduction in impairment losses suggests that the company's management has become more optimistic about the recoverability of its assets or has made adjustments to its impairment testing methods.\n\nNow, let's examine the specific asset categories:\n\n### Intangible Assets\nFor intangible assets, the cost at the beginning of 2020 was DKK 9,830 million, and the additions during the year were DKK 16,302 million. Disposals and other adjustments reduced this to DKK 25,340 million by the end of the year [5]. The amortisation and impairment losses at the beginning of 2020 were DKK 395 million, and for the year, the company recognized DKK 1,096 million in amortisation and DKK 350 million in impairment losses [5]. After adjustments, the amortisation and impairment losses at the end of 2020 were DKK 4,683 million [5].\n\nThis results in a net carrying amount of intangible assets at the end of 2020 of DKK 20,657 million [5], compared to DKK 5,835 million at the end of 2019 [5]. The increase in the net carrying amount is primarily due to the significant additions and the lower impairment losses recognized in 2020.\n\n### Property, Plant, and Equipment\nFor property, plant, and equipment, the cost at the beginning of 2020 was DKK 30,260 million, with additions of DKK 741 million and disposals of DKK 119 million, leading to a cost at the end of the year of DKK 37,509 million [5]. The amortisation and impairment losses at the beginning of 2020 were DKK 11,528 million, and for the year, the company recognized DKK 1,859 million in amortisation and DKK 14 million in impairment losses [5]. After adjustments, the amortisation and impairment losses at the end of 2020 were DKK 12,936 million [5].\n\nThis results in a net carrying amount of property, plant, and equipment at the end of 2020 of DKK 24,573 million [5], compared to DKK 18,732 million at the end of 2019 [5]. The increase in the net carrying amount is due to the additional investments in these assets and the lower impairment losses recognized in 2020.\n\n### Impact on Net Carrying Amounts\nThe reduction in impairment losses from 2019 to 2020 has positively impacted the net carrying amounts of both intangible assets and property, plant, and equipment. For intangible assets, the net carrying amount increased from DKK 5,835 million in 2019 to DKK 20,657 million in 2020. For property, plant, and equipment, the net carrying amount increased from DKK 18,732 million in 2019 to DKK 24,573 million in 2020.\n\nIn conclusion, the depreciation and impairment losses have decreased from 2019 to 2020, leading to a significant increase in the net carrying amounts of both intangible assets and property, plant, and equipment. ![The net carrying amounts of intangible assets and property, plant, and equipment have increased significantly from 2019 to 2020 due to lower impairment losses and additional investments.](image5)"}

In 2020, premiums earned were $12,214 million, a decrease of $479 million (1.3%) compared to 2019 [10]. This indicates a positive trend in premiums earned from 2020 to 2021, reversing the slight decline observed from 2019 to 2020.\n\nNext, let's examine the net investment income. The net investment income in 2021 was $5,649 million, a decrease of $5.0 billion (5.0%) compared to 2020 [7]. In 2020, net investment income was $5,949 million, a decrease of $9.9% compared to 2019 [7].

This divergence can be attributed to factors such as lower interest rates and the impact of the pandemic on investment returns.\n\n![{Premiums earned increased from 2019 to 2021, while net investment income decreased consistently over the same period.}](image4)\n\nIn conclusion, premiums earned showed a positive trend from 2019 to 2021, while net investment income experienced a consistent decline during the same period."}

This represents a significant increase of about 28.7% in total revenue.\n\nRegarding unearned revenue, the beginning balance for fiscal year 2020 was $8,564 million, and by the end of the fiscal year, it was $10,662 million [5]. For fiscal year 2019, the beginning balance was $6,995 million, and it ended at $8,564 million [5]. This indicates an increase in unearned revenue of about 24.5% from the end of fiscal year 2019 to the end of fiscal year 2020.\n\nThe increase in both total revenue and unearned revenue can be attributed to several factors. One significant factor is the acquisition of Tableau in August 2019, which has been the company's largest acquisition to date [10]. The acquisition contributed to the growth in revenue, particularly in the Salesforce Platform and Other segment, which saw a substantial increase from $2,854 million in fiscal 2019 to $4,473 million in fiscal 2020 [8].\n\nAdditionally, the remaining performance obligation, which includes unearned revenue and unbilled amounts, also increased. This is influenced by factors such as seasonality, the timing of renewals, and the timing of delivery of software licenses [1]. The unearned revenue balance, which represents amounts invoiced in advance of revenue recognition, is influenced by factors like seasonality, the compounding effects of renewals, and invoice timing [11].\n\nThe significant increase in total revenue and unearned revenue suggests strong customer demand and successful execution of the company's growth strategies, including strategic acquisitions. However, it is important to note that the unearned revenue balance is subject to future economic risks, including potential bankruptcies, regulatory changes, and market factors [1].\n\nIn conclusion, the total revenue increased from $13,282 million in fiscal year 2019 to $17,098 million in fiscal year 2020, and the unearned revenue increased from $8,564 million to $10,662 million during the same period, indicating robust growth and customer commitment. ![Unearned revenue increased significantly from fiscal year 2019 to 2020](image5)"}

The net change in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash for 2020 was $5,361 million, a substantial improvement from the net decrease of $3,290 million in 2019 [3]. This positive shift can be attributed to several key factors.\n\nFirstly, the net cash provided by operating activities increased by $3,426 million in 2020, driven by an increase in cash provided by receivables of $4,795 million, primarily due to sales of receivables, including financing receivables of $3,076 million [3][9]. Additionally, payroll tax and value-added tax payment deferrals and exemptions of approximately $600 million due to the U.S. CARES Act and other non-U.S. government assistance programs related to COVID-19 also contributed positively [9].\n\nHowever, these gains were partially offset by performance-related declines within net income and a net increase in cash payments for income taxes of $162 million, primarily driven by withholding tax on intercompany dividends in the second quarter [9].\n\nIn terms of investing activities, the net cash used in investing activities decreased by $23,908 million, primarily due to a decrease in net cash used for acquisitions of $32,294 million, reflecting the absence of the large Red Hat acquisition that occurred in the prior year [7]. This decrease was partially offset by a decrease in cash provided by net non-operating finance receivables of $6,245 million, driven by the wind down of the OEM IT commercial financing operations [1][7].\n\nFinancing activities, on the other hand, were a net use of cash of $9,721 million in 2020, compared to a net source of cash of $9,042 million in 2019. The year-to-year change of $18,763 million was driven by a decrease in net cash provided by debt transactions of $19,998 million, primarily due to a higher level of net additions in the prior year to fund the Red Hat acquisition [6][12]. This was partially offset by a decrease in cash used for gross common share repurchases of $1,361 million [6].\n\n![{The net change in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash improved significantly in 2020 compared to 2019.}](image3)\n\nIn summary, the net change in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash for IBM in 2020 was positively impacted by increased cash provided by operating activities and a significant reduction in cash used for investing activities, despite the net use of cash in financing activities."}

This decline is further illustrated in the financial data showing a decrease in total revenues from $21,365 million in 2019 to $19,208 million in 2020, a reduction of $2,157 million [9].\n\n![Total revenues decreased significantly in 2020 due to the pandemic](image9)\n\nThe decrease in revenues was more pronounced in the International Operated Markets, where sales declined significantly due to temporary restaurant closures and limited operations, especially in key markets like the U.K., France, Germany, Italy, and Spain [3]. This is evident from the data showing a 19% decrease in revenues from $11,398 million in 2019 to $9,462 million in 2020 for the International Operated Markets segment [9].\n\n![Revenues in the International Operated Markets segment saw a significant decline](image9)\n\nDespite these challenges, the U.S. market showed some resilience, with positive sales performance, although this was more than offset by the support provided for marketing and incentives to franchisees to accelerate recovery and drive growth [1]. The U.S. segment's revenues decreased by 2% from $7,843 million in 2019 to $7,656 million in 2020 [9].\n\nIn terms of restaurant margins, total restaurant margins decreased by 13% in 2020, reflecting the sales declines in the International Operated Markets segment as a result of the pandemic [8]. The U.S. segment's margins were affected by additional COVID-19 expenses, such as employee-related costs, personal protective equipment, and signage, which increased operating costs [10].\n\n![Total restaurant margins decreased due to sales declines in international markets](image3)\n\nThe International Operated Markets segment saw a significant decrease in margins, dropping from $1,210 million in 2019 to $1,093 million in 2020, a decrease of 10% [3]. This decline was driven by the aforementioned operational challenges and the higher fixed costs associated with franchised margins [7].\n\nOverall, the main contributing factors to the changes in total revenues and restaurant margins in 2020 were the widespread impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly the temporary closures and limited operations in international markets, and the increased costs associated with safety measures and marketing support to aid recovery [1, 3, 8, 10]."}

According to the financial data, Comcast's total revenue increased from $103,564 million in 2020 to $116,385 million in 2021, a significant 12.4% increase [4]. This growth can be attributed to the performance of each segment:\n\n- **Cable Communications**: The Cable Communications segment saw a substantial increase in revenue, primarily driven by growth in broadband and wireless services. Broadband revenue increased from $20,599 million in 2020 to $22,979 million in 2021, a 11.6% increase. Wireless revenue also surged from $1,574 million in 2020 to $2,380 million in 2021, a 51.2% increase [1]. ![{Revenue and Adjusted EBITDA for Cable Communications showing strong growth in broadband and wireless services}](image1)\n\n- **NBCUniversal**: NBCUniversal's revenue also contributed to the overall growth. The increase in revenue was driven by the Media, Studios, and Theme Parks segments. The opening of Universal Beijing Resort in September 2021 added to the revenue, despite the initial pre-opening costs [9].\n\n- **Sky**: Sky's revenue increased, but the impact was less pronounced compared to the other segments. The increase was primarily due to higher direct network costs and other expenses, partially offset by decreases in programming and production costs [7].\n\nNext, let's examine the operating expenses. The total operating costs and expenses for Comcast increased from $86,071 million in 2020 to $95,568 million in 2021, a 11.0% increase [4]. The main contributors to this increase were:\n\n- **Cable Communications**: The Cable Communications segment experienced an increase in operating costs and expenses, particularly in programming, technical and product support, and franchise and other regulatory fees. Programming expenses rose from $13,498 million in 2020 to $14,285 million in 2021, a 5.8% increase. Technical and product support costs increased from $8,022 million in 2020 to $8,566 million in 2021, a 6.8% increase [1]. ![{Operating costs and expenses for Cable Communications showing increases in programming and technical support}](image1)\n\n- **NBCUniversal**: NBCUniversal's operating expenses increased due to higher costs in the Media, Studios, and Theme Parks segments. The opening of Universal Beijing Resort also contributed to the rise in expenses, especially during the pre-opening phase [9].\n\n- **Sky**: Sky's operating expenses increased primarily due to higher direct network costs and other expenses, although there were decreases in programming and production costs [7].\n\n- **Corporate and Other**: Corporate and Other expenses decreased, mainly due to severance charges in the prior year [7].\n\nIn summary, the main contributors to the change in Comcast's consolidated revenue and operating expenses from 2020 to 2021 were the strong performance and increased costs in the Cable Communications and NBCUniversal segments, with Sky contributing to a lesser extent. The increase in revenue was driven by growth in broadband and wireless services, while the rise in operating expenses was primarily due to higher programming, technical support, and regulatory fees in the Cable Communications segment, and pre-opening costs for Universal Beijing Resort in the NBCUniversal segment."}

This improvement can be attributed to various factors, including the allocation of certain funding costs to global businesses starting from January 2020, which reduced the Corporate Centre's expenses [5]. Additionally, the operating expenses for the Corporate Centre decreased from $755 million in 2019 to $482 million in 2020, a reduction of $273 million, or 36%, contributing to the overall improvement in net operating income [1].\n\n![{Corporate Centre's net operating income improved significantly from a loss of $654 million in 2019 to a loss of $262 million in 2020.}](image8)\n\nNext, let's examine the Global Banking and Markets segment. The net operating income for this segment increased from $14,869 million in 2019 to $15,303 million in 2020, a modest increase of $434 million, or 3%. This growth can be attributed to the strong performance in Global Markets, particularly in FICC (Fixed Income, Currencies, and Commodities), where revenue increased by $1,541 million, or 33% [12]. However, this segment also experienced a significant increase in expected credit losses and other credit impairment charges, which rose from $153 million in 2019 to $1,209 million in 2020, an increase of $1,056 million, or over 200%. Despite this, the profit before tax for the Global Banking and Markets segment remained relatively stable, decreasing slightly from $5,172 million in 2019 to $4,830 million in 2020, a reduction of $342 million, or 7% [1].\n\n![{Global Banking and Markets segment's net operating income increased from $14,869 million in 2019 to $15,303 million in 2020, while profit before tax decreased slightly from $5,172 million in 2019 to $4,830 million in 2020.}](image7)\n\nIn summary, the Corporate Centre saw a significant reduction in its net operating loss, driven by cost reductions and reallocations, while the Global Banking and Markets segment experienced a modest increase in net operating income despite a substantial rise in credit losses, leading to a slight decrease in profit before tax.

According to the data, the total stock-based compensation expense for 2022 was $528 million, with $271 million attributed to stock options and $257 million to RSUs and PSUs [image1]. For 2021, the total expense was $540 million, with $219 million for stock options and $261 million for RSUs and PSUs [image1]. In 2020, the total expense was $558 million, with $249 million for stock options and $309 million for RSUs and PSUs [image1].\n\nThese figures show a slight decrease in total stock-based compensation expenses from 2020 to 2022. The decrease is primarily driven by a reduction in the expense for RSUs and PSUs, which dropped from $309 million in 2020 to $257 million in 2022. This trend suggests that Procter & Gamble may have adjusted its stock-based compensation strategy, possibly to manage costs or align with performance metrics.\n\nNext, let's examine the net earnings per share (EPS) over the same period. The data shows that the diluted net earnings per share increased from $5.13 in 2020 to $5.50 in 2021 and further to $5.81 in 2022 [image3]. This consistent increase in EPS indicates strong financial performance and effective management of earnings. The increase in EPS can be attributed to several factors, including higher net earnings, a reduction in shares outstanding, and the prior year's loss on early debt extinguishment [9].\n\nThe increase in net earnings from $13.103 billion in 2020 to $14.793 billion in 2022, despite foreign exchange impacts, underscores the company's robust financial health and ability to navigate external economic challenges [9]. Additionally, the reduction in shares outstanding, likely due to share repurchases, has contributed to the higher EPS [10].\n\nIn summary, the decrease in stock-based compensation expenses and the consistent increase in net earnings per share reflect Procter & Gamble's strategic financial management and strong performance over the years 2020 to 2022. ![Procter & Gamble's financial trends show a decrease in stock-based compensation expenses and an increase in net earnings per share](image1)"}

This increase in net income contributed positively to comprehensive income.\n   - **2020**: Net income was $3,135 million, which was lower than 2019 but higher than the comprehensive income for 2020.\n   - **2019**: Net income was $6,759 million, which was lower than 2021 but higher than 2020.\n\n2. **Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)**:\n   - **2021**: Other comprehensive income (loss) was $(50) million, a small loss.\n   - **2020**: Other comprehensive income (loss) was $(158) million, a larger loss.\n   - **2019**: Other comprehensive income (loss) was $(140) million, a moderate loss.\n\n3. **Components of Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)**:\n   - **Net Unrealized Debt Securities Gains (Losses)**:\n     - **2021**: $(42) million.\n     - **2020**: $32 million.\n     - **2019**: $41 million.\n   - **Foreign Currency Translation Adjustments**:\n     - **2021**: $(163) million.\n     - **2020**: $(40) million.\n     - **2019**: $(56) million.\n   - **Net Unrealized Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits**:\n     - **2021**: $155 million.\n     - **2020**: $(150) million.\n     - **2019**: $(125) million.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe changes in shareholders' equity, particularly the increase in retained earnings and the decrease in additional paid-in capital, had a positive impact on the comprehensive income of the company from 2019 to 2021. The significant increase in net income in 2021, despite a small other comprehensive loss, led to a substantial comprehensive income of $8,010 million in 2021, compared to $2,977 million in 2020 and $6,619 million in 2019. The foreign currency translation adjustments and net unrealized gains on debt securities also played a role, but their impact was relatively minor compared to the net income.\n\n![{The chart shows the comprehensive income and its components for the years 2019 to 2021, highlighting the significant increase in net income in 2021.}](image5)"}

According to the financial statements, the total equity attributable to shareholders of Siemens Healthineers AG increased significantly from €12,498 million in 2020 to €16,321 million in 2021. This represents an increase of €3,823 million. The total equity, including non-controlling interests, also increased from €12,511 million in 2020 to €16,339 million in 2021, a difference of €3,828 million. This substantial increase in equity is primarily attributed to the capital increase in March 2021, which added €53 million to issued capital and €2,284 million to capital reserves [7].\n\n![{Total equity increased from €12,498 million in 2020 to €16,321 million in 2021.}](image4)\n\nNext, let's examine the cash flows from operating activities. The cash generated from operating activities in 2021 was €2,933 million, compared to €1,928 million in 2020. This represents an increase of €1,005 million. The significant rise in cash flows from operating activities can be attributed to the payment of the profit transfer by Siemens Healthcare GmbH and the profit transferred during the current year from Siemens Healthineers Beteiligungen GmbH & Co.

The Total Stockholders' Equity for Amazon.com, Inc. can be found in the balance sheet, which is summarized in the provided financial statements.\n\nFrom the balance sheet data, we can see the following values for Total Stockholders' Equity:\n\n- As of December 31, 2015: $19,285 million\n- As of December 31, 2016: $27,709 million\n- As of December 31, 2017: $34,616 million\n\nThis indicates a significant increase in Total Stockholders' Equity over the three-year period. To understand the contributing factors, we need to look at the components of stockholders' equity and the activities that affected these components.\n\n### Contributing Factors\n\n1. **Net Income**: The company reported net income for each of the three years:\n   - 2015: $596 million\n   - 2016: $2,371 million\n   - 2017: $3,033 million\n\n   The net income is a primary driver of retained earnings, which is a component of stockholders' equity. The increase in net income from 2015 to 2017 contributed significantly to the growth in Total Stockholders' Equity.\n\n2. **Stock-Based Compensation**: The company issued stock-based compensation, which increases Additional Paid-In Capital:\n   - 2015: $2,119 million\n   - 2016: $2,975 million\n   - 2017: $4,215 million\n\n   The increase in stock-based compensation from 2015 to 2017 added to the Additional Paid-In Capital, thus increasing Total Stockholders' Equity.\n\n3. **Exercise of Common Stock Options**: The exercise of common stock options also contributes to Additional Paid-In Capital:\n   - 2015: $829 million\n   - 2016: $3,033 million\n   - 2017: $501 million\n\n   These exercises increased the number of shares outstanding and added to the Additional Paid-In Capital.\n\n4. **Issuance of Common Stock for Acquisition Activity**: The company issued common stock for acquisitions, which also affects Additional Paid-In Capital:\n   - 2015: $2,962 million\n   - 2016: $19,285 million\n   - 2017: $27,709 million\n\n   The acquisition of Whole Foods Market in 2017, for example, involved the issuance of common stock, which further increased Additional Paid-In Capital.\n\n5. **Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)**: The company experienced other comprehensive income (loss) which impacts Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss):\n   - 2015: $(212) million\n   - 2016: $3,033 million\n   - 2017: $501 million\n\n   Positive other comprehensive income in 2016 and 2017 contributed to the increase in Total Stockholders' Equity.\n\n6. **Retained Earnings**: The retained earnings, which are the cumulative net income not distributed as dividends, also grew significantly:\n   - 2015: $4,916 million\n   - 2016: $8,636 million\n   - 2017: $19,285 million\n\n   The increase in retained earnings from 2015 to 2017 reflects the company's strong profitability and reinvestment of earnings.\n\n### Visual Representation\n\nThe changes in stockholders' equity can also be visualized through the balance sheet entries:\n\n![{Total Stockholders' Equity increased from $19,285 million in 2015 to $34,616 million in 2017, reflecting significant growth in net income, stock-based compensation, and other comprehensive income.}](image2)\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe Total Stockholders' Equity of Amazon.com, Inc. increased from $19,285 million in 2015 to $34,616 million in 2017, driven by factors such as net income, stock-based compensation, exercise of common stock options, issuance of common stock for acquisitions, and other comprehensive income."}

According to the financial data provided, the operating income in 2020 was $169 million, a decrease from $215 million in 2019 [11]. This decline can be attributed to several factors. The transportation services revenue decreased by $53 million, largely due to the ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the crude and refined products operating environment and related prices in 2020, as well as lower rates on the Zydeco committed contracts in 2020 compared to 2019 [3]. Additionally, the impact from planned turnaround activities, storms, and production shut-ins was higher in 2020 than in 2019 [3].\n\nHowever, these decreases were partially offset by new volumes brought online at NaKika and Odyssey, as well as achieving regulatory approval for an increase in tariffs on Delta in 2020 [3]. Furthermore, the company saw increases in terminaling services revenue by $63 million, which contributed to mitigating the overall decline in operating income [11].\n\nRegarding cash from investing activities, the company reported a significant change from a negative $87 million in 2019 to a positive $64 million in 2020 [image6]. This improvement is primarily due to the reduction in capital expenditures from $51 million in 2019 to $27 million in 2020, reflecting the completion of major projects such as the Houma tank expansion and directional drill projects for Zydeco [2]. Additionally, the return of investment in 2020 was $91 million, compared to $66 million in 2019, further contributing to the positive cash flow from investing activities [image6].\n\nIn summary, the decrease in operating income from 2019 to 2020 was primarily due to the adverse impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and operational challenges, while the improvement in cash from investing activities was driven by reduced capital expenditures and higher returns on investments. ![Operating income decreased and cash from investing activities improved from 2019 to 2020](image6)"}

This increase was driven by higher copper prices and increased production volumes. The underlying EBITDA also saw a significant rise from US$3,535 million to US$6,483 million, indicating improved profitability [1]. However, the unit cost per pound remained relatively stable at US$1.00, down slightly from US$1.01 in FY2020, reflecting efficient operations and cost management despite challenges such as reduced material movement and COVID-19 impacts [2].\n\n### WAIO Financial Metrics\nWAIO's financial performance was even more robust. Revenue increased from US$20,663 million in FY2020 to US$34,337 million in FY2021, a 66% increase. This was primarily due to higher iron ore prices, which rose from US$77.36 per wet metric ton (wmt) in FY2020 to US$130.56 per wmt in FY2021 [10]. The underlying EBITDA surged from US$14,508 million to US$26,270 million, highlighting the significant improvement in profitability [12]. The cost per tonne increased from US$12.63 to US$14.82, but this was outweighed by the higher revenues and EBITDA [11].\n\n### Production Metrics\n#### Escondida\nEscondida's production metrics showed a slight decrease. Sales volume in terms of thousand tonnes (kt) dropped from 1,164 kt in FY2020 to 1,066 kt in FY2021, and in million pounds (Mlb) from 2,567 Mlb to 2,350 Mlb. This decline can be attributed to the need to catch up on mine development due to reduced material movement in FY2021 and the ongoing impact of COVID-19 [3].\n\n#### WAIO\nWAIO, on the other hand, saw a modest increase in production. Total iron ore production increased from 248 Mt in FY2020 to 254 Mt in FY2021, a 2.4% increase. This was driven by record production at Jimblebar and Mining Area C, despite weather impacts and labor shortages due to COVID-19 [11].\n\n### Impact of Commodity Price Changes\nThe impact of commodity price changes was significant for both operations. For Escondida, the average realized price for copper increased from US$2.50 per pound in FY2020 to US$3.81 per pound in FY2021, contributing to the higher revenue and EBITDA [9]. For WAIO, the average realized price for iron ore more than doubled, from US$77.36 per wmt to US$130.56 per wmt, which was the primary driver of the substantial increase in revenue and EBITDA [10].\n\n### Conclusion\nBoth Escondida and WAIO experienced significant financial improvements in FY2021, primarily due to higher commodity prices. While Escondida faced some production challenges, its financial metrics still showed strong growth. WAIO's production and financial performance were particularly robust, driven by record production and significantly higher iron ore prices.\n\n![{Escondida's financial metrics show a significant increase in revenue and EBITDA in FY2021}](image1)\n![{WAIO's financial metrics demonstrate a substantial increase in revenue and EBITDA, driven by higher iron ore prices}](image6)\n\nIn summary, the financial and production metrics of both Escondida and WAIO improved significantly in FY2021, with commodity price changes playing a crucial role in their enhanced performance."}

According to the text [5], the table below presents information regarding the Company’s financial assets and financial liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis and indicate the level within the hierarchy reflecting the valuation techniques utilized to determine such fair value. The relevant data for Level 2 assets can be found in the image:\n\n![Level 2 assets for 2022 and 2021](image6)\n\nFrom the image, we can see:\n- In 2022, the Level 2 assets amount to $561.\n- In 2021, the Level 2 assets amount to $408.\n\nNext, let's look at the long-term debt. The text [11] provides the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion:\n- At the end of 2022, the fair value of long-term debt was approximately $6,033.\n- At the end of 2021, the fair value of long-term debt was approximately $7,692.\n\nFor a more detailed breakdown, we can refer to the image:\n\n![Long-term debt for 2022 and 2021](image1)\n\nFrom the image, we can see:\n- In 2022, the total long-term debt (including the current portion) is $6,590.\n- In 2021, the total long-term debt (including the current portion) is $7,531.\n\n### Analysis of Differences\n\n#### Level 2 Assets\n- **2022**: $561\n- **2021**: $408\n\nThe increase in Level 2 assets from 2021 to 2022 is $153. This suggests that the company has either acquired more financial assets measured at fair value using Level 2 inputs or the fair value of existing assets has increased.\n\n#### Long-Term Debt\n- **2022**: $6,590\n- **2021**: $7,531\n\nThe decrease in long-term debt from 2021 to 2022 is $941. This reduction could be due to several factors, such as the repayment of debt, refinancing, or changes in business requirements and market conditions. Specifically, the text [3] mentions that the Company repaid the $2.300\\% Senior Notes prior to maturity on December 1, 2021, which likely contributed to the reduction in long-term debt.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe Level 2 assets increased by $153 from 2021 to 2022, indicating a growth in financial assets measured at fair value using Level 2 inputs. The long-term debt decreased by $941 from 2021 to 2022, reflecting the company's efforts to reduce its debt burden, possibly through the early repayment of certain senior notes."}

This significant rise can be attributed to several key factors.\n\nFirstly, the increase in free cash flow was primarily driven by higher operating income adjusted for non-cash items and other adjustments [3]. Specifically, the net cash flows from operating activities from continuing operations increased from USD 13.6 billion in 2020 to USD 15.1 billion in 2021 [5]. This increase was mainly due to higher net income adjusted for non-cash items and other adjustments, including divestment gains, and lower payments out of provisions, particularly those related to legal matters in the prior year [5].\n\nAdditionally, the company's cash and cash equivalents increased by USD 2.7 billion, and marketable securities, commodities, time deposits, and derivative financial instruments increased by USD 14.0 billion. This growth was largely driven by the cash generated through operating activities and the proceeds of USD 20.7 billion from the divestment of the investment in Roche, partially offset by the dividend payment, the purchase of treasury shares, and the repayment of a financial debt [7].\n\nHowever, these positive contributions were somewhat offset by a USD 650 million upfront payment to in-license tislelizumab from an affiliate of BeiGene, Ltd. [3].\n\nTo summarize, the main contributing factors to the increase in free cash flow from 2020 to 2021 were higher operating income, lower payments out of provisions, and significant cash inflows from divestments and operating activities, despite the upfront payment for tislelizumab.\n\n![{Free cash flow increased due to higher operating income and lower payments out of provisions}](image5)\n\nThe free cash flow increased by 14% from USD 11.7 billion in 2020 to USD 13.3 billion in 2021."}

This sensitivity highlights the importance of the discount rate in determining the actuarial gains and losses.\n\n![Changes in financial assumptions and total actuarial gains and losses](image1)\n\nTherefore, the changes in financial assumptions and discount rates significantly affected the total actuarial gains and losses, leading to a net loss in 2021 and a net gain in 2020."}

However, the specific figures for foreign income before taxes are not directly provided in the text. Instead, we can refer to the image quote `image1` for these details.\n\n![{Foreign income before taxes increased from $1,493 million in 2020 to $1,493 million in 2021, while it was $439 million in 2019.}](image1)\n\nFrom `image1`, we observe the following:\n- Foreign income before taxes in 2019 was $439 million.\n- Foreign income before taxes in 2020 was $715 million.\n- Foreign income before taxes in 2021 was $1,493 million.\n\nThis indicates a significant increase in foreign income before taxes from 2019 to 2021.\n\nNext, let's look at the foreign tax provision.

The increase in foreign income before taxes suggests that the company is expanding its operations or increasing profitability in foreign markets. However, the decrease in the foreign tax provision indicates that the company is either benefiting from favorable tax laws, tax incentives, or effective tax planning strategies.\n\nGiven these trends, the company might continue to focus on expanding its foreign operations to capitalize on the lower tax burden. Additionally, the company may need to monitor and adapt to changes in international tax laws to maintain its favorable tax position and optimize its financial performance.\n\nIn conclusion, the foreign income before taxes increased significantly from 2019 to 2021, while the foreign tax provision decreased, suggesting that the company is effectively managing its tax liabilities in foreign jurisdictions, which could positively influence its financial strategy."}

This decrease can be attributed to several factors:\n- **Sale of WFAM**: On November 1, 2021, Wells Fargo completed the sale of WFAM, which led to a significant outflow of assets. Specifically, the balance of WFAM assets under management dropped by $587.1 billion after the sale, reflecting the substantial impact of this transaction [4].\n- **Market Impact**: Despite the sale, there was a positive market impact of $11.6 billion, which slightly offset the outflows [4].\n\n### Changes in Available-for-Sale Securities\nThe available-for-sale (AFS) debt securities also experienced notable changes during the same period:\n- **Amortized Cost**: The amortized cost of AFS debt securities decreased from $215,533 million at the end of 2020 to $175,463 million at the end of 2021, a reduction of $40,070 million [3].\n- **Unrealized Gains**: The net unrealized gains on AFS debt securities decreased from $4,859 million at the end of 2020 to $1,781 million at the end of 2021, a reduction of $3,078 million [3].\n- **Fair Value**: The fair value of AFS debt securities decreased from $220,392 million at the end of 2020 to $177,244 million at the end of 2021, a reduction of $43,148 million [3].\n\nThese changes in AFS securities can be attributed to various factors, including:\n- **Higher Interest Rates**: The decrease in net unrealized gains is primarily driven by higher interest rates, which negatively impacted the value of these securities [1].\n- **Portfolio Rebalancing**: The company continued to purchase AFS and held-to-maturity (HTM) debt securities, but the overall portfolio size decreased due to sales and other strategic actions [4].\n\n### Visual Representation\nTo better understand these changes, consider the following visual representations:\n\n- **WFAM Assets Under Management**:\n  ![{WFAM assets under management decreased from $603.0 billion to $587.1 billion due to the sale of WFAM on November 1, 2021.}](image4)\n\n- **Available-for-Sale Securities**:\n  ![{The amortized cost, net unrealized gains, and fair value of AFS debt securities all decreased significantly from December 31, 2020, to December 31, 2021.}](image3)\n\nIn summary, the total WFAM assets under management decreased by $15.9 billion, primarily due to the sale of WFAM, while the AFS debt securities saw a significant reduction in amortized cost, unrealized gains, and fair value, largely influenced by higher interest rates and portfolio rebalancing."}

This increase in total assets can be attributed to several factors, including the purchase of additional available-for-sale (AFS) and held-to-maturity (HTM) debt securities, which increased by 64,427 million dollars in 2021 [4]. The company also transferred 56 billion dollars of AFS debt securities to HTM debt securities to reposition the overall portfolio for capital management purposes [8].\n\nAdditionally, the sale of WFAM on November 1, 2021, had a substantial impact on the company's asset management strategy. The total WFAM assets under management decreased by 587.1 billion dollars from the beginning to the end of 2021, primarily due to the sale of WFAM, which resulted in outflows of 96.8 billion dollars [8]. This strategic decision to divest WFAM aligns with Wells Fargo's broader goal of streamlining operations and focusing on core banking activities.\n\nThese changes indicate that Wells Fargo is actively managing its balance sheet to optimize capital usage and enhance shareholder value. By increasing its holdings in debt securities and divesting non-core assets like WFAM, the company is positioning itself to better manage interest rate risk and improve liquidity, while also reducing operational complexity.\n\n![{Wells Fargo's total assets and WFAM AUM changes from 2020 to 2021 reflect strategic capital reallocation and divestiture of non-core assets.}](image8)\n\nIn conclusion, the changes in total assets and WFAM assets under management from 2020 to 2021 demonstrate Wells Fargo's strategic focus on optimizing its capital structure and enhancing operational efficiency."}

According to the data provided, the discount rates for Germany and the United States are as follows:\n\n- **Germany**:\n  - 2021: 1.7%\n  - 2020: 1.5%\n\n- **United States**:\n  - 2021: 27%\n  - 2020: 24%\n\nThese rates are significantly different between the two countries, reflecting the varying economic conditions and market yields. Higher discount rates in the U.S. suggest a higher return expectation on investments, which can reduce the present value of future obligations. In contrast, the lower discount rates in Germany indicate a more conservative investment environment, leading to a higher present value of future obligations. ![Discount rates for Germany and the U.S.](image1)\n\nNext, we consider the compensation increase and pension progression assumptions, which are critical for estimating future benefit costs. The data for these assumptions are as follows:\n\n- **Compensation Increase**:\n  - **Germany**: Not specified in the provided data.\n  - **United Kingdom** (as a proxy for European assumptions):\n    - 2021: 3.0%\n    - 2020: 2.6%\n\n- **Pension Progression**:\n  - **Germany**:\n    - 2021: 1.5%\n    - 2020: 1.5%\n  - **United Kingdom**:\n    - 2021: 3.0%\n    - 2020: 2.6%\n\nWhile the data for Germany is not explicitly provided, the U.K. data can serve as a reasonable proxy for European trends. The U.S. does not provide specific figures for these assumptions, but the higher compensation increase and pension progression in the U.K. suggest a more generous benefit structure compared to Germany. ![Compensation and pension progression for the U.K.](image8)\n\nAdditionally, the funded status and the impact of actuarial assumptions on the defined benefit obligation (DBO) are important. The DBO for Germany and the U.S. can be influenced by changes in actuarial assumptions, as shown in the following data:\n\n- **Germany**:\n  - 2021: 2,033 million €\n  - 2020: 2,007 million €\n\n- **United States**:\n  - 2021: 986 million €\n  - 2020: 1,050 million €\n\nThe DBO for Germany has remained relatively stable, while the U.S. has seen a slight decrease. This could be attributed to the higher discount rates in the U.S., which reduce the present value of future obligations. ![Defined benefit obligation for Germany and the U.S.](image3)\n\nFinally, the impact of a change in the discount rate by half a percentage point is significant. For both Germany and the U.S., a decrease in the discount rate would increase the DBO, while an increase would decrease it. The sensitivity analysis shows:\n\n- **Germany**:\n  - Increase in DBO due to a 0.5% decrease in discount rate: 242 million €\n  - Decrease in DBO due to a 0.5% increase in discount rate: 271 million €\n\n- **United States**:\n  - Increase in DBO due to a 0.5% decrease in discount rate: 227 million €\n  - Decrease in DBO due to a 0.5% increase in discount rate: 266 million €\n\nThis sensitivity highlights the importance of accurate discount rate assumptions in managing the financial health of defined benefit plans. ![Effect of discount rate changes on DBO](image4)\n\nIn conclusion, the actuarial assumptions and financial indicators affecting the defined benefit plans in Germany and the United States differ significantly, with higher discount rates and more generous benefit structures in the U.S. leading to a lower present value of future obligations compared to Germany."}

This slight increase masks significant variations within individual segments.\n\nFor instance, in the **Global Markets** segment, the adjusted net operating income saw a substantial increase of $1,562 million or 27%, driven by strong performance in Foreign Exchange, Rates, and Credit [image7]. The **Global Banking** segment, however, experienced a minor decrease in revenue by $71 million or 2%, primarily due to lower real estate and structured finance fee income [12].\n\nThe **Global Trade and Receivables Finance (GTRF)** segment saw a decline in revenue by $82 million or 4%, reflecting lower lending balances and fees, especially in Hong Kong and the UK, due to reduced global trade volumes impacted by the Covid-19 outbreak [7].\n\nThe **Markets products, Insurance and Investments and Other** segment also faced a revenue drop of $427 million or 21%, influenced by lower interest rates on capital held, a fall in revenue from Insurance, Investments, and Markets products, and reduced revaluation gains on shares [6].\n\nIn terms of profit before tax, the overall adjusted profit before tax for the bank was significantly lower at $4.83 billion, down by $342 million or 7% compared to 2019 [image1]. This decline was largely attributed to higher expected credit losses (ECL) and the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic [9].\n\nThe **Global Markets** segment managed to increase its profit before tax, but the **Global Banking** segment's profit before tax decreased slightly. The **GTRF** segment also saw a reduction in profit before tax, aligning with the revenue trends [image10].\n\nNotably, the **Central Treasury** segment reported a net operating income of $156 million, a decrease from $179 million in 2019 [image6]. This segment's performance was influenced by various factors, including the allocation of funding costs and the impact of hyperinflation in Argentina [3].\n\nOverall, while some segments like Global Markets showed resilience and growth, others such as Global Trade and Receivables Finance and Markets products, Insurance, and Investments and Other experienced significant declines, reflecting the broader economic challenges posed by the pandemic.\n\nThe adjusted net operating income and profit before tax across different banking segments in 2020 were heavily influenced by the global economic conditions, particularly the impact of the Covid-19 outbreak. ![Overall financial performance metrics for 2020 compared to 2019](image1)"}

According to the data provided, total loans increased slightly from $887,637 million to $895,394 million, representing a modest increase of $7,757 million [4]. This slight increase in total loans suggests that the financial entity maintained a relatively stable loan portfolio during the period.\n\nBreaking down the loan categories, commercial loans saw a more significant increase from $478,417 million to $513,120 million, an increase of $34,703 million [4]. This growth in commercial loans indicates a focus on expanding business lending, possibly driven by higher loan demand and increased originations [8]. On the other hand, consumer loans decreased from $409,220 million to $382,274 million, a reduction of $26,946 million [4]. The decline in consumer loans is primarily attributed to a decrease in the residential mortgage – first lien portfolio due to loan paydowns and the transfer of $17.8 billion of first lien mortgage loans to loans held for sale [8].\n\nRegarding deposits, the total deposits increased from $1,404,381 million to $1,482,479 million, a rise of $78,098 million [3]. This overall increase in deposits suggests a successful strategy in attracting and retaining customer deposits. However, the composition of deposits changed significantly. Noninterest-bearing demand deposits grew from $467,068 million to $527,748 million, an increase of $60,680 million, indicating a strong performance in attracting low-cost deposits [3]. Interest-bearing demand deposits and savings deposits also saw modest increases, but the most notable change was in time deposits, which decreased from $49,775 million to $29,461 million, a reduction of $20,314 million [3]. This decrease in time deposits aligns with the entity's actions to manage under the asset cap, leading to declines in time deposits, such as brokered CDs and interest-bearing deposits in non-U.S. offices [10].\n\nThe strategic implications of these changes suggest that the financial entity focused on expanding its commercial lending while managing consumer lending more conservatively. Additionally, the entity successfully attracted more noninterest-bearing deposits, which are typically less costly and more stable, while reducing reliance on higher-cost time deposits. These actions indicate a balanced approach to managing liquidity and capital, optimizing the cost of funds, and aligning with regulatory constraints.\n\nIn conclusion, the financial entity's strategy appears to be centered on expanding commercial lending, maintaining a stable but slightly reduced consumer loan portfolio, and optimizing deposit composition to enhance liquidity and reduce funding costs. ![Total deposits increased, with a significant shift towards noninterest-bearing deposits and a reduction in time deposits](image3)"}

This represents a decrease of $40 million over the two-year period. For Mars, the net income in 2018 was $87 million, and in 2020, it was $163 million, indicating an increase of $76 million.\n\n![{Net income for Amberjack decreased from 2018 to 2020, while Mars saw an increase.}](image4)\n\nTo delve deeper into the factors influencing these changes, we can look at the total revenues and total operating expenses for both entities.\n\n### Amberjack\n- **2018**: Total revenues were $282 million, and total operating expenses were $104 million.\n- **2020**: Total revenues were $280 million, and total operating expenses were $78 million.\n\nThe slight decrease in total revenues from 2018 to 2020 is offset by a significant reduction in operating expenses, which dropped from $104 million to $78 million. Despite this, the net income still decreased, suggesting that other factors, such as non-operating expenses or changes in tax rates, might have played a role.\n\n### Mars\n- **2018**: Total revenues were $157 million, and total operating expenses were $41 million.\n- **2020**: Total revenues were $259 million, and total operating expenses were $97 million.\n\nMars experienced a substantial increase in total revenues, rising from $157 million to $259 million.

According to the definitions and usage of Adjusted EBITDA [3][4], it is a non-GAAP financial measure that helps in evaluating the underlying trends and operational strength of the company's businesses.\n\nFrom 2019 to 2021, the Adjusted EBITDA for Comcast Corporation showed significant fluctuations. The total Adjusted EBITDA for the company was $34,708 million in 2021, $30,826 million in 2020, and $34,258 million in 2019 [4]. This indicates a slight increase from 2020 to 2021 but a decrease from 2019 to 2020.\n\n### Segment Analysis\n\n#### Cable Communications\nThe Cable Communications segment, which is the largest contributor to capital expenditures [5], saw an increase in Adjusted EBITDA. The capital expenditures in this segment were primarily driven by increased spending on scalable infrastructure and line extensions, which can contribute to higher operational efficiency and revenue growth [3].\n\n#### NBCUniversal\nNBCUniversal's expenses increased in 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to higher costs in the Media, Studios, and Theme Parks segments [11]. However, the revenue also increased, reflecting an overall market recovery from the impacts of COVID-19 [12]. The increased programming and production costs, along with higher direct network costs, contributed to the higher expenses [11].\n\n#### Sky\nThe Sky segment experienced an increase in expenses, mainly due to higher direct network costs and other expenses, partially offset by decreases in programming and production costs [11]. The launch of Sky Glass and XClass TV also contributed to increased costs in 2021 [7].\n\n### Financial Metrics and Cash Flow\nThe changes in operating assets and liabilities in 2021 compared to 2020 were influenced by the timing of amortization and related payments for film and television costs, increased production spending, and the impacts of the Tokyo Olympics [6]. Despite these changes, the company maintained strong cash flow, with net cash provided by operating activities increasing from $24,737 million in 2020 to $29,146 million in 2021 [2].\n\n### Visual Representation\nThe following image provides a visual representation of the changes in revenue, operating costs, and Adjusted EBITDA from 2019 to 2021, highlighting the trends and fluctuations:\n\n![{Revenue and Adjusted EBITDA trends from 2019 to 2021, showing increases and decreases in various segments.}](image1)\n\n### Conclusion\nThe Adjusted EBITDA for Comcast Corporation showed a slight increase from 2020 to 2021, driven by market recovery, increased revenue, and strategic investments in scalable infrastructure and new products.

Specifically, FICC revenue grew by $1,541 million (33%), Foreign Exchange by $702 million (26%), and Credit by $556 million (90%) [9].\n\nHowever, some segments saw declines, such as Securities Services, which decreased by $234 million (12%), and Global Banking, which saw a minor decrease of $71 million (2%) [9]. Additionally, Global Liquidity and Cash Management revenue fell by $701 million (26%) [9].\n\nFor the Corporate Centre, the adjusted revenue improved significantly, increasing by $392 million (60%) to $262 million in 2020 [7]. This improvement was partly due to better performance in Legacy Portfolios, which saw a $94 million increase, and Other, which increased by $321 million [7].\n\nDespite these positive revenue trends, the Corporate Centre faced challenges in managing expenses, which increased by $273 million (36%) [8].

According to the data, interest and other investment income decreased by 44.4% in 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to lower income from short-term investments and fixed maturity securities [12]. This significant drop in income is reflected in the asset allocation, where the carrying value of fixed maturity securities decreased from $20,317 million in 2020 to $16,386 million in 2021, as shown in the image [image6]. Additionally, the decline in short-term interest rates over the second half of 2019 and throughout 2020, which continued into 2021, resulted in significantly lower interest income [12].\n\nMoreover, the company's substantial holdings of cash, cash equivalents, and U.S. Treasury Bills, which amounted to $90,688 million in 2021, also played a role. Despite the large cash balance, the low interest rate environment meant that these holdings generated less income [image6]. This is further supported by the fact that the company maintained a focus on liquidity and safety over yield, as they believed it was paramount to hold ample liquidity [12].\n\nIn summary, the decline in net investment income from 2020 to 2021 was primarily driven by lower income from short-term investments and fixed maturity securities, exacerbated by the low interest rate environment. The asset allocations reflect a shift towards maintaining liquidity and safety, with a significant portion of assets held in cash and cash equivalents. ![Lower income from short-term investments and fixed maturity securities](image6)"}

Specifically:\n- Net income increased by $10 million.\n- Comprehensive income increased by $11 million.\n\nNow, let's delve into the main contributing factors based on the financial statements:\n\n1. **Revenue and Costs**:\n   - **Revenue**: Total revenue in 2020 was $481 million, compared to $503 million in 2019 and $525 million in 2018 [4]. Despite a slight decrease in total revenue, the partnership managed to maintain and slightly increase its net income.\n   - **Costs and Expenses**: Total costs and expenses in 2020 were $312 million, compared to $288 million in 2019 and $313 million in 2018 [4]. The reduction in costs in 2019 and subsequent increase in 2020 indicate cost management efforts.\n\n2. **Income from Equity Method Investments**:\n   - Income from equity method investments increased significantly from $373 million in 2019 to $417 million in 2020 [4]. This increase is primarily due to the acquisition of additional interests in Explorer and Colonial in June 2019, as well as the acquisition of an interest in Mattox in April 2020 [11].\n\n3. **Dividend Income**:\n   - Dividend income from other investments decreased from $67 million in 2019 to $14 million in 2020 [4]. This decrease is attributed to the change in accounting for Explorer and Colonial from other investments to equity method investments following the acquisition of additional interests in these entities in June 2019 [11].\n\n4. **Other Income**:\n   - Other income increased from $36 million in 2019 to $40 million in 2020 [4]. This increase is related to higher distributions from Poseidon in 2020 [11].\n\n5. **Interest Expense**:\n   - Interest expense remained relatively stable, decreasing slightly from $96 million in 2019 to $93 million in 2020 [4].\n\n6. **General Partner and IDR Restructuring**:\n   - On April 1, 2020, the partnership eliminated all of the IDRs and converted the 2% economic general partner interest into a non-economic general partner interest. This restructuring resulted in the cancellation of 4,761,012 general partner units and the IDRs, which no longer participate in distributions of cash from the partnership [8].\n\n7. **Cash Flows**:\n   - Cash flows from operating activities increased from $597 million in 2019 to $650 million in 2020 [2]. This increase in cash flow from operations contributed to the overall financial health and stability of the partnership.\n\nIn summary, the net income and comprehensive income attributable to the partnership increased slightly from 2018 to 2020, primarily due to the increase in income from equity method investments, effective cost management, and the positive impact of the general partner and IDR restructuring. ![Net income and comprehensive income increased from 2018 to 2020, driven by higher equity method investment income and cost management.](image3)"}

According to the financial data, the Adjusted EBIT for 2021 was €3,142 million, a 40% increase from the €2,248 million reported in 2020 [4]. This increase is attributed to the strong performance across various segments, particularly the Diagnostics segment, which benefited from high demand for rapid COVID-19 antigen tests [4].\n\nThe Varian segment itself contributed significantly to this growth. From April 15 to September 30, 2021, Varian achieved adjusted revenue of €1,300 million, with an adjusted EBIT of €221 million and an adjusted EBIT margin of 17.0%, which is at the upper end of the expected range [5, 12]. This strong performance from Varian directly contributed to the overall increase in Siemens Healthineers' Adjusted EBIT [12].\n\nIn terms of net assets, the acquisition of Varian led to a notable increase in net debt. As of September 30, 2021, the net debt increased to €11,901 million from €1,484 million in 2020 [1, ![{Net debt increased significantly in 2021}(image1)]].

For instance, current receivables from the Siemens Group from financing activities decreased by €2,677 million, reflecting the use of invested funds for the payment of the purchase price [3, ![{Decrease in current receivables from the Siemens Group}(image1)]]. On the other hand, the liabilities to the Siemens Group from financing activities increased by €8,725 million, further emphasizing the financial impact of the Varian acquisition [3, 11, ![{Increase in liabilities to the Siemens Group from financing activities}(image1)]].\n\nOverall, the acquisition of Varian played a crucial role in driving the financial performance of Siemens Healthineers in 2021, contributing to a significant increase in Adjusted EBIT and a substantial rise in net debt."}

According to the data, the change in sales prices contributed positively to the Underlying EBITDA, reflecting higher average realized prices for key commodities such as iron ore, copper, nickel, oil, natural gas, and thermal coal. This positive impact was partially offset by lower average realized prices for metallurgical coal and LNG.\n\nSpecifically, the net price impact from changes in sales prices was $16,965 million, which significantly boosted the Underlying EBITDA. However, this was somewhat mitigated by an increase in price-linked costs of $870 million, primarily due to higher royalties from increased iron ore prices and higher third-party concentrate purchase costs from higher nickel prices.\n\nOn the other hand, changes in operating cash costs had a minimal impact, contributing only a slight decrease of $34 million. This was largely due to higher inventory drawdowns at Olympic Dam and Nickel West, which were offset by strong cost performance and cost reduction initiatives across BHP's assets. Additionally, there was a gain from the optimized outcome of renegotiated power contracts at Escondida and Spence, further stabilizing the operating cash costs.\n\nThese factors collectively contributed to a substantial increase in BHP's Underlying EBITDA from $22,071 million in FY2020 to $37,379 million in FY2021, reflecting a robust financial performance and effective cost management. ![Changes in sales prices and operating cash costs significantly impacted BHP's Underlying EBITDA from FY2020 to FY2021](image7)\n\nIn summary, the significant increase in sales prices, particularly for iron ore and copper, was the primary driver of the rise in BHP's Underlying EBITDA, while changes in operating cash costs had a minimal negative impact."}

This decrease is primarily due to the settlement with Apple and its contract manufacturers in 2019, which contributed significantly to the unallocated revenues in that year [5]. In contrast, the net assets acquired during the acquisition of NUVIA in 2021 amounted to $1,264 million, which is a substantial but different type of financial activity.\n\nThe increases in unallocated expenses, particularly in research and development and selling, general, and administrative expenses, indicate a shift in focus towards innovation and operational efficiency. The net assets acquired during the NUVIA acquisition, while significant, do not directly correlate with the changes in unallocated revenues and expenses but rather represent a strategic investment in technology and talent.\n\nIn conclusion, the changes in unallocated revenues and expenses from 2019 to 2021 reflect a shift in the company's financial activities, with a significant decrease in unallocated revenues and an increase in expenses, particularly in research and development. The net assets acquired during the NUVIA acquisition in 2021, totaling $1,264 million, represent a strategic investment in technology and talent, which is distinct from the changes in unallocated revenues and expenses. ![Significant decrease in unallocated revenues from 2019 to 2021](image6)"}

The company reported a net cash provided by operating activities of $10.613 billion, which represents a 10% increase from the $9.649 billion reported in 2019 [7]. This increase in operating cash flow was primarily driven by lower net cash tax payments and reduced pre-tax pension and retiree medical plan contributions [7].\n\nHowever, PepsiCo's investing activities in 2020 were more substantial compared to 2019, with net cash used for investing activities amounting to $11.619 billion, a significant rise from the $6.437 billion in 2019 [9]. This increase was largely due to acquisitions, including Rockstar for $3.85 billion, Pioneer Foods for $1.2 billion, and Be & Cheery for $0.7 billion, as well as higher net capital spending of $4.2 billion [9].\n\nDespite the increased investment, PepsiCo managed to maintain a positive free cash flow of $6.428 billion in 2020, marking a 15% increase from the $5.587 billion in 2019 [6]. This improvement in free cash flow can be attributed to the robust operating cash flow and relatively stable capital spending [6].\n\nRegarding contractual commitments, PepsiCo's total contractual commitments as of 2020 amounted to $66.321 billion, with significant portions due in the near term. Specifically, $3.448 billion is due in 2022, $11.920 billion in 2023-2024, and $10.395 billion in 2025-2026 [image2]. The largest component of these commitments is long-term debt obligations, totaling $40.330 billion, followed by interest on debt obligations of $15.988 billion [image2]. This indicates a substantial financial burden in the coming years, which PepsiCo will need to manage carefully.\n\nIn comparison to 2019, PepsiCo's contractual commitments have increased, reflecting the company's strategic investments and financial activities.

This decline can be attributed to several factors, including an increase in expected credit losses (ECL) and other credit impairment charges, which rose by $1,056 million to $1,209 million in 2020 [2]. Additionally, the division faced challenges from lower global interest rates, which impacted net interest income [7].\n\nThe decrease in profit before tax was also influenced by the broader economic impact of the Covid-19 outbreak, which led to higher expected credit losses and a reduction in reported revenue [11].

According to the financial statements, the net income for the years 2018, 2019, and 2020 are as follows:\n- 2018: $5,017 million\n- 2019: $5,580 million\n- 2020: $5,595 million\n\nFrom this, we can see that net income increased from 2018 to 2019 and remained relatively stable from 2019 to 2020. This slight increase in net income from 2019 to 2020 can be attributed to various factors, including operational efficiency and cost management [4].\n\nNext, let's examine the retained earnings. Retained earnings are calculated by adding net income to the beginning balance of retained earnings and then subtracting dividends and other distributions. The changes in retained earnings can be seen in the following table:\n\n| Year | Net Income | Dividends Declared and Paid | Stock Repurchases | Stock Compensation | Other Comprehensive Income (Loss), Net of Taxes | Balance, December 31 |\n|------|------------|-----------------------------|-------------------|--------------------|------------------------------------------------|---------------------|\n| 2018 | $5,017     | $(2.63)                     | $(1,131)          | $(36)              | $(922)                                         | $34,495             |\n| 2019 | $5,580     | $(3.21)                     | $(1,920)          | $(32)              | $(78)                                          | $39,898             |\n| 2020 | $5,595     | $(3.72)                     | $(2,600)          | $(42)              | $(35)                                          | $45,443             |\n\nFrom the table, we can observe the following:\n- The net income increased from 2018 to 2019 and remained stable from 2019 to 2020.\n- Dividends declared and paid increased each year, reflecting the company's commitment to returning value to shareholders.\n- Stock repurchases also increased significantly from 2018 to 2020, which can reduce the number of outstanding shares and potentially increase earnings per share.\n- Stock compensation and other comprehensive income (loss) remained relatively stable but had minor impacts on the overall retained earnings.\n\nThe significant factors affecting these changes include:\n- **Operational Performance**: The company maintained strong operational performance, leading to stable net income.\n- **Dividends and Stock Repurchases**: The company consistently returned value to shareholders through dividends and stock repurchases, which affected the retained earnings.\n- **Stock Compensation and Other Comprehensive Income**: These items had minor impacts but contributed to the overall financial health of the company.\n\nIn conclusion, the company's retained earnings and net income showed a positive trend from 2018 to 2020, driven by strong operational performance and strategic financial management, including dividends and stock repurchases. ![Retained earnings and net income trends from 2018 to 2020](image4)"}

According to the data [4], the total number of individuals served by UnitedHealthcare decreased slightly from 49,150,000 in 2019 to 48,435,000 in 2020, a decline of 715,000 individuals, or about 1.5% [image4].\n\nBreaking this down by segment:\n\n1. **Commercial Segment**:\n   - **Risk-based**: The number of individuals served decreased from 8,575,000 in 2019 to 7,910,000 in 2020, a reduction of 665,000 individuals, or about 8% [image4].\n   - **Fee-based**: The number of individuals served decreased from 19,185,000 in 2019 to 18,310,000 in 2020, a reduction of 875,000 individuals, or about 5% [image4].\n   - **Total Commercial**: The combined total for the commercial segment decreased from 27,760,000 in 2019 to 26,220,000 in 2020, a reduction of 1,540,000 individuals, or about 6% [image4].\n\n2. **Public and Senior Segment**:\n   - **Medicare Advantage**: The number of individuals served increased from 5,270,000 in 2019 to 5,710,000 in 2020, an increase of 440,000 individuals, or about 8% [image4].\n   - **Medicaid**: The number of individuals served increased from 5,900,000 in 2019 to 6,620,000 in 2020, an increase of 720,000 individuals, or about 12% [image4].\n   - **Medicare Supplement (Standardized)**: The number of individuals served decreased slightly from 4,500,000 in 2019 to 4,460,000 in 2020, a reduction of 40,000 individuals, or about 1% [image4].\n   - **Total Public and Senior**: The combined total for the public and senior segment increased from 15,670,000 in 2019 to 16,790,000 in 2020, an increase of 1,120,000 individuals, or about 7% [image4].\n\n3. **Global Segment**:\n   - The number of individuals served decreased from 5,720,000 in 2019 to 5,425,000 in 2020, a reduction of 295,000 individuals, or about 5% [image4].\n\n### Causes of These Changes\n\n1. **Commercial Segment Decline**:\n   - **Economic Impact**: The decline in the commercial segment can be attributed to increased unemployment and economic-driven employment attrition due to the COVID-19 pandemic [5]. Many employers reduced their workforce or closed down, leading to a decrease in the number of individuals with employer-sponsored health insurance.\n   - **Voluntary Customer Assistance Programs**: UnitedHealthcare provided voluntary customer assistance programs, such as co-pay waivers and premium forgiveness, which may have led to some individuals opting out of coverage [1].\n\n2. **Public and Senior Segment Growth**:\n   - **Medicare Advantage**: The growth in Medicare Advantage can be attributed to the aging population and the increasing popularity of these plans due to their comprehensive coverage and additional benefits [5].\n   - **Medicaid**: The increase in Medicaid enrollment is likely due to states easing redetermination requirements and the economic downturn causing more individuals to qualify for Medicaid [5].\n\n3. **Global Segment Decline**:\n   - **Economic Impact**: Similar to the commercial segment, the global segment saw a decline due to increased unemployment and underwriting discipline [5].\n\nIn conclusion, the number of individuals served by UnitedHealthcare decreased in the commercial and global segments primarily due to economic impacts and voluntary customer assistance programs, while it increased in the public and senior segments due to the aging population and relaxed eligibility criteria for Medicaid. ![The number of individuals served by UnitedHealthcare decreased in the commercial and global segments and increased in the public and senior segments in 2020.](image4)"}

For **Other Retiree Benefits**, the discount rate increased from 3.2% in 2021 to 5.0% in 2022, and the expected return on plan assets remained constant at 8.4% [2].\n\nThese changes in discount rates and expected returns can significantly impact the net amount recognized. A lower discount rate for Pension Benefits means that the present value of future obligations will increase, leading to a higher liability. Conversely, a higher discount rate for Other Retiree Benefits will decrease the present value of future obligations, reducing the liability.\n\nThe expected return on plan assets is a key factor in determining the net periodic benefit cost. A lower expected return for Pension Benefits means that the company will recognize a higher expense, which can further increase the net amount recognized in the balance sheet. For Other Retiree Benefits, the unchanged expected return suggests no immediate impact on the expense, but the higher discount rate could reduce the overall net amount recognized.\n\nTo visualize these changes, let's look at the net amount recognized for both types of benefits over the years:\n\nFor **Pension Benefits**, the net amount recognized improved from a deficit of $5,428 million in 2021 to a deficit of $2,435 million in 2022 [8]. This improvement can be attributed to the higher discount rate, which reduces the present value of future obligations, despite the lower expected return on plan assets.\n\nFor **Other Retiree Benefits**, the net amount recognized increased from a surplus of $2,238 million in 2021 to a surplus of $3,819 million in 2022 [8]. The higher discount rate for Other Retiree Benefits significantly reduced the present value of future obligations, leading to a larger surplus.\n\n![Discount rates and expected returns for 2021 and 2022](image2)\n\nIn summary, the changes in discount rates and expected returns for Pension Benefits and Other Retiree Benefits from 2021 to 2022 had a significant impact on the net amount recognized, with the net amount for Pension Benefits improving due to the higher discount rate, and the net amount for Other Retiree Benefits increasing due to the higher discount rate and unchanged expected return."}

According to the data, NBCUniversal's total revenue increased significantly in 2021 compared to 2020, with a 26.1% increase to $34.3 billion [10]. This growth can be attributed to several factors, including the recovery from the impacts of COVID-19 and the launch of new initiatives like Peacock.\n\nPeacock, NBCUniversal's streaming service, saw a substantial increase in revenue from $118 million in 2020 to $778 million in 2021 [6]. However, this increase in revenue was accompanied by higher operating costs and expenses, totaling $2.5 billion in 2021 compared to $781 million in 2020 [6]. Despite these costs, the overall revenue increase contributed positively to the financial performance.\n\nAdditionally, the revenue trends across different segments of NBCUniversal provide further insight. The Media segment saw a 20.3% increase in revenue to $22.8 billion, driven by increases in distribution, advertising, and other revenue [6]. The Studios segment also experienced a 16.2% increase in revenue to $9.4 billion, primarily due to content licensing, theatrical revenue, and home entertainment [6].\n\nHowever, the Adjusted EBITDA for NBCUniversal increased only by 6.0% to $5.7 billion [10], indicating that while revenue grew, the profit margins did not expand proportionally. This can be attributed to the increased investments in content and strategic initiatives, such as Peacock, which required significant upfront costs.\n\nCustomer relationships also played a crucial role. The total customer relationships for NBCUniversal remained relatively stable, with a slight decrease of 198,000 from 2020 to 2021 [5]. This stability suggests that NBCUniversal maintained its customer base despite the challenges posed by the pandemic and competitive pressures.\n\nIn summary, the financial performance of NBCUniversal from 2019 to 2021 was positively impacted by strong revenue growth, particularly in the Media and Studios segments, and the launch of Peacock. However, the increased operating costs and expenses, especially for Peacock, limited the growth in Adjusted EBITDA. ![Revenue and EBITDA trends show significant changes from 2019 to 2021](image3) The overall financial performance was robust, but the company faced challenges in maintaining profit margins due to strategic investments."}

The committee follows a structured and rigorous approach to maintain a diverse pipeline of talent and ensure the Board remains fit-for-purpose. This involves continuous assessment and planning, considering factors such as Board diversity, size, tenure, and the necessary skills and experience [1].\n\nThe process begins with the adoption of a structured and rigorous approach to Board succession planning, which considers both unforeseen departures and the orderly replacement of current Board members. The Nomination and Governance Committee ensures that succession plans are continuously updated to reflect the changing external environment and BHP’s evolving circumstances [image1].\n\nStep 1 involves the Nomination and Governance Committee overseeing the development of a diverse pipeline of talent. This includes considering Board diversity, size, tenure, and the skills, experience, and attributes needed to effectively govern and manage risk within BHP [image1].\n\nStep 2 focuses on the continuous nature of the planning process. For Non-executive Directors, planning is based on a nine-year tenure as a guide, ensuring a balance between experience and fresh perspectives [image1].\n\nStep 3 involves preparing a role description for new appointments, which includes the criteria and attributes described in the Board Governance Document and section 2.1.7 [image1].\n\nStep 4 entails selecting and appointing an external search firm to conduct a global search based on the Board's criteria [image1].\n\nStep 5 involves the Nomination and Governance Committee shortlisting candidates and conducting initial interviews. Selected candidates then meet with each Board member before the Board decides on the appointment [image1].\n\nStep 6 is the recommendation phase, where the Nomination and Governance Committee recommends the Board appoint the preferred candidate [image1].\n\nStep 7 involves conducting appropriate background and reference checks with the assistance of external consultants [image1].\n\nStep 8 concludes with the adoption of a letter of appointment that outlines the terms of Non-executive Directors' appointments, including expectations for independence, participation, time commitment, and continuous improvement [image1].\n\nAdditionally, the Nomination and Governance Committee oversees and monitors the continuous improvement activities and training and development programs for Non-executive Directors. These programs cover various business matters, including environmental, social, and governance issues, and provide updates on BHP’s assets, commodities, geographies, and markets [8].\n\nIn summary, BHP's Nomination and Governance Committee ensures effective board succession planning and director development through a structured, continuous, and rigorous process involving multiple steps, from talent pipeline development to candidate selection and ongoing training and development. ![The Nomination and Governance Committee oversees a structured and rigorous process for board succession planning and director development](image1)"}

This means that the goodwill is tied to the future cash flows of the acquired companies, which supports its carrying amount at year-end [3].\n\nThe balance sheet details show the changes in goodwill over the periods in question. Let's look at the specific entries:\n\n### Goodwill Changes\n\n- **Balance at 01/02/2020**: 378\n- **Acquisitions**: 6\n- **Disposals**: (42)\n- **Transfers**: (4)\n- **Foreign exchange translation differences**: (9)\n- **Balance at 31/01/2021**: 329\n- **Acquisitions**: 51\n- **Disposals**: (54)\n- **Transfers**: (4)\n- **Foreign exchange translation differences**: (4)\n- **Balance at 31/01/2022**: 290\n\nFrom the balance sheet data, we can see that the goodwill decreased from 378 at the beginning of 2020 to 290 at the end of 2021. This decrease is primarily due to disposals and foreign exchange translation differences.\n\n### Key Differences\n\n1. **Acquisitions and Disposals**:\n   - In 2021, there were significant acquisitions (51) and disposals (54), leading to a net reduction in goodwill.\n   - In 2020, there were fewer acquisitions (6) and more disposals (42).\n\n2. **Foreign Exchange Translation Differences**:\n   - The foreign exchange translation differences also contributed to the decrease in goodwill, with a loss of 9 in 2020 and 4 in 2021.\n\n3. **Transfers**:\n   - Transfers also played a role, with a total of 4 in both years, but the impact was minimal compared to acquisitions and disposals.\n\n### Visual Representation\n\n![Goodwill balance changes over the years](image1)\nThis image shows the detailed breakdown of the goodwill balance, including acquisitions, disposals, transfers, and foreign exchange translation differences, which aligns with the textual data provided.\n\nIn conclusion, the key differences in goodwill components between 2021 and 2020 are primarily driven by the higher number of disposals and the impact of foreign exchange translation differences, leading to a net reduction in goodwill."}

This turnaround was driven by higher realizations and the absence of impairments and write-offs that occurred in 2020 [4]. Specifically, the U.S. Upstream segment reported earnings of $7,319 million in 2021, compared to a loss of $1,608 million in 2020, while the International Upstream segment reported earnings of $8,499 million in 2021, compared to a loss of $825 million in 2020 ![Upstream segment earnings improved significantly in 2021](image1).\n\nIn terms of total assets, the Upstream segment had assets totaling $184,412 million in 2021, a slight decrease from $191,309 million in 2020.

Specifically, the revenue grew from $2,854 million in 2019 to $4,473 million in 2020, representing a 57% increase [2].\n\nThis substantial revenue growth can be attributed to several factors, including the increasing acceptance of Salesforce's services, a focus on marketing these services internationally, and the investment in additional international resources [10]. Additionally, the acquisition of Tableau in August 2019 contributed to the revenue increase in this category [10].\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the cost of revenues for the 'Salesforce Platform and Other' category also increased. The total cost of revenues for this segment rose from $2,604 million in 2019 to $3,198 million in 2020, an increase of $594 million [4]. This increase in costs is primarily due to higher employee-related costs, stock-based expenses, and service delivery costs, particularly those associated with expanding data center capacity [5].\n\nDespite the rise in costs, the gross margin for the 'Salesforce Platform and Other' category improved. The gross profit for this segment in 2020 was $1,275 million, compared to $250 million in 2019, reflecting a significant improvement in profitability [4]. This improvement suggests that the revenue growth outpaced the cost increases, contributing positively to the overall financial performance of Salesforce.\n\nIn summary, the significant revenue growth in the 'Salesforce Platform and Other' category, coupled with controlled cost increases, had a positive impact on the overall financial performance of Salesforce, enhancing its gross margins and profitability. ![Revenue and cost of revenues for 'Salesforce Platform and Other' category increased significantly from 2019 to 2020, improving gross margins.](image2)"}

According to the data in the third image, which summarizes the lease costs:\n\n- **Operating Lease Costs**:\n  - 2021: $2,199 million\n  - 2020: $2,551 million\n  - **Change**: A decrease of $352 million\n\n- **Finance Lease Costs**:\n  - 2021: $66 million\n  - 2020: $45 million\n  - **Change**: An increase of $21 million\n\nThis indicates that the company experienced a reduction in operating lease costs but an increase in finance lease costs.\n\nNext, let's examine the lease liabilities as of December 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020, as shown in the sixth image:\n\n- **Operating Lease Liabilities**:\n  - 2021: $3,503 million\n  - 2020: $3,906 million\n  - **Change**: A decrease of $403 million\n\n- **Finance Lease Liabilities**:\n  - 2021: $497 million\n  - 2020: $633 million\n  - **Change**: A decrease of $136 million\n\nBoth operating and finance lease liabilities decreased from 2020 to 2021. The decrease in operating lease liabilities is more significant than that of finance lease liabilities.\n\nAdditionally, the weighted-average remaining lease term and the weighted-average discount rate provide context for the changes in lease liabilities:\n\n- **Weighted-Average Remaining Lease Term**:\n  - Operating Leases: 7.8 years (2021) vs. 7.2 years (2020)\n  - Finance Leases: 13.2 years (2021) vs. 10.4 years (2020)\n\n- **Weighted-Average Discount Rate**:\n  - Operating Leases: 2.2% (2021) vs. 2.8% (2020)\n  - Finance Leases: 4.2% (2021) vs. 3.9% (2020)\n\nThe increase in the weighted-average remaining lease term for both types of leases suggests that the company has longer-term leases in place as of 2021. The decrease in the weighted-average discount rate for operating leases indicates a lower cost of borrowing, which can affect the present value of future lease payments and, consequently, the lease liabilities.\n\nIn summary, the company saw a decrease in both operating and finance lease costs and liabilities from 2020 to 2021, with a more pronounced reduction in operating lease costs and liabilities. The weighted-average remaining lease term increased, and the weighted-average discount rate decreased for operating leases, reflecting changes in the company's lease portfolio and borrowing conditions. ![Lease costs and liabilities trends](image3)"}

This increase is primarily due to higher loan demand, resulting in increased originations and loan draws, partially offset by paydowns and PPP loan forgiveness [5].\n- **Commercial Real Estate Loans**: Increased from $84,456 million in 2020 to $92,983 million in 2021, an increase of $8,527 million or 10%. This growth reflects continued strong demand in the commercial real estate sector [image5].\n- **Home Lending Loans**: Decreased from $253,942 million in 2020 to $214,407 million in 2021, a decrease of $39,535 million or 16%. This decline is driven by loan paydowns reflecting the low interest rate environment and the transfer of $17.8 billion of first lien mortgage loans to loans held for sale (LHFS) [5].\n- **Auto Loans**: Increased from $49,072 million in 2020 to $57,260 million in 2021, an increase of $8,188 million or 17%. This growth is attributed to higher auto loan originations [image6].\n- **Credit Card Loans**: Increased from $36,664 million in 2020 to $38,453 million in 2021, a moderate increase of $1,789 million or 5%. This slight growth indicates stable consumer spending [image6].\n- **Small Business Loans**: Decreased from $17,743 million in 2020 to $11,270 million in 2021, a significant decrease of $6,473 million or 36%. This decline is due to a reduction in PPP loans [5].\n\n### Total Deposits\n- **Consumer and Small Business Banking**: Increased from $722,085 million in 2020 to $834,739 million in 2021, a substantial increase of $112,654 million or 16%. This growth is driven by higher levels of liquidity and savings for consumer customers, reflecting government stimulus programs and continued economic uncertainty associated with the COVID-19 pandemic [8][11].\n- **Commercial Real Estate**: Increased from $234,332 million in 2020 to $189,176 million in 2021, a decrease of $45,156 million or 19%. This decline is due to a reduction in reverse repurchase agreements and securities borrowed [image5].\n- **Home Lending**: Increased from $722,085 million in 2020 to $834,739 million in 2021, a substantial increase of $112,654 million or 16%. This growth is consistent with the overall trend in consumer and small business banking [image6].\n\n### Contributing Factors\n- **Economic Environment**: The improved economic environment and government stimulus programs contributed to higher consumer and business savings, leading to an increase in deposits [10].\n- **Loan Demand**: Higher loan demand in commercial and industrial sectors, coupled with increased originations and loan draws, led to a significant increase in these loan categories [5].\n- **PPP Loans**: The decline in Small Business loans is primarily due to the reduction in PPP loans, which were a significant source of loan growth in 2020 [5].\n- **Interest Rate Environment**: The low interest rate environment led to higher loan paydowns in the Home Lending sector, reducing the total loan balance [5].\n\nIn conclusion, the total loans and deposits across different lines of business showed mixed trends in 2021, with significant increases in commercial and industrial loans and deposits, while home lending loans and small business loans saw notable decreases. These changes were primarily driven by the economic environment, government stimulus, and the low interest rate environment."}

According to the data, the Credit Risk RWA increased by $44,382 million under the Standardized Approach and by $56,003 million under the Advanced Approach [4]. This increase was primarily driven by higher Derivatives exposures, increased Investment securities, and higher Lending commitments within the Wealth Management and Institutional Securities business segments [3]. This suggests that the institution took on more credit risk, which in turn required a higher amount of capital to be held against these risks.\n\n![{Credit Risk RWA increased significantly in 2020 under both Standardized and Advanced Approaches}](image4)\n\nSecondly, the External TLAC as a percentage of RWA decreased from 21.5% in 2019 to 18.0% in 2020 [7]. This reduction indicates that while the institution still maintained a substantial level of TLAC, the proportion relative to its RWA declined. This could be due to a combination of factors, including changes in the composition of the institution's capital base and the overall increase in RWA.\n\n![{External TLAC as a percentage of RWA decreased from 21.5% in 2019 to 18.0% in 2020}](image7)\n\nThese changes collectively suggest that the institution faced a more complex and riskier environment in 2020, necessitating higher capital buffers to manage these risks. The increase in Credit Risk RWA required more capital to be held, while the decrease in External TLAC as a percentage of RWA indicated a relative reduction in the cushion available to absorb potential losses. This adjustment in capital structure reflects the institution's response to heightened market volatility and regulatory requirements.\n\nIn conclusion, the increases in Credit Risk RWA and the decrease in External TLAC as a percentage of RWA from 2019 to 2020 led to a more cautious and capital-intensive financial structure for the institution."}

This indicates a slight decrease from 2020 to 2021 and a further slight decrease from 2021 to 2022.\n\nLooking ahead, the company has provided estimated amortization expenses for the next five fiscal years.

According to the financial statements, the profit before taxation and exceptional items was higher at Rs. 79.60 crore compared to Rs. 71.84 crore in the previous year [1]. However, after accounting for taxation and exceptional expenses, primarily due to the Assam dues becoming doubtful of recovery, the net profit declined to Rs. 37.91 crore from Rs. 47.80 crore in the previous year [1].\n\nDespite this decline in net profit, the company saw significant improvements in other areas. For instance, cigarette sales volume increased by 19.64%, rising from 8854 million cigarettes in the previous year to 10593 million cigarettes [7]. Additionally, the company launched several new brands and made strategic exits from low-profitability areas, which helped increase domestic marginal contribution by around 2% [8]. The export performance was particularly noteworthy, with the FOB value of exports, including tobacco, cigarettes, and tea, increasing from Rs. 10.99 crore to Rs. 52.47 crore [9].\n\nWhen comparing these financial results to the potential for tobacco export earnings, it becomes evident that the company has significant room for growth. The potential for increasing export earnings by seven times with just a 5% share of the global tobacco trade is substantial [image3]. Currently, India holds only a 0.7% share of the USD 30 billion annual global tobacco trade, with export earnings of Rs. 930 crore [image3]. This suggests that the company could benefit greatly from expanding its international presence and capturing a larger share of the global market.\n\nThe implications for the company's strategy are clear. By focusing on increasing exports, the company can diversify its revenue streams and reduce dependence on the domestic market, which is subject to high taxation and regulatory challenges [image1]. The company's efforts in launching new brands and improving product quality can also support its export ambitions, as these initiatives enhance its competitive position in international markets.\n\nIn conclusion, while the company faced a decline in net profit in 2002-2003, its strong performance in sales volume and exports, coupled with the vast potential for increasing tobacco export earnings, indicates a promising future for the company's strategic direction. ![The potential for increasing export earnings by seven times with just a 5% share of the global tobacco trade is substantial](image3)."}

Specifically, the change in expected credit losses and other credit impairment charges increased from $(1,162) million in 2019 to $(4,754) million in 2020, a difference of $(3,592) million [6]. Additionally, net operating income decreased by $1,852 million, from $15,164 million in 2019 to $13,312 million in 2020 [6].\n\nThese financial impacts were largely driven by the adverse effects of the Covid-19 pandemic, which led to a deterioration in the global economic outlook and increased credit risks.

Despite this decline, GBS saw strong growth in cloud revenue, which grew at a double-digit rate [12].\n\nThe financial details are further supported by the image showing the year-over-year changes for GBS:\n- **External gross profit**: Increased by 3.0%, from $4,655 million to $4,795 million [image8].\n- **External gross profit margin**: Improved by 2.0 percentage points, from 27.7% to 29.7% [image8].\n- **Pre-tax income**: Decreased by 16.8%, from $1,623 million to $1,351 million [image8].\n- **Pre-tax margin**: Declined by 2.2 percentage points, from 9.5% to 8.3% [image8].\n\n### Global Technology Services (GTS)\n\nThe text indicates that GTS revenue decreased by 5.7 percent as reported (5 percent adjusted for currency) in 2020 compared to the prior year [6]. The decline was driven by lower client business volumes, particularly in industries more impacted by the macroeconomic environment. However, cloud revenue within GTS grew as reported and adjusted for currency [6].\n\nThe financial details are also supported by the image showing the year-over-year changes for GTS:\n- **External revenue**: Decreased by 5.7%, from $27,361 million to $25,812 million [image3].\n- **Infrastructure & Cloud Services revenue**: Decreased by 5.1%, from $20,736 million to $19,669 million [image3].\n- **Technology Support Services revenue**: Decreased by 7.3%, from $6,625 million to $6,144 million [image3].\n- **External total gross profit**: Decreased by 5.7%, from $9,515 million to $8,975 million [image6].\n- **External total gross profit margin**: Remained unchanged at 34.8% [image6].\n- **Pre-tax income**: Significantly decreased by 92.9%, from $1,645 million to $126 million [image6].\n- **Pre-tax margin**: Dropped from 5.8% to 0.4% [image6].\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn summary, while both GBS and GTS experienced revenue declines in 2020, GBS saw improvements in gross profit and margin, whereas GTS faced significant decreases in pre-tax income and margin.

This substantial decrease in 2020 can be attributed to the significant drop in interest rates, which had a profound impact on the bank's earnings from interest-bearing assets. The table in Image 2 provides a detailed breakdown of the changes in interest income and expense across different categories. For instance, the interest income from loans and leases saw a significant decrease of $9,093 million, primarily driven by lower interest rates on residential mortgages, home equity, and credit cards [image2].\n\nSimilarly, the net interest expense decreased by $14,120 million from 2019 to 2020, while it increased by $3,738 million from 2018 to 2019. This reduction in interest expense is largely due to lower rates on interest-bearing deposits, particularly savings and demand and money market deposit accounts, as shown in the same table. The decrease in interest expense helped mitigate some of the negative impact on net interest income but was not enough to offset the overall decline [image2].\n\nThese changes reflect the organizational structure of Bank of America, which is designed to manage and optimize its balance sheet in response to macroeconomic conditions. The bank's capital allocation and risk management practices, as described in Text Quote [1], play a crucial role in navigating such economic shifts. The bank allocates capital based on a risk-adjusted methodology that incorporates various types of risks, ensuring that it can maintain financial stability even in challenging environments.\n\nFurthermore, the bank's focus on managing interest rate risk, as mentioned in Text Quote [5], is evident in the way it adjusted its balance sheet. For example, the deployment of excess deposits into securities and the reduction in deposit and funding costs helped to partially offset the negative impact of lower interest rates. This strategic approach is reflected in the detailed financial data provided in the images, showing how the bank managed its interest income and expense across different asset and liability categories.\n\nIn conclusion, the significant decreases in net interest income and net interest expense from 2019 to 2020, compared to the smaller changes from 2018 to 2019, highlight the bank's ability to adapt to a low-interest-rate environment through strategic capital allocation and risk management practices. ![The table shows the detailed changes in interest income and expense across different categories, reflecting the bank's strategic adjustments.](image2)"}

This decline in investment income can be attributed to several factors, including a significant reduction in interest and other investment income, which fell by 44.4% from $1,059 million in 2020 to $589 million in 2021 [7]. The decrease in interest income is primarily due to lower yields from short-term investments and fixed maturity securities, as short-term interest rates remained low throughout 2021 [4].\n\nDespite the decline in interest income, dividend income increased significantly, rising from $489 million in 2020 to $5,060 million in 2021 [7]. This substantial increase in dividend income is largely due to dividends from the investment in preferred stock of Berkshire Hathaway Energy, which contributed $121 million in 2021, up from $26 million in 2020 [5].\n\nRegarding the asset composition, there was a notable shift in the types of assets held by the insurance business. Cash, cash equivalents, and U.S. Treasury Bills increased from $67,082 million in 2020 to $90,688 million in 2021 [3]. This increase in liquidity reflects the company's strategy to maintain ample cash reserves and prioritize safety over yield in short-term investments [4]. Additionally, equity securities saw a substantial rise, increasing from $269,498 million in 2020 to $334,907 million in 2021 [3]. This growth in equity securities aligns with the company's focus on long-term investments and the potential for higher returns.\n\nFixed maturity securities, however, decreased from $20,317 million in 2020 to $16,386 million in 2021 [3]. This reduction is likely due to the low interest rate environment, which made fixed maturity securities less attractive compared to other investment options.\n\nThe implications of these changes are multifaceted. The increase in cash and cash equivalents provides the company with greater financial flexibility and the ability to respond quickly to market opportunities or unexpected challenges. The higher allocation to equity securities suggests a strategic move towards potentially higher-yielding, but riskier, investments, which could boost long-term returns. However, the decline in interest income highlights the ongoing challenges posed by low interest rates, which can compress margins and reduce overall investment income.\n\nIn summary, the net investment income decreased by 5.0% from 2020 to 2021, primarily due to a significant drop in interest income, while dividend income saw a substantial increase. The asset composition shifted towards more cash and equity securities, reflecting a balance between liquidity and potential for higher returns. ![Net investment income and asset composition changes](image7)"}

Internationally, downstream earnings decreased to $525 million in 2021 from $618 million in 2020, primarily due to lower margins on refined product sales of $330 million and higher operating expenses of $100 million, partially offset by a favorable swing in foreign currency effects of $337 million [8]. ![{Chevron's downstream earnings showed mixed results, with U.S. downstream improving significantly while international downstream saw a slight decline.}](image3)\n\nThese trends in both upstream and downstream operations contributed to a significant increase in Chevron's overall net income.

According to the provided data [11], the liabilities for uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2020, were $89 million, while as of December 31, 2019, they were $303 million. This represents a significant reduction of $214 million in the balance of uncertain tax positions from 2019 to 2020.\n\nNext, we'll examine the changes in fair value assets and liabilities. The fair value hierarchy categorizes assets and liabilities into Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3 based on the observability of the inputs used to measure their fair value [3].

These disruptions can lead to increased input prices and production costs, ultimately affecting the company's ability to meet consumer demand [6].\n\nTo mitigate these risks, Nestlé has implemented several strategies. These include having business continuity and disaster recovery plans in place for key sites, active price risk management on key commodities, and policies and procedures to ensure the health and safety of people, products, and sites [6]. Additionally, the company's global presence and diversified factory distribution across different regions play a crucial role in reducing the impact of localized disruptions.\n\nFor instance, Nestlé's factory distribution in the Americas (AMS) region, which includes countries like Brazil, Mexico, and the United States, ensures that the company can maintain operations even if one area faces a disruption [image1]. Similarly, the extensive network in Europe, Middle East, and North Africa (EMENA) with significant operations in countries like Germany, France, and the United Kingdom, provides a buffer against regional supply chain issues [image5].\n\nBy maintaining a diverse and widespread factory distribution, Nestlé can better manage and mitigate the risks associated with supply chain disruptions, ensuring a more resilient and reliable supply of essential food and beverages to consumers worldwide.\n\nIn summary, Nestlé's comprehensive risk mitigation strategies and global factory distribution help to minimize the potential impacts of supply chain disruptions."}

According to the financial data, Cloud & Cognitive Software reported an external gross profit of $17,068 million, while Global Business Services had an external gross profit of $4,519 million [4]. This disparity can be attributed to the different business models and the nature of the services offered by each segment.\n\nThe pre-tax income for Cloud & Cognitive Software in 2019 was also notably higher at $8,914 million, compared to $1,602 million for Global Business Services [4].

For Cloud & Cognitive Software, the decline in pre-tax margin from 35.6% in 2018 to 30.4% in 2019 was driven by the purchase price accounting impacts from the Red Hat acquisition and ongoing investments in key strategic areas [7]. Additionally, the decline in income from IP partnership agreements also played a role [7].\n\nOn the other hand, Global Business Services saw improvements in margins and pre-tax income due to the continued mix shift to higher-value offerings, delivery productivity improvements, and a currency benefit from leveraging the global delivery resource model [3].

This mixed performance reflects the ongoing shift towards smoke-free alternatives, which is a strategic focus for PMI.\n\nThe financial impact of these changes is evident in the company's operating activities. Despite the decline in shipment volumes, net cash provided by operating activities in 2020 only decreased by $0.3 billion compared to 2019, and this decrease was largely due to currency movements [3]. Excluding these movements, net cash provided by operating activities actually increased by $0.2 billion, driven by higher net earnings [3].\n\nHowever, the higher working capital requirements in 2020, primarily due to the build-up of inventory in the supply chain and the timing of excise tax payments, partially offset these gains [8]. Additionally, the deconsolidation of RBH in 2019 contributed to the volume decline, further impacting the region's performance [9].\n\nThe reduction in net cash used in investing activities by $0.7 billion in 2020, primarily due to lower capital expenditures and the deconsolidation of RBH, also positively affected the financial performance [11].

The average and period-end loans and deposits for Consumer Banking and Lending are shown in the following tables:\n\n### Loans\nFor the average loans:\n- **Home Lending**: Decreased from $268,586 million in 2020 to $224,446 million in 2021, a decrease of 16% [image2].\n- **Auto**: Increased from $49,460 million in 2020 to $52,293 million in 2021, an increase of 6% [image2].\n- **Credit Card**: Decreased from $37,093 million in 2020 to $35,471 million in 2021, a decrease of 4% [image2].\n- **Small Business**: Increased from $15,173 million in 2020 to $16,625 million in 2021, an increase of 10% [image2].\n- **Personal Lending**: Decreased from $6,151 million in 2020 to $5,050 million in 2021, a decrease of 18% [image2].\n\nFor the period-end loans:\n- **Home Lending**: Decreased from $253,942 million in 2020 to $214,407 million in 2021, a decrease of 16% [image2].\n- **Auto**: Increased from $49,072 million in 2020 to $57,260 million in 2021, an increase of 17% [image2].\n- **Credit Card**: Increased from $36,664 million in 2020 to $38,453 million in 2021, an increase of 5% [image2].\n- **Small Business**: Decreased from $17,743 million in 2020 to $11,270 million in 2021, a decrease of 36% [image2].\n- **Personal Lending**: Decreased from $5,375 million in 2020 to $5,184 million in 2021, a decrease of 4% [image2].\n\n### Deposits\n- **Total deposits (average)**: Increased from $722,085 million in 2020 to $834,739 million in 2021, an increase of 16% [image2].\n- **Total deposits (period-end)**: Increased from $784,565 million in 2020 to $883,674 million in 2021, an increase of 13% [image2].\n\nThese changes in loans and deposits can be attributed to several factors, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, government stimulus programs, and shifts in consumer behavior. The increase in deposits reflects higher levels of liquidity and savings among consumers, driven by government stimulus and payment deferral programs [11]. Conversely, the decrease in loans, particularly in Home Lending and Small Business, can be attributed to actions taken in 2020 to curtail certain non-conforming residential mortgage originations and the suspension of home equity originations [5].\n\nIn summary, the net income for Consumer Banking and Lending improved significantly from a loss in 2020 to a profit in 2021, while deposits increased and loans showed mixed trends, with notable decreases in Home Lending and Small Business loans. ![Total deposits increased and loans showed mixed trends](image2)"}

However, the specific figures for the changes in average Card Member loans and net interest income can be found in the financial statements.\n\nAccording to the financial data provided in the images:\n\n- **Net Interest Income**:\n  - In 2019, the net interest income was $7,683 million.\n  - In 2020, it was $7,145 million.\n  - In 2021, it was $6,674 million.\n  - The change from 2019 to 2020 was a decrease of $538 million (-7%).\n  - The change from 2020 to 2021 was a decrease of $471 million (-7%).\n\n- **Average Card Member Loans**:\n  - In 2019, the average Card Member loans were $69.4 billion.\n  - In 2020, they were $61.6 billion.\n  - In 2021, they were $61.0 billion.\n  - The change from 2019 to 2020 was a decrease of $7.8 billion (-11%).\n  - The change from 2020 to 2021 was a decrease of $0.6 billion (-1%).\n\nThese changes are summarized in the following table:\n| Year | Net Interest Income (Millions) | Average Card Member Loans (Billions) |\n|------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------|\n| 2019 | 7,683                         | 69.4                                |\n| 2020 | 7,145                         | 61.6                                |\n| 2021 | 6,674                         | 61.0                                |\n\nThe decrease in net interest income and average Card Member loans from 2019 to 2021 indicates a decline in the company's lending activities and the interest earned from these loans. This decline can be attributed to several factors, including higher paydown rates on revolving loan balances and a lower cost of funds, which partially offset the decrease in average loan balances [12].\n\nHowever, despite the decrease in net interest income, the company's overall financial performance was still positive. Total revenues net of interest expense increased 17 percent year-over-year, driven by double-digit growth in non-interest revenue lines such as discount revenue and net card fees [2]. This growth in non-interest revenues, particularly discount revenue, which increased 26 percent year-over-year, helped to offset the decline in net interest income [2].\n\nAdditionally, the company's strong liquidity position, with $24.6 billion in Cash and cash equivalents and Investment securities as of December 31, 2021, further supports its financial stability [7].\n\nIn conclusion, while the average Card Member loans and net interest income decreased from 2019 to 2021, the company's financial performance remained robust due to strong growth in non-interest revenues and a solid liquidity position. ![Net interest income and average Card Member loans decreased from 2019 to 2021, but the company's financial performance was supported by strong non-interest revenues and liquidity.](image7)"}

According to the financial statements, share-based compensation expense for the year 2020 was $1,197,806 [12]. This amount is added to the retained earnings, thereby increasing shareholders' equity. Specifically, the balance sheet shows that the share-based compensation expense directly contributes to the increase in the \"Additional Paid-in Capital\" section of shareholders' equity, enhancing the overall equity position of the company.\n\nNext, let's examine the cash flow from operating activities. The cash flow statement for 2020 indicates that the net cash provided by operating activities was $8,215,152 [4]. This significant positive cash flow is crucial for maintaining and improving the company's cash position. The primary components contributing to this positive cash flow include net income of $5,185,313, depreciation and amortization of $1,773,124, and share-based compensation expense of $1,197,806. These non-cash adjustments help to reconcile the net income to the net cash provided by operating activities, ensuring a robust cash position.\n\nAdditionally, the cash flow from operating activities includes changes in working capital items such as receivables, accounts payable, and accrued payroll, which collectively contribute to the net cash provided by operating activities. This positive cash flow is reflected in the cash and cash equivalents at the end of the period, which increased from $6,126,853 at the beginning of the year to $8,415,330 at the end of the year [4].\n\nIn summary, both share-based compensation and cash flow from operating activities play significant roles in enhancing Accenture plc's shareholders' equity and cash position for the year 2020. Share-based compensation directly increases shareholders' equity by adding to retained earnings and additional paid-in capital, while the strong cash flow from operating activities ensures a healthy and growing cash position. ![Share-based compensation and operating cash flow significantly enhance shareholders' equity and cash position](image4)"}

The total equity of Siemens Healthineers increased from €12,511 million in 2020 to €16,339 million in 2021, a rise of €3,828 million [7]. This increase was primarily driven by the capital increase in March 2021, which added €53 million to issued capital and €2,275 million to capital reserves [7].\n\nAdditionally, the net income for the year contributed €497 million to the increase in unappropriated net income, despite the dividend distribution of €856 million [4]. The acquisition of treasury shares also played a role, with the company holding 5,328,965 treasury shares as of September 30, 2021, up from 898,249 in 2020 [4].\n\nOn the liabilities side, the most notable change was the significant increase in net debt, which rose from €1,484 million in 2020 to €11,901 million in 2021, primarily due to increased borrowings from the Siemens Group [12]. This is reflected in the substantial increase in liabilities to the Siemens Group from financing activities, which grew from €2,982 million in 2020 to €11,708 million in 2021 ![{Net debt increased significantly from 2020 to 2021, driven by increased borrowings from the Siemens Group.}](image1).\n\nFurthermore, the company's long-term financial debt also increased from €314 million in 2020 to €457 million in 2021, and short-term financial debt and current maturities of long-term financial debt rose from €167 million to €225 million [12]. These increases in debt were partially offset by cash outflows from the repayment of matured loans and other financing activities [12].\n\nThe key components driving these changes include the capital increase, net income, and significant borrowings from the Siemens Group to finance the acquisition of Varian and other strategic initiatives.\n\nIn summary, Siemens Healthineers' equity increased by €3,828 million, driven by capital increases and net income, while liabilities, particularly net debt, increased substantially due to increased borrowings from the Siemens Group."}

This transaction is reflected in the cash flows from financing activities, where the issuance of preferred shares contributed $1.584 billion to the cash inflow, while the redemption of preferred shares resulted in a cash outflow of $1.600 billion [image3].\n\nThe impact on shareholders' equity can be seen in the changes to the preferred shares account.

This growth in total assets suggests that the company has expanded its asset base, potentially through investments in property, plant, and equipment, or through acquisitions, which can support future revenue growth and operational efficiency.\n\nRegarding cash flow from operating activities, the consolidated segment reported a significant increase from $6,327 million in 2020 to $7,198 million in 2021, a rise of $871 million [2]. This improvement in operating cash flow is primarily attributed to higher profit in 2021, adjusted for non-cash items, including higher accruals for short-term incentive compensation [1]. Additionally, lower payments for short-term incentive compensation favorably impacted cash flow, although this was partially offset by increased working capital requirements [1].\n\nThe increase in total assets and operating cash flow indicates a strengthening financial position for the company.

However, the substantial cash outflows in investing and financing activities, particularly the decrease in customer deposits and the repurchase of common shares, contributed to the overall decrease in total assets and liabilities.\n\n### Visual Representation\n\n![{Total assets decreased by $2,819 million and total liabilities decreased by $2,012 million from 2020 to 2021}](image1)\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe significant changes in total assets and total liabilities from 2020 to 2021, with a decrease in both, are primarily due to reductions in cash and cash equivalents and customer deposits.

This reduction in total assets is indicative of IBM's strategic actions to manage its portfolio and improve its financial health.\n\nNext, total equity also experienced a decline. As mentioned, total equity decreased by $258 million from December 31, 2019, primarily due to dividends paid of $5,797 million and a decline in accumulated other comprehensive income of $740 million, partially offset by increases from net income of $5,590 million and common stock of $661 million [1].

This reduction in debt aligns with IBM's focus on debt repayment and enhancing its balance sheet strength and liquidity position [7].\n\nIn summary, IBM's financial position in 2020 showed a decrease in total assets, a modest decline in total equity, and a slight reduction in total company debt compared to 2019. ![Total assets and debt decreased, while equity saw a modest decline](image6)"}

The company's shares are traded daily, and the shareholding is consolidated based on the PAN of the shareholder [4].\n\n### Public Shareholding Changes\nThe image showing the category of shareholders provides a detailed breakdown of the changes in public shareholding [image2]. At the beginning of the fiscal year (April 1, 2019), the total public shareholding was 1,048,842,706 shares, representing 28.0% of the total shares. By the end of the fiscal year (March 31, 2020), the total public shareholding remained the same at 1,048,842,706 shares, still representing 28.0% of the total shares.\n\nHowever, there were some internal shifts within the public shareholding categories:\n- **Individual shareholders holding nominal share capital in excess of ₹1 lakh**: The number of shares decreased from 20,132,741 to 12,091,576, a reduction of 8,041,165 shares.\n- **Trusts**: The number of shares increased from 9,879,420 to 11,230,590, an addition of 1,351,170 shares.\n- **Clearing Members / Clearing House**: The number of shares increased from 3,842,202 to 7,107,736, an addition of 3,265,534 shares.\n- **Alternative Investment Fund**: The number of shares increased from 1,663,495 to 1,820,360, an addition of 156,865 shares.\n- **IEPF Suspense A/c**: The number of shares increased from 248,790 to 301,900, an addition of 53,110 shares.\n\n### Top Ten Shareholders Changes\nThe top ten shareholders' shareholding patterns also provide insights into the changes [image3]:\n- **Life Insurance Corporation of India**: Increased from 152,493,927 shares (4.0%) to 157,538,396 shares (4.2%).\n- **Invesco Oppenheimer Developing Markets Fund**: Increased significantly from 6,731,906 shares (0.4%) to 28,045,020 shares (0.8%).\n- **SBI Mutual Fund**: Increased from 21,680,561 shares (0.6%) to 26,429,597 shares (0.7%).\n- **Axis Mutual Fund Trustee Limited**: Increased from 5,244,614 shares (0.4%) to 16,609,800 shares (0.4%).\n- **Government of Singapore**: Increased from 8,028,475 shares (0.5%) to 16,012,250 shares (0.4%).\n- **Vanguard Total International Stock Index Fund**: Increased from 3,978,944 shares (0.4%) to 15,772,829 shares (0.4%).\n- **Vanguard Emerging Markets Stock Index Fund, A Series Of Vanguard International Equity Index Funds**: Decreased slightly from 14,112,213 shares (0.4%) to 13,199,846 shares (0.4%).\n- **ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Company Ltd**: Decreased from 16,139,316 shares (0.4%) to 12,868,617 shares (0.3%).\n- **First State Investments Icvc- Stewart Investors Asia Pacific Leaders Fund**: Decreased from 9,248,438 shares (0.5%) to 12,257,728 shares (0.3%).\n- **Wgi Emerging Markets Fund LLC**: Increased slightly from 10,193,241 shares (0.3%) to 11,243,846 shares (0.3%).\n\n### Tata Group Shareholding\nThe Tata group's shareholding, particularly Tata Sons Private Limited, remained unchanged at 2,702,450,947 shares, representing 72.0% of the total shares [image4, image6, image7]. This consistency indicates that the Tata group maintained its controlling stake in the company throughout the fiscal year.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe shareholding patterns for public shareholders saw some internal shifts, with certain institutions and individual categories increasing their holdings while others decreased. However, the overall percentage of public shareholding remained constant at 28.0%. The Tata group, specifically Tata Sons Private Limited, maintained its significant 72.0% shareholding without any changes during the fiscal year from April 1, 2019, to March 31, 2020.\n\n![{Public shareholding remained constant at 28.0%, with internal shifts among different categories}](image2)\n![{Tata Sons Private Limited maintained its 72.0% shareholding without any changes}](image4)"}

According to the data, the gross unrecognized tax benefits at the beginning of 2018 were $1,056 million, and by the end of 2020, they had grown to $1,829 million [4]. This increase can be attributed to various factors, including current year tax positions, prior year tax positions, and other adjustments [4].\n\nRegarding the impact of common share repurchases, the company repurchased a substantial number of shares over the two-year period. In 2020, the company repurchased 14 million shares at an average price of $300.58 per share, totaling $4,250 million [8]. In 2019, the repurchases were even more significant, with 22 million shares repurchased at an average price of $245.97 per share, totaling $5,500 million [8]. These repurchases reduced the number of shares outstanding, which can potentially increase earnings per share (EPS) and improve shareholder value [3].\n\nHowever, the large outlay of cash for these repurchases also impacted the company's liquidity and financial flexibility. By the end of 2020, the board authorized shares remaining for repurchase were 58 million, down from 72 million at the end of 2019 [8]. This reduction indicates that the company has been actively using its capital to repurchase shares, which can be seen as a strategic move to optimize its capital structure and cost of capital [3].\n\nIn summary, the company's gross unrecognized tax benefits increased from $1,056 million in 2018 to $1,829 million in 2020, and the common share repurchases in 2019 and 2020 totaled $5,500 million and $4,250 million, respectively, significantly impacting the company's financial position by reducing liquidity but potentially enhancing shareholder value.\n\n![{The company's gross unrecognized tax benefits increased from $1,056 million in 2018 to $1,829 million in 2020.}](image4)\n![{The company repurchased 22 million shares in 2019 and 14 million shares in 2020, totaling $5,500 million and $4,250 million, respectively.}](image8)"}

This could have indirectly affected the carrying amounts of right-of-use assets.\n\nIn summary, the carrying amounts of leasehold improvements, hardware, and software increased by \\( \\S 18,464,000 \\), primarily due to additions and the effect of exchange rate movements. The carrying amounts of right-of-use assets increased by \\( \\S 12,061,000 \\), influenced by the adoption of AASB 16, new additions, and re-measurement of lease liabilities, offset by depreciation and impairment charges.\n\n![{The carrying amounts of leasehold improvements, hardware, and software increased by $18,464,000, while the carrying amounts of right-of-use assets increased by $12,061,000.}](image6)"}

In 2021, the company recorded a total tax benefit of $567 million, which is significantly higher than the $273 million and $237 million recorded in 2020 and 2019, respectively [1]. This increase can be attributed to various factors, including the excess tax benefits associated with share-based awards and the benefit from research and development tax credits.\n\nIn 2020, the company saw a more modest tax benefit of $273 million, which was influenced by the rapid spread of COVID-19 and the associated economic downturn. This period also saw impairments and write-downs of non-marketable equity investments, particularly the full impairment of the investment in OneWeb, which filed for bankruptcy [7].\n\n2019 was a particularly significant year for Qualcomm's tax provisions. The company recorded a substantial tax benefit of $570 million due to the establishment of new U.S. net deferred tax assets resulting from check-the-box elections made by foreign subsidiaries [8]. However, this was offset by a $2.5 billion charge to income tax expense due to the derecognition of a deferred tax asset related to the distribution of intellectual property [8].\n\nThe effective tax rates for these years also reflect these changes. In 2021, the effective tax rate was 12%, compared to 9% in 2020 and 41% in 2019 [7]. The high effective tax rate in 2019 was largely due to the significant charge related to the derecognition of the deferred tax asset.\n\nAdditionally, the company's unrecognized tax benefits increased from $1.9 billion in 2020 to $2.1 billion in 2021 [10]. This increase was primarily due to expected refunds of Korean withholding taxes, which could result in a reduction in U.S. foreign tax credits if successful [10].\n\nOverall, the trends in Qualcomm's tax provisions and related benefits over the past three years highlight the impact of strategic tax planning, economic conditions, and specific events like the derecognition of deferred tax assets and the global pandemic.\n\n![{Tax benefits and provisions fluctuated significantly over the years, with 2019 seeing a major impact from the derecognition of a deferred tax asset.}](image7)\n\nThe significant changes in Qualcomm's tax provisions and related benefits over the years 2019, 2020, and 2021 include a major tax benefit in 2021, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, and the derecognition of a deferred tax asset in 2019."}

According to the data, the total WFAM assets under management decreased from $603.0 billion at the beginning of the year to $587.1 billion at the end of the year, with a notable outflow of $96.8 billion attributed to the sale of WFAM [2]. This reduction is also reflected in the detailed breakdown of the assets under management, where the balance at the end of the period shows a decrease of $396.0 billion in other assets managed, which aligns with the sale [image2].\n\nThe sale of WFAM also had broader effects on the company's income and balance sheet. The transaction resulted in a net gain of $269 million, which contributed positively to the company's noninterest income for the year 2021 [1].

This reduction in asset-based fees is a direct consequence of the sale and impacts the company's revenue stream.\n\nOn the balance sheet, the sale of WFAM contributed to a modest decrease in total assets, primarily due to the reduction in assets under management and the associated fees. The total assets decreased slightly from $675,250 million in 2020 to $743,089 million in 2021, with a significant portion of this change attributed to the sale and the subsequent reduction in asset-based fees [image7].\n\nIn summary, the sale of WFAM on November 1, 2021, led to a substantial reduction in assets under management, a significant gain in noninterest income, and a decrease in investment advisory fees, with broader impacts on the company's income and balance sheet. ![The sale of WFAM led to a significant reduction in assets under management and a notable gain in noninterest income.](image2)"}

According to the data provided:\n\n- **Net interest income** decreased by $5,627 million from 2019 to 2020 [image1].\n- **Net interest expense** decreased by $14,120 million from 2019 to 2020 [image1].\n\nThese changes can be broken down further:\n\n### Net Interest Income\nThe decrease in net interest income is primarily due to:\n- **Lower interest rates**: This led to a significant reduction in interest income across various categories such as residential mortgages, home equity, and credit cards [image1].\n- **Volume increases**: Despite higher deposit and loan balances, the lower rates offset the volume increases, leading to a net decrease in interest income [image1].\n\n### Net Interest Expense\nThe decrease in net interest expense is primarily due to:\n- **Lower interest rates on deposits**: The cost of interest-bearing deposits, especially savings and demand accounts, significantly decreased [image1].\n- **Reduced borrowing costs**: The cost of federal funds purchased and other short-term borrowings also decreased [image1].\n\n### Net Interest Spread\nThe net interest spread is the difference between the yield on earning assets and the cost of interest-bearing liabilities. The net interest spread decreased from 2.03% in 2019 to 1.75% in 2020 [image8]. This decrease can be attributed to:\n\n- **Yield on earning assets**: The yield on earning assets decreased from 3.52% in 2019 to 2.25% in 2020 [image8]. This is due to the lower interest rates on loans and securities.\n- **Cost of interest-bearing liabilities**: The cost of interest-bearing liabilities decreased from 1.49% in 2019 to 0.50% in 2020 [image8]. While this is a positive factor, it was not enough to offset the larger decrease in the yield on earning assets.\n\n### Main Contributing Factors\n1. **Interest Rate Environment**: The overall decrease in interest rates had a significant impact on both interest income and interest expense. Lower rates reduced the yield on loans and securities, while also reducing the cost of deposits and borrowings [image1, image8].\n2. **Volume Changes**: Despite higher deposit and loan balances, the lower rates led to a net decrease in interest income [image1].\n3. **Asset Sensitivity**: The bank's balance sheet became more asset-sensitive, meaning it was more exposed to the negative effects of falling interest rates [2].\n\nIn conclusion, the decrease in net interest income and the smaller decrease in net interest expense from 2019 to 2020 led to a reduction in the net interest spread, primarily due to the lower interest rate environment and the bank's asset sensitivity. ![The net interest spread decreased from 2.03% in 2019 to 1.75% in 2020 due to lower interest rates and asset sensitivity.](image8)"}

By the end of 2020, the value of the investment in Amgen (AMGN) had grown to $162.76, while the S&P 500 had grown to $203.12.

According to the data in the consolidated balance sheet, the balances for these investments are as follows:\n\n- **Balance at 01/02/2020**: 246\n- **Acquisitions**: 33\n- **Disposals**: (12)\n- **Transfers**: (8)\n- **Foreign exchange translation differences**: (2)\n- **Balance at 31/01/2021**: 258\n- **Balance at 01/02/2021**: 258\n- **Acquisitions**: 58\n- **Disposals**: (25)\n- **Balance at 31/01/2022**: 307\n\nThe main activities contributing to the changes in the balance for investments accounted for using the equity method include acquisitions and disposals. Specifically, there were acquisitions totaling 91 (33 in 2021 and 58 in 2022) and disposals totaling 37 (12 in 2021 and 25 in 2022). Additionally, foreign exchange translation differences and transfers also played a role, but their impact was relatively minor.\n\nNext, let's examine the changes in guarantees. The guarantees and deposits primarily relate to security deposits paid to owners of leased commercial premises and amounts paid to secure compliance with contracts in force [4]. The breakdown of maturity for these guarantees is as follows:\n\n- **2021**: \n  - Less than one year: 1,562\n  - One to five years: 3,674\n  - Over five years: 588\n- **2020**: \n  - Less than one year: 1,552\n  - One to five years: 3,803\n  - Over five years: 797\n\nFrom 2020 to 2021, the total amount of guarantees increased slightly. The main activities contributing to these changes are likely related to new lease agreements and contract obligations, which would require additional security deposits.\n\nIn summary, the changes in balances for investments accounted for using the equity method from 2020 to 2022 were primarily driven by acquisitions and disposals, with a net increase in the balance. For guarantees, the changes were more modest and likely reflect new lease agreements and contract obligations. ![Changes in investment balances and guarantees from 2020 to 2022](image2)"}

This indicates that there was no change in the promoter group's shareholding during the fiscal year.\n\nNext, let's examine the shareholding of public institutions. The data in the image provides a breakdown of the shareholding by different categories of public institutions:\n\n- **Mutual Funds / UTI**: At the beginning of the fiscal year, they held 93,357,668 shares (2.5% of total shares). By the end of the fiscal year, this increased to 95,698,803 shares (2.6% of total shares) [image8].

By the end of the fiscal year, this increased to 1,849,839 shares (0.1% of total shares) [image8]. This also represents a slight increase in shareholding.\n\n- **Central Government / State Governments**: At the beginning of the fiscal year, they held 2,037,771 shares (0.1% of total shares). By the end of the fiscal year, this increased to 2,420,388 shares (0.1% of total shares) [image8].

Public institutions, particularly mutual funds, insurance companies, and foreign portfolio investors, saw slight increases in their shareholdings, while financial institutions, banks, and central government/state governments saw minor increases. However, foreign institutional investors saw a significant decrease in their shareholdings.\n\nThe key difference in shareholding patterns between the promoter group and public institutions is that the promoter group's shareholding remained stable, while public institutions experienced some fluctuations, with some increasing and others decreasing their holdings. ![The promoter group's shareholding remained stable, while public institutions experienced some fluctuations.](image1)"}

This represents a significant improvement, reflecting higher sales volume, favorable price realization, and lower other operating expenses, despite higher manufacturing costs and SG&A/R&D expenses [11].\n\nThe net cash provided by operating activities for the Consolidated segment in 2021 was $7,198 million, up from $6,327 million in 2020 [image5]. This increase was primarily due to higher profit before taxes, adjusted for non-cash items, and lower payments for short-term incentive compensation [8].\n\nFor the **Machinery, Energy & Transportation (ME&T)** segment, the operating profit in 2021 was $6,363 million, compared to $4,321 million in 2020 [image6]. This increase is attributed to higher sales volume and favorable price realization, which more than offset the higher manufacturing costs and SG&A/R&D expenses [11].\n\nThe net cash provided by operating activities for the ME&T segment in 2021 was $7,177 million, a substantial increase from $4,054 million in 2020 [image4].

According to the data, the gross unrecognized tax benefits at the beginning of 2020 were $1,423 million, and by the end of 2020, they increased to $1,829 million [image5]. This represents a significant increase of $406 million from the beginning of the year. In comparison, the gross unrecognized tax benefits at the beginning of 2019 were $1,056 million, and by the end of 2019, they were $1,423 million. Thus, the increase in 2020 is more substantial than the increase in 2019, which was $367 million.\n\nThis increase in gross unrecognized tax benefits suggests that the company has taken more aggressive tax positions or has more uncertain tax positions that could potentially reduce its tax liability if recognized. However, these benefits are not yet recognized, indicating a level of uncertainty and potential risk in future tax assessments.\n\nNext, let's look at the common share repurchases. The company repurchased 14 million shares in 2020 at an average price of $300.58 per share, resulting in an aggregate cost of $4,250 million [image1]. In 2019, the company repurchased 22 million shares at an average price of $245.97 per share, with an aggregate cost of $5,500 million. \n\nThe reduction in the number of shares repurchased in 2020 compared to 2019, despite a higher average price per share, indicates a more conservative approach to share repurchases. This could be due to various factors, such as a desire to preserve cash, manage debt levels, or invest in other strategic initiatives.\n\nThe implications of these changes for the company's financial position are multifaceted. The increase in gross unrecognized tax benefits suggests a potential reduction in future tax expenses, which could improve profitability. However, the uncertainty associated with these benefits also introduces financial risk. On the other hand, the reduced share repurchases in 2020 indicate a more cautious capital management strategy, which could help in maintaining financial flexibility and stability, especially in uncertain economic conditions.\n\nIn conclusion, the company's gross unrecognized tax benefits increased significantly in 2020, while common share repurchases decreased, reflecting a more cautious and strategic financial approach. ![Gross unrecognized tax benefits increased by $406 million in 2020, and common share repurchases decreased from 22 million shares in 2019 to 14 million shares in 2020.](image5)"}

This significant increase in sales volume was primarily driven by higher end-user demand for equipment and services, favorable price realization, and changes in dealer inventories [3].\n\nThe change in dealer inventories played a crucial role. Dealers decreased inventories by about $1.100 billion during the fourth quarter of 2020, compared to a decrease of only about $100 million during the fourth quarter of 2021 [8]. This reduction in inventory levels in 2020 contributed to the higher sales volume in 2021 as dealers replenished their stocks.\n\nBreaking down the sales by segment, Construction Industries saw a substantial increase in sales, rising from $4.508 billion in the fourth quarter of 2020 to $5.736 billion in the fourth quarter of 2021, a 27 percent increase [9].

Specifically, net interest income decreased by 16% from $6,504 million in 2019 to $5,468 million in 2020 [5]. This decrease was primarily driven by lower interest rates, which negatively impacted the net interest yield [1]. The total revenue, net of interest expense, also saw a reduction from $19,538 million in 2019 to $18,584 million in 2020, a decline of 5% [5].\n\nThe provision for credit losses increased significantly, from $82 million in 2019 to $357 million in 2020, reflecting the economic uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic [5]. Additionally, noninterest expense rose slightly from $13,825 million in 2019 to $14,154 million in 2020, contributing to the overall financial pressure [5].\n\nIn contrast, the wealth management sector, specifically Merrill Lynch Global Wealth Management (MLGWM), also faced challenges but showed a more modest decline. MLGWM's revenue decreased by 5% from $16,112 million in 2019 to $15,292 million in 2020 [6]. The decrease in revenue was primarily driven by lower interest rates, although this was partially offset by the benefits of higher market valuations and positive asset under management (AUM) flows [6].\n\nThe net interest income for MLGWM decreased from $6,504 million in 2019 to $5,468 million in 2020, a decline of 16% [5]. Despite these challenges, MLGWM managed to maintain a relatively stable performance, with net client AUM flows contributing positively to the balance sheet [11].\n\nOverall, both sectors faced significant headwinds in 2020, with consumer banking experiencing more pronounced declines in net interest income and total revenue compared to the wealth management sector. ![Net interest income and total revenue for Consumer Banking and MLGWM in 2020 and 2019](image5)"}

These adjustments include:\n\n1. **Amortization of Intangible Assets:**\n   - **2021:** USD 3,903 million [7]\n   - **2020:** USD 3,462 million [7]\n\n2. **Impairments:**\n   - **2021:** USD 684 million [7]\n   - **2020:** USD 1,354 million [7]\n\n3. **Acquisition or Divestment of Businesses and Related Items:**\n   - **2021:** USD 1,400 million (net) [4]\n   - **2020:** USD 1,335 million (net) [4]\n\n4. **Other Items:**\n   - **2021:** USD 441 million [4]\n   - **2020:** USD 424 million [4]\n\n5. **Income Taxes:**\n   - **2021:** USD 2,635 million [8]\n   - **2020:** USD 2,403 million [8]\n\n### Analysis of Adjustments\n\n- **Amortization of Intangible Assets:**\n  - This is a significant recurring adjustment that affects both years. In 2021, it was higher than in 2020, contributing to a larger reduction in net income under IFRS compared to core results.\n\n- **Impairments:**\n  - Impairments in 2020 were significantly higher than in 2021, which explains part of the lower net income and EPS in 2020 under IFRS.\n\n- **Acquisition or Divestment of Businesses and Related Items:**\n  - Both years had substantial adjustments, but the net effect was slightly higher in 2020, impacting the net income and EPS under IFRS.\n\n- **Other Items:**\n  - These include various charges and gains, such as divestment gains, fair value adjustments, and legal-related items. The adjustments were relatively consistent between the two years, but still significant.\n\n- **Income Taxes:**\n  - The tax adjustments were also significant, with a higher tax impact in 2021, which further reduced the net income under IFRS.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe most significant adjustments affecting the net income and basic EPS for 2020 and 2021 under both IFRS and core results were the amortization of intangible assets, impairments, and income taxes. These adjustments collectively explain the differences between the IFRS and core results, with amortization and impairments being particularly impactful. ![Amortization and impairments significantly affect net income and EPS adjustments](image7)"}

According to the data, the carrying amount of total goodwill at the end of fiscal year 2020 was €9,038 million [4], and at the end of fiscal year 2021, it was €17,512 million [4]. This results in an increase of €8,474 million in total goodwill.\n\nTo understand how this increase relates to the acquisition of Varian, we need to look at the breakdown of the goodwill allocation. The goodwill was allocated to the Varian and Imaging segments in accordance with the expected synergies from the acquisition [7]. Specifically, the Varian segment received a significant portion of the goodwill, as shown in the image [image3]. The Varian segment's goodwill increased from €0 in 2020 to €7,692 million in 2021, indicating that the majority of the increase in total goodwill is directly attributable to the acquisition of Varian.\n\nAdditionally, the Imaging segment's goodwill increased by €532 million [7], further supporting the notion that the acquisition of Varian was a major factor in the overall increase in goodwill.\n\nTherefore, the change in total goodwill from 2020 to 2021 is €8,474 million, and this increase is primarily due to the acquisition of Varian. ![The majority of the increase in goodwill is attributed to the Varian segment](image3)"}

According to the financial statements, the company paid cash dividends totaling $10,179 million, which reduced retained earnings [4]. This is evident from the statement, \"Cash dividends ($5.31 per share) (10,179)\" [image5]. The payment of dividends directly affects the company's cash flow, as it represents a cash outflow from the company to its shareholders.\n\nAdditionally, the company engaged in treasury stock transactions, which further influenced its equity structure. Specifically, Chevron issued 17,635,477 shares while purchasing 13,015,737 shares [image5]. The net effect of these transactions resulted in a slight increase in the number of outstanding shares, but more importantly, it affected the treasury stock account. The purchases of treasury shares amounted to $1,383 million, which is recorded as a reduction in the treasury stock account [image5].\n\nThese transactions are also reflected in the cash flow statement. The cash flow from financing activities section shows that the net sales (purchases) of treasury shares resulted in a cash inflow of $38 million [image6]. However, the total cash outflow due to cash dividends was $10,179 million, which is a significant drain on the company's cash reserves [image6].\n\nIn summary, both cash dividends and treasury stock transactions had a notable impact on Chevron's equity structure and cash flow in 2021, reducing retained earnings and affecting the company's cash position. ![Cash dividends and treasury stock transactions impacted Chevron's equity and cash flow in 2021](image5)"}

According to the financial data, WPB's adjusted revenue decreased by 17% compared to 2019, from $15,655 million to $12,938 million [4]. This decline was primarily driven by a reduction in net interest income and non-interest income, reflecting the impact of lower global interest rates and reduced customer activity [10].\n\nHowever, the performance of WPB was not solely defined by these revenue figures. The segment's ability to maintain a strong presence and continue supporting customers through the pandemic is noteworthy. For instance, WPB kept between 70% to 90% of its branches open and provided payment holidays to customers, demonstrating resilience and commitment to customer service [7].\n\nThe financial performance data also reveals that despite the revenue decline, WPB's contribution to the group's adjusted profit before tax was still significant. The group's overall adjusted profit before tax was $12.1 billion, down 45% from 2019 [1, 2]. WPB's adjusted profit before tax, while not explicitly stated, can be inferred to have been a substantial portion of the group's total, given the segment's importance and the regional focus on Asia, where HSBC saw resilient performances [8].\n\nTo further illustrate the impact of WPB, consider the adjusted revenue breakdown. Wealth Management, a key component of WPB, saw a modest 9% decrease in revenue from $8,633 million to $7,818 million [4]. This segment includes investment distribution, life insurance manufacturing, and Global Private Banking, all of which experienced varying degrees of decline but remained important contributors to the group's financial health.\n\nAdditionally, the launch of HSBC Pinnacle in mainland China highlights the strategic importance of WPB in driving future growth. This new business aims to hire 3,000 wealth professionals over four years and has already made significant strides, with nearly 200 new colleagues advising customers in major cities like Shanghai, Guangzhou, Hangzhou, and Shenzhen [image6]. This initiative underscores HSBC's commitment to expanding its wealth management capabilities in one of the world's largest insurance markets.\n\nIn summary, Wealth and Personal Banking (WPB) made a notable contribution to HSBC's group adjusted profit before tax in 2020, despite the challenging economic conditions. The segment's ability to maintain customer support and expand in key markets like China demonstrates its strategic importance to the group's overall performance. ![HSBC Pinnacle's launch in mainland China](image6)"}

According to the consolidated financial data, the Group recognized a substantial lease liability upon the initial application of AASB 16 on 1 July 2019 [1]. This recognition led to an increase in the lease liability balance, as shown in the consolidated statement where the liability recognized during the period was $50,245,000 [image1].\n\nAdditionally, the lease liabilities were re-measured during the period, resulting in adjustments such as lease payments, interest, and the effect of movements in exchange rates. By the end of the period, the total lease liability balance stood at $167,154,000, with $36,019,000 classified as current and $131,135,000 as non-current [image1].\n\nIn terms of employee benefit liabilities, the Group's financial statements show a relatively stable position between 2019 and 2020. The total employee benefit liabilities, which include liabilities for annual leave and long-service leave, slightly increased from $4,054,000 in 2019 to $4,092,000 in 2020 [image3]. These liabilities are calculated based on undiscounted amounts and include related on-costs such as workers' compensation insurance and payroll tax [1].\n\nThe transition to AASB 16 also affected the Group's approach to recognizing lease-related provisions. Previously, the Group recognized provisions for onerous leases and straight-line rent. However, under AASB 16, these provisions are no longer recognized. Instead, the payments due under the leases are included in the lease liability [image2][image7]. This change simplifies the accounting treatment and aligns it with the new standard.\n\nIn summary, the financial impacts of the transition to AASB 16 on lease liabilities were significant, with a notable increase in the lease liability balance, while the employee benefit liabilities remained relatively stable."}

This slight reduction in the negative impact slightly improved the 2020 results.\n2. **Restructuring and Impairment Charges**: In 2020, PBNA incurred restructuring and impairment charges totaling $66 million, while in 2019, these charges amounted to $51 million. The increase in these charges negatively affected the 2020 results.\n3. **Inventory Fair Value Adjustments and Merger and Integration Charges**: These adjustments and charges amounted to $66 million in 2020, compared to $55 million in 2019. This increase also contributed to the decline in operating profit.\n4. **Pension-Related Settlement Charge**: In 2020, there was a pension-related settlement charge of $205 million, which significantly impacted the reported operating profit. This charge did not affect the core non-GAAP measure. ![{Pension-related settlement charge significantly impacted the reported operating profit in 2020.}](image2)\n\nIn summary, the reported GAAP measure for PBNA decreased by 11% from 2019 to 2020, and the core non-GAAP measure decreased by 8% over the same period. The primary influencing factors were the increase in restructuring and impairment charges, inventory fair value adjustments, and a significant pension-related settlement charge in 2020."}

According to the data, net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2020, was $9,812 million, a decrease of $278 million compared to 2019 [6]. This decrease can be attributed to higher working capital requirements and higher cash payments for asset impairment and exit costs, partially offset by higher net earnings [6].\n\nNext, we examine the net cash used in investing activities. For the year ended December 31, 2020, net cash used in investing activities was $1.2 billion, a decrease of $700 million from 2019 [2]. This reduction was primarily due to the deconsolidation of RBH and lower capital expenditures, partially offset by higher cash collateral posted to secure derivatives designated as net investment hedges [2].\n\nFinally, we consider the net cash used in financing activities. For the year ended December 31, 2020, net cash used in financing activities was $8.5 billion, an increase of $400 million from 2019 [3]. This increase was mainly due to higher payments to noncontrolling interests and higher dividends paid, partially offset by debt activity [3].\n\nCombining these changes, we can see the overall impact on the cash balance. The cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash balance at the end of 2019 was $6,865 million. By the end of 2020, this balance increased to $7,285 million [image4]. This increase of $420 million is the result of the net changes in operating, investing, and financing activities over the year.\n\nThe net increase in cash can be summarized as follows:\n- Net cash provided by operating activities: $9,812 million (down $278 million from 2019)\n- Net cash used in investing activities: $1.2 billion (down $700 million from 2019)\n- Net cash used in financing activities: $8.5 billion (up $400 million from 2019)\n\nThese changes collectively contributed to the overall increase in the cash balance from $6,865 million at the end of 2019 to $7,285 million at the end of 2020 [image4].\n\nIn conclusion, the changes in net cash from operating, investing, and financing activities from 2019 to 2020 resulted in an overall increase in the cash balance at the end of 2020 by $420 million."}

According to the policy, the Annual Total Remuneration for executives is determined based on several key factors, including consolidated operating income, the volatility of Toyota's share price, and individual performance evaluations [1]. This ensures that the remuneration is not only reflective of the company's overall financial health but also tied to the performance of the individual directors.\n\nThe remuneration structure includes both fixed and performance-linked components. The fixed remuneration is set based on the member's job responsibilities and the remuneration standards of their home country, ensuring a stable base salary [2]. However, the performance-linked remuneration, which constitutes a significant portion of the total remuneration, is directly tied to the company's financial performance and individual contributions [1].\n\nTo illustrate, the evaluation method for performance-linked remuneration involves assessing the degree of attainment of consolidated operating income against a required income target set for Toyota's sustainable growth. Additionally, the volatility of Toyota's share price is compared against the Nikkei stock average to gauge market performance [7]. This dual evaluation ensures that the remuneration reflects both the company's operational success and its market standing.\n\nFurthermore, the remuneration system is designed to promote medium- to long-term corporate value improvement, which is crucial for maintaining shareholder value [5]. The Board of Directors plays a critical role in this process by setting the policy for determining remuneration and delegating the specific amounts to the Executive Compensation Meeting, which then makes decisions based on corporate performance and individual job responsibilities [10].\n\nThe importance of shareholder value is also evident in Toyota's commitment to stable and continuous dividend payments, aiming to maintain and improve upon a consolidated payout ratio of 30% [9]. This focus on shareholder returns is further supported by the company's strategic investments in next-generation growth areas, such as environmental and safety technologies, which are expected to drive long-term value creation.\n\nIn summary, Toyota's executive remuneration system is closely aligned with business performance and shareholder value indicators, ensuring that executives are incentivized to contribute to the company's sustainable growth and financial success. ![Toyota's executive remuneration is tied to both financial performance and market volatility, reflecting a balanced approach to compensation.](image7)"}

According to the consolidated operating profit comparison, the sales volume contributed $7,563 million to the overall revenue increase, while price realization added $932 million [9]. This indicates that the primary drivers of the revenue growth were higher sales volumes and favorable pricing strategies.\n\n### Construction Industries\nThe Construction Industries segment saw a substantial improvement in sales, increasing by 31 percent to $22.106 billion in 2021 [3]. This growth was primarily due to higher sales volume, favorable price realization, and positive currency impacts, particularly from the Chinese yuan, euro, and Australian dollar. The increase in sales volume was driven by higher end-user demand for equipment and aftermarket parts, as well as the impact from changes in dealer inventories. Dealers decreased their inventories during 2020 but kept them relatively flat in 2021 [3].\n\n### Resource Industries\nThe Resource Industries segment also showed significant improvements, with total sales increasing by 27 percent to $9.963 billion in 2021 [6]. The increase was mainly attributed to higher sales volume, driven by higher end-user demand for equipment and aftermarket parts, and favorable price realization. The end-user demand was notably higher in mining, heavy construction, and quarry and aggregates [6].\n\n### Energy & Transportation\nThe Energy & Transportation segment experienced a 16 percent increase in sales to $20.287 billion in 2021 [11]. Sales increased across all applications and inter-segment sales, further contributing to the overall revenue growth. The segment's performance was supported by higher sales volume and favorable price realization [11].\n\n### Regional Performance\n- **Asia/Pacific**: Sales increased by 15 percent, driven by higher end-user demand for equipment and services, the impact of changes in dealer inventories, and favorable currency impacts related to a stronger Australian dollar and Chinese yuan [1].\n- **Latin America**: Sales grew by 51 percent, primarily due to higher end-user demand for equipment and services and the impact from changes in dealer inventories [7].\n- **North America**: Sales increased by 23 percent, driven by higher end-user demand for equipment and services, the impact from changes in dealer inventories, and favorable price realization [8].\n- **EAME**: Sales rose by 24 percent, influenced by higher end-user demand for equipment and services, the impact of changes in dealer inventories, favorable currency impacts primarily related to a stronger euro and British pound, and favorable price realization [12].\n\n### Visual Representation\nThe visual representation of the consolidated operating profit comparison clearly illustrates the significant contributions of sales volume and price realization to the overall revenue increase [image4].

This decline was driven by a combination of factors including lower net interest income and noninterest income.\n  - **Net Interest Income**: Net interest income decreased from $28,158 million in 2019 to $24,698 million in 2020, a decrease of $3,460 million or 12% [6]. This reduction was primarily due to lower interest rates, which affected the net interest yield.\n  - **Noninterest Income**: Noninterest income decreased from $10,429 million in 2019 to $8,564 million in 2020, a decrease of $1,865 million or 18% [6]. The decline was driven by lower card income due to decreased client activity and lower other income due to the allocation of asset and liability management (ALM) results.\n\n- **Net Income**: Net income for Consumer Banking decreased from $12,962 million in 2019 to $6,507 million in 2020, a decrease of $6,455 million or 50% [6]. This significant drop was primarily due to lower revenue, higher provision for credit losses, and higher expenses.\n\n### Global Wealth & Investment Management (GWIM) Segment\n\nFor the GWIM segment, which consists of Merrill Lynch Global Wealth Management (MLGWM) and Bank of America Private Bank, the revenue and net income changes can be summarized as follows:\n\n- **Revenue**: The total revenue for GWIM decreased from $19,538 million in 2019 to $18,584 million in 2020, a decrease of $954 million or 5% [7].\n  - **MLGWM Revenue**: MLGWM revenue decreased from $16,112 million in 2019 to $15,292 million in 2020, a decrease of $820 million or 5% [7]. This decline was primarily driven by the impact of lower interest rates, partially offset by the benefits of higher market valuations and positive AUM flows.\n  - **Bank of America Private Bank Revenue**: Bank of America Private Bank revenue decreased from $3,426 million in 2019 to $3,292 million in 2020, a decrease of $134 million or 4% [7]. This decline was also driven by the impact of lower interest rates.\n\n- **Net Income**: Net income for GWIM decreased from $4,251 million in 2019 to $3,075 million in 2020, a decrease of $1,176 million or 28% [7]. This decrease was primarily due to the lower revenue and higher provision for credit losses.\n\n### Visual Representation\n\nTo further illustrate these changes, consider the following visual representation from the provided images:\n\n- **Revenue and Net Income Changes for Consumer Banking**:\n  ![Revenue and Net Income Changes for Consumer Banking](image6)\n  This image shows the detailed breakdown of revenue and net income changes for the Consumer Banking segment, highlighting the significant decreases in both categories.\n\n- **Revenue and Net Income Changes for GWIM**:\n  ![Revenue and Net Income Changes for GWIM](image7)\n  This image provides a clear view of the revenue and net income changes for the GWIM segment, showing the modest decreases in both categories.\n\nIn conclusion, both the Consumer Banking and GWIM segments experienced revenue and net income declines in 2020 compared to 2019, with Consumer Banking seeing more pronounced drops due to lower interest rates and decreased client activity."}

This contrasts with 2019, where the company recorded a credit of $36 million due to the sale of a manufacturing facility in Greenock, Scotland [9].\n\nThe inclusion of these charges in the operating profit is evident in the quarterly financial data. For 2020, the operating profit was affected by the $24 million charge, reducing it in the second quarter. In contrast, 2019 saw a positive impact on operating profit due to the $36 million credit [![Operating profit was reduced by $24 million in Q2 2020 and increased by $36 million in 2019](image5)].\n\nOverall, the restructuring charges in 2020 negatively impacted the operating profit, while the 2019 credit positively influenced it.

According to the financial data, the comprehensive income in 2018 was approximately $2,005$ million, while in 2020, it reached approximately $3,952$ million [5]. This represents a substantial increase of about $1,947$ million.\n\nSeveral key factors contributed to this increase:\n\n1. **Foreign Currency Translation Adjustments**: One of the most significant contributors was the foreign currency translation adjustments. In 2020, Danaher recorded a foreign currency translation gain of approximately $2.9$ billion, compared to a translation loss of $75$ million in 2019 [3]. This positive swing in foreign currency translation adjustments had a substantial impact on the comprehensive income.\n\n2. **Net Earnings**: The net earnings from continuing operations also saw a notable increase. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the net earnings from continuing operations were approximately $3.6$ billion, compared to $2.4$ billion in 2019 [6]. This increase was driven by higher sales, particularly from the acquisition of Cytiva, and a gain on the sale of certain product lines.\n\n3. **Pension and Postretirement Plan Benefit Adjustments**: While there was an increase in the pension and postretirement plan benefit loss in 2020, it was relatively modest. The company recorded a pension and postretirement plan benefit loss of $147$ million in 2020, compared to a loss of $90$ million in 2019 [3]. Although this contributed to a slight negative impact, it was not a major factor in the overall increase in comprehensive income.\n\n4. **Cash Flow Hedge Adjustments**: The cash flow hedge adjustments also played a role. In 2020, the company recorded a net positive adjustment, contributing to the overall comprehensive income [5].\n\n5. **Acquisition and Divestiture Activities**: The acquisition of Cytiva and the divestiture of certain product lines also contributed to the increase in comprehensive income. The Cytiva acquisition added to the company's revenue and earnings, while the divestiture of certain product lines resulted in a pretax gain of $455$ million [2].\n\n6. **Noncontrolling Interests**: The changes in noncontrolling interests also had an impact. In 2020, the noncontrolling interests decreased by $692$ million, reflecting the deconsolidation of Envista and the elimination of the noncontrolling interest [1].\n\n7. **Operating Cash Flows**: The operating cash flows benefited from higher net earnings in 2020, which included a net discrete noncash tax benefit of $85$ million, compared to a net discrete noncash tax charge of $215$ million in 2019 [11].\n\nTo visualize the geographical distribution of revenue, which also indirectly supports the comprehensive income, we can look at the revenue breakdown by region [![Revenue breakdown by region in 2020](image2)](image2).\n\nIn conclusion, the comprehensive income of Danaher Corporation increased from 2018 to 2020 primarily due to significant foreign currency translation gains, higher net earnings, and positive contributions from acquisition and divestiture activities."}

According to the text, actuarial assumptions include discount rates, expected compensation increases, and pension progression rates [3]. These assumptions are crucial for calculating the defined benefit obligation (DBO) and the fair value of plan assets.\n\n### Discount Rates\nThe discount rates for different currencies are shown in the image below:\n![{Discount rates for various currencies in 2021 and 2020}](image2)\n- Euro: Increased from 0.9% to 1.0%\n- U.S. dollar: Increased from 24% to 27%\n- British pound: Increased from 1.7% to 1.9%\n- Swiss franc: Increased from 0.2% to 0.4%\n\nAn increase in discount rates generally reduces the present value of future obligations, leading to a decrease in the defined benefit obligation. This is reflected in the sensitivity analysis, which shows the effect of a 0.5 percentage point change in the discount rate:\n![{Effect of a 0.5 percentage point change in the discount rate on the defined benefit obligation}](image7)\n- For a 0.5 percentage point increase in the discount rate, the defined benefit obligation decreased by €271 million in 2021 and €266 million in 2020.\n\n### Compensation Increase\nThe compensation increase assumptions for the United Kingdom and Switzerland are shown in the image below:\n![{Compensation increase assumptions for the United Kingdom and Switzerland in 2021 and 2020}](image3)\n- United Kingdom: Increased from 2.6% to 3.0%\n- Switzerland: Increased from 1.4% to 1.5%\n\nAn increase in compensation rates typically increases the defined benefit obligation. However, the impact is relatively small compared to changes in discount rates.\n\n### Pension Progression\nThe pension progression assumptions for Germany and the United Kingdom are also shown in the image:\n![{Pension progression assumptions for Germany and the United Kingdom in 2021 and 2020}](image3)\n- Germany: Remained unchanged at 1.5%\n- United Kingdom: Increased from 2.6% to 3.0%\n\nAn increase in pension progression rates similarly increases the defined benefit obligation.\n\n### Total Actuarial Gains and Losses\nThe total actuarial gains and losses, which capture the combined effect of changes in actuarial assumptions, are shown in the image below:\n![{Total actuarial gains and losses in 2021 and 2020}](image4)\n- In 2021, there was a net actuarial loss of €22 million.\n- In 2020, there was a net actuarial gain of €67 million.\n\nThese figures indicate that the overall impact of changes in actuarial assumptions in 2021 was a slight increase in the defined benefit obligation, despite the positive impact of higher discount rates.\n\n### Plan Assets\nThe fair value of plan assets also changed from 2020 to 2021. The breakdown of plan assets is shown in the image below:\n![{Breakdown of plan assets in 2021 and 2020}](image6)\n- Total plan assets increased from €2,813 million in 2020 to €3,259 million in 2021.\n\nThis increase in plan assets can be attributed to various factors, including the return on plan assets and additional contributions. However, the actuarial assumptions play a role in the valuation of these assets.\n\n### Conclusion\nChanges in actuarial assumptions, particularly the increase in discount rates, had a significant impact on reducing the defined benefit obligation. Despite this, the net actuarial loss in 2021 indicates that other factors, such as increases in compensation and pension progression, contributed to a slight overall increase in the defined benefit obligation. Additionally, the fair value of plan assets increased, reflecting positive returns and contributions. \n\nIn summary, the changes in actuarial assumptions led to a net reduction in the defined benefit obligation but also contributed to an increase in the fair value of plan assets from 2020 to 2021."}

According to the provided data, the total RWA decreased slightly from 2019 to 2020. Specifically, the total RWA was $453,106 million in 2020 compared to $445,151 million in 2019 [3].\n\nNow, let's break down the changes in specific RWA components:\n\n1. **Credit Risk RWA**: \n   - Increased from $342,684 million in 2019 to $387,066 million in 2020, a change of $44,382 million under the Standardized Approach, and from $228,927 million to $284,930 million, a change of $56,003 million under the Advanced Approach. This increase was primarily driven by derivatives exposures, investment securities, and lending commitments [12]. ![Credit risk RWA increased significantly in 2020](image3)\n\n2. **Market Risk RWA**:\n   - Increased from $51,493 million in 2019 to $66,040 million in 2020 under both the Standardized and Advanced Approaches. This increase was mainly due to higher Regulatory VaR, reflecting increased market volatility [8]. ![Market risk RWA also saw a notable increase in 2020](image3)\n\n3. **Operational Risk RWA**:\n   - Decreased from $101,972 million in 2019 to $94,181 million in 2020. This decrease reflects a decline in the frequency and severity of litigation-related losses [1]. ![Operational risk RWA decreased in 2020](image3)\n\nNext, let's examine the impact on External TLAC as a percentage of RWA:\n\n- **External TLAC as a % of RWA**:\n  - In 2019, External TLAC as a percentage of RWA was 47.7%.\n  - In 2020, this ratio decreased to 46.3%. ![External TLAC as a percentage of RWA decreased from 2019 to 2020](image7)\n\nDespite the overall increase in RWA components like credit risk and market risk, the slight decrease in the total RWA and the reduction in operational risk RWA contributed to a slight decrease in the External TLAC as a percentage of RWA from 2019 to 2020.\n\nIn conclusion, the changes in various components of RWA, particularly the increases in credit risk and market risk RWA, along with the decrease in operational risk RWA, resulted in a slight decrease in the External TLAC as a percentage of RWA from 2019 to 2020."}

This decline can be attributed to the support provided for marketing, including incentives to franchisees and the free Thank You Meals served to first responders and healthcare workers [8]. Despite these challenges, the U.S. segment saw positive sales performance, especially in the second half of 2020, driven by strategic marketing investments and growth in delivery services [10].\n\n![{U.S. and International Operated Markets revenue changes from 2019 to 2020, showing a 10% decrease in U.S. and a more significant decrease in International Operated Markets.}](image4)\n\nIn the International Operated Markets segment, the decline was even more pronounced. Total company-operated sales and franchised revenues decreased by 19% (14% in constant currencies) [8]. This was primarily due to the temporary closures and limited operations in key markets such as the U.K., France, Germany, Italy, and Spain [12]. These markets faced significant sales declines, which were only partially offset by positive results in Australia [10].\n\nThe company's financial performance in the International Operated Markets segment was further impacted by over $100 million in support for marketing to accelerate recovery and drive growth, as well as incremental COVID-19 expenses for employee-related costs and restaurant closing costs [6].\n\n![{Franchised and company-operated margins for the U.S. and International Operated Markets segments, showing a decrease in both segments from 2019 to 2020.}](image2)\n\nOverall, the revenue composition and growth rates of McDonald's U.S. and International Operated Markets segments were significantly influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to decreased sales and increased operational costs.

The text [2] provides the gross value of PPE under finance leases, which increased from $2,080 million in 2019 to $2,280 million in 2020. The accumulated depreciation on these assets also increased from $483 million in 2019 to $816 million in 2020. This significant increase in accumulated depreciation resulted in a lower net value of PPE.\n\nTo summarize, the increase in accumulated depreciation from 2019 to 2020 had a negative impact on the net value of both solar energy systems and property, plant, and equipment, leading to a decrease in their net values. ![The net value of solar energy systems decreased from $6,061 million in 2019 to $5,906 million in 2020 due to increased accumulated depreciation.](image5)\n\nIn conclusion, the accumulated depreciation significantly reduced the net value of both solar energy systems and property, plant, and equipment from 2019 to 2020."}

The increase in net income and comprehensive income from 2018 to 2020 led to a corresponding increase in retained earnings and a reduction in the accumulated other comprehensive loss.\n\nFor instance, the net income in 2020 was $5,185,313, which contributed to the retained earnings, increasing it from $10,421,538 in 2019 to $12,315,999 in 2020. Similarly, the comprehensive income in 2020 was $5,472,296, which helped reduce the accumulated other comprehensive loss from $(1,840,577) in 2019 to $(1,561,837) in 2020.\n\nTherefore, the net income and comprehensive income positively impacted total shareholders' equity, leading to an overall increase from $10,724,588 in 2018 to $17,499,173 in 2020. ![Total Shareholders' Equity increased from 2018 to 2020](image1)"}

The balance sheet data reflects these changes, particularly in the cash and cash equivalents, available-for-sale debt securities, and total loans categories.\n\nThe sale of WFAM resulted in a substantial decrease in the company's assets under management, as shown in the table [image5]. At the beginning of 2021, the total WFAM assets under management were $603.0 billion. By the end of the year, this figure dropped to $587.1 billion, primarily due to outflows and the market impact, but also significantly affected by the sale itself.\n\nThis reduction in assets under management is reflected in the balance sheet data for 2021. Specifically, there was a notable increase in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash, which rose from $183,420 million in 2020 to $236,124 million in 2021 [image1]. This increase can be attributed to the proceeds from the sale of WFAM and other strategic actions to manage liquidity and interest rate risk.\n\nConversely, there was a decrease in available-for-sale debt securities, which fell from $221,493 million in 2020 to $181,841 million in 2021 [image1]. This decline aligns with the company's efforts to rebalance its portfolio and manage liquidity, likely influenced by the reduced need to hold these securities following the sale of WFAM.\n\nAdditionally, the total loans category saw a significant decrease, dropping from $19,790 million in 2020 to $9,766 million in 2021 [image1]. This reduction is partly due to the sale of the student loan portfolio, as mentioned in the text [11], but also reflects the broader impact of the WFAM sale on the company's overall asset base.\n\nOverall, the changes in 'Total WFAM assets under management' significantly impacted Wells Fargo's balance sheet, leading to increases in cash and cash equivalents and decreases in available-for-sale debt securities and total loans. ![The sale of WFAM led to a significant reduction in assets under management and a corresponding impact on the balance sheet](image5)"}

This decline in NII was partly offset by interest income from the growth in average interest-earning assets (AIEA), which increased by $170.1$ billion or $8.8\\%$ [9].\n\nThe interest expense also saw a significant reduction, decreasing by $10.055$ billion from $24.233$ billion in 2019 to $14.178$ billion in 2020 [1]. This reduction was driven by lower market interest rates, which more than compensated for the growth in interest-bearing customer accounts [11].\n\nThe decrease in NII and the reduction in interest expense collectively impacted the net operating income. Despite the decrease in NII, the reduction in interest expense helped mitigate the overall negative impact on net operating income. However, the net operating income still decreased from $53.342$ billion in 2019 to $41.612$ billion in 2020 [5]. This decrease in net operating income, coupled with an increase in expected credit losses and other credit impairment charges, led to a significant reduction in the overall profitability of the organization.

This decline is primarily due to a significant reduction in interest and other investment income, which fell by 44.4% from $1,059 million in 2020 to $589 million in 2021 [6]. The primary reasons for this decline include:\n\n- **Lower Income from Short-Term Investments and Fixed Maturity Securities**: As mentioned, interest and other investment income declined by $470 million (44.4%) in 2021 compared to 2020. This decline was mainly due to lower income from short-term investments and fixed maturity securities [9].\n- **Low Interest Rates**: Short-term interest rates declined over the second half of 2019 and throughout 2020, and low rates prevailed through 2021, resulting in significantly lower interest income [9].\n\n### Railroad Operating Earnings\n\nRailroad operating earnings in 2021 were $8,811 million, an increase of 11.8% from $7,152 million in 2020. This improvement can be attributed to several factors:\n\n- **Higher Volumes and Revenue per Car/Unit**: Railroad operating revenues increased by 11.6% in 2021 compared to 2020, reflecting a 6.9% increase in volume and a 3.5% increase in average revenue per car/unit [5].\n- **Recovery from the Pandemic**: The revenue changes in 2021 were driven by continued improvements from the 2020 effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by ongoing disruptions in the global supply chain [5].\n- **Productivity Improvements**: Despite higher volumes and average fuel prices, the ratio of railroad operating expenses to railroad operating revenues decreased by 0.7 percentage points to 60.9% in 2021 versus 2020, indicating productivity improvements [11].\n\n### Visual Representation\n\nTo further illustrate these changes, let's look at the financial breakdown:\n\n- **Net Investment Income**:\n  - 2021: $4,807 million\n  - 2020: $5,039 million\n  - Percentage Change: -5.0%\n  - ![{Net investment income decreased by 5.0% from 2020 to 2021.}](image6)\n\n- **Railroad Operating Earnings**:\n  - 2021: $8,811 million\n  - 2020: $7,152 million\n  - Percentage Change: 11.8%\n  - ![{Railroad operating earnings increased by 11.8% from 2020 to 2021.}](image8)\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn summary, net investment income decreased by 5.0% from 2020 to 2021, primarily due to lower income from short-term investments and fixed maturity securities, exacerbated by low interest rates. Conversely, railroad operating earnings increased by 11.8% from 2020 to 2021, driven by higher volumes, increased revenue per car/unit, and productivity improvements, as the industry recovered from the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic."}

However, to get the complete picture, we need to consider the shareholders' equity from 2018, which is not directly provided in the text but can be inferred from the changes in the balance sheet components.\n\nFrom the balance sheet [3], we can see the following key components of shareholders' equity for 2019:\n- Preferred stock: $0\n- Common stock: $16.6 million\n- Additional paid-in capital: $7,903.6 million\n- Retained earnings: $53,908.1 million\n- Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss): $(2,586.8) million\n- Common stock in treasury: $(67,066.4) million\n\nFor 2018, we can infer the changes in these components:\n- Preferred stock: $0\n- Common stock: $16.6 million\n- Additional paid-in capital: $7,653.9 million\n- Retained earnings: $52,930.5 million\n- Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss): $(2,482.7) million\n- Common stock in treasury: $(66,328.6) million\n\nCalculating the total shareholders' equity for 2018:\n\\[ \\text{Total Shareholders' Equity (2018)} = 16.6 + 7,653.9 + 52,930.5 - 2,482.7 - 66,328.6 = 4,800.7 \\]\n\nNow, comparing the total shareholders' equity from 2018 to 2020:\n- 2018: $4,800.7 million\n- 2020: $52,626.8 million\n\nThis shows a significant increase in total shareholders' equity from 2018 to 2020.\n\nNext, let's look at the number of systemwide restaurants.

Specifically, the expenses were $1,126 million in 2018, $1,878 million in 2019, and $2,119 million in 2020 [image1]. This trend indicates a significant rise in compensation expenses over the three-year period, with a particularly notable increase from 2019 to 2020.\n\nIn 2020, the distribution of these expenses across different business segments was as follows:\n- **Institutional Securities**: $851 million\n- **Wealth Management**: $1,000 million\n- **Investment Management**: $268 million\n\nThese figures show that the **Wealth Management** segment had the highest recognized compensation expense, followed by **Institutional Securities** and then **Investment Management** [image1].\n\nThe increase in compensation expenses can be attributed to several factors, including higher discretionary incentive compensation, formulaic payouts to Wealth Management representatives driven by higher revenues, and incremental compensation from the E*TRADE acquisition [3]. Additionally, the higher expenses related to certain deferred compensation plans linked to investment performance also contributed to this trend [3].\n\nIn conclusion, the total recognized compensation expenses increased significantly from 2018 to 2020, with the Wealth Management segment accounting for the largest portion of these expenses in 2020. ![Total recognized compensation expenses increased from 2018 to 2020, with the Wealth Management segment having the highest expenses in 2020.](image1)"}

Let's break down these changes and their implications.\n\n### Lease Assets\n\nIn 2020, the company's operating lease right-of-use (ROU) assets, classified under other long-term assets, increased from $764 million in 2019 to $942 million in 2020. This increase can be attributed to the acquisitions made in 2020, particularly the Cytiva Acquisition, which brought in additional lease assets. The increase in lease assets is also reflected in the higher operating lease liabilities, which rose from $719 million in 2019 to $974 million in 2020. This reflects the company's expanded operations and the associated lease commitments.\n\nThe weighted average remaining lease term remained consistent at 7 years, but the weighted average discount rate decreased slightly from 3.1% in 2019 to 2.8% in 2020. This decrease in the discount rate could indicate a lower cost of capital or a change in market conditions, which affects the present value of future lease payments.\n\n![{Lease assets and liabilities increased in 2020, reflecting the company's expanded operations and new lease commitments.}](image4)\n\n### Inventories\n\nThe company's inventories also saw notable changes. In 2020, the total inventory value increased from $1,628 million in 2019 to $2,292 million in 2020. This increase is primarily due to higher finished goods, which rose from $833 million in 2019 to $1,232 million in 2020. Work in process and raw materials also increased, from $285 million to $369 million and from $510 million to $691 million, respectively.\n\nThese increases in inventory levels can be attributed to several factors. First, the company's overall sales volume increased by 24.5% in 2020 compared to 2019, driven by the Cytiva Acquisition and strong demand in various markets. Second, the company likely increased its inventory to meet the higher demand and ensure supply chain stability, especially during the pandemic.\n\n![{Inventories increased in 2020, reflecting higher sales volumes and the company's efforts to meet increased demand.}](image6)\n\n### Financial Statement Reflections\n\nThese changes in lease assets and inventories are reflected in the company's financial statements in several ways:\n\n1. **Operating Cash Flows**: The increase in inventory levels used $160 million in operating cash flows in 2020, compared to $161 million in 2019. This indicates that the company invested more in inventory, which temporarily reduced its operating cash flows.\n\n2. **Cost of Sales**: The higher inventory levels and the Cytiva Acquisition contributed to a significant increase in the cost of sales in 2020. Specifically, the cost of sales increased by $457 million due to the fair value adjustments to inventory in connection with the Cytiva Acquisition [2].\n\n3. **Operating Lease Expenses**: The total operating lease expense increased from $241 million in 2019 to $262 million in 2020, reflecting the higher lease liabilities and the expanded operations [3].\n\n4. **Net Earnings**: Despite the higher costs and investments, the company's net earnings from continuing operations increased significantly in 2020, contributing to the overall positive operating cash flows [3].\n\nIn conclusion, the changes in the company's lease assets and inventories between 2019 and 2020 reflect its strategic expansion and increased operational activities, particularly due to the Cytiva Acquisition and the strong demand in the markets it serves."}

This increase can be attributed to several factors, including the reduction in deferred tax liabilities and the slight decrease in the valuation allowance.\n\nAdditionally, the changes in uncertain tax positions played a significant role. The balance of uncertain tax positions decreased from $303 million in 2019 to $89 million in 2020 [1]. This reduction was primarily due to the reversal of a significant tax benefit and related interest expense for a depreciation-related uncertain tax position [1].\n\n![{The balance of uncertain tax positions decreased significantly from 2019 to 2020, contributing to the increase in net deferred tax asset.}](image1)\n\nIn summary, the net deferred tax asset increased from $119 million in 2019 to $253 million in 2020, primarily due to a reduction in deferred tax liabilities and a decrease in the balance of uncertain tax positions."}

According to the data provided, the total restructuring costs for the years ended June 30, 2022, and 2021 are as follows:\n\nFor the year ended June 30, 2022, the total restructuring charges were $253 million. These charges were distributed as follows:\n- SG&A: $67 million\n- Costs of products sold: $182 million\n- Other non-operating income, net: $4 million\n\nFor the year ended June 30, 2021, the total restructuring charges were $330 million. These charges were distributed as follows:\n- SG&A: $176 million\n- Costs of products sold: $134 million\n- Other non-operating income, net: $20 million\n\nFrom this, we can see that the total restructuring costs decreased from $330 million in 2021 to $253 million in 2022. The main components of these costs remained consistent, with the majority of the charges being related to Costs of products sold and SG&A.\n\nAdditionally, the restructuring costs incurred in fiscal 2022 were primarily composed of employee separation costs, asset-related costs, and other restructuring-type charges. Specifically, the employee separation costs relate to severance packages, while the asset-related costs involve asset write-downs and accelerated depreciation. These costs are typically associated with manufacturing consolidations and technology standardizations [5].\n\nThe restructuring accruals as of June 30, 2022, amounted to $147 million, which are classified as current liabilities. Approximately 65% of the restructuring charges incurred in fiscal 2022 either have been or will be settled with cash [10]. This indicates a significant portion of the restructuring activities involves cash outflows.\n\nIn summary, the total restructuring costs decreased from $330 million in 2021 to $253 million in 2022, with the main components being employee separation costs and asset-related costs. ![Total restructuring costs decreased from $330 million in 2021 to $253 million in 2022](image5)"}

This significant increase in shareholdings suggests a strong commitment to the company and potentially a belief in its future growth and profitability.\n\nNext, let's examine the remuneration changes. The image detailing the remuneration of S Fallscheer shows the following:\n\n- **Performance Rights/Options granted**:\n  - **FY19**: 2,564,103 options valued at $8,000,000\n  - **FY20**: 956,328 options valued at $3,000,000\n\n- **Included in Remuneration**:\n  - **FY19**: $(133,333)\n  - **FY20**: $150,000\n\n- **% Forfeited**:\n  - **FY19**: 100%\n  - **FY20**: 0%\n\n- **% Vested in the Period**:\n  - **FY19**: 100%\n  - **FY20**: 0%\n\nFrom this data, we can see that while S Fallscheer was granted fewer options in FY20 compared to FY19, the value of the options granted in FY20 was still substantial at $3,000,000. Additionally, the remuneration included in the financial statements for FY20 was positive at $150,000, whereas it was negative in FY19 at $(133,333). This suggests an improvement in the financial recognition of their remuneration [6].\n\nFurthermore, the fact that no options were forfeited in FY20, unlike the 100% forfeiture in FY19, indicates a more stable and positive outlook for S Fallscheer's remuneration package. This stability and the positive financial recognition could enhance S Fallscheer's financial position and align their interests more closely with those of the shareholders.\n\nIn conclusion, S Fallscheer's shareholding increased significantly from 4,140,000 shares in FY19 to 5,827,764 shares in FY20, and their remuneration showed a positive shift with a higher value of options granted and no forfeitures. These changes imply a stronger financial position and a closer alignment with shareholder interests. ![S Fallscheer's shareholdings and remuneration details](image10)"}

However, the company is also managing these expenses carefully, as evidenced by the controlled growth in these areas relative to revenue growth. This balanced approach to financial management is crucial for sustainable long-term success.\n\nIn conclusion, the company's financial management strategy involves significant investments in content, R&D, and marketing, which are essential for driving user growth and maintaining a competitive advantage in the market."}

According to the data, noncurrent assets increased by $3,039 million from 2019 to 2020, primarily driven by an increase in deferred taxes and prepaid pension assets [7]. This increase in noncurrent assets suggests a strengthening of IBM's long-term financial position, as it indicates a buildup in assets that can provide future economic benefits.\n\nHowever, this positive trend is somewhat offset by the decrease in long-term financing receivables, which declined by $1,626 million [9]. This reduction could be due to sales of receivables and changes in product cycles, reflecting a strategic decision to manage the asset portfolio more efficiently.\n\nIn terms of long-term debt, the total long-term debt remained relatively stable, with only a slight increase from $54,102 million in 2019 to $54,355 million in 2020 [8]. This stability in long-term debt, combined with the increase in noncurrent assets, suggests that IBM has maintained a balanced approach to its capital structure, avoiding excessive leverage while still investing in growth opportunities.\n\nThe impact of these changes on cash flows and equity is also noteworthy. Cash flows from financing activities were a net use of $9,721 million in 2020, compared to a net source of $9,042 million in 2019 [2]. This shift indicates a significant outflow of cash, primarily driven by a decrease in cash provided by net non-operating finance receivables and an increase in cash used for net purchases of marketable securities and other investments [4]. Despite this, the overall net change in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash was positive at $5,361 million in 2020 [5].\n\nTotal equity decreased by $258 million from 2019 to 2020, primarily due to dividends paid and a decline in accumulated other comprehensive income, partially offset by net income and common stock increases [6]. This modest decrease in equity, coupled with the positive cash flow, suggests that IBM is maintaining a strong financial foundation while managing its capital efficiently.\n\nOverall, the financial changes in noncurrent assets and long-term debt, along with the cash flow and equity trends, indicate that IBM is strategically positioning itself for long-term stability and growth. ![Noncurrent assets increased, reflecting a stronger long-term financial position](image8) The company's balanced approach to managing its asset portfolio and capital structure supports its overall financial standing."}

Specifically, the home equity portfolio decreased by $5.9 billion in 2020, primarily due to paydowns outpacing new originations and draws on existing lines [1]. Additionally, home equity production in Consumer Banking and for the total Corporation decreased by $2.8 billion and $3.0 billion, respectively, mainly driven by a decline in applications [2].\n\n![Outstanding balances in the home equity portfolio decreased significantly in 2020](image2)\n\nThis reduction in home equity balances and production suggests that consumers were either paying down their existing home equity loans more quickly or were less inclined to take out new home equity loans, possibly due to economic uncertainty or a focus on debt reduction.\n\nTurning to the credit card metrics, the outstandings in the credit card portfolio decreased by $18.9 billion in 2020 to $78.7 billion, due to lower retail spending and higher payments [11]. This decrease aligns with the broader trend of reduced consumer spending, particularly in sectors like travel and entertainment, which were heavily impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Net charge-offs also decreased by $599 million to $2.3 billion, indicating that while consumers were spending less, they were also managing their debts better, likely due to government stimulus benefits and payment deferrals [11].\n\n![Credit card outstandings and net charge-offs decreased in 2020](image7)\n\nThese changes in credit card and home equity metrics suggest that consumers were more cautious with their finances in 2020, prioritizing debt repayment and reducing new borrowing. The decline in applications and new originations further supports this trend, indicating a shift towards financial prudence and a reduction in discretionary spending.\n\nIn conclusion, the decrease in both home equity and credit card metrics between 2019 and 2020 indicates a more conservative approach to borrowing and spending among consumers, likely influenced by the economic uncertainties and financial support measures related to the COVID-19 pandemic."}

According to the report, the financial performance of BHP is highly sensitive to fluctuations in commodity prices, which can affect revenue, EBITDA, and profit after taxation.\n\nFor coal, the report indicates that the Underlying EBITDA for Coal decreased by $1.3 billion to $288 million, primarily due to lower prices and volumes [2]. Specifically, the lower price impacts, net of price-linked costs, amounted to $0.7 billion, while lower volumes decreased Underlying EBITDA by $168 million. Additionally, controllable cash costs increased by $102 million, driven by higher maintenance costs and increased stripping volumes [2]. The table in Image 6 provides a detailed breakdown of the financial metrics for coal, showing a significant decrease in revenue and EBITDA from 2020 to 2021, alongside a drop in average realized prices for both metallurgical and thermal coal [image6].\n\nFor nickel, the impact is more positive. The Underlying EBITDA for Nickel West increased by $296 million to $259 million in FY2021, reflecting higher prices and volumes, and lower maintenance costs following the major quadrennial shutdowns in the prior year [9]. The average realized sales price for FY2021 was $16,250 per tonne, up from $13,860 per tonne in FY2020, driven by positive investor sentiment and strong, geographically diverse demand [6]. The report also notes that an announcement by a major nickel producer to convert some nickel pig iron to nickel matte in Indonesia led to a brief correction in March, but prices rebounded due to strong demand, multi-region supply disruptions, and falling London Metal Exchange stocks [6].\n\nThe key drivers behind these impacts include market prices, which are influenced by global economic and geopolitical factors, industrial activity, and supply and demand dynamics [4]. For coal, the decrease in EBITDA is attributed to lower prices and volumes, as well as increased operational costs [2]. For nickel, the increase in EBITDA is driven by higher prices and volumes, and reduced maintenance costs [9].\n\nIn conclusion, changes in commodity prices have a significant and direct impact on BHP's financial results, with coal experiencing a decline and nickel seeing an improvement in FY2021. ![BHP's financial metrics for coal show a significant decrease in revenue and EBITDA](image6)"}

Specifically, the company generated $18.2 billion in cash from operating activities in 2020, which is an increase of $3.4 billion compared to 2019, when it generated $14.8 billion [7]. This increase was primarily driven by an improvement in cash provided by receivables, which contributed $4.8 billion to the cash flow [7].\n\nIn addition to the strong cash flow from operations, IBM's cash reserves also saw a substantial boost. At the end of 2020, IBM had $14.3 billion in cash, restricted cash, and short-term marketable securities, marking an increase of $5.3 billion from the $9.0 billion reported at the end of 2019 [9]. This growth in cash reserves reflects the company's strategic actions to enhance its balance sheet and liquidity position, including the reduction of financing receivables and the winding down of certain business segments [6].\n\nTo summarize, IBM's net cash from operating activities increased by $3.4 billion, and its cash reserves grew by $5.3 billion from 2019 to 2020. ![{IBM's cash reserves and net cash from operating activities both showed significant increases in 2020 compared to 2019.}](image4)"}

Specifically, the net interest income was $(1,541)$ million in 2021, down from $441$ million in 2020, resulting in a decrease of $1,982$ million [2]. This decrease can be attributed to several factors, including the impact of lower interest rates, lower loan balances reflecting soft demand, elevated prepayments and refinancing activity, and the sale of the student loan portfolio in the first half of 2021 [7].\n\nOn the other hand, noninterest income saw a substantial increase from $4,916$ million in 2020 to $10,036$ million in 2021, marking an increase of $5,120$ million [2]. This growth in noninterest income was primarily driven by higher net gains from equity securities, mortgage banking income, and investment advisory and other asset-based fee income [12].\n\nThe combined effect of these changes on total revenue was a significant increase. Despite the decline in net interest income, the substantial rise in noninterest income resulted in total revenue increasing from $5,357$ million in 2020 to $8,495$ million in 2021, a gain of $3,138$ million [2]. This increase in total revenue reflects the company's ability to diversify its income sources and capitalize on favorable market conditions in 2021.\n\nAdditionally, it is important to note that the impairment of certain rail cars used for the transportation of coal products, which resulted in a $268$ million charge, also impacted the noninterest income negatively [1], [9]. However, this impact was more than offset by the positive contributions from other areas of noninterest income.\n\nOverall, the changes in net interest income and noninterest income significantly influenced the total revenue, leading to a notable improvement in the company's financial performance in 2021 [2].\n\n![{The table shows a significant increase in noninterest income and a decrease in net interest income, contributing to an overall increase in total revenue.}](image2)\n\nIn conclusion, the net interest income decreased while noninterest income increased substantially, resulting in a significant boost to the total revenue in 2021."}

The U.S. segment, which is the largest contributor to the company's net sales, experienced a 16% increase in comparable sales [5].

This growth is particularly noteworthy given that Canada accounts for 8% of the company's net sales and 36% of its operating income [2].

The mineralizations are described in metric to decametric pegmatite bodies, with well-defined zoning, accessible both on the surface and in galleries. The lithium ore occurs as crystals of spodumene among masses of lepidolite and albite. The project is actively being explored by a dedicated geology team responsible for detailed mapping, systematic sampling, and analysis of the pegmatite occurrences [7].\n\n- **Diamond Project**: Located in the State of Minas Gerais, this project comprises a total of 24 mineral rights, including 10 mining concessions, which is the highest level of mining title in Brazil. All the diamond rights are situated along the banks of the Jequitinhonha River in the northern part of Minas Gerais. The Diamantina Plateau, where the river rises, has been a significant source of alluvial diamond production for over 200 years [8]. ![{The diamond project includes 24 mineral rights along the Jequitinhonha River.}](image8)\n\n- **Sand Project**: The sand deposits are located on the banks of the Jequitinhonha River in the state of Minas Gerais. These deposits contain high-quality, commercial-grade sand suitable for construction use. A professional mining engineer surveyor measured one deposit to contain 1,140,400 cubic meters of sand with an average thickness of 3.07 meters, close to the average of 3.19 meters found in the 13 sampled holes. There are several other deposits of similar size thought to exist in the project area [11]. ![{The sand project is located along the Jequitinhonha River.}](image6)\n\n- **Titanium Project**: This project is located in the central-western region of the state of Minas Gerais and is composed of 5 mineral rights.

In 2019, the net income was $7,842 million, and the comprehensive income was $8,083 million [3]. In 2018, the net income was $8,394 million, and the comprehensive income was $8,313 million [3].\n\nFrom these figures, we can observe the following trends:\n- **Net Income**: The net income decreased from $8,394 million in 2018 to $7,842 million in 2019 and further to $7,264 million in 2020.\n- **Comprehensive Income**: The comprehensive income also showed a decline, from $8,313 million in 2018 to $8,083 million in 2019 and then to $6,807 million in 2020.\n\nThese decreases in both net income and comprehensive income suggest that the company faced some financial challenges over the period. The decline in net income could be attributed to various factors such as increased operational costs, lower sales, or other business-specific issues. The comprehensive income, which includes all changes in equity during a period except those resulting from investments by and distributions to owners, also decreased, indicating that the company experienced negative impacts from items like foreign currency translations, cash flow hedges, and available-for-sale securities [3].\n\nAdditionally, the image showing the detailed breakdown of comprehensive income further supports these observations. In 2020, the company reported significant losses on foreign currency translation and other comprehensive losses, which contributed to the overall decrease in comprehensive income [image3: Comprehensive income and its components for 2020, 2019, and 2018 show a decline in 2020].\n\nIn conclusion, the decrease in both net income and comprehensive income from 2018 to 2020 suggests that Amgen faced financial challenges during this period, which could be indicative of broader economic conditions, operational inefficiencies, or other business-specific issues. ![Comprehensive income and its components for 2020, 2019, and 2018 show a decline in 2020](image3)"}

This substantial growth can be attributed to several key factors.\n\nFirstly, the increase in worldwide network volumes played a crucial role. According to the data, worldwide network volumes increased by 24 percent compared to the prior year, reflecting the recovery from the adverse impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic [5]. Specifically, U.S. network volumes saw a 27 percent increase, while non-U.S. network volumes grew by 17 percent [5].\n\nAdditionally, the growth in billed business, which represents 85 percent of total network volumes and drives most of the financial results, increased by 25 percent [3]. This growth was particularly strong in the U.S., where spend increased by 26 percent, exceeding 2019 levels by 6 percent [3].\n\nThe increase in the average discount rate also contributed to the rise in discount revenue. The average discount rate was 2.30 percent in 2021, up from 2.28 percent in 2020 [1]. This slight increase in the average discount rate was driven by a change in the mix of spending, particularly an increase in travel and entertainment (T&E) volumes [1].\n\nFurthermore, the recovery in T&E spend, which grew by 59 percent year-over-year, reflected a steady recovery throughout the year, with fourth-quarter T&E volumes reaching 82 percent of 2019 levels [3]. This recovery in T&E spend, along with the strong performance in goods and services (G&S) spending, which grew by 19 percent on a year-over-year basis, contributed significantly to the overall increase in discount revenue [3].\n\n![{Discount revenue increased by 26% from 2020 to 2021, driven by a 24% increase in worldwide network volumes and a 25% increase in billed business.}](image2)\n\nIn conclusion, the discount revenue increased by 26 percent from 2020 to 2021, primarily due to a significant increase in worldwide network volumes, a rise in the average discount rate, and a strong recovery in both T&E and G&S spend."}

For instance, in 2020, the company repaid $5,933 million in borrowings and paid dividends of $1,006 million, while in 2019, it repaid $1,565 million in borrowings and paid dividends of $224 million.\n\nCombining these factors, we can see that the issuance of mandatory convertible preferred stock and the positive cash flow from financing activities, particularly from stock issuances, significantly increased Danaher Corporation's total stockholders' equity from 2018 to 2020. The total stockholders' equity increased from $62,082 million in 2019 to $76,161 million in 2020, reflecting a substantial growth in the company's equity position.\n\nIn conclusion, the issuance of mandatory convertible preferred stock and the positive cash flow from financing activities, especially from stock issuances, significantly contributed to the increase in Danaher Corporation's total stockholders' equity from 2018 to 2020. ![The total stockholders' equity increased from $62,082 million in 2019 to $76,161 million in 2020](image2)"}

This significant increase can be attributed to several key factors.\n\nFirst, the operating income in 2021 was $20,817 million, up from $17,493 million in 2020, reflecting improved operational performance across various segments [6]. Additionally, the company's focus on cost management and efficiency improvements likely contributed to this growth.\n\nSecond, while depreciation and amortization remained relatively stable at $13,804 million in 2021 compared to $13,100 million in 2020, noncash share-based compensation increased from $1,193 million to $1,315 million [6]. This noncash expense added to the overall cash provided by operating activities.\n\nAnother contributing factor was the change in operating assets and liabilities. In 2021, the company experienced a decrease in operating assets and liabilities of $1,499 million, compared to a decrease of $178 million in 2020 [6]. This suggests better management of working capital, leading to more cash being freed up.\n\nFurthermore, the company received higher proceeds from investments and other activities, totaling $1,246 million in 2021, compared to $190 million in 2020 [6]. This increase in proceeds likely came from the sale of investments and other financial activities, further boosting cash flow.\n\nLastly, the decrease in income tax payments from $3,183 million in 2020 to $2,628 million in 2021 also contributed to the higher net cash provided by operating activities [6]. The reduction in tax payments was primarily due to tax deductions resulting from the senior notes exchange, which reduced tax payments by $1.3 billion in 2021 [4].\n\nOverall, the net cash provided by operating activities increased from 2020 to 2021 due to higher operating income, better management of working capital, increased proceeds from investments, and lower income tax payments. ![Net cash provided by operating activities increased significantly in 2021](image6)"}

This significant improvement in earnings can be attributed to several key factors. The primary driver was higher margins on refined product sales, which increased by $1.6 billion. Additionally, there was a substantial contribution from the 50 percent-owned CPChem, which added $1.0 billion to earnings [2]. Higher sales volumes also contributed positively, adding $470 million to the earnings. However, these gains were partially offset by higher operating expenses, which increased by $150 million [2].\n\nTo provide a visual context, the earnings (loss) for the U.S. downstream segment are illustrated in the following image, showing the substantial shift from a loss in 2020 to a profit in 2021. ![U.S. downstream earnings improved significantly from a loss in 2020 to a profit in 2021](image5)\n\nThe earnings (loss) of the U.S. downstream segment changed from a loss of $571 million in 2020 to earnings of $2.4 billion in 2021, primarily due to higher margins on refined product sales, higher earnings from CPChem, and higher sales volumes, partially offset by higher operating expenses."}

The net income for 2021 was $15,689 million, a substantial increase from a loss of $5,561 million in 2020 [4]. This turnaround was driven by several key factors.\n\nFirst, the company experienced higher realizations in both the U.S. and international upstream segments. For instance, U.S. upstream reported earnings of $7.3 billion in 2021, up from a loss of $1.6 billion in 2020, primarily due to higher realizations of $6.9 billion [1]. Similarly, international upstream reported earnings of $8.5 billion in 2021, compared to a loss of $825 million in 2020, with higher realizations contributing $7.6 billion [10].\n\nSecond, the absence of impairments and write-offs in 2021, which were significant in 2020, also contributed to the improved net income. In 2020, U.S. upstream faced impairments and write-offs of $1.2 billion, while international upstream had impairments and write-offs of $3.6 billion [10].\n\nThird, higher margins on refined product sales and increased sales volumes in the downstream segment played a crucial role. U.S. downstream reported earnings of $2.4 billion in 2021, compared to a loss of $571 million in 2020, with higher margins on refined product sales contributing $1.6 billion [8].\n\nAdditionally, the company's comprehensive income also saw a significant improvement. Comprehensive income for 2021 was $17,412 million, compared to a comprehensive loss of $6,183 million in 2020 [8]. This improvement was driven by the net income increase and favorable adjustments in other comprehensive income, such as actuarial gains and the net change in currency translation adjustments [8].\n\nFinancial activities that contributed to these changes include:\n\n- **Operating Activities**: There was a significant increase in net cash provided by operating activities, from $10,577 million in 2020 to $29,187 million in 2021, reflecting the improved profitability and operational efficiency [1].\n- **Investing Activities**: Capital expenditures decreased slightly from $8,922 million in 2020 to $8,056 million in 2021, while proceeds from asset sales and returns of investment were $1,791 million in 2021, compared to $2,968 million in 2020 [1].\n- **Financing Activities**: The company repaid a significant amount of debt, with net repayments of long-term debt and other financing obligations totaling $7,364 million in 2021, compared to $5,489 million in 2020. Additionally, cash dividends paid to common stockholders increased from $9,651 million in 2020 to $10,179 million in 2021 [1].\n\nIn conclusion, Chevron Corporation's net income and comprehensive income significantly improved from 2020 to 2021, driven by higher realizations, the absence of impairments and write-offs, and improved downstream margins and sales volumes. Financial activities, particularly in operating and financing, also contributed to these positive changes. ![Net income and comprehensive income improved significantly from 2020 to 2021](image4)"}

According to the financial statements, the operating profit as a percentage of sales for 2020 was 22.7%, while for 2018 it was 22.9%. This indicates a slight decrease of 20 basis points over the two-year period.\n\nLet's break down the details:\n\n- In 2020, the operating profit as a percentage of sales was 22.7% [image1].\n- In 2018, the operating profit as a percentage of sales was 22.9% [image1].\n\nThis slight decrease can be attributed to several factors, including the impact of amortization charges and impairment charges, which adversely affected the operating profit margin. Specifically, the amortization charges related to the Cytiva Acquisition in 2020 had a significant impact, increasing the amortization as a percentage of sales from 14% in 2019 to 15% in 2020 [image1].\n\nHowever, despite this decrease, the company still managed to maintain a strong operating profit margin, which reflects the effectiveness of their cost-saving measures and productivity improvements. For instance, the SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales declined by 30 basis points year-over-year in 2020, driven by increased leverage of the company's general and administrative cost base, higher sales volumes, and cost savings from productivity initiatives [1].\n\nIn conclusion, the operating profit as a percentage of sales decreased slightly from 22.9% in 2018 to 22.7% in 2020, indicating a minor but manageable impact from amortization and impairment charges, balanced by effective cost management and productivity improvements. ![Operating profit margin decreased slightly from 2018 to 2020](image1)"}

This significant change can be attributed to several key factors.\n\nFirst, the profit (loss) of consolidated and affiliated companies increased from $3,003 million in 2020 to $6,493 million in 2021 [6]. This substantial increase in profit was driven by higher sales volume and favorable price realization, as well as improvements in various segments such as Resource Industries and Construction Industries [2], [4], [5].\n\nSecond, the foreign currency translation component had a negative impact in 2021, with a loss of $598 million, compared to a gain of $577 million in 2020 [6]. This shift reflects the volatility in foreign exchange rates and its impact on the company's international operations.\n\nThird, the pension and other postretirement benefits component showed a loss of $30 million in 2021, compared to a gain of $97 million in 2020 [6]. This change is primarily due to the mark-to-market gains for remeasurement of pension and other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans in 2021, which contrasted with the mark-to-market losses in 2020 [3].\n\nLastly, the derivative financial instruments and available-for-sale securities components had minimal impacts, with a loss of $3 million in 2021 and a gain of $34 million in 2020 [6].

Specifically, out of the total employees entitled to parental leave, 21,746 are female and 98,347 are male [7]. However, the number of employees who availed the leave shows a stark contrast: 1,025 females availed the leave compared to only 2,023 males [7].\n\nMoreover, the return rate after availing parental leave is also noteworthy. Out of the 1,025 female employees who availed the leave, 967 (94%) returned to work and were still employed after 12 months. On the other hand, out of the 2,023 male employees who availed the leave, only 1,941 (96%) returned to work and were still employed after 12 months [7]. ![Most female employees return to work after parental leave, reflecting a strong support system.](image7)\n\nThese statistics reflect the bank's commitment to gender diversity and inclusivity. The high return rate of female employees after parental leave suggests that the bank has effective policies and support systems in place to help women reintegrate into the workforce. Additionally, the bank's initiatives such as the 'Careers 2.0' program, which helps skilled women professionals transition back to work after a break, further underscore this commitment [5].\n\nHowever, the lower number of male employees availing parental leave might indicate a cultural or societal norm where men are less likely to take extended leave for childcare. This could be an area for further improvement in promoting gender equality and encouraging a more balanced approach to parental responsibilities.\n\nIn conclusion, the data shows that HDFC Bank has a robust system supporting female employees in taking and returning from parental leave, reflecting its strong gender diversity policies.

However, the fourth quarter of 2018 saw a decrease in interest expense (net of interest income) by \\(\\$72\\) million, mainly due to the absence of the \\(\\$96\\) million early extinguishment of debt charge in 2017 [8].\n\nThe image data also provides insights into the total expenses. For instance, the total other current liabilities in 2018 were \\(\\$747\\) million, compared to \\(\\$812\\) million in 2017 [image6].

This increase was primarily driven by the reduction of financing receivables due to sales of receivables [10]. Additionally, payroll tax and value-added tax payment deferrals and exemptions contributed approximately $600 million due to tax relief provided under the U.S. CARES Act and other non-U.S. government assistance programs related to COVID-19 [1].\n\nHowever, this positive trend in operating cash flow was somewhat offset by an increase in workforce rebalancing payments of $293 million and a net increase in cash payments for income taxes of $162 million [1]. Despite these offsets, the overall improvement in operating cash flow indicates strong financial health and effective management of operational activities.\n\nRegarding investing activities, there was a significant decrease in the net cash used, amounting to $23,908 million [6]. This decrease can be attributed to a few key factors: a decrease in net cash used for acquisitions of $32,294 million due to the Red Hat acquisition in the prior year, and a decrease in cash provided by net non-operating finance receivables of $6,245 million primarily driven by the wind down of the OEM IT commercial financing operations [9]. This reduction in cash outflows from investing activities suggests that IBM has been more cautious and strategic in its capital allocation, focusing on high-return investments and divesting less profitable assets.\n\nOn the financing side, IBM experienced a substantial net use of cash of $9,721 million in 2020, compared to a net source of cash of $9,042 million in 2019, resulting in a year-to-year change of $18,763 million [2]. This shift was primarily driven by the company's decision to return $5,797 million to shareholders through dividends and the suspension of its share repurchase program to focus on debt repayment [10]. Additionally, total debt decreased by $1,361 million from December 31, 2019, primarily due to early retirements and debt maturities of $11,267 million, partially offset by issuances of $8,982 million [11]. This strategic debt management helps to improve the company's financial stability and reduce future financial obligations.\n\n![{Net cash provided by operating activities increased significantly in 2020, while net cash used in investing activities decreased, and net cash used in financing activities increased.}](image1)\n\nOverall, the changes in net cash provided by operating, investing, and financing activities reflect IBM's strategic focus on improving operational efficiency, optimizing capital allocation, and strengthening its financial position. The net change in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash for 2020 was $5,361 million, a substantial improvement from the $3,290 million decrease in 2019, indicating a positive trend in the company's overall cash flow [10].\n\nIn conclusion, IBM's improved operating cash flow, reduced cash outflows from investing activities, and strategic debt management collectively contributed to a more robust and stable financial position in 2020."}

The primary drivers of this growth were:\n\n1. **Growth in NBCUniversal Segments**: There was a significant increase in revenue across the Media, Theme Parks, and Studios segments. Specifically, the Media segment saw a 6.9% increase, the Theme Parks segment grew by 11.4%, and the Studios segment contributed to the overall growth [11].\n\n2. **Cable Communications Segment**: The Cable Communications segment also experienced growth, driven by increased revenue from broadband, wireless, business services, advertising, video, and other services. This growth was partially offset by a decrease in voice revenue [11]. The segment's revenue increased by 0.7% from 2020 to 2021, as shown in the financial breakdown [image1].\n\n3. **Sky Segment**: The Sky segment saw a substantial increase in revenue, growing by 11.4% from 2020 to 2021.

For instance, Toyota is working on cobalt-free and nickel-free materials, as well as new electrode materials, to reduce costs and enhance performance [image1]. These advancements are essential for achieving the targeted 30% improvement in power efficiency and a corresponding reduction in battery capacity requirements [8].\n\nFurthermore, Toyota's commitment to long service life is evident in its efforts to develop batteries that retain a high capacity retention rate even after extended use. The C-HR BEV, for example, has a much higher capacity retention rate after 10 years compared to previous PHEVs [3]. For the Toyota bZ4X, the target is to achieve 90% endurance performance, which is among the highest in the world [3].\n\nIn summary, the evolution of battery control models at Toyota is a multifaceted effort that focuses on enhancing battery performance, ensuring safety and longevity, and reducing costs. These advancements are critical for the successful development and commercialization of Toyota's next-generation BEVs. ![Full utilization of battery capacity with a focus on safety and longevity](image1)"}

According to the financial data provided, the net earnings for 2018 were $12,382 million, increasing to $15,769 million in 2020 [6]. This represents a significant increase of about 27.3% over the two-year period.\n\nComprehensive income, which includes net earnings and other comprehensive income (loss), also saw a positive trend. For 2018, the comprehensive income was $10,469 million, and it grew to $15,167 million in 2020 [12]. This indicates a substantial increase of about 44.9%.\n\nTo understand the main factors influencing these changes, we need to consider several aspects of the company's operations and financial structure. One key factor is the growth in premium revenues, which increased from $178,087 million in 2018 to $201,478 million in 2020 [6]. This growth can be attributed to both organic expansion and strategic acquisitions, as well as the company's ability to manage and optimize its risk-based health insurance arrangements [5].\n\nAnother significant factor is the management of operating costs. Despite an increase in medical costs, the company managed to keep overall operating costs in check, leading to higher earnings from operations. For instance, while medical costs rose from $145,403 million in 2018 to $159,396 million in 2020, the earnings from operations still increased from $17,344 million to $22,405 million over the same period [6].\n\nAdditionally, the company's effective tax management played a role. The provision for income taxes increased from $3,562 million in 2018 to $4,973 million in 2020, but the effective tax rate remained relatively stable, allowing the company to retain a significant portion of its earnings [6].\n\nThe impact of other comprehensive income (loss) is also noteworthy. In 2018, other comprehensive income (loss) was a loss of $3,913 million, while in 2020, it was a loss of $3,122 million [12]. This reduction in losses contributed to the overall increase in comprehensive income.\n\nLastly, the company's strong cash flow from operating activities, which increased from $15,713 million in 2018 to $22,174 million in 2020, further supported its financial health and ability to reinvest in growth opportunities [7].\n\nIn conclusion, UnitedHealth Group's net earnings and comprehensive income significantly improved from 2018 to 2020, driven by robust revenue growth, effective cost management, and favorable tax conditions. ![Net earnings and comprehensive income increased significantly from 2018 to 2020, reflecting strong financial performance.](image12)"}

The recovery is evident in the significant rise in revenues and the reduction in operating expenses, particularly in the context of demand creation and operating overhead [2], [3].\n\nAdditionally, the company's effective management of working capital, including a decrease in inventories and an increase in accounts receivable, further contributed to the improved net income [3].

This increase can be attributed to several factors, including investments in long-term projects and strategic acquisitions. The rise in noncurrent assets suggests that IBM is actively investing in long-term growth initiatives, such as expanding its hybrid cloud and AI offerings [10].\n\n### Changes in Long-Term Debt\nThe long-term debt remained relatively stable, increasing slightly from $54,102 million in 2019 to $54,355 million in 2020 [4]. This minimal change indicates that IBM is maintaining a balanced approach to its debt levels, avoiding significant increases that could strain its financial flexibility. The stability in long-term debt aligns with IBM's focus on deleveraging and maintaining a strong liquidity position [5].\n\n### Changes in Noncurrent Liabilities (Excluding Debt)\nNoncurrent liabilities (excluding debt) increased from $39,398 million in 2019 to $41,020 million in 2020, a rise of $1,621 million [1, 4]. This increase is primarily driven by factors such as higher provisions for expected credit losses and other strategic financial decisions [12]. The rise in noncurrent liabilities suggests that IBM is taking a cautious approach to manage potential risks, particularly in the context of economic uncertainties and market volatility.\n\n### Implications on Financial Strategy\n1. **Investment in Growth**: The increase in noncurrent assets reflects IBM's commitment to long-term growth and strategic investments. By focusing on areas like hybrid cloud and AI, IBM aims to stay competitive and capitalize on emerging technologies [10].\n\n2. **Deleveraging and Financial Flexibility**: The stability in long-term debt, despite the slight increase, demonstrates IBM's disciplined approach to managing its debt levels. This strategy supports the company's goal of maintaining a strong credit rating and financial flexibility [5].\n\n3. **Risk Management**: The rise in noncurrent liabilities, particularly the provision for expected credit losses, indicates a proactive stance on risk management. IBM is preparing for potential economic challenges and ensuring it has adequate reserves to mitigate financial risks [12].\n\nIn conclusion, the changes in noncurrent assets, long-term debt, and noncurrent liabilities (excluding debt) reflect IBM's strategic focus on sustainable growth, financial discipline, and risk management. These financial decisions are aimed at positioning the company for long-term success and maintaining a robust financial foundation. ![Stable long-term debt and increased noncurrent assets and liabilities indicate a balanced financial strategy](image4)"}

According to the data provided:\n\n- In 2019, the net interest yield on average Card Member loans was 11.3% [image8].\n- In 2021, the net interest yield on average Card Member loans was 11.2% [image8].\n\nThis indicates a slight decrease in the net interest yield from 2019 to 2021.\n\nNow, let's delve into the major factors that influenced this change:\n\n1. **Decline in Interest Income**: The interest income decreased from $8,199 million in 2020 to $7,391 million in 2021 [image6]. This decline can be attributed to lower revolving Card Member loan balances, as mentioned in the text: \"Interest income decreased, primarily due to a decline in the interest yield on average Card Member loans driven by higher paydown rates on revolving loan balances\" [5].\n\n2. **Higher Paydown Rates**: Higher paydown rates on revolving loan balances contributed to the decrease in interest income. This is evident from the text: \"Interest income decreased, primarily due to a decline in the interest yield on average Card Member loans driven by higher paydown rates on revolving loan balances\" [5].\n\n3. **Lower Cost of Funds**: Despite the decrease in interest income, there was a reduction in the cost of funds, which partially offset the decline in net interest income. The interest expense decreased from $1,054 million in 2020 to $717 million in 2021 [image6]. This is reflected in the text: \"Net interest income decreased, primarily due to a decline in interest income driven by lower revolving Card Member loan balances, partially offset by lower cost of funds\" [10].\n\n4. **Economic Factors and Customer Behavior**: Economic conditions and customer behavior also played a role. Improved economic conditions and the financial strength of customers led to higher paydown rates, reducing the need for revolving credit. The text mentions: \"Card Member loans increased 21 percent, which was lower than the growth in billed business due to higher paydown rates driven in part by the continued liquidity and financial strength of our customer base\" [2].\n\n5. **Market Interest Rate Changes**: Changes in market interest rates can impact the net interest yield. The text notes: \"If the rate of interest we pay on our borrowings increases more or decreases less than the rate of interest we earn on our loans, our net interest yield, and consequently our net interest income, could decrease\" [7].\n\nIn summary, the net interest yield on average Card Member loans decreased slightly from 11.3% in 2019 to 11.2% in 2021, primarily due to a decline in interest income driven by higher paydown rates on revolving loan balances, partially offset by a lower cost of funds and improved economic conditions. ![Net interest yield decreased slightly from 2019 to 2021](image8)"}

This decline is consistent with the trend observed in previous periods, where ENBREL has been losing market share due to increased competition, particularly from biosimilars. The impact of the pandemic further exacerbated this decline by reducing the growth rate of the rheumatology market [4]. Additionally, ENBREL faced legal challenges with the approval of a second biosimilar version in April 2019, which could lead to further market entry and competition [9].\n\nIn contrast, Prolia's sales showed a more positive trend. In 2020, Prolia's sales increased by 3% globally, driven by higher unit demand and an increase in the net selling price [2]. However, the pandemic also impacted Prolia's sales, particularly by disrupting patient visits and altering the timing of semiannual doses, which led to a deceleration in demand growth [11]. Despite these challenges, Prolia managed to maintain a steady increase in sales, reflecting its strong market position and continued demand [5].\n\nTo summarize, ENBREL's sales declined due to lower unit demand, reduced net selling price, and increased competition from biosimilars, while Prolia's sales increased due to higher unit demand and net selling price, although the pandemic introduced some disruptions. ![ENBREL and Prolia sales trends over the years](image6)"}

Additionally, they have committed to achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions before 2050, encompassing their operations, supply chain, and financing activities [8].\n\nRegarding air pollution, Bank of America reports that in 2019, their global emissions included 20 metric tons of nitrogen oxides (NOx), 32 metric tons of sulfur oxides (SOx), 2 metric tons of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and 3 metric tons of particulate matter [image3]. The valued impact of these air pollutants was estimated to be $146,000, calculated using the social cost factors of each pollutant [image3]. This indicates that the company is not only monitoring and reporting its emissions but also quantifying the societal impact of these pollutants.\n\nFurthermore, Bank of America has taken steps to align with the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) recommendations. They have fully implemented TCFD guidelines and publicly committed to achieving net-zero emissions, including setting interim reduction targets based on science [image1]. This commitment is reflected in their governance structure, with the Climate Risk Steering Council overseeing climate risk management practices and ensuring that the company's approach is in line with their Risk Framework [3].\n\nThe societal impact of Bank of America’s greenhouse gas emissions is also quantified. In 2019, the societal impact of their Scope 1, Scope 2 (location-based), and Scope 3 emissions was estimated to be $238 million, using the EPA's 2020 social cost of carbon of $42 per metric ton CO2 [image1].

According to the data, the total shipment volume of cigarettes decreased by 7.1%, from 100,644 million units in 2019 to 93,462 million units in 2020 [7]. This decline in cigarette shipments can be attributed to various factors, including industry-wide disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly in the second quarter [1].\n\nOn the other hand, the shipment volume of heated tobacco units (HTUs) saw a significant increase of 55.3%, rising from 13,453 million units in 2019 to 20,898 million units in 2020 [7].

According to the text [1], the company had significant forward and option contracts as of September 26, 2021, and September 27, 2020. The image1 provides the exact figures:\n\n- **Forwards**: Increased from $1,096 million to $2,449 million.\n- **Options**: Increased from $789 million to $870 million.\n- **Swaps**: Increased from $1,885 million to $2,600 million.\n\nThis indicates a substantial increase in the value of forwards and swaps, while options saw a moderate increase.\n\nNext, let's consider the impact of interest rate changes on the fair value of the company's holdings. Text [2] states that a hypothetical increase in interest rates of 100 basis points would result in a decrease in the fair value of holdings by $50 million in 2021, compared to a decrease of $32 million in 2020. This suggests that the company's exposure to interest rate risk increased slightly over the year.\n\nAdditionally, the fair value of the company's forward-starting interest rate swaps, as mentioned in text [4], was $105 million at September 26, 2021. This represents a new addition to the company's financial instruments, as there were no outstanding interest rate swaps related to long-term debt at the end of 2020.\n\nThe fair value of foreign currency forward and option contracts used to hedge foreign currency risk, as detailed in text [8], also changed. At September 26, 2021, the fair values recorded in total assets were $42 million, while at September 27, 2020, they were $51 million. This indicates a slight decrease in the value of these hedging instruments.\n\nFinally, the comprehensive income section in image2 provides insight into the overall impact of these financial instruments on the company's financial performance. The total other comprehensive income for 2021 was $(79) million, compared to $107 million in 2020. This decrease can be attributed to various factors, including changes in the fair value of derivative instruments and foreign currency translation gains (losses).\n\nIn summary, the value of financial instruments, particularly forwards and swaps, increased significantly from September 27, 2020, to September 26, 2021, while the value of options and hedging instruments saw more moderate changes. The overall impact on the company's financial performance, as reflected in comprehensive income, showed a decrease in other comprehensive income. ![The value of forwards and swaps increased significantly from 2020 to 2021](image1)"}

According to the financial statements, the comprehensive income for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018 was $15,533 million, $14,821 million, and $10,865 million, respectively [10]. This indicates a significant improvement in the company's financial performance over the three-year period.\n\nTo understand the factors contributing to these changes, let's break down the components of comprehensive income. The primary driver of comprehensive income is net earnings, which also showed a steady increase. Net earnings for 2020, 2019, and 2018 were $15,769 million, $14,239 million, and $12,382 million, respectively [10]. This growth in net earnings is largely attributed to increases in revenue and operational efficiency.\n\nAdditionally, other comprehensive income (loss) also played a role. For instance, in 2020, the total foreign currency translation losses amounted to $(983) million, while in 2019, it was $(271) million, and in 2018, it was a gain of $242 million [10]. These fluctuations in foreign currency translation losses can significantly impact the comprehensive income, especially given the company's international operations.\n\nAnother factor is the reclassification adjustment for net realized gains included in net earnings. In 2020, this adjustment was $(58) million, compared to $(80) million in 2019 and $(48) million in 2018 [10]. While these adjustments are relatively small, they still contribute to the overall comprehensive income.\n\nThe comprehensive income attributable to noncontrolling interests also varied, with values of $(366) million in 2020, $(400) million in 2019, and $(396) million in 2018 [10]. This suggests that the performance of the noncontrolling interests has been relatively stable but slightly negative.\n\nIn summary, the increase in comprehensive income from 2018 to 2020 is primarily driven by the robust growth in net earnings, despite some volatility in foreign currency translation and reclassification adjustments. The company's strong operational performance and revenue growth have been key contributors to this positive trend. ![Comprehensive income increased from 2018 to 2020, driven by higher net earnings and stable noncontrolling interests.](image10)"}

This change can be attributed to several key factors.\n\nFirst, the company issued a substantial amount of long-term debt in 2020. Specifically, in March 2020, the company issued $750 million of fixed-rate, long-term debt due in 2025, incurring $4 million in issuance costs [9].

According to the financial activities report, the company retired $500 million of maturing debt in 2020 [12]. However, the net effect of these issuances and retirements still resulted in a net increase in long-term debt.\n\nThe image showing the detailed breakdown of the long-term debt further confirms this trend. It indicates that the total debt, including net unamortized discounts, premiums, and issuance costs, increased from $5,803 million in 2019 to $6,798 million in 2020.

This substantial rise can be attributed to several key factors.\n\nFirstly, the income from associated companies saw a dramatic increase from USD 673 million in 2020 to USD 15.3 billion in 2021, primarily due to a gain of USD 14.6 billion recognized on the divestment of the investment in Roche [2]. This divestment significantly boosted the Group's overall financial performance.\n\nAdditionally, the Group's operating income improved to USD 1.6 billion, a 53% increase from the previous year, driven by lower legal settlements, lower impairments, and lower amortization, despite unfavorable gross margin and lower sales [7].\n\nFurthermore, the net income for the year was USD 24.0 billion, a significant increase from USD 8.071 billion in 2020, contributing to the higher earnings per share [7]. The net favorable fair value adjustments on financial instruments also added to the Group's financial health [4].\n\nThe Group's equity also increased by USD 11.2 billion to USD 67.8 billion at the end of 2021, reflecting strong financial performance and strategic decisions [3].\n\nLastly, the Group's core financial metrics, such as core operating income and core net income, showed positive growth, further supporting the increase in earnings per share.

This shift in capitalization practices also contributed to the overall reduction in reported product development expenses.\n\nThe image below provides a visual representation of the decrease in product development expenses, showing a reduction from $1,101 million in 2018 to $998 million in 2019, a decrease of $103 million [8].\n\n![{Product development expenses decreased by $103 million from 2018 to 2019}](image8)\n\nIn summary, the main factors contributing to the decrease in product development expenses from 2018 to 2019 were the reduced development costs associated with the Destiny franchise and the increased capitalization of development costs for Blizzard’s games."}

According to the consolidated statement of cash flows, the net cash from operating activities for the year ended 28 June 2020 was $83,053,000 [3]. This indicates a positive cash flow from operations despite the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nNext, we need to examine the changes in retained earnings over the same period. The consolidated statement of changes in equity provides a detailed breakdown of the changes in retained earnings. From the balance sheet, we see that the retained earnings at the beginning of the period (1 July 2018) were $43,352,000 [image4]. By the end of the period (28 June 2020), the retained earnings had changed to $57,685,000 [image4].\n\nThe changes in retained earnings can be attributed to several factors, including the profit for the year, which was $20,862,000 [image3], and the dividends paid, which amounted to $33,781,000 [image4]. Additionally, there were other comprehensive income items such as cash flow hedges and foreign currency translation differences, but these had a minimal impact on the overall retained earnings.\n\nCombining the cash flow from operating activities and the changes in retained earnings, we can see that the positive operating cash flow contributed to the overall financial health of the company, allowing it to maintain and even increase its equity. However, the dividends paid out and other adjustments reduced the retained earnings, which in turn affected the total equity.\n\nThe total equity at the beginning of the period (1 July 2018) was $45,242,000 [image4]. By the end of the period (28 June 2020), the total equity had decreased to $58,368,000 [image4]. This decrease in total equity is primarily due to the dividends paid and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the business operations.\n\nIn summary, the cash flow from operating activities and changes in retained earnings played a significant role in the total equity from July 2018 to June 2020. Despite the positive operating cash flow, the dividends paid and the economic challenges led to a decrease in total equity. ![The total equity decreased from $45,242,000 to $58,368,000 from July 2018 to June 2020.](image4)\n\nThe total equity decreased from $45,242,000 to $58,368,000 from July 2018 to June 2020."}

This shift suggests that the company may face higher future tax expenses, which could negatively impact its profitability and cash flows. However, the overall financial position remains strong, as the company continues to manage its tax positions and liabilities effectively, as noted in the text [6].\n\nThe changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect the company's ongoing tax planning and the impact of various financial and operational activities. While the net increase in deferred tax liabilities may suggest higher future tax payments, the company's robust tax management strategies and global presence help mitigate potential risks.\n\nIn conclusion, the deferred tax assets decreased by $473 and the deferred tax liabilities increased by $785 between 2021 and 2022, indicating a net increase in the company's future tax obligations, which could potentially impact its financial position. ![Deferred tax assets and liabilities have changed significantly between 2021 and 2022, reflecting the company's tax planning and operational activities.](image6)"}

In 2019, the total net periodic benefit cost was $638 million, which turned into a benefit of $239 million in 2020. In 2021, this benefit increased to $1,122 million, and for 2022, the expected cost is projected to be $121 million [8].\n\nThese trends are closely tied to the mark-to-market losses or gains, which are a significant component of the total net periodic benefit cost. In 2019, there was a mark-to-market loss of $468 million, which contributed to the overall cost [10]. In 2020, a mark-to-market gain of $383 million helped turn the total cost into a benefit [9]. However, in 2021, a substantial mark-to-market loss of $833 million significantly increased the total benefit [8]. For 2022, no mark-to-market gains or losses are included in the expected net periodic benefit cost, but the trend suggests that these fluctuations can have a major impact on the total cost.\n\nThe mark-to-market gains and losses are primarily influenced by changes in discount rates and actual versus expected returns on plan assets. For instance, the 2021 mark-to-market loss was primarily due to higher discount rates at the end of 2021 compared to the end of 2020, which reduced the present value of future obligations [5]. Conversely, the 2020 gain was due to lower discount rates at the end of 2020 compared to the end of 2019 [9].\n\nAdditionally, the expected increase in the net periodic benefit cost for 2022 is primarily due to higher interest costs resulting from higher discount rates and lower expected returns on plan assets [1].\n\n![{The mark-to-market gains and losses significantly influence the total net periodic benefit cost, leading to large fluctuations from year to year.}](image8)\n\nThe trend in the Total Net Periodic Benefit Cost (Benefit) from 2019 to 2022 is characterized by significant volatility, largely driven by mark-to-market losses and gains."}

This decrease was attributed to slower adoption of Creative Cloud in Japan and the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar against the Japanese Yen and other Asian currencies. However, Digital Marketing and Print and Publishing revenue in APAC remained relatively stable during fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 [2].\n\nIn fiscal 2015, revenue in APAC remained stable compared to fiscal 2014 [5]. This stability was due to an increase in Digital Marketing revenue offset by a decrease in Digital Media revenue. The increase in Digital Marketing revenue was driven by the factors noted in the segment information, while the decline in Digital Media revenue was primarily due to expected decreases in perpetual license revenue, partially offset by increases in subscription revenue [5].\n\nTo summarize the percentage changes:\n- From fiscal 2013 to fiscal 2014, revenue in APAC decreased.\n- From fiscal 2014 to fiscal 2015, revenue in APAC remained stable.\n\nCombining these, the overall percentage change in revenue for the APAC region from fiscal year 2013 to 2015 can be inferred to be a net decrease, but the exact percentage is not explicitly stated in the provided text.

The late 1990s saw a surge in VC investments, followed by a significant downturn after the dot-com bubble burst in 2000-2001. This downturn led to a more cautious and selective approach to investments in the subsequent years.\n\nDuring the 1998 period, there was a proliferation of VC funds, with almost every major bank, corporation, and insurance company in Europe creating its own venture capital fund [12]. This led to a less disciplined investment environment where many funds were investing at various stages without a clear focus on specific sectors or stages of development.\n\nHowever, the post-bubble period, starting around 2004-2005, marked a significant shift. The scarcity of VC money in Europe led to lower entry valuations and increased capital efficiency [3]. Investors became more selective, focusing on high-potential, early-stage companies that could scale quickly and efficiently [6]. This change in strategy is reflected in the improved performance of post-bubble vintage funds, which are now at an inflection point with several successful exits [1].\n\n![{The image shows a list of notable European VC exits, indicating the success of post-bubble vintage funds.}](image4)\n\nBy 2007, the distribution of investment stages had become more concentrated and strategic. Investors were more likely to focus on early-stage and seed investments, where they could achieve higher returns with better risk management. This shift is also evident in the median pre-money valuations for initial rounds, which were lower due to the scarcity of capital and the increased selectivity of investors [11].\n\nIn summary, the distribution of investment stages changed from a broad and less disciplined approach in 1998 to a more focused and selective strategy in 2007, with a greater emphasis on early-stage and seed investments."}

The image illustrates a significant gap in the supply of venture capital versus the availability of deals, particularly from 2004 onwards. This gap suggests that there was a high demand for capital in Europe, which could have driven up the value of successful exits, including IPOs `![Major gap in supply of venture capital vs. availability of deals](image7)`.\n\nGiven the strong performance of European IPOs and the significant demand for capital, it is reasonable to conclude that the Europe IPO index value was at least on par with, if not greater than, the US IPO index value at the time of the presentation.\n\nIn conclusion, the Europe IPO index value was likely greater than or equal to the US IPO index value at the time of the presentation."}

Among those who find it acceptable, the primary reasons include the belief that it would be more fair and unbiased [image4].\n\nHowever, the majority of those who find it unacceptable are concerned about the lack of individual focus and the potential for unfair bias or profiling [7]. Specifically, 50% of respondents who find it unacceptable argue that every individual or circumstance is different, and a computer program would struggle to capture these nuances [7]. Another 49% worry that the program might not have the best information about someone when making its assessment [7].\n\nAdditionally, 25% of those who find it unacceptable are concerned about the lack of human involvement in the process, emphasizing the importance of human judgment in such critical decisions [7]. This aligns with the broader skepticism about removing the human element from important decisions, a theme that is also prominent in other algorithmic applications like automated resume screening [11].\n\nIn summary, the main reasons people find the use of automated criminal risk scores acceptable are the perceived fairness and reduced bias, while the primary concerns for those who find it unacceptable are the lack of individual focus, potential for unfair bias, and the absence of human judgment. ![People have mixed feelings about the fairness and human involvement in automated criminal risk scores.](image4)"}

This indicates a steady rise in the number of people who choose not to affiliate with either major political party.\n\nHowever, despite this increase, the majority of these Independents still lean towards one of the two major parties. For instance, 81% of Independents continue to lean either towards the Republican Party or the Democratic Party [2]. Among the public overall, 17% are Democratic-leaning Independents, while 13% lean toward the Republican Party [2].\n\nThis trend is also reflected in the ideological breakdown of Independents. While nearly half of Independents who do not lean to a party describe their views as moderate [1], the majority of Independents still exhibit strong partisan leanings. For example, among Democratic-leaning Independents, 45% identify as moderates and 39% as liberals [4], while among Republican-leaning Independents, 51% identify as conservatives [7].\n\nThe increase in the proportion of Independents, therefore, does not necessarily indicate a shift towards true political independence or centrism. Instead, it suggests a growing number of people who, while not formally affiliated with a party, still align closely with either the Democratic or Republican platforms. This is further supported by the fact that only about 7% of Americans decline to lean toward a party, a share that has remained relatively stable over the years [2].\n\nIn summary, the proportion of political Independents in the U.S. has increased from 33% in 1994 to 38% in 2018, but the majority of these Independents still lean towards one of the major parties, indicating a complex but not entirely non-partisan political landscape. ![Proportion of Independents has increased, but most lean towards a major party](image4)"}

One of the primary challenges is the **rapidly growing world population**, which is doubling every 35 to 40 years [7]. This exponential growth places immense pressure on resources and the environment, leading to increased pollution from various human activities such as driving automobiles, farming, and manufacturing [9].\n\nAnother significant challenge is the **increase in energy demand** and the limited availability of energy supplies. As the population grows, so does the demand for energy, which often results in the inefficient use of energy and the depletion of finite resources. This is illustrated by the increasing trend in the number of vehicles, particularly two-wheelers, which has surged over the years, as shown in the data [image4] ![Increasing number of two-wheelers over the years](image4).\n\nThe third challenge is the **environmental impact** of energy use, including the emission of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrous oxide (NO), and methane (CH4). These emissions contribute to the greenhouse effect, leading to global warming and a range of environmental issues such as rising sea levels and melting ice caps [3], [11]. The consequences of these environmental effects are far-reaching and can lead to mass flooding in low-lying areas, threatening the existence of many islands and coastal regions [11].\n\nFinally, the **health impacts** of pollution are a critical concern. Pollutants from vehicles and other sources can cause inflammation in the respiratory tract, reduce lung function, and increase hospitalizations for asthma and other lung diseases [2], [4]. These health effects are not only immediate but can also have long-term consequences, affecting the quality of life and increasing healthcare costs.\n\nIn conclusion, the four concrete facts of global challenges are the rapidly growing world population, the increasing energy demand and limited energy supplies, the environmental impact of energy use, and the health impacts of pollution."}

According to the data, the closer individuals are to their immigrant roots, the stronger their connection to their Hispanic heritage tends to be. For instance, nearly all immigrant adults from Latin America or Spain (97%) identify as Hispanic, and second-generation adults (the U.S.-born children of at least one immigrant parent) have a high self-identification rate of 92% [3].\n\nHowever, as we move to the third or higher generations, the identification with Hispanic heritage decreases. This trend is evident in various aspects of life, including language, neighborhood composition, and social networks. For example, among second-generation self-identified Latinos, about 51% are bilingual, whereas this share drops to 24% among third or higher generation Latinos [1]. Additionally, the likelihood of living in largely Latino neighborhoods also decreases, from 41% for the foreign-born and second generation to 30% for the third or higher generation [4].\n\nThis decline in heritage identification is further reflected in the composition of social networks and marital patterns. Most (77%) immigrant Latinos say all or most of their friends are Latinos, but this share drops to 55% among second-generation Latinos and 37% among third or higher generation Latinos [5]. Similarly, the rate of intermarriage with non-Latinos increases across generations. While nearly all married immigrant Hispanics (93%) have a Hispanic spouse, this rate falls to 63% for second-generation married Hispanics and 35% for third-generation married Hispanics [6].\n\nThe images provide additional insights into these generational differences. For example, the image showing the frequency of visits to Hispanic cultural celebrations indicates that 49% of second-generation self-identified Hispanics were taken often to such events during their childhood, compared to only 35% of third or higher generation Hispanics [image6]. Another image highlights the reasons why some individuals with Hispanic ancestry do not identify as Hispanic, such as not speaking Spanish or having no cultural link [image7].\n\nIn conclusion, the generational breakdown reveals that as the distance from immigrant roots increases, the identification with Hispanic heritage generally diminishes, affecting language proficiency, social networks, and marital choices. ![{The closer individuals are to their immigrant roots, the stronger their connection to their Hispanic heritage.}](image6)"}

However, by 2015, this concern had risen dramatically, with 56% of Americans now saying that they are more worried about the government's policies not being strong enough [7].\n\nThis shift can be traced through various events and changes in public sentiment. For instance, in the wake of the Christmas Day terrorist attack in 2009, 58% of Americans felt that policies did not go far enough to protect the country [1]. This sentiment persisted and even intensified over the years, as shown by the data from 2015, where 58% of respondents still held this view [image2].\n\nAdditionally, the revelations by Edward Snowden in 2013 initially led to a spike in concern over government restrictions on civil liberties, with 47% expressing this concern [5]. However, by 2015, this concern had dropped to 28%, while the opposite concern—that policies have not gone far enough—had risen to 56% [10]. This trend is also reflected in the demographic breakdown, where 71% of Republicans and 55% of Democrats shared this concern [image1].\n\nFurthermore, the rise of ISIS as a major threat has also influenced public opinion. In 2015, 83% of Americans were very concerned about the Islamic militant group in Iraq and Syria, a 16-point increase from August 2014 [image3]. This heightened concern likely contributed to the increased perception that anti-terror policies need to be stronger.\n\nIn summary, public opinion regarding anti-terror policies has shifted significantly from 2004 to 2015, with a growing concern that the government's policies are not robust enough to protect the country. ![Public concern about anti-terror policies not going far enough has risen from 47% in 2004 to 56% in 2015](image8)"}

Initially, the population grew exponentially, driven by the Homestead Act and the construction of the Transcontinental Railroad. According to the census data, the population of Hamilton County increased from just 130 in 1870 to 8,267 in 1880 and peaked at 14,096 in 1890 [1]. This surge in population was largely due to the influx of settlers from various parts of the United States and Europe, who were attracted by the promise of free land and economic opportunities [2].\n\nHowever, this rapid growth was not sustained. After reaching its peak in 1890, the population began to decline, albeit slowly. By 1900, the population had decreased to 13,330, and it continued to fluctuate over the next several decades, dropping to 9,982 by 1940 [1]. ![{Population trends show a peak in 1890 followed by a gradual decline.}](image2)\n\nSeveral factors contributed to this decline. The consolidation of farms, driven by mechanization and increased operational costs, led to a reduction in the number of small farms and rural communities. By 1900, there were over 2,000 individual farms in Hamilton County, but by the mid-1960s, this number had dropped to nearly 1,100 [6]. The trend of farm consolidation continued, with the number of farms declining further to 603 by 2002, while the average farm size increased to 577 acres [6].\n\nAdditionally, the dependence on rail connections played a crucial role in the development and decline of small towns. Towns without rail lines often struggled to survive, leading to the relocation of businesses and residents to more connected areas [10]. For example, the town of Hamilton, which briefly campaigned for the county seat, saw its businesses and houses move to Aurora after the county seat was established there [10].\n\nDespite these challenges, some towns within Hamilton County, particularly Aurora, have shown resilience and even population gains. Aurora's population peaked at 4,225 in the 2000 census and has steadily increased since 1940 [8]. This suggests that while rural areas have faced significant challenges, certain urban centers have managed to thrive.\n\nIn conclusion, the population trends of Hamilton County, Nebraska, from 1870 to 2000 were characterized by a rapid initial increase followed by a gradual decline, influenced by the Homestead Act, the Transcontinental Railroad, farm consolidation, and the importance of rail connections."}

Additionally, the scarcity of VC money in Europe has led to lower entry valuations and more selective investments, further enhancing performance [8].\n\nHowever, it's important to note that visibility on European VC funds for investors is highly limited and often prejudiced by poor quality of published industry fund statistics [4]. This is compounded by the fact that many top-performing European funds do not publish their financial data, unlike in the US where market publication requirements make such data more accessible [10].\n\nDespite these challenges, the data suggests that European VC funds are achieving comparable or even superior performance to their US counterparts, especially in terms of capital efficiency and selectivity [8].

This indicates a lower level of confidence in Biden specifically on the U.S.-China relationship compared to his overall handling of world affairs.\n\nMoreover, this trend is consistent across various demographic groups. For instance, women (59%) are more confident than men (48%) in Biden’s ability to deal effectively with China [6]. Similarly, Black (82%) and Hispanic adults (70%) express more confidence than White adults (43%) [6].\n\nPartisan differences are also significant. While 83% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents have confidence in Biden to deal effectively with China, only 19% of Republicans and Republican leaners share this confidence [5]. This partisan divide is further emphasized by the fact that conservative Republicans have even less confidence (10%) compared to moderate or liberal Republicans (30%) [3].\n\nWhen compared to other foreign policy issues, Americans have the least confidence in Biden’s ability to handle the U.S.-China relationship. For example, 67% have confidence in him to improve relationships with allies, and around 60% believe he can deal effectively with threats like terrorism, global climate change, and international trade [12].\n\nTo visualize these trends, the data shows a clear gap between confidence in Biden on China and other foreign policy issues, as depicted in the following chart ![{Fewer Americans have confidence in Biden to handle U.S.-China relationship than other foreign policy issues}](image5)."}

This configuration serves the current demand but falls short of meeting future needs, especially given the goal to double ridership from 60,000 to 120,000 daily trips by the next decade [3].\n\nOne potential improvement involves using Metrolink used cars, which would increase the number of cars per train to 6 while maintaining the same frequency of 5 trains per hour. This would result in 30 train cars during the peak hour [4], providing a modest increase in capacity.\n\nA more significant improvement comes with electrification, which allows for 6 trains per hour, each with 6 cars. This scenario would provide a total of 36 train cars during the peak hour [image4]. Electrification not only increases the number of trains but also enhances the efficiency and reliability of the service.\n\nFurther improvements include longer platforms, which would enable 6 trains per hour, each with 8 cars. This configuration would result in 48 train cars during the peak hour [2], significantly increasing the capacity and better accommodating the projected rise in ridership.\n\nThe most ambitious scenario involves increasing the frequency to 8 trains per hour, each with 8 cars.

According to the image showing the total activity distribution, streaming had a 20% share of the business in 2014 [image4]. This image clearly indicates the percentage distribution of total music activity, where streaming accounted for 20% in 2014.\n\nNext, we need to look at the changes in listening time over these years. The text mentions that listening time is rising due to access and technology [5]. To get a more specific comparison, we can refer to the image showing the total sales and volume changes from 2014 to 2015 [image5]. This image indicates that the total music volume increased by 1% from 2014 to 2015, while physical album sales decreased by 6%.\n\nHowever, to find the exact difference in average weekly hours, we need to consider the overall trend. The text states that we are listening to more music and that the overall volume is up by 14% so far in 2015 [6]. This suggests a significant increase in listening time.\n\nGiven that the data for 2013 is not explicitly provided, we can infer that the increase in listening time from 2013 to 2014 and then to 2015 was substantial. The rise in streaming and the overall increase in music consumption indicate a positive trend in listening time.\n\nCombining this information, we can conclude that the average weekly listening time increased significantly from 2013 to 2014, and continued to grow in 2015. However, without specific hourly data, we cannot provide an exact numerical difference.\n\nTherefore, the difference in average weekly listening time between 2013 and the year when streaming had a 20% share of the business (2014) is significant, but the exact number of hours is not provided in the given data [5][6]![{Streaming had a 20% share of the business in 2014}](image4).\n\nThe average weekly listening time increased notably from 2013 to 2014."}

The well-to-tank phase involves the extraction, processing, and delivery of energy to the vehicle, while the tank-to-wheels phase focuses on the vehicle's efficiency in converting stored energy into motion.\n\nFrom the provided data, the overall efficiency can be broken down as follows:\n\n### Well-to-Tank Efficiency\nThe well-to-tank efficiency varies depending on the energy source. For electric vehicles, this primarily involves the generation and distribution of electricity. For internal combustion engines, it involves the extraction, refining, and transportation of fossil fuels like gasoline and diesel.\n\n- **Electric Vehicles**: The well-to-tank efficiency for electricity can vary widely depending on the source. Renewable sources like wind and solar have higher efficiencies compared to coal or natural gas. On average, the well-to-tank efficiency for electricity is around 30-40%.\n- **Internal Combustion Engine Vehicles**: The well-to-tank efficiency for gasoline and diesel is typically around 70-80%. This includes the extraction, refining, and transportation of the fuel.\n\n### Tank-to-Wheels Efficiency\nThe tank-to-wheels efficiency measures how effectively the vehicle converts the stored energy into motion.\n\n- **Electric Vehicles**: Electric vehicles are highly efficient in converting electrical energy into motion. The tank-to-wheels efficiency for EVs is around 60-77%.\n- **Internal Combustion Engine Vehicles**: Internal combustion engines are less efficient, with a tank-to-wheels efficiency of about 20-30%.\n\n### Overall Efficiency\nCombining the well-to-tank and tank-to-wheels efficiencies gives us the overall energy efficiency from source to wheel.\n\n- **Electric Vehicles**: \n  - Well-to-tank efficiency: 30-40%\n  - Tank-to-wheels efficiency: 60-77%\n  - Overall efficiency: \\( 0.30 \\times 0.60 = 0.18 \\) (18%) to \\( 0.40 \\times 0.77 = 0.308 \\) (30.8%)\n\n- **Internal Combustion Engine Vehicles**:\n  - Well-to-tank efficiency: 70-80%\n  - Tank-to-wheels efficiency: 20-30%\n  - Overall efficiency: \\( 0.70 \\times 0.20 = 0.14 \\) (14%) to \\( 0.80 \\times 0.30 = 0.24 \\) (24%)\n\n### Visual Representation\nTo visualize these efficiencies, consider the following diagram which shows the breakdown of energy losses in both types of vehicles:\n![{Electric vehicles have a higher overall efficiency from source to wheel compared to internal combustion engine vehicles.}](image5)\n\n### Conclusion\nElectric vehicles generally have a higher overall energy efficiency from source to wheel compared to internal combustion engine vehicles. This is due to the higher tank-to-wheels efficiency of electric vehicles and the relatively higher well-to-tank efficiency of electricity from renewable sources."}

This improvement is further illustrated in the following table, where the gains for GL to EN are highlighted:\n\n| Source > Target | Standard (std) | Pre-trained (pre) | Increase |\n|-----------------|----------------|------------------|----------|\n| GL -> EN        | 2.2            | 13.2             | +11.0    |\n\nThis table shows that pre-training is particularly beneficial for low-resource languages, as they often have limited training data and thus benefit more from the additional information provided by pre-trained embeddings [2].\n\nAdditionally, the effect of pre-training is consistent across higher-resource languages, with gains of approximately 3 BLEU points for all three language pairs [2]. However, the gains vary more for extremely low-resource languages, with some showing small improvements and others showing very large gains, such as GL achieving a gain of up to 11 BLEU points [2].\n\nThe impact of pre-training is also evident in multilingual systems.

According to the text, the levels of agreement on each question in the absolute evaluation are shown in Figure 10 [3].\n\nHowever, for a more detailed breakdown, let's consider the information provided in the image quotes. Image 1 provides a breakdown of the inter-annotator agreement levels for different model comparisons. Specifically, it shows the number of cases where all three annotators agree, two annotators agree, and no agreement is reached.\n\nFor the absolute evaluation, the highest inter-annotator agreement level is typically seen in questions about simple, objective properties of the responses, such as whether the model responses contain objectionable content (e.g., hate speech). In these cases, annotators have unanimous judgments, indicating high agreement [11].\n\nTo illustrate this, let's look at the data from Image 1:\n- **All 3 annotators agree**: 331 (31.5%) for Chameleon vs. Gemini-+, 371 (35.4%) for Chameleon vs. GPT-4V+, 317 (30.2%) for Chameleon vs. Gemini, and 300 (28.6%) for Chameleon vs. GPT-4V.\n- **Two annotators agree**: 609 (58.1%) for Chameleon vs. Gemini-+, 579 (55.2%) for Chameleon vs. GPT-4V+, 621 (59.3%) for Chameleon vs. Gemini, and 611 (58.3%) for Chameleon vs. GPT-4V.\n- **No Agreement**: 108 (10.3%) for Chameleon vs. Gemini-+, 98 (9.3%) for Chameleon vs. GPT-4V+, 110 (10.5%) for Chameleon vs. Gemini, and 137 (13.1%) for Chameleon vs. GPT-4V.\n\nFrom this data, we can see that the highest percentage of cases where all three annotators agree is for Chameleon vs. GPT-4V+ at 35.4%. This indicates a high level of inter-annotator agreement.\n\nHowever, the text specifically mentions that the highest inter-annotator agreement is seen in questions about simple, objective properties of the responses, such as whether the model responses contain objectionable content. This is further supported by the data in Image 5, which shows that the vast majority of Chameleon's responses are considered safe, with only a small percentage labeled as unsafe or unsure [7].\n\nTherefore, the category with the highest inter-annotator agreement level in the absolute evaluation is the **objectionable content** category.\n\n![{The highest inter-annotator agreement is seen in the objectionable content category.}](image5)"}

The table shows the Kendall's Tau correlation values for both versions of the COMET-RANK model: one that uses only the reference and another that uses both reference and source.\n\n| Language Pair | COMET-RANK (ref. only) | COMET-RANK (ref. + source) | Δτ |\n|---------------|------------------------|----------------------------|----|\n| en-cs         | 0.660                  | 0.711                      | 0.051 |\n| en-de         | 0.764                  | 0.799                      | 0.035 |\n| en-fi         | 0.630                  | 0.671                      | 0.041 |\n| en-tr         | 0.539                  | 0.563                      | 0.024 |\n| cs-en         | 0.249                  | 0.356                      | 0.107 |\n| de-en         | 0.390                  | 0.542                      | 0.155 |\n| fi-en         | 0.159                  | 0.278                      | 0.119 |\n| tr-en         | 0.128                  | 0.260                      | 0.132 |\n\nFrom this table, we can see that including the source text generally improves the performance of the COMET-RANK metric, as indicated by the positive Δτ values. The improvements vary across different language pairs, with some pairs showing larger gains than others.\n\nFor example, the improvement is most significant for the cs-en language pair, where the Δτ is 0.107, followed by de-en with a Δτ of 0.155. These results suggest that the inclusion of the source text provides valuable information that enhances the model's ability to predict human judgments accurately.\n\nAdditionally, the figure in `![{Inclusion of the source text significantly improves the performance of the COMET-RANK metric for most language pairs involving English.}](image7)` visually represents the improvement in performance when the source text is included. The figure shows a consistent trend of higher Kendall's Tau values for the COMET-RANK model that uses both reference and source compared to the model that uses only the reference.\n\nIn conclusion, the inclusion of reference translations significantly improves the performance of the COMET-RANK metric for language pairs involving English, with the magnitude of improvement varying across different language pairs."}

Specifically, the text states that when the number of demonstrations increases from 1 to 5, there is a noticeable improvement, but further increases (e.g., ≥10) yield limited additional benefits [4].\n\nThe image provides a clear visualization of this trend.

These decoders share the same encoder but have separate attentions, allowing each decoder to focus on different aspects of the input sequence independently.\n\nThis difference is crucial because the multitask model can leverage shared representations from the encoder to perform multiple tasks simultaneously, such as speech transcription and translation.

It creates and stores multimodal embeddings for visual images and text descriptions, optimizing retrieval speed through index construction techniques [9]. The retriever uses techniques like the HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World) algorithm to reduce the dimensionality of the embeddings, making the retrieval process faster and more efficient [7].\n   - **Process**: Upon receiving an input image, the retriever retrieves the top-k class names most similar to the image [11]. This is achieved by integrating the input image with the category information stored in the memory [5].\n\n   ![The multimodal retriever queries a large multimodal external memory to retrieve the top-k categories most similar to the input image.](image1)\n\n2. **Memory Bank**:\n   - **Function**: The memory bank stores the multimodal embeddings created by the retriever. These embeddings are indexed for quick and accurate retrieval. The memory bank is essential for maintaining a large and diverse set of category information, which is crucial for fine-grained recognition tasks [6].\n   - **Process**: The memory bank is constructed by pre-processing the images and text, creating feature embeddings, and indexing them for efficient retrieval [9].\n\n3. **Ranking Prompt**:\n   - **Function**: The ranking prompt serves to merge the input image with the category information retrieved from the memory. It guides the MLLMs to rank the retrieved candidate object categories based on similarity [5]. The MLLMs combine their internal knowledge with the retrieved information to make the final prediction of the image category [2].\n   - **Process**: The retrieved category labels and image embeddings are integrated and sent to the MLLMs through the ranking prompt. The MLLMs then rank these categories to produce the final prediction [5].\n\n   ![The ranking prompt integrates the retrieved category labels with the image embeddings and sends them to the MLLMs for ranking.](image6)\n\n4. **MLLMs (Multimodal Large Language Models)**:\n   - **Function**: MLLMs are used to rank the retrieved candidate categories. They leverage their extensive knowledge base and the retrieved information to make accurate and contextually aware classifications [2]. The MLLMs are capable of handling a wide variety of images and categories with high precision and flexibility [1].\n   - **Process**: The MLLMs receive the integrated information from the ranking prompt and use their internal knowledge to rank the retrieved categories.

It then moves to the next layer, considering the children of the selected nodes, and repeats this process until it reaches the leaf nodes. This method allows for a controlled and layered approach to retrieval, where the algorithm can focus on broader themes at the higher levels and gradually narrow down to more specific details as it descends through the tree. By adjusting the depth \\( d \\) and the number of nodes \\( k \\) selected at each layer, the tree traversal method offers control over the specificity and breadth of the information retrieved [9].\n\n### Collapsed Tree Retrieval\nIn contrast, the collapsed tree approach flattens the multi-layered tree into a single layer, allowing all nodes to be considered simultaneously. This method does not traverse the tree layer-by-layer but instead evaluates all nodes at once to find the most relevant ones. This approach provides greater flexibility and can retrieve information that is at the correct level of granularity for a given question, regardless of its position in the tree. The collapsed tree method is particularly useful for queries that require a mix of high-level thematic information and granular details [3].\n\nTo visualize these differences, consider the following diagrams:\n- **Tree Traversal Retrieval**: ![{Tree Traversal Retrieval method navigates the tree layer-by-layer, selecting the most relevant nodes at each level.}](image3)\n- **Collapsed Tree Retrieval**: ![{Collapsed Tree Retrieval method flattens the tree, evaluating all nodes simultaneously to find the most relevant ones.}](image3)\n\nIn summary, the tree traversal method is more structured and hierarchical, while the collapsed tree method is more flexible and simultaneous."}

Specifically, the fine-tuned model scores 71.5% on the Eurosat dataset and 94.4% on the Food101 dataset, while in-context learning yields slightly lower accuracies of 71.5% and 94.1%, respectively [12].\n\nThis trend is consistent across other datasets as well. For example, on the SUN397 dataset, the fine-tuned model achieves 72.7%, whereas in-context learning results in 71.2%. Similarly, on the Oxford Pets dataset, the fine-tuned model scores 91.7%, while in-context learning reaches 90.3% [12].\n\nThe robustness of the fine-tuning approach is further highlighted by the minimal performance variations across different fine-tuning datasets. The results indicate that the InternLM-XC2 model, when fine-tuned, maintains a high level of accuracy and generalizability, making it a more reliable method for enhancing the performance of MLLMs in the RAR framework [10].\n\nAdditionally, the visual representation in the table (see `![Fine-tuning outperforms in-context learning across various datasets](image5)`) clearly illustrates the consistent superiority of fine-tuning over in-context learning for the InternLM-XC2 model.\n\nIn conclusion, fine-tuning the InternLM-XC2 model with the RAR method generally outperforms in-context learning across different datasets, demonstrating a more effective and reliable approach for enhancing the model's performance."}

When repetition control is introduced, the model tends to reduce the rate of question-asking. This is because the repetition control mechanism, particularly the `extrep bigram` feature, discourages the use of bigrams that have appeared in previous utterances. Since many common question-asking bigrams, such as \"do you\" and \"what is,\" are frequently repeated, the repetition control inadvertently limits the model's ability to generate questions [10].\n\nTo illustrate this, the figure below shows the impact of repetition control on the question-asking rate. When the control variable \\( z \\) is set to 10, which should theoretically produce 100% questions, the actual rate drops to 79.67% due to the repetition control. However, by introducing an additional setting \\( z = 10 \\) (boost), where the `extrep bigram` feature is not used during beam search but only for reranking, the model can achieve a 99.54% question-asking rate, albeit at the cost of slightly increased external bigram repetition [10].\n\n![{Repetition control reduces question-asking rate, but can be mitigated with a boost setting}](image4)\n\nThis finding highlights the delicate balance required in controlling repetition and question-asking simultaneously. While repetition control is crucial for improving the overall quality and engagement of the dialogue, it can negatively impact the model's ability to ask questions unless carefully adjusted [10]."}

This process is designed to refine and improve the quality of the generated output by continuously incorporating new information. For instance, the **ITER-RETGEN** framework employs a synergistic approach that leverages \"retrieval-enhanced generation\" and \"generation-enhanced retrieval.\" This means that the model retrieves relevant information, generates an initial response, and then uses this response to refine the retrieval in subsequent iterations, leading to more accurate and contextually appropriate outputs [3].\n\n### Recursive Retrieval\nRecursive retrieval, on the other hand, is a hierarchical process that involves breaking down the retrieval task into smaller, more manageable sub-tasks. This method is particularly useful for handling complex and nuanced queries. For example, **IRCoT** (Iterative Retrieval with Chain-of-Thought) guides the retrieval process using a chain-of-thought approach, where the system refines the CoT with the results obtained from each retrieval step. This allows for a more focused and precise search, gradually converging on the most relevant information [11]. The recursive nature of this process ensures that the system can handle complex and ambiguous queries effectively, as shown in the diagram below:\n\n![{Recursive retrieval involves breaking down the retrieval task into smaller sub-tasks, refining the search through a feedback loop.}](image2)\n\n### Adaptive Retrieval\nAdaptive retrieval introduces flexibility and active control over the retrieval and generation processes. Methods like **FLARE** and **Self-RAG** enable the model to dynamically decide when and what to retrieve based on the current context and the specific requirements of the task. This adaptability is crucial for enhancing the efficiency and relevance of the information sourced. For instance, the **Modular RAG** framework introduces specialized components such as the Search module, which adapts to specific scenarios by enabling direct searches across various data sources, and the Task Adapter module, which tailors RAG to different downstream tasks [10]. The adaptive nature of these methods allows the system to navigate through diverse data sources and select the optimal pathway for a query, as illustrated in the following diagram:\n\n![{Adaptive retrieval methods allow the model to dynamically determine the optimal moments and content for retrieval, enhancing efficiency and relevance.}](image6)\n\n### Conclusion\nIn summary, iterative retrieval refines and improves the quality of generated outputs through multiple rounds of retrieval and generation, recursive retrieval breaks down complex queries into manageable sub-tasks to achieve precise results, and adaptive retrieval provides flexible and active control over the retrieval process to enhance efficiency and relevance. Each method plays a crucial role in the RAG system, contributing to its overall effectiveness and versatility."}

In the distractor setting, where the model is provided with two gold paragraphs and eight distractor paragraphs, single-paragraph BERT achieves a high F1 score of 67.08 [7]. This indicates that many questions in the H OTPOT QA dataset can be answered with single-hop reasoning, even when distractors are present.\n\nHowever, in the open-domain setting, where the model must retrieve relevant paragraphs from a large pool of candidates, the performance drops considerably. When the model is given 500 retrieved paragraphs, including the gold paragraphs, the F1 score decreases to 39.12 [5]. This decline highlights the challenges of effective retrieval in multi-hop QA tasks, as the model often fails to retrieve the necessary gold paragraphs.\n\nTo further illustrate this point, consider the impact of using adversarial distractors. When the model is re-trained on adversarially selected distractors, it can recover some of its original accuracy, achieving an F1 score of 60.10 [2].

(2018), the components marked as 'Word LSTM-B' and 'Word LSTM-F' play crucial roles in capturing the context of words in a sentence.\n\nThe 'Word LSTM-B' component, which stands for Word Bi-LSTM Backward, processes the input sequence in reverse order. This allows it to capture the context of each word based on the words that follow it in the sentence. By doing so, it helps the model understand the future context of each word, which can be particularly useful for disambiguating words that might have different meanings depending on the subsequent words in the sentence.\n\nThe 'Word LSTM-F' component, which stands for Word Bi-LSTM Forward, processes the input sequence in the standard forward direction. This enables it to capture the context of each word based on the words that precede it in the sentence. It helps the model understand the past context of each word, which is essential for understanding the meaning of a word based on the preceding context.\n\nTogether, these two components form a bidirectional LSTM (Bi-LSTM) layer, which combines the forward and backward contexts to provide a richer and more comprehensive representation of each word in the sentence. This bidirectional approach is particularly effective in NER tasks because it allows the model to consider both the preceding and following words when making predictions, leading to improved performance.\n\nTo visualize this, consider the following diagram from the paper, which illustrates the flow of information through the Bi-LSTM layer:\n![{Word LSTM-B and Word LSTM-F capture the backward and forward context of each word, respectively, forming a bidirectional LSTM layer.}](image5)\n\nIn summary, the 'Word LSTM-B' and 'Word LSTM-F' components in Figure 4 capture the backward and forward context of each word, respectively, to provide a comprehensive representation for the NER task."}

Specifically, [7] states that both CNN and LSTM compositional functions perform better than SWEM in sentiment analysis, suggesting that word-order information is essential for analyzing sentiment orientations. This aligns with the hypothesis by Pang et al. (2002) that the positional information of a word in text sequences can be beneficial for predicting sentiment. For example, the phrases \"not really good\" and \"really not good\" convey different levels of negative sentiment, which are differentiated by their word orderings. LSTM models, which can capture this type of information through their recurrent transition functions, perform better in these tasks.\n\nTo further validate this, the authors conducted an experiment where they shuffled the words in the training set to remove word-order features and examined the impact on performance. The results are shown in the table from `![{Shuffled vs Original LSTM Performance on Yelp Dataset}](image4)`. On the Yelp polarity dataset, the accuracy drops significantly when the training set is shuffled, from 95.11% to 93.49%. This drop indicates that word-order information is indeed critical for sentiment analysis, as removing it leads to a notable decrease in performance.\n\nAdditionally, `![{Performance Comparison on Sentiment Analysis Datasets}](image7)` provides a detailed comparison of different models on sentiment analysis tasks. The table shows that LSTM models generally outperform SWEM models, which do not capture word-order information. For instance, on the SST-2 dataset, the LSTM model achieves an accuracy of 84.9%, while SWEM-concat, which combines multiple pooling strategies, reaches 84.3%.\n\nIn conclusion, word-order information significantly affects sentiment analysis accuracy in LSTM models, and removing this information leads to a noticeable drop in performance."}

This is evident from the results on various datasets, including PathMNIST, OrganAMNIST, BloodMNIST, and CIFAR-10-LT.\n\nFor instance, on PathMNIST, the 'Hard-to-Contrast' method achieves an AUC of 94.14% ± 1.0% with only 0.1% of the dataset labeled, significantly outperforming random selection, which achieves 92.27% ± 2.2% [6]. Similarly, on OrganAMNIST, the 'Hard-to-Contrast' method achieves an AUC of 84.35% ± 0.7% with 0.1% labeled data, compared to 81.75% ± 2.1% for random selection [6].\n\nOn BloodMNIST, the 'Hard-to-Contrast' method also shows a substantial improvement, achieving an AUC of 88.51% ± 1.5% with 0.1% labeled data, while random selection only reaches 83.36% ± 3.5% [6]. This trend is consistent across different datasets and varying numbers of labeled images, indicating that the 'Hard-to-Contrast' method is effective in improving model performance even with a small initial set of labeled data.\n\nAdditionally, the performance of the 'Hard-to-Contrast' method is not only superior at the initial stages but also maintains its advantage throughout the active learning cycles. For example, on PathMNIST, the 'Hard-to-Contrast' initial query strategy (red lines) outperforms other initial query strategies in every cycle of active learning [8]. This strong correlation between the initial and final performance highlights the importance of selecting a superior initial query [5].\n\nMoreover, the 'Hard-to-Contrast' method's effectiveness is further validated by its consistent outperformance across different datasets and budget regimes. For instance, on CIFAR-10-LT, the 'Hard-to-Contrast' method achieves an AUC of 87.35% ± 0.0% with 20% of the dataset labeled, compared to 66.12% ± 0.9% for random selection [6]. This significant improvement underscores the method's robustness and practicality in addressing the cold start problem in active learning.\n\nIn summary, the 'Hard-to-Contrast' method consistently outperforms other selection strategies in terms of AUC, particularly when the number of labeled images is limited.

This is evident from the experimental results and visual representations provided.\n\nFirst, let's consider the impact on specific models. According to the text, the DSGAN method was tested on several state-of-the-art models, including CNN+ONE, CNN+ATT, PCNN+ONE, and PCNN+ATT [4]. The results show that incorporating DSGAN leads to consistent performance gains across these models. For instance, the precision-recall (PR) curves in Figures 5 and 6 demonstrate that the models augmented with DSGAN outperform their counterparts without DSGAN [11].\n\nTo illustrate this further, let's look at the performance metrics. The Area Under the Curve (AUC) values for the PR curves of different models are provided in Table 2. The AUC values for the models with DSGAN are consistently higher, indicating better performance [11]. For example, the AUC value for CNN+ONE increases from 0.177 to 0.189, and for PCNN+ATT, it rises from 0.253 to 0.264. These improvements are statistically significant, as indicated by the p-values, which are all less than 0.05 [11].\n\nAdditionally, the visual representation in `![{The accuracy of the discriminator decreases over epochs, indicating the effectiveness of DSGAN in generating true positive samples}](image5)` clearly shows the decline in the discriminator's accuracy over epochs for different relation types. This decline signifies that the generator is becoming more effective at generating true positive samples, thereby challenging the discriminator and improving the overall performance of the relation extraction system.\n\nMoreover, the performance of the generator is evaluated by comparing the positive datasets generated by different methods, including random selection, pre-trained generator, and DSGAN generator. The results, as shown in `![{The positive set from the DSGAN generator yields the best performance, indicating its robustness in generating true positive samples}](image3)`, demonstrate that the positive set generated by the DSGAN generator consistently outperforms the other methods, further validating the effectiveness of DSGAN.\n\nIn conclusion, the addition of DSGAN significantly improves the performance of different models in relation extraction tasks by effectively filtering out false positive samples and generating true positive samples."}

Without repetition control, the model is designed to produce a high percentage of questions, aiming for a 100% question-asking rate. However, when repetition control is introduced, the model's ability to ask questions is reduced due to the constraints imposed by the repetition control mechanism.\n\nAs mentioned in the text, the weighted decoding feature `extrep bigram` is used to discourage bigrams that have appeared in previous utterances. This feature prevents the model from producing common question-asking bigrams, such as \"do you\" and \"what is,\" leading to a reduction in the question-asking rate. Specifically, the text states that the z=10 setting, which should ideally produce 100% questions, now only produces 79.67% questions when repetition control is applied [6].\n\nTo address this issue, an additional setting `z=10 (boost)` was introduced. In this setting, the `extrep bigram` feature is not used during weighted decoding but is used to rerank the candidates after beam search. This adjustment allows the model to produce necessary question-asking bigrams, resulting in a 99.54% question-asking rate, although it comes at the cost of slightly increased external bigram repetition [6].\n\nThis trade-off between reducing repetition and maintaining a high question-asking rate highlights the complexity of balancing these attributes in dialogue models. ![The introduction of repetition control reduces the question-asking rate at the highest control level (z=10) from 100% to 79.67%, but an adjusted setting (z=10 boost) restores it to 99.54%.](image1) \n\nIn summary, the introduction of repetition control reduces the question-asking rate at the highest control level (z=10) from 100% to 79.67%, but an adjusted setting (z=10 boost) restores it to 99.54%."}

However, we also need to consider the performance of the LLMs with logical constraints.\n\nFor instance, the LLaMA2-13B-PT model, when using logical constraints, achieved a Micro-F1 score of 70% on the ProofWriter task, which is even higher than the RoBERTa-Large (fully fine-tuned) model. This is evident from the table in Image 6, which provides a comprehensive comparison of different model configurations and their performance metrics.\n\nAdditionally, the table in Image 7 further supports this conclusion by showing the improvement in Micro-F1 scores when logical constraints are used. For example, the LLaMA2-13B-PT model with logical constraints (CoT w. logical constraints) achieved a Micro-F1 score of 70%, which is the highest among all configurations.\n\nTherefore, the model configuration that achieved the highest Micro-F1 score on the ProofWriter task is LLaMA2-13B-PT with logical constraints. ![LLaMA2-13B-PT with logical constraints achieved the highest Micro-F1 score on the ProofWriter task](image6)"}

The same trend is observed on BloodMNIST, where the 'Hard-to-Contrast' strategy not only outperforms other methods but also shows a strong correlation between the initial and final AUC scores [1][12].\n\nThis consistent outperformance is further supported by the visualization in the data maps, which show that hard-to-contrast queries have a greater spread within each cluster, ensuring better coverage and reducing the risk of introducing out-of-distribution data [6]. ![Hard-to-contrast queries have a greater spread within each cluster, ensuring better coverage and reducing the risk of introducing out-of-distribution data](image4)\n\nIn conclusion, the 'Hard-to-Contrast' querying strategy significantly improves the initial query selection in active learning, leading to better model performance across various stages of the learning process.

The question generator also relies on InstructGPT to generate the next relevant question needed for verifying the claim [2]. Similarly, the validator module uses InstructGPT to ensure the usefulness of the newly-generated QA pairs [4].\n\nMoreover, the question-answering module can be flexibly configured with different LLMs. For instance, the retriever–reader model combines a retriever to fetch relevant evidence from Wikipedia and a reader to generate answers [10], while FLAN-T5 directly generates answers and evidence based on its parametric knowledge [9]. The GPT3-based reciter–reader model is another alternative [5].\n\nThese modules collectively demonstrate the extensive use of LLMs in the QACHECK system, highlighting its reliance on these models to perform multi-step reasoning and fact-checking tasks effectively.\n\nTherefore, the number of modules implemented with a large language model backbone in the QACHECK system is four: the claim verifier, question generator, validator, and question-answering module.\n\n![{The system architecture highlights the use of LLMs in multiple modules.}](image3)"}

This breadth ensures that the benchmark covers a diverse array of topics, from Art Theory to Mechanical Engineering, as detailed in the statistics [9].\n\nMoreover, MMMU's depth is unparalleled. It requires models to not only perceive and understand various image formats, such as diagrams, tables, and medical images, but also to apply expert-level reasoning and domain-specific knowledge. For instance, a question might require a model to use Fourier Transform or Equilibrium Theory to derive a solution [2]. This level of complexity is illustrated in the example questions, which involve intricate tasks such as interpreting MRI scans or solving calculus problems [5][image5].\n\nIn contrast, other benchmarks like MathVista, which focuses solely on mathematical problems, or SEED, which covers a narrower range of subjects, do not offer the same level of depth and breadth [1][image4].

As described in [8], the user utterance is first mapped to an embedding space, and then these embeddings are fed into the bidirectional LSTM.

This approach contrasts with previous methods that separately encode the dialogue context and domain-slot pairs, leading to less effective matching.\n\nFor instance, in the DS-DST model, the BERT model is used to encode the dialogue context \\( X_t \\) and each domain-slot pair in \\( S \\). This encoding produces contextualized representations that are conditioned on the domain-slot information. These representations are then used to handle both non-categorical and categorical slots effectively [6].\n\nNon-categorical slots, such as the duration of a stay, are handled by finding text spans in the dialogue context using a two-way linear mapping. For categorical slots, such as the presence of parking, the model selects the most plausible values from a picklist based on the contextual representation [6].\n\nThis dual-strategy approach allows the model to flexibly handle different types of slots and improve the overall performance in dialog state tracking. The effectiveness of this method is evident in the results shown in the comparison tables, where DS-DST significantly outperforms other models like BERT-DST [10].\n\nAdditionally, the importance of strong interactions between the dialogue context and domain-slot pairs is further highlighted in the experimental results.

These mechanisms include base excision repair (BER), nucleotide excision repair (NER), direct reversal repair, mismatch repair (MMR), and recombination repair. Each of these pathways addresses specific types of DNA damage and ensures that the genetic material remains stable and functional.\n\nFor instance, base excision repair (BER) is a common pathway that deals with single-strand point mutations affecting one or few bases. This process involves the recognition and removal of damaged bases by glycosylase enzymes, followed by the addition of new, correct bases by polymerase enzymes and the sealing of the strand by ligase enzymes [5].\n\nNucleotide excision repair (NER) is another important mechanism that can handle a broader range of DNA lesions, including UV-induced pyrimidine dimers and bulky adducts. This pathway involves the excision of the damaged segment and its replacement with a new, correct sequence [6].\n\nDirect reversal repair is a simpler process that directly reverts specific types of damage, such as UV-induced pyrimidine dimers, without the need for DNA strand incision or resynthesis [11].\n\nMismatch repair (MMR) focuses on correcting errors that occur during DNA replication, such as single base mismatches. This involves recognizing and removing the incorrect segment, followed by the insertion of the correct bases and the resealing of the DNA strand [12].\n\nRecombination repair mechanisms are particularly important for addressing double-strand breaks, which can be highly detrimental to the genome. These mechanisms include homologous recombination repair (HR) and non-homologous end-joining repair (NHEJ).

According to the data in the provided tables, post-processing ensures that the LI is reduced to 0%, but this comes at the cost of potentially affecting the overall quality and performance of the models.\n\nFor instance, in the MAVEN-ERE dataset, the post-processing method reduces the LI to 0% for both models, but the micro-F1 score drops significantly. For Llama2-13B-PT, the micro-F1 score decreases from 18.0% to 11.0% when post-processing is applied, and for Vicuna-13B-PT, it decreases from 26.4% to 11.0%. Similarly, in the Causal-TimeBank dataset, the micro-F1 score for Llama2-13B-PT drops from 8.5% to 8.0%, and for Vicuna-13B-PT, it drops from 13.3% to 11.0% when post-processing is used to eliminate logical inconsistencies.\n\nThis trend is also evident in the broader analysis of the impact of post-processing on logical consistency and model performance. As stated in the text, \"Although our post-processing guarantees the absence of logical conflicts (resulting in LI of 0%), it may severely affect the quality of the whole generation. On one hand, the semantics of the post-processing answer may be far from the ground truth due to the random selection.

This improvement is particularly noteworthy given the complexity of the V3Det dataset, which includes 13,204 distinct classes.\n\nMoreover, in the LVIS dataset, the RAR model shows a substantial boost in performance.

This involves identifying key entities, facts, and rules present in the problem statement and converting them into a structured symbolic language [12].\n\nFor example, consider the problem involving \"Stranger Things\" and \"Black Mirror\" [image3]. The LLM would generate the following symbolic formulations:\n- Predicates: `NetflixShow(x)`, `Popular(x)`, `BingeWatch(x, y)`, `Download(x, y)`, `Share(x, y, z)`\n- Premises: \n  - `NetflixShow(strangerThings) ∧ Popular(strangerThings)`\n  - `∀x (NetflixShow(x) ∧ Popular(x) → BingeWatch(karen, x))`\n  - `∀x (NetflixShow(x) ∧ BingeWatch(karen, x) ↔ Download(karen, x))`\n  - `NetflixShow(blackMirror) ∧ ¬Download(karen, blackMirror)`\n  - `∀x (NetflixShow(x) ∧ BingeWatch(karen, x) → Share(karen, x, lisa))`\n\nNext, in the **Symbolic Reasoning** stage, a deterministic symbolic solver performs inference on the symbolic formulation. This solver uses logical rules to derive the answer to the problem [12]. In the \"Stranger Things\" and \"Black Mirror\" example, the symbolic solver would determine that the statement \"Black Mirror is popular\" is false [image3].\n\nFinally, in the **Result Interpretation** stage, a result interpreter translates the symbolic answer back into natural language. This ensures that the final answer is understandable and correctly aligned with the original problem [12]. In the given example, the predicted answer is \"False,\" indicating that \"Black Mirror\" is not popular [image3].\n\nBy combining the strengths of LLMs in natural language understanding and symbolic solvers in logical reasoning, LOGIC-LM effectively addresses complex logical problems with high accuracy and fidelity [12]."}

According to the provided data, the vanilla GPT-4 model already demonstrates strong performance, but the CAUSALCoT approach further improves its capabilities.\n\nFirstly, the CAUSALCoT approach achieves an accuracy of 70.40% on the CLADDER dataset, which is a substantial improvement over the vanilla GPT-4 by 8.37 points [5]. This improvement is consistent across different rungs of causal questions, with the performance decreasing as the questions become more complex, indicating that the approach is effective in handling a range of difficulty levels.\n\nAdditionally, the CAUSALCoT approach shows significant improvements on anti-common sensical and nonsensical data. While the vanilla GPT-4 performs well on common sensical data, it struggles with anti-common sensical and nonsensical data, performing 5.34 points worse on nonsensical data [10]. However, the CAUSALCoT approach enhances the reasoning ability across all levels, with a substantial improvement of 9.65 points on anti-common sensical data [3].\n\nTo better understand the reasoning abilities of the CAUSALCoT approach, an extensive analysis was conducted using the ROSCOE framework, which evaluates the multi-step reasoning quality of the model. The results, shown in Table 8 and Figure 9, provide detailed insights into the model's performance in terms of semantic consistency, logicality, informativeness, fluency, and factuality [12]. The CAUSALCoT approach is particularly strong in these areas, demonstrating a more robust and reliable reasoning process.\n\nThe effectiveness of the CAUSALCoT approach is also evident in the step-by-step performance analysis.

However, the model struggles more with steps requiring formal causal inference, such as Steps 3 and 5, which highlights the need for further enhancement in these areas [2].\n\nIn summary, the CAUSALCoT approach significantly improves the performance of GPT-4 across various evaluation metrics, particularly in causal reasoning tasks and on unseen data. ![The CAUSALCoT approach significantly enhances GPT-4's performance on causal reasoning tasks and unseen data.](image7)"}

According to the data, Amazon-AWS uses 30% renewable energy and 24% coal, while Microsoft uses 31% renewable energy and 23% coal [3]. \n\nThis comparison indicates that both companies have a relatively balanced mix of energy sources, but Microsoft has a slightly higher proportion of renewable energy and a slightly lower proportion of coal. This difference in energy sources can have notable implications for their CO2 emissions.\n\nRenewable energy sources, such as wind and solar, produce significantly fewer CO2 emissions compared to fossil fuels like coal. Therefore, the higher proportion of renewable energy in Microsoft's energy mix suggests that it may have a lower overall CO2 footprint per unit of energy consumed. Conversely, Amazon-AWS, with a higher proportion of coal, is likely to have higher CO2 emissions.\n\nTo put this into perspective, consider the average CO2 emissions per kilowatt-hour (kWh) of energy consumed. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) provides a conversion factor for CO2 emissions based on the energy mix in the United States, which is similar to the energy mix of Amazon-AWS [5]. This means that the CO2 emissions from Amazon-AWS's operations are likely to be closer to the U.S. average, which includes a significant portion of coal.\n\nIn contrast, Microsoft's higher reliance on renewable energy means that its operations are likely to produce less CO2 per kWh. This is particularly important for cloud services, where large amounts of energy are consumed for data processing and storage.\n\nTherefore, the energy consumption distribution of Amazon-AWS and Microsoft suggests that Microsoft's operations may have a lower environmental impact in terms of CO2 emissions due to its higher proportion of renewable energy and lower reliance on coal.\n\n![{Microsoft has a slightly higher proportion of renewable energy and lower coal usage compared to Amazon-AWS, suggesting lower CO2 emissions.}](image3)"}

According to the data in the table, the BiDAF model consistently outperforms the FastQA model on both WIKIHOP and MEDHOP datasets [12]. Specifically, on the WIKIHOP dataset, BiDAF achieves an accuracy of 42.9% on the standard test set and 49.7% on the test* set, while FastQA reaches 25.7% and 27.2% respectively. On the MEDHOP dataset, BiDAF scores 47.8% and 61.2%, whereas FastQA attains 23.1% and 24.5%. These results indicate that BiDAF is more effective in integrating information across multiple documents, likely due to its iterative latent interactions and bidirectional attention mechanism [6].\n\nTo further understand the performance differences, consider the \"gold chain\" setup, where only relevant documents are provided to the models. In this scenario, both models see a significant boost in performance, but BiDAF continues to outperform FastQA. For WIKIHOP, BiDAF reaches 57.9% and 63.4% in the gold chain setup, and 81.2% and 85.7% in the masked gold chain setup. FastQA, on the other hand, achieves 44.5% and 53.5% in the gold chain setup, and 65.3% and 70.0% in the masked gold chain setup [2]. This suggests that while FastQA benefits from reduced noise, it still struggles to integrate cross-document information as effectively as BiDAF [5].\n\nAdditionally, the performance drop when discarding documents that do not contain candidate mentions provides further insight. BiDAF shows a significant drop of 3.3% and 6.2% on MEDHOP, and 10.0% and 2.1% on WIKIHOP, indicating its reliance on cross-document information. FastQA, however, shows a slight increase of 2.2% and 3.2% on WIKIHOP and a decrease of 2.7% and 4.1% on MEDHOP, suggesting it has more difficulty leveraging cross-document information [5].\n\nIn summary, the BiDAF model outperforms the FastQA model on both WIKIHOP and MEDHOP datasets, particularly in scenarios requiring the integration of information from multiple documents. This is likely due to BiDAF's more sophisticated architecture, which includes iterative latent interactions and bidirectional attention mechanisms, making it better suited for multi-hop reasoning tasks.\n\n![{BiDAF outperforms FastQA on both WIKIHOP and MEDHOP datasets, especially in the gold chain setup.}](image2)"}

Specifically, the pre-processing involves two key steps: cropping and blurring [8]. \n\nCropping is used to isolate the regions of interest within the image based on the bounding box coordinates of the object proposals. This helps in focusing the model's attention on the specific objects that need to be recognized, rather than the entire image. Resizing the cropped regions to a fixed proportion ensures consistency in the input dimensions, which is important for the model's processing.\n\nBlurring is applied to the non-target areas surrounding the objects of interest. This technique helps to reduce distractions and guide the model's focus towards the relevant objects. By blurring the background, the model can better concentrate on the features of the objects, which is particularly useful in object detection datasets where objects can vary greatly in size and position.\n\nThese pre-processing steps are illustrated in the provided diagram, showing how the bounding boxes are used to crop and resize the regions of interest, followed by blurring the non-target areas.

One of the earliest notable works was the proposal by Jurgens and Stevens (2009) to use distributional methods to detect semantic shifts in a quantitative way. They introduced the concept of a Word:Semantic Vector:Time tensor, which allowed for the comparison of word meanings over different time spans [1].\n\nIn 2011, Gulordava and Baroni applied a distributional similarity approach to detect semantic changes in the Google Books Ngram corpus, achieving good correlation with human judgments [4]. This work highlighted the potential of large-scale corpora in studying semantic shifts.\n\nA pivotal moment came in 2014 with the work of Kim et al., who were among the first to use prediction-based word embedding models, specifically the Continuous Skipgram with negative sampling (SGNS), to trace diachronic semantic shifts [10]. This method significantly advanced the field by leveraging neural language models for temporal analysis.\n\nIn 2015, Kulkarni et al. demonstrated the robustness of computational methods for detecting semantic shifts across various time granularities, using datasets like Google Ngrams, Amazon Movie Reviews, and Twitter data [8]. Their findings confirmed that these methods could be applied to time spans less than a decade, opening up new possibilities for fine-grained analysis.\n\nHamilton et al. (2016a) further solidified the use of SGNS over explicit PPMI-based distributional models in semantic shifts analysis, showing that low-rank SVD approximations could perform comparably, especially on smaller datasets [10]. This work influenced subsequent research, leading to the widespread adoption of dense word representations.\n\nFinally, in 2017, Kutuzov et al. explored the temporal dynamics of semantic relations in word embeddings, applying these models to predict participants in armed conflicts [3]. This application demonstrated the practical utility of diachronic embeddings in understanding real-world events.\n\nThese milestones collectively illustrate the rapid progress in the computational detection of semantic shifts, driven by advancements in both methodologies and the availability of large, temporally rich datasets.\n\n![Key milestones in the development of diachronic semantic shifts research from 2010 to 2017](image1)\n\nThe key milestones in tracing diachronic semantic shifts from 2010 to 2017 include the introduction of distributional methods, the application of prediction-based word embeddings, and the robust use of diverse datasets to analyze semantic changes over time."}

Basic perceptual errors occur when the model accurately processes and understands the given information but fails in elementary visual interpretation, such as misjudging the sequence described as “from left to right, top to bottom.” Domain-specific perceptual errors, on the other hand, occur due to a lack of specialized knowledge. ![Perceptual errors are the most common type of error in GPT-4V](image1)\n\n2. **Lack of Knowledge (29%)**: This type of error is rooted in the model's insufficient specialized knowledge. For instance, in the context of Computer Science, the model might identify visual elements such as double circles but fail to interpret them accurately within the domain-specific context, such as their representation of an 'accept state' in Deterministic Finite Automata. Similarly, in medical contexts, the model may misinterpret specific anatomical structures, leading to flawed reasoning. [4]\n\n3. **Reasoning Error (26%)**: Reasoning errors occur when the model's initial incorrect interpretation of visual content leads to subsequent reasoning mistakes. For example, if the model misidentifies a bone in an image, all subsequent explanations and reasoning will be built on this incorrect basis, leading to a chain of errors.

It often involves setting a maximum depth or threshold to control the recursion depth.\n- **Adaptive**: This icon symbolizes flexible and active control over the retrieval and generation processes. It allows for dynamic adjustments based on the context and the needs of the query.\n\nEach of these icons is distinct and serves to visually differentiate the strategies used in the RAG framework. Therefore, the number of distinct icons used in Figure 3 is **three**. ![Figure 3 shows three distinct icons representing Iterative, Recursive, and Adaptive strategies](image3)"}

The results are summarized in the table shown in the first image `![{Removing the abstract significantly decreases performance, while adding authors or venues slightly decreases performance}](image1)`.\n\n1. **Abstract Removal**: When the abstract is removed from the input, the performance of the model drops significantly. Specifically, the average performance across all tasks decreases from 80.0 to 68.1 [8]. This indicates that the abstract is a crucial component for the model to capture the essence of the scientific document.\n\n2. **Author Inclusion**: Adding authors to the input (along with the title and abstract) actually hurts the performance of the model. The average performance decreases from 80.0 to 67.3 [8]. This is likely due to the sparsity of author names in the corpus and the suboptimal tokenization of author names by the Wordpiece tokenizer, leading to noisy correlations [8].\n\n3. **Venue Inclusion**: Including venues slightly decreases the overall performance, with the average dropping to 79.9 [8]. However, it is noted that venues have a higher correlation with document classification tasks, which explains why the performance on this specific task does not decrease as much [8].\n\nThese findings highlight the importance of carefully selecting the input features for the SPECTER model.

On the original dataset, BERT achieves a peak performance of 77%, but on the adversarial dataset, this drops to a peak of 53% [9].\n\n![{BERT's performance drops significantly on the adversarial dataset}](image5)"}

Under the general setting, GPT-4 (0.5) achieves a citation precision of 30.8%, recall of 42.1%, and an F1 score of 35.6%. In contrast, under the specific setting, GPT-4 (0.5) improves its citation precision to 36.0%, recall to 43.6%, and F1 score to 39.4% [6]. Similarly, ChatGPT (0.5) shows an improvement from a citation precision of 25.2%, recall of 47.4%, and F1 score of 32.9% in the general setting to a citation precision of 29.9%, recall of 49.0%, and F1 score of 37.2% in the specific setting [6].\n\nThis improvement in citation metrics under specific settings is consistent with the observation that specific questions provide clearer instructions to the models, leading to better performance in terms of citation precision and recall [3]. The specific questions target the knowledge more explicitly, ensuring that the models can more accurately cite the relevant information.\n\nNow, let's examine the text evaluation metrics. Under the general setting, GPT-4 (0.5) scores 4.38 in coherence, 4.77 in consistency, 4.48 in fluency, and 4.48 in relevance. Under the specific setting, these scores improve to 4.48 in coherence, 4.89 in consistency, 4.64 in fluency, and 4.72 in relevance [4]. For ChatGPT (0.5), the general setting yields scores of 4.64 in coherence, 4.89 in consistency, 4.45 in fluency, and 4.70 in relevance, while the specific setting improves these to 4.57 in coherence, 4.94 in consistency, 4.71 in fluency, and 4.81 in relevance [4].\n\nThese improvements in text quality metrics under specific settings further support the idea that specific questions lead to more coherent, consistent, fluent, and relevant text generation. The explicit nature of specific questions helps the models produce higher-quality text by providing clear guidance on the required knowledge and context.\n\nIn conclusion, the performance metrics of GPT-4 and ChatGPT under specific settings are notably better than those under general settings, particularly in terms of citation precision, recall, and text quality. This suggests that for tasks requiring accurate citations and high-quality text generation, specific questions should be used to guide the models. ![Improvement in citation and text metrics under specific settings](image6)"}

According to the data in Table 4 [12], the performance metrics for the Ultra-Fine category are broken down for different combinations of supervision sources.\n\nWhen all data sources are used (Crowd, Head, and Entity Linking), the model achieves an F1 score of 42.8%. However, when each source is removed individually, the performance changes as follows:\n\n- Removing the **Crowd** data (manually annotated data) results in an F1 score of 46.2%.\n- Removing the **Head** data (head word supervision) results in an F1 score of 31.7%.\n- Removing the **Entity Linking** (EL) data (supervision from both KB and Wikipedia definitions) results in an F1 score of 16.0%.\n\nThese changes indicate the importance of each data source:\n\n- **Crowd** data, while reducing the F1 score slightly when removed, suggests that it provides valuable ground truth annotations that help the model generalize.\n- **Head** data is crucial, as removing it leads to a significant drop in F1 score, highlighting its importance in predicting ultra-fine labels.\n- **Entity Linking** data is also essential, as removing it causes a substantial decrease in performance, indicating its role in providing rich contextual information.\n\n![{Removing head word supervision significantly reduces the F1 score for ultra-fine labels, emphasizing its importance.}](image3)\n\nIn conclusion, the exclusion of head word supervision has the most detrimental effect on the model's performance on the Ultra-Fine category, followed by the removal of entity linking data."}

This includes knowledge of Boolean search strings, which are essential for constructing accurate and efficient searches. For instance, the search string \"Engineering AND Java NOT Manager\" would produce results that include profiles related to engineering and Java but exclude those associated with management roles [2]. This skill is fundamental for all talent acquisition professionals, even as next-generation tools become more user-friendly [4].\n\nAdditionally, the exam covers best practices for using LinkedIn Recruiter, ensuring that candidates can perform actions optimally rather than just finding ways to complete tasks [5]. It also emphasizes the importance of understanding the entire recruiting lifecycle, from sourcing and engaging talent to posting jobs and managing the pipeline [6].\n\nUnderstanding Boolean search results through a Venn diagram is particularly relevant because it helps visualize the intersection and exclusion of different search criteria.

The thermal impedance data provides insight into how effectively these parts can dissipate heat, which is crucial for their reliable operation.\n\nAccording to the provided data, the thermal impedance values for the 8051AH and 8751BH parts are as follows:\n\n- For the 8051AH:\n  - 40-Pin Plastic DIP: \\( \\theta_{ja} = 45^\\circ C/W \\), \\( \\theta_{jc} = 16^\\circ C/W \\)\n  - 40-Pin CERDIP: \\( \\theta_{ja} = 45^\\circ C/W \\), \\( \\theta_{jc} = 15^\\circ C/W \\)\n\n- For the 8751BH:\n  - 40-Pin Plastic DIP: \\( \\theta_{ja} = 36^\\circ C/W \\), \\( \\theta_{jc} = 12^\\circ C/W \\)\n  - 40-Pin CERDIP: \\( \\theta_{ja} = 45^\\circ C/W \\), \\( \\theta_{jc} = 15^\\circ C/W \\)\n\nFrom this data, we can see that the 8751BH part has lower thermal resistance compared to the 8051AH part in the Plastic DIP package. Specifically, the 8751BH has a \\( \\theta_{ja} \\) of 36°C/W and a \\( \\theta_{jc} \\) of 12°C/W, while the 8051AH has a \\( \\theta_{ja} \\) of 45°C/W and a \\( \\theta_{jc} \\) of 16°C/W. This means the 8751BH can dissipate heat more effectively, leading to better thermal performance.\n\nFor the CERDIP package, both parts have the same \\( \\theta_{ja} \\) value of 45°C/W, but the 8751BH has a slightly lower \\( \\theta_{jc} \\) value of 15°C/W compared to the 8051AH's 15°C/W. However, this difference is minimal and may not significantly impact thermal performance.\n\nIn summary, the 8751BH part generally has better thermal resistance, particularly in the Plastic DIP package, making it more efficient at dissipating heat. ![The 8751BH has lower thermal resistance compared to the 8051AH, especially in the Plastic DIP package.](image5)"}

This ritual not only adds a sense of formality but also serves as a reminder of the traditions that have shaped the Navy over centuries.\n\nAnother significant moment during the event was the presentation and explanation of the Prisoner of War/Missing in Action table by Hospital Corpsman 1st Class Brian Knetsch [6]. This heartfelt tribute honored the memory of fallen or lost comrades, past and present, and underscored the importance of remembering those who have made the ultimate sacrifice for their country.\n\nThe event also featured a series of toasts, beginning with a toast to the Commander-in-Chief of the United States, followed by toasts to the U.S. Navy, U.S. Marine Corps, and other sister services, culminating in a salute to all sweethearts and spouses [9]. These toasts reinforced the unity and support within the military community and acknowledged the sacrifices made by service members and their families.\n\nThe evening concluded with a final toast to the United States Navy and the playing of \"Anchors Aweigh,\" symbolizing the end of the formal proceedings and the start of a more relaxed social gathering [7].\n\nIn addition to the ceremonial aspects, the event highlighted the importance of Navy Medicine research and development. Capt. Stephen Savarino, serving as the Vice President of the Mess, required junior officers to recite poems and odes to the research accomplishments of Naval forbears, demonstrating both a grasp of history and a flair for poetry [1]. This not only honored the past but also inspired the next generation of leaders in Navy Medicine.\n\nRear Adm. Bruce A.

For instance, in Liberia, which has been ravaged by a 14-year civil war, NAMRU-3 has been crucial in rebuilding the country's medical research capabilities [1]. Similarly, in Afghanistan, NAMRU-3 has partnered with the Ministry of Public Health and the Afghan Public Health Institute to enhance laboratory operations and diagnostic procedures. This includes providing comprehensive training for over 160 Afghan scientists and technicians [8], [9], [10]. These efforts are essential for improving local healthcare and ensuring that U.S. military personnel can operate in these environments with reduced health risks.\n\nNAMRU-3's collaborations extend beyond training. They have established and equipped multiple laboratories, including virology, bacteriology, and serology labs, within the Central Public Health Laboratory in Kabul [12]. Additionally, they have conducted workshops to train staff on proper laboratory procedures, quality control, and inventory management [5]. These initiatives help in creating sustainable healthcare systems and enhancing disease surveillance, which is vital for both public health and military readiness.\n\nMoreover, NAMRU-3 works closely with the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) through the Cooperative Biological Engagement Program (CBEP) to improve biodefense and disease surveillance efforts [3]. This collaboration ensures that the U.S. government's biodefense strategies are more efficient and synergistic, further supporting military operations in regions with potential biological threats.\n\nOn the other hand, the Naval Submarine Medical Research Laboratory (NSMRL) focuses on the health and performance of submariners and special operations forces. NSMRL is the primary human technology laboratory for the Commander, Submarine Forces (CSF) and is tasked with conducting medical, psychological, and human performance research [6]. This research is crucial for understanding and mitigating the unique challenges faced by submariners, such as prolonged confinement, high pressure, and extreme environments.\n\nOne of NSMRL's notable achievements is the addition of an external hatch to the Genesis hyperbaric chamber, which allows for the simulation of high-altitude and deep-sea conditions [6]. This capability is essential for studying mission profiles that involve transitions between different environments, such as special operations forces locking out of a submarine and scaling a mountain. The data collected from these studies can inform the development of new technologies and protocols to enhance the safety and effectiveness of military operations.\n\nIn summary, both NAMRU-3 and NSMRL contribute significantly to medical and scientific research, with their missions aligning closely with U.S. military operations by enhancing healthcare in conflict zones, improving biodefense, and ensuring the health and performance of military personnel in challenging environments. ![NAMRU-3 training Afghan scientists and technicians](image1) ![NSMRL's Genesis hyperbaric chamber](image2)"}

For instance, the Joint Planning Group (JPG) chaired by Lt. Col. Andrew Hocking from USPACOM's Functional Plans Branch involves multiple stakeholders, including the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the State of Hawaii, to formulate and update plans for responding to pandemics and other infectious diseases [1]. This collaborative effort ensures a comprehensive approach to health security.\n\nAdditionally, the Rickettsial Diseases Research Program trains individuals in regions where rickettsial diseases are endemic, thereby enhancing the capability to manage these diseases both in military and civilian populations [2]. This training is crucial for reducing the risk of rickettsial diseases, which can significantly impact health and operational readiness.\n\nIn Liberia, the NMRUs have been instrumental in building medical research capacity. NAMRU-3 has collaborated with the Liberian Institute of Biomedical Research (LIBR) on projects focused on disease vector surveillance and control, which have benefited both the Liberian Armed Forces and the broader population [3][7]. This collaboration has enabled Liberia to independently expand its vector-borne disease surveillance and detection capabilities, contributing to the overall health and safety of the region.\n\nFurthermore, NAMRU-3 has provided vector control training to the Armed Forces of Liberia (AFL) with the assistance of the Office of Overseas Liaison (OOL). This training has significantly improved the ability of local forces to protect their soldiers and families from disease [5][9]. The combination of insecticide spraying, surveillance, and geospatial mapping has effectively reduced the incidence of malaria among U.S. troops, demonstrating the effectiveness of integrated force health protection policies [10].\n\nThe Naval Health Research Center (NHRC) has also developed the Patient Condition Occurrence Frequency (PCOF) tool, which generates tables showing the occurrence probabilities of various diseases and injuries. This tool is essential for military medical planning and helps in developing patient streams for health care simulations, ensuring better preparedness for a range of military operations, including humanitarian assistance and disaster relief [8][11].\n\nIn another initiative, scientists from Kazakhstan visited the Rickettsial Diseases Research Program laboratories at the Naval Medical Research Center (NMRC) in Silver Spring, Maryland, for training on molecular assays. This international collaboration, supported by the Cooperative Biological Engagement Program (CBEP) of the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA), enhances global health security by sharing advanced scientific techniques [6].\n\nThese activities highlight the multifaceted role of the U.S. Naval Medical Research Units in supporting both military personnel and local communities, fostering health and security across different regions.\n\n![{Collaborative efforts enhance pandemic response and health security}](image1)\n![{Training programs improve disease surveillance and control in endemic regions}](image2)\n![{NAMRU-3's collaboration with LIBR builds Liberia's medical research capacity}](image3)\n![{Vector control training protects soldiers and their families from disease}](image4)\n![{Integrated force health protection policies reduce malaria incidence}](image5)\n![{Development of the PCOF tool aids in military medical planning}](image6)\n![{International collaborations share advanced scientific techniques}](image7)\n![{Comprehensive support ensures health and security across regions}](image8)\n\nThe U.S. Naval Medical Research Units support both military personnel and local communities by enhancing disease surveillance, providing critical training, and developing advanced tools for health care planning."}

According to the levels of analytics and the analytics value chain, this transformation can be broken down into several key steps.\n\nFirst, **data collection** is crucial. This involves gathering raw data from various sources, ensuring it is accurate and complete [3]. Once the data is collected, it moves into the **descriptive analytics** stage, where it is transformed into information. Descriptive analytics answers the question \"What happened?\" by providing backward-looking reports and dashboards that summarize past performance ![Descriptive analytics provides backward-looking reports and dashboards](image2).\n\nNext, the data is analyzed further to understand **why** certain outcomes occurred. This is the realm of **diagnostic analytics**, which delves deeper into the data to identify patterns and root causes. At this stage, statistical analysis and query drilldowns help uncover the underlying reasons behind the observed trends [3].\n\nFollowing diagnostic analytics, **predictive analytics** comes into play. Predictive analytics uses historical data to forecast future trends and outcomes. This forward-looking approach helps organizations anticipate what might happen next, enabling proactive decision-making [3].\n\nFinally, **prescriptive analytics** takes the insights gained from predictive analytics and translates them into actionable recommendations. Prescriptive analytics answers the question \"What actions are needed?\" by providing specific guidance on how to optimize business processes and achieve the best possible outcomes [3].\n\nThroughout this process, the **analytics value chain** ensures that each step adds value and leads to impactful actions. The chain starts with data collection and progresses through analysis, decision-making, and action, ultimately leading to business impact [3]. As Ken Rudin from Facebook emphasizes, the goal is to ensure that insights lead to tangible changes and improvements within the organization [12].\n\nIn summary, the transformation of data into business value is a multi-stage process that leverages different levels of analytics, from descriptive to prescriptive, to drive informed and impactful decisions."}

The Analytics Value Chain, as described in [1], outlines the steps from data collection to impact, emphasizing that the true value is realized only when the insights lead to action and measurable outcomes. This means that merely collecting and analyzing data is insufficient; the insights must be used to make decisions and take actions that drive business impact.\n\nOn the other hand, the Levels of Analytics framework, illustrated in `![{Descriptive analytics provide backward-looking insights, while prescriptive analytics offer forward-looking recommendations.}(image5)`, categorizes analytics into different levels: descriptive, diagnostic, predictive, and prescriptive. Each level builds upon the previous one, providing deeper insights and more actionable recommendations.\n\n### Descriptive Analytics\nDescriptive analytics, as shown in `![{Descriptive analytics provide backward-looking insights, while prescriptive analytics offer forward-looking recommendations.}(image5)`, answers the question \"What happened?\" by looking at historical data. This is the foundational level where raw data is transformed into information, such as reports and dashboards, which provide a snapshot of past performance. For example, a report showing server load averages over time, as depicted in `![{Server load averages over time show historical performance trends.}(image8)`, helps in understanding past system behavior.\n\n### Diagnostic Analytics\nDiagnostic analytics delves deeper to answer \"Why did it happen?\" by analyzing the data to identify patterns and root causes. This level of analytics is crucial for understanding the underlying factors behind the observed trends. For instance, a query drilldown (OLAP) to find the exact location of a problem, as mentioned in `![{OLAP queries help in identifying specific issues within the data.}(image7)`, provides the necessary context to understand why certain events occurred.\n\n### Predictive Analytics\nPredictive analytics uses statistical models and machine learning to forecast future trends and outcomes. It answers the question \"What will happen next?\" by leveraging historical data to make predictions. This level is essential for proactive decision-making. For example, predictive modeling can forecast future server load based on historical data, helping in capacity planning and resource allocation.\n\n### Prescriptive Analytics\nFinally, prescriptive analytics goes beyond prediction to recommend specific actions to achieve desired outcomes. It answers the question \"What actions are needed?\" by providing actionable insights. This level is the culmination of the analytics process, where the insights are translated into concrete steps that can be taken to drive business impact. For instance, a recommendation to optimize server performance based on predictive analytics can lead to improved system efficiency and reliability.\n\n### Integration with the Analytics Value Chain\nThe integration of these levels with the Analytics Value Chain ensures that each step in the process is aligned with the goal of driving business impact. For example, descriptive analytics provides the necessary historical context, which is then analyzed to diagnose issues, predict future trends, and ultimately prescribe actions. This alignment ensures that the insights generated are not just informative but also actionable, leading to tangible business benefits.\n\nIn conclusion, the Analytics Value Chain and the Levels of Analytics complement each other by ensuring that data is not only collected and analyzed but also transformed into actionable insights that drive business impact."}

Homologous chromosomes, which are pairs of chromosomes that carry the same genes but may have different versions (alleles), align at the center of the cell along the metaphase plate. This alignment is facilitated by the mitotic spindle, which is composed of microtubules that attach to the kinetochores of the homologous chromosomes [2]. The kinetochores are protein structures located at the centromeres of the chromosomes [6].\n\nThe alignment of homologous chromosomes ensures that they will be equally distributed to the opposite poles of the cell during Anaphase I, reducing the chromosome number by half in the resulting daughter cells [5]. Additionally, during Prophase I, which precedes Metaphase I, homologous chromosomes undergo synapsis, where they pair up and form tetrads. This pairing allows for the exchange of genetic material through a process called crossing over, which increases genetic diversity [1].\n\n![Homologous chromosomes align at the metaphase plate during Metaphase I](image2)\n\nIn summary, the key processes and features during Metaphase I of meiosis include the alignment of homologous chromosomes at the metaphase plate, the attachment of spindle fibers to kinetochores, and the preparation for the separation of homologous chromosomes during Anaphase I."}

In animal cells, this process is characterized by the formation of a cleavage furrow, which is a constricting ring of microfilaments that pinches the cell in two [2]. The cleavage furrow deepens until it completely separates the cell into two daughter cells, as shown in the image depicting the cleavage furrow during cytokinesis ![Cleavage furrow forms and deepens during cytokinesis](image2).\n\nIn plant cells, cytokinesis occurs through the formation of a cell plate, which originates from vesicles containing cell wall material.

Once insights are derived, they are used to inform decisions. These decisions are then translated into actions, which are implemented within the organization. The final stage is the impact, where the actions taken based on the data-driven decisions result in tangible business outcomes [2].\n\nTo illustrate this process, consider the different types of analytics that can be applied at various stages of the chain. Descriptive analytics, for instance, looks backward and raises questions about what has happened. It involves generating reports, dashboards, and alerts that provide raw data and information but lack context `![{Descriptive analytics provides backward-looking data without context}](image2)`.\n\nPrescriptive analytics, on the other hand, is forward-looking and aims to answer questions by combining data and information to generate insights.

He observed that when he crossed true-breeding plants with different traits, such as purple flowers and white flowers, the resulting F1 generation displayed only one of the parental traits—purple flowers in this case [11]. This phenomenon can be explained by the concept of dominant and recessive alleles.\n\nIn the F1 generation, all plants had purple flowers because the allele for purple flowers (P) is dominant over the allele for white flowers (p). Each F1 plant received one dominant allele (P) from one parent and one recessive allele (p) from the other parent, making their genotype Pp [11].\n\nWhen these F1 plants (Pp) were allowed to self-pollinate, producing the F2 generation, the segregation of alleles during gamete formation led to a variety of possible combinations in the offspring. The Punnett square for this cross shows that there are four possible combinations: PP, Pp, Pp, and pp [image4]. This results in a genotypic ratio of 1:2:1, with one homozygous dominant (PP), two heterozygous (Pp), and one homozygous recessive (pp) [image4].\n\nThe phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation is 3:1, with three plants having purple flowers (PP and Pp) and one plant having white flowers (pp) [image1]. This ratio is a direct result of the dominance of the purple flower allele over the white flower allele. The white flower trait, which seemed to disappear in the F1 generation, reappeared in the F2 generation due to the presence of the homozygous recessive genotype (pp) [11].\n\nThus, Mendelian inheritance explains the phenotypic and genotypic ratios observed in the F2 generation of pea plants through the principles of dominance, segregation, and independent assortment of alleles. ![The Punnett square and phenotypic ratio for a monohybrid cross showing 3:1 ratio of purple to white flowers](image4)"}

According to the Law of Continuity [12], elements of objects tend to be grouped together if they form a continuous line. This means that each line in the graph is perceived as a continuous trend, making it easier to track changes over time.\n\nAdditionally, the Law of Proximity [5] suggests that we tend to see objects that are visually close together as belonging to part of a group. In the context of the graph, this means that data points that are close to each other on the same line are perceived as part of the same trend, reinforcing the continuity of each line.\n\nThe Law of Similarity [3] also plays a role here. If the lines in the graph have similar colors or patterns, they are likely to be perceived as belonging to the same category, further aiding in the interpretation of trends.\n\nBy applying these principles, we can observe the following trends in the multi-line graph chart over the six months:\n\n- **Line A**: Shows a steady increase from July to September, followed by a slight decline in October and November, and then a sharp increase in December.\n- **Line B**: Exhibits a gradual decrease from July to October, with a slight uptick in November and a significant rise in December.\n- **Line C**: Remains relatively stable from July to September, then shows a moderate increase in October and November, and a slight dip in December.\n\nThese observations are consistent with the principles of Gestalt psychology, which help us perceive the overall patterns and trends in the data.\n\nIn conclusion, the multi-line graph chart over the six months shows varying trends for each line, with some showing steady increases, others gradual decreases, and some remaining relatively stable before changing direction. ![{Trends in the multi-line graph chart over the six months show varying patterns for each line.}](image4)"}

This approach often involves high-level discussions and initial modeling to identify the key areas of focus. For example, during the inception phase, stakeholders might engage in initial release planning and discuss new requirements and needs during iteration demos [3]. This ensures that the team has a clear understanding of the overall direction and can align their efforts accordingly.\n\nOn the other hand, 'Elicitation Methods' are more focused on gathering detailed requirements through various techniques. These methods include just-in-time (JIT) model storming, look-ahead modeling, and acceptance test-driven development (ATDD). For instance, JIT model storming involves quick, informal modeling sessions to clarify requirements just before they are needed, ensuring that the team has the necessary details to proceed with development [4].\n\nBoth strategies are essential and often used in conjunction to provide a comprehensive approach to requirement gathering. 'Needs Exploration' sets the foundation by aligning the team with stakeholder goals, while 'Elicitation Methods' ensure that the team has the detailed information required to deliver a high-quality product.\n\nTo illustrate, consider the following visual representation of the agile development process, which highlights the importance of active stakeholder participation and just-in-time modeling [image2]. ![Active stakeholder participation and just-in-time modeling](image2)\n\nIn summary, 'Needs Exploration' and 'Elicitation Methods' complement each other in agile management by ensuring that stakeholder requirements are both broadly understood and specifically detailed."}

According to the provided information, pressing and holding the Up button has several functions, but none directly mention the Down button. However, we can infer the behavior of the Down button based on the general button functions described.\n\nFor instance, the Up button can be used to access the app list screen and go to settings, as well as to power off the device [11]. Similarly, the Down button is often used to open the current app [5].\n\nGiven this context, pressing and holding the Down button is likely to have a similar significant action. Typically, in many devices, holding a button for an extended period triggers a more critical function, such as powering off or restarting the device. However, the specific function for the Down button is not explicitly mentioned in the provided text.\n\nTo provide a more accurate answer, let's consider the image descriptions. Image 2 describes the functions of the buttons, and it mentions that pressing and holding the Up button can power on the watch when it is off or access the restart/power off screen when the watch is on `![Press and hold - Power on the watch when the watch is off. - Access the restart/power off screen when the watch is on.](image2)`.\n\nSince the Down button is not explicitly mentioned in the images, we can infer that the Down button might have a similar but distinct function. Based on common device behaviors, pressing and holding the Down button might also lead to a significant action, such as accessing a settings menu or initiating a shutdown sequence.\n\nHowever, without explicit confirmation, the most accurate conclusion is that pressing and holding the Down button likely performs a critical function, possibly related to system settings or power management.\n\nIn summary, pressing and holding the Down button will likely trigger a significant function, such as accessing system settings or initiating a shutdown sequence."}

According to the Gestalt principles, elements are perceived as a whole rather than as individual parts, and this concept is beautifully illustrated in the way the word is visually presented.\n\nFirstly, the principle of **proximity** suggests that elements that are close to each other are perceived as a group. In the word \"GESTALT,\" the letters are closely spaced, creating a cohesive unit that is easily recognized as a single word [1]. This proximity helps the viewer to quickly identify the word as a whole rather than focusing on each letter individually.\n\nSecondly, the principle of **similarity** plays a role in how the letters are designed. Letters with similar shapes or features are often perceived as part of the same group. For example, the letters 'G' and 'T' share vertical lines, and the letters 'A' and 'L' have a similar open structure, which helps to create a harmonious and unified appearance [10].\n\nAdditionally, the principle of **closure** is evident in the way the word is designed. Even if some parts of the letters are not fully closed, our brain tends to fill in the gaps to perceive the complete form. For instance, the letter 'A' might have an open top, but we still perceive it as a complete letter because our brain completes the missing parts [11].\n\nFinally, the principle of **continuity** is also at play. The flow of the letters from left to right creates a continuous line that guides the eye smoothly through the word, reinforcing the perception of the word as a single, coherent entity [3].\n\nThese principles work together to make the word \"GESTALT\" visually appealing and easy to recognize, demonstrating the practical application of Gestalt psychology in design. ![The word \"GESTALT\" is designed with close spacing and similar shapes, illustrating the principles of proximity and similarity.](image2) \n\nIn conclusion, the principles of Gestalt psychology manifest in the design of the word \"GESTALT\" through proximity, similarity, closure, and continuity, making it a cohesive and recognizable visual element."}

This involves working with geo-referenced (P625) items and SPARQL queries to generate maps where groups of items can be toggled on or off. The objective is to familiarize participants with the foundational skills needed to visualize data spatially. ![{Module 1 focuses on basic flat and layered maps in Wikidata.}](image1)\n\n### Module 2: Embedded Maps in Wikimedia Projects\n**Module 2** builds on the basics by teaching participants how to embed Wikidata-driven maps into other Wikimedia projects such as Wikipedia and Commons. This module delves into the use of SPARQL, OpenStreetMap, GeoJSON, and the MediaWiki Kartographer extension. The goal is to enable users to integrate their maps into a broader range of platforms, enhancing the visibility and utility of their work. ![{Module 2 covers embedding maps in Wikimedia projects like Wikipedia and Commons.}](image2)\n\n### Module 3: Interactive, Layered Off-Wiki Maps\nFinally, **Module 3** advances to the creation of interactive, layered maps that can be used off-Wiki, meaning they can be embedded in regular HTML pages. This module introduces additional tools and techniques, including basic Python and Jupyter notebooks, to build more sophisticated and dynamic maps. The aim is to equip participants with the skills to create maps that can be used outside the Wikimedia ecosystem, expanding their applicability and reach. ![{Module 3 focuses on creating interactive, layered off-Wiki maps using additional tools like Python.}](image3)\n\nEach module builds on the previous one, starting with basic map creation, moving to embedding maps in Wikimedia projects, and culminating in the creation of advanced, interactive maps that can be used in a variety of external contexts.\n\nThe key learning objectives for each module differ in complexity and application:\n- **Module 1**: Basic map creation using SPARQL and geo-referenced data.\n- **Module 2**: Embedding maps in Wikimedia projects using various extensions and formats.\n- **Module 3**: Creating advanced, interactive maps for use in external HTML pages with additional programming tools.\n\nBy the end of the workshop, participants will have a comprehensive understanding of how to create and utilize maps in both on-Wiki and off-Wiki environments."}

Specifically, curved items or those with recesses should be placed at an angle so that water can run off [4]. Utensils like knives and forks should be positioned in a way that they do not touch each other or the door seal, which can be damaged by sharp points. Long and sharp items, such as carving knives, must be placed horizontally in the upper basket to avoid injury [4]. \n\nFor **dishes**, the guidelines recommend placing larger and more difficult-to-clean items, such as pots, pans, lids, serving dishes, and bowls, in the lower basket [9]. These items should be positioned on the sides of the racks to avoid blocking the rotation of the top spray arm.

The address of the EPROM location to be programmed is applied to Port 1 and pins P2.0-P2.4 of Port 2, while the code byte to be programmed into that location is applied to Port 0 [1].\n\nFor programming the lock bits specifically, the setup is similar to normal EPROM programming but with some differences. The key configuration details are as follows:\n\n- **Port 2.6 (P2.6)**: This pin must be held at a logic high [12].\n- **Other Pins**: The other pins should be held at the \"Program\" levels indicated in Table 3 [12].\n- **ALE/PROG**: This pin is pulsed low for 50 ms to program the code byte into the addressed EPROM location [9].\n- **$\\overline{{\\mathsf{E A}}}/\\mathsf{v}_{\\mathsf{P P}}$**: This pin must be raised to Vpp (12.75 ± 0.25 Volts) before ALE/PROG is pulsed low [11].\n\nAdditionally, the timing parameters for the programming pulses are crucial. The programming supply voltage (Vpp) must be 12.5 to 13.0 V, and the oscillator frequency should be between 4 and 6 MHz [2]. The ALE/PROG pin is pulsed low for 100 μs, 25 times, as shown in the waveform diagram [3].\n\nHere is a visual representation of the pin configurations and timing parameters for programming the lock bits:\n![{Programming the lock bits requires specific pin configurations and timing parameters.}](image5)\n\nIn summary, to program the lock bits (LBx) in the 875XBH, you need to set P2.6 to a logic high, hold other pins at the \"Program\" levels, pulse ALE/PROG low for 50 ms, and ensure the $\\overline{{\\mathsf{E A}}}/\\mathsf{v}_{\\mathsf{P P}}$ pin is at Vpp (12.75 ± 0.25 Volts).\n\nThe required pin and signal configurations for programming the lock bits (LBx) in the 875XBH include setting P2.6 to a logic high, holding other pins at the \"Program\" levels, pulsing ALE/PROG low for 50 ms, and ensuring the $\\overline{{\\mathsf{E A}}}/\\mathsf{v}_{\\mathsf{P P}}$ pin is at Vpp (12.75 ± 0.25 Volts)."}

The specific SPARQL query used to generate the map includes logic to assign colors based on the land area of each country [6].\n\nThe relevant part of the SPARQL query is:\n```sparql\nBIND (\n  IF(?area < 5000, '#FOFSFr',\n    IF(?area < 100000, '#BOEQE6',\n      IF(?area < 300000, '#87CEEB',\n        IF(?area < 800000, '#1E90FF',\n          IF(?area < 1500000, '#468284',\n            IF(?area < 2000000, '#6A5ACD',\n              '#4B0082')))))) AS ?color\n)\nBIND (?color AS ?fill)\nBIND (?color AS ?stroke)\n```\n\nThis query assigns different colors based on the land area of the country. To find the color of Mali, we need to know its land area. According to the data provided, Mali is a country in Africa with a land area of approximately 124,019 square kilometers [4].\n\nGiven this land area, we can see that Mali falls into the category where the land area is less than 300,000 square kilometers. Therefore, the color assigned to Mali would be `#87CEEB`.\n\nTo confirm this, we can also look at the image that displays the map of Africa with color-coded zones [image10].

These trends highlight the increasing focus on improving patient safety, reducing medical errors, and enhancing the quality of care through the implementation of various IT solutions.\n\nOne significant trend is the growing emphasis on reducing medical errors and promoting patient safety. This is evident in the increased interest in implementing electronic medical records (EMRs), which can help streamline patient data and reduce the risk of errors. For instance, the push to implement EMRs has gained momentum, as seen in the comparison between 2005 and 2006 results [image5]. The adoption of EMRs is crucial for connecting IT at hospitals and remote locations, facilitating better data sharing and coordination of care.\n\nAnother notable trend is the implementation of wireless systems and the upgrade of network infrastructure. These technologies are essential for enabling real-time access to patient data and improving the efficiency of clinical workflows [image5]. Additionally, the adoption of point-of-care decision support systems and digital picture archiving (PACS) has also increased, reflecting the need for advanced diagnostic tools and better clinical decision-making [image6].\n\nHowever, despite these positive trends, several barriers continue to impede the widespread adoption of IT in healthcare. The most significant barriers include lack of financial support, staffing resources, and effective vendor delivery [image2]. Proving the quantifiable benefits and return on investment (ROI) of IT systems remains a challenge, as does achieving end-user acceptance and securing clinical leadership and top management support. The lack of common data standards and strategic IT plans further complicates the adoption process [image2].\n\nSecurity concerns also play a critical role in the adoption of healthcare IT. Issues such as internal and external breaches, unauthorized use of data, and patients' lack of confidence in the security of their information are significant barriers [image4]. Ensuring HIPAA compliance and implementing robust security measures, including firewalls, user access controls, and data encryption, are essential steps to address these concerns [image7].\n\nIn summary, while there has been a noticeable increase in the adoption of healthcare IT applications from 2005 to 2006, particularly in areas like EMRs, wireless systems, and network upgrades, the identified barriers such as financial constraints, staffing issues, and security concerns continue to pose significant challenges. ![Healthcare IT adoption trends from 2005 to 2006 show a focus on reducing medical errors and improving patient safety, but barriers like financial support and security concerns persist.](image5)"}

The lead funnel typically includes several stages: Total Leads, Marketing-Qualified Leads (MQLs), Sales-Accepted Leads (SALs), Sales-Qualified Leads (SQLs), and Won Opportunities (SWOs). Each stage has a conversion rate that indicates how many leads move from one stage to the next.\n\nFrom the provided image2, we can see the following conversion rates:\n- **Lead to MQL Conversion Rate**: 52.07%\n- **MQL to SAL Conversion Rate**: 1.50%\n- **SAL to SQL Conversion Rate**: 83.08%\n- **SQL to SWO Conversion Rate**: 6.67%\n\nThese rates show the percentage of leads that successfully transition from one stage to the next in the funnel.\n\nNow, let's compare these rates with the average conversion rates provided in marketing diagnostics. While the text does not explicitly provide average conversion rates, we can infer that these rates are used to benchmark the performance of the lead funnel.\n\nFor instance, in the text [8], it is mentioned that the metrics for measuring outcomes (conversions) are linked to engagement and exposure metrics. This implies that the conversion rates in the lead funnel are part of a broader set of metrics used to evaluate marketing performance.\n\nAdditionally, image7 provides a visual representation of the lead funnel with the following conversion rates:\n- **Inquiries to MQIs**: 45% to 75%\n- **MQIs to SALs**: 4% to 8%\n- **SALs to SQLs**: 20% to 60%\n- **SQLs to Opportunities**: 25%+\n\nComparing these ranges with the specific rates from image2, we can see that:\n- The **Lead to MQL Conversion Rate** of 52.07% falls within the range of 45% to 75%.\n- The **MQL to SAL Conversion Rate** of 1.50% is lower than the range of 4% to 8%, indicating a potential area for improvement.\n- The **SAL to SQL Conversion Rate** of 83.08% is higher than the range of 20% to 60%, suggesting strong performance at this stage.\n- The **SQL to SWO Conversion Rate** of 6.67% is lower than the range of 25%+, indicating another area for improvement.\n\nBy comparing these specific rates with the average benchmarks, we can identify which stages of the lead funnel are performing well and which need attention. This analysis helps in optimizing the marketing and sales processes to improve overall conversion rates.\n\nIn conclusion, the conversion rates in the lead funnel progression are crucial for understanding the effectiveness of the marketing and sales processes. By comparing these rates with industry benchmarks, marketers can identify areas for improvement and optimize the funnel to enhance conversion rates. ![{Comparison of specific conversion rates with industry benchmarks to identify performance areas}](image2)"}

However, we can infer some context from the historical timeline of the Space Race and the general economic trends of the period.\n\nThe Space Race, as depicted in the timeline in image3, shows significant milestones from the 1960s through the early 2000s. These events include the Mercury, Gemini, Apollo, Skylab, and Space Shuttle programs, among others. During this period, the U.S. government invested heavily in space exploration, which had broader economic implications.\n\nWhile the exact figures for healthcare spending as a percentage of GDP are not provided, we can use historical data to understand the trend. According to various sources, U.S. healthcare spending as a percentage of GDP increased significantly from the 1960s to 2007. In 1960, healthcare spending was around 5% of GDP, and by 2007, it had risen to approximately 16% of GDP.\n\nThis increase in healthcare spending can be attributed to several factors, including advancements in medical technology, an aging population, and rising healthcare costs. The period also saw the introduction and expansion of Medicare and Medicaid in the 1960s, which increased government expenditure on healthcare.\n\nNow, let's consider how this trend relates to the major events in the Space Race. The 1960s were marked by significant government spending, not only on healthcare but also on the space program. The Apollo program, which aimed to land humans on the Moon, required substantial funding and resources. This dual focus on healthcare and space exploration reflects a broader trend of increasing government investment in various sectors during this period.\n\nThe economic context of the time, characterized by robust government spending and technological advancements, likely contributed to the rise in healthcare spending as a percentage of GDP. The Space Race, while a different domain, shares the theme of significant government investment and technological innovation.\n\nIn conclusion, U.S. healthcare spending as a percentage of GDP increased from approximately 5% in 1960 to around 16% in 2007. This trend aligns with the broader economic context of the period, including significant government investments in both healthcare and the Space Race. ![The Space Race timeline highlights major events from the 1960s through the early 2000s, reflecting significant government spending and technological advancements.](image3)"}

It acts as the central brain, coordinating and controlling multiple subsystems to ensure optimal performance, efficiency, and emissions.\n\nFirstly, the ECU monitors and controls the fuel injection process. It determines the precise amount of fuel to inject based on various parameters such as the throttle position, air intake, and engine temperature [4]. For instance, when the throttle pedal is pressed, more air enters the engine, and the ECU adjusts the fuel injection accordingly to maintain the correct air-fuel ratio [3]. This is illustrated in the diagram where connection lines represent the flow of information and control signals between components ![{Connection lines represent the flow of information and control signals between components}](image1).\n\nAdditionally, the ECU manages the ignition timing, which is critical for efficient combustion. By adjusting the timing of the spark, the ECU ensures that the fuel-air mixture ignites at the optimal moment, enhancing power output and fuel economy [5].\n\nThe ECU also controls the idle speed of the engine. It uses the crankshaft position sensor to monitor the engine's RPM and adjusts the idle speed through a programmable throttle stop or an idle air bypass control [6]. This ensures that the engine runs smoothly at idle without stalling.\n\nFurthermore, the ECU monitors the engine's operating conditions and reports this information to the Engine Control Module (ECM) [9]. It relies on data from various sensors to make real-time adjustments and maintain optimal performance. The ECU's ability to read values from multidimensional maps, which are generated by sensor devices, allows it to fine-tune the engine's operation [11].\n\nIn summary, the ECU is responsible for managing fuel injection, ignition timing, and idle speed, ensuring that the engine operates efficiently and reliably."}

For instance, the utility derived from eating each additional hot dog diminishes rapidly, as shown in the graph where the utility from the first hot dog is +6, but it drops to 0 by the third hot dog and becomes negative by the fourth [image1]. This illustrates the principle that after a certain point, consuming more of the same good can actually decrease overall satisfaction.\n\nHowever, in competitive contexts, the dynamics of diminishing marginal utility can be quite different. In a competitive setting, such as a hot dog eating contest, the focus and intention behind the consumption can significantly alter the utility curve. For example, in the 2007 hot dog eating championship, Joey Chestnut's utility from each hot dog consumed remains high even as he approaches and surpasses the number of hot dogs eaten by his competitor, Takeru Kobayashi. At the point where Joey ties Kobayashi (64 hot dogs), the utility from each additional hot dog is still positive, and the cumulative effect of focused practice and competition drives him to consume more, ultimately winning the championship [image1].\n\nThis difference highlights the importance of context in understanding marginal utility. In standard consumption, the focus is on individual satisfaction, which tends to decline with increased consumption. In contrast, in competitive settings, the focus on performance and the psychological drive to outdo others can sustain or even increase the utility derived from each additional unit of consumption, despite the physical limitations and diminishing returns [image1].\n\nTherefore, the concept of diminishing marginal utility differs between standard consumption and competitive contexts due to the influence of focus, competition, and the psychological drive to achieve mastery."}

Unfortunately, the provided images do not directly show banana export data from Ecuador. However, we can infer some trends from the general economic and policy context provided in the images. Image 7 provides insights into the economic environment of Indonesia, which might not be directly applicable to Ecuador but gives a sense of economic conditions in developing countries during this period. The ease of access to capital and the days needed to start a business can indirectly suggest a favorable environment for exports, including bananas [7].\n\nNext, let's examine the changes in time spent with family and friends from 2005 to 2010. Image 4 provides a breakdown of how people spent their time on weekends during these years. According to the data, the percentage of time spent on various activities, including eating out, hobbies, net surfing, and watching films, can give us a broader context of lifestyle changes. Notably, the time spent on eating out and net surfing increased slightly, while the time spent on hobbies and reading remained relatively stable. However, the specific category for \"time spent with family and friends\" is not explicitly mentioned [4].\n\nGiven the lack of direct data on banana exports from Ecuador and the absence of a specific category for time spent with family and friends, we can make a few reasonable assumptions. The economic conditions in developing countries, as shown in Image 7, suggest that there was likely a supportive environment for exports, which could have positively influenced banana exports from Ecuador. On the other hand, the slight increase in time spent on activities like net surfing and eating out might indicate a trend towards more individual or digital leisure activities, potentially reducing the time spent with family and friends.\n\nIn conclusion, while the data does not provide a direct comparison, it suggests that banana exports from Ecuador were likely supported by favorable economic conditions, whereas the time spent with family and friends may have been impacted by a shift towards more individual activities. ![Economic conditions in developing countries were generally favorable, supporting exports.](image7) ![Leisure activities shifted slightly towards more individual pursuits.](image4)"}

For instance, the Tmall Campus - Zijing store and the Tmall Campus - Qingfen store both operate from 8:30am to 11:30pm every day [image8]. Similarly, the Tmall Campus - Guanchou store and the Zhaolanyuan Supermarket also have long operating hours, which provide students with ample time to shop even after evening classes or late-night study sessions.\n\nIn contrast, off-campus supermarkets, while still convenient, have slightly different and sometimes shorter operating hours. For example, the Lotus Supermarket and BHG Supermarket, both located in the Wudaokou area, are open from 9:00am to 9:00pm [image4]. Carrefour, located in the Zhongguancun area, operates from 8:30am to 10:00pm, which is a bit longer than the Wudaokou supermarkets but still closes earlier than the on-campus options [image4].\n\nThese differences in opening hours can significantly affect students' shopping schedules. On-campus supermarkets, with their extended hours, offer more flexibility for students who might have varying class schedules or need to shop late at night. Off-campus supermarkets, while still accessible, may require students to plan their shopping trips more carefully to fit within the earlier closing times.\n\nIn summary, the extended opening hours of on-campus supermarkets provide greater convenience and flexibility for students, allowing them to shop at any time, whereas off-campus supermarkets may necessitate more planned shopping trips due to their earlier closing times. ![On-campus supermarkets have longer operating hours](image8)"}

At the shu stage, where you begin to learn the techniques and philosophies of disciplined agile development, the focus is on building a strong foundation [3]. This foundational knowledge is essential for later stages, such as the ha stage, where you reflect upon and question why these strategies work, seeking to understand the range of strategies available and when they are best applied [1].\n\nOne key aspect of Needs Exploration is the facilitation of requirements envisioning and modeling, which helps in defining the initial scope and goals of the project [6]. This process is often lightweight and iterative, ensuring that the team can quickly adapt to changing requirements and stakeholder feedback. For instance, informal modeling sessions and just-in-time (JIT) model storming are techniques that allow for rapid and flexible requirement gathering and validation ![Explore Initial Scope](image3).\n\nElicitation Methods, on the other hand, involve various techniques to gather and validate requirements from stakeholders. These methods can include interviews, usage modeling, domain modeling, and user interface modeling. The level of detail required can vary depending on the complexity of the project and the distribution of stakeholders. For example, when stakeholders are geographically distributed, business analysts (BAs) at each location can help in eliciting and validating requirements [5]. Techniques like acceptance test-driven development (ATDD) and test-driven development (TDD) ensure that requirements are not only well-defined but also executable, reducing the need for extensive documentation [10].\n\nAdditionally, active stakeholder participation is crucial in agile projects. This can be achieved through regular coordination meetings, iteration planning, and all-hands demos, which keep stakeholders informed and engaged throughout the project lifecycle. Just-in-time (JIT) planning and look-ahead modeling help in addressing immediate and future needs, ensuring that the team is always aligned with stakeholder expectations ![Active stakeholder participation](image6).\n\nIn summary, the processes of Needs Exploration and Elicitation Methods contribute to addressing stakeholder needs in agile project management by providing a structured yet flexible approach to requirement gathering and validation, ensuring continuous stakeholder engagement, and adapting to changing requirements throughout the project lifecycle."}

During interphase, the cell grows and prepares for division, which is subdivided into three phases: G1, S, and G2 [2].\n\nIn the G1 phase, the cell undergoes growth and increases its cytoplasmic content [2]. This phase is crucial for the cell to accumulate the necessary resources and proteins needed for subsequent stages. ![Interphase includes G1, S, and G2 phases](image1)\n\nThe S phase follows, during which DNA replication occurs, and chromosomes duplicate [1]. This ensures that each daughter cell will receive a complete set of genetic material. ![DNA synthesis occurs during the S phase](image1)\n\nFinally, the G2 phase involves further growth and preparation for cell division [2]. The cell checks for any DNA damage and synthesizes additional proteins required for mitosis.\n\nThe mitotic (M) phase includes mitosis and cytokinesis [4]. Mitosis is the division of the nucleus, ensuring that each daughter cell receives an identical set of chromosomes [8]. During early mitosis, the chromatin condenses into visible chromosomes, each consisting of two sister chromatids joined at the centromere [8]. ![Chromosomes consist of sister chromatids joined at the centromere](image2)\n\nCytokinesis is the division of the cytoplasm, which typically follows mitosis [4]. In animal cells, this involves the formation of a cleavage furrow, while in plant cells, a cell plate forms to separate the two daughter cells [6].\n\nIn summary, the main stages of the cell cycle are interphase (G1, S, and G2) and the mitotic (M) phase (mitosis and cytokinesis)."}
