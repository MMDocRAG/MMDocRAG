According to the text and image quotes:\n\n- **Overall Trends**: The share of Americans saying Islam is more likely than other religions to encourage violence has dropped from 50% in September 2014 to 46% in December 2015, indicating a slight decrease in perceived likelihood of Islam encouraging violence compared to other religions [4]. This trend is reflected in image1, which shows a decrease in percentages over time for various demographic groups.\n\n- **Political Divides**: The partisan divide over whether Islam encourages violence is now as wide as it has ever been. Fully 68% of Republicans say Islam encourages violence more than other religions, a historical high but little changed since last fall. By contrast, just 30% of Democrats say Islam is more likely to encourage violence than other religions, down from 42% in September 2014 but on par with Democratic opinion at other points in recent years [8]. This is visually represented in image5, which shows a significant increase in Republican views from 2014 to 2015, while Democratic views have remained relatively stable.\n\n- **Demographic Differences**: The perception is starkly divided by political affiliation. For example, 77% of conservative Republicans say Islam is more likely to encourage violence than other religions, while 73% of liberal Democrats say Islam is no more likely than other religions [7]. Image2 illustrates this divide, showing that Democrats are much less likely than Republicans to believe Islam is more likely to encourage violence.\n\n- **Age and Generational Differences**: Younger Americans (ages 18-29) are less likely to associate Islam with violence compared to older age groups. In December 2015, only 32% of those ages 18 to 29 say Islam encourages violence to a greater degree than other faiths, compared with roughly half of those in other age groups [2]. Image1 also shows a decrease in perceived likelihood of violence among younger demographics.\n\n- **Religious Group Differences**: Seven-in-ten white evangelical Protestants say Islam encourages violence more than other religions, the highest percentage of any religious group and little changed from 2014. By comparison, about half of Catholics (49%) and white mainline Protestants (51%) say this [9]. Image3 highlights these differences, showing higher percentages"}

For instance, 76% believe inequality will worsen, and 64% think people will struggle to find meaningful work. Conversely, 43% believe the economy will become more efficient, and 42% think people will focus more on what matters. **Image3** provides a detailed breakdown of these perceptions, showing a clear majority expecting negative outcomes.\n\n- **Support for Limitations**: There is strong support for limiting the impact of automation, such as enacting a universal basic income or national service programs.

{"q_id": 57, "model": "InternVL3-8B", "in_tok": 11645, "out_tok": 512, "total_tok": 12157, "response": "### Answer:\n\nThe perceptions of ethical standards and extremism between the Republican and Democratic parties are significantly influenced by both education and political affiliation. Independents are more likely to view neither party as having high ethical standards, with 34% saying so, compared to 19% of Republicans and 18% of Democrats. This suggests that independents are more critical of both parties. However, when it comes to describing their own party as having high ethical standards, majorities of both Republicans (66%) and Democrats (64%) do so, indicating strong self-perception within their respective parties ([4]). \n\nThe perception of extremism is also divided along partisan lines. More Americans view the Republican Party as \"too extreme\" (48%) than the Democratic Party (42%), though this perception has declined since last June for Republicans from 54% to 48% ([3]). Democrats and Democratic leaners are more likely to view the Republican Party as too extreme (72%) than their own party (28%), reflecting partisan polarization. \n\nEducation levels play a role in these perceptions. Among those with at least a college degree, 31% say neither party has high ethical standards, compared to 26% with some college and 20% with a high school degree or less ([5]). Similarly, 49% of those with some college education view the Republican Party as too extreme, compared to 42% of those with a high school degree or less ([3]). This indicates that higher education levels may correlate with a more nuanced or critical view of both parties.\n\nThe data also shows that partisans are less positive about their own party's ethical standards compared to their views of the opposing party. For example, while 80% of Republicans and 88% of Democrats believe their own party has good policy ideas, only 28% of Republicans and 21% of Democrats think the opposing party shares this view ([7]). This partisan divide is evident in the perception of ethical standards, with 41% of Americans viewing the GOP as having high ethical standards and 42% viewing the Democratic Party similarly ([9]).\n\n**Conclusion:** Independents are more critical of both parties on ethical standards, while partisans are more positive about their own party. Education influences these perceptions, with higher education levels often leading to a more critical view, and partisan affiliation deeply divides opinions on both ethical standards and extremism.\n\n![Total perceptions of ethical standards and extremism by party and education]()\n\n!["}

According to the survey by Pew Research Center, a significant majority of Americans, regardless of party affiliation, view China negatively in terms of its handling of the pandemic. However, Republicans are more critical and hold a more unfavorable view of China compared to Democrats. \n\n**Republicans**:\n- **Handling of the Outbreak**: A substantial majority of Republicans (82%) believe China has done a bad job, with 61% saying it has done a very bad job. This is significantly higher than the 54% of Democrats who share this view [2, 4, 10].\n- **Blame for Global Spread**: A large proportion of Republicans (73%) believe China's initial handling of the outbreak in Wuhan contributed a great deal to the global spread of the virus, compared to 38% of Democrats [5].\n- **U.S.-China Relations**: Republicans are more likely to support holding China responsible for the outbreak, even if it means worsening economic relations.

According to the survey data, **73% of Republicans** believe that China's initial handling of the coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan contributed a great deal to the global spread of the virus, compared to **38% of Democrats** who hold the same view [3][7]. This partisan divide is evident in the percentage of Americans who think the U.S. should hold China responsible for the outbreak, with **71% of Republicans** favoring this stance, compared to **37% of Democrats** [3]. \n\nOver time, these perceptions have become more negative across the political spectrum.

In the U.S., there has been a notable decline in the percentage of people who believe European allies should increase their defense spending. In 2017, 45% of Americans felt their allies should dedicate more resources to national defense, but by 2019, this figure dropped to 35% [4]. This trend is reflected in the image1, which shows a decrease in support for increased spending from 45% in 2017 to 35% in 2019 for Americans, while Germans' views have remained relatively stable, with a slight increase in support from 32% to 40% for maintaining or increasing spending [10].\n\nIn Germany, the public is divided on whether to increase or maintain current levels of spending, with about four-in-ten taking each view. In 2017, about half of Germans were content with their country’s defense spending, while about a third felt it should be increased [10]. This division is evident in image1, where Germans are split between increasing (40%) and keeping the same (41%) defense spending in 2019.\n\nPartisan differences are also significant in both countries. In the U.S., Republicans and Republican-leaning independents are more likely than Democrats to favor increased defense spending in Europe. However, the share among Republicans who think the U.S.’s European allies should increase their defense budgets has fallen by 14 percentage points between 2017 and 2019 [3].

According to the text, Republicans and Republican-leaning independents are more likely to favor increased defense spending in Europe compared to Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents. However, there has been a decline in this view among Republicans, with a 14 percentage point drop between 2017 and 2019. Democrats have also seen a modest decline in their support for increased defense spending. This partisan gap is evident in the data, where Republican-leaning independents consistently see U.S. military bases in Germany as an important part of their country's national defense, with 90% in 2019, compared to 80% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents. The image1 shows that in 2019, 35% of Americans thought European allies should increase defense spending, while 40% of Germans held the same view.\n\nIn Germany, the political landscape also shows significant differences. Supporters of the CDU/CSU are more in favor of defense spending increases, with 51% in favor, compared to 41% of SPD members and only 28% of Greens. Younger Germans, particularly those aged 18-29, are less likely to see the importance of American military bases in Germany for national security, with 62% considering them not important, compared to 61% of those aged 65 and older. The image3 illustrates these differences, showing that CDU/CSU supporters are more inclined to favor increased defense spending.\n\n**Changes Over Time:**\n\nThe data indicates a shift in opinions over time.

According to the text and image quotes, roughly six-in-ten Germans aged 18 to 29 believe that U.S. military bases in Germany do not contribute to German national security, while 61% of those aged 65 and older find them important [9]. This generational divide highlights a potential shift in younger Germans' views on the role of U.S. military presence. Image 3 visually supports this, showing that only 15% of Germans find U.S. military bases \"very important\" for Germany's national security, compared to 56% of Americans who hold the same view [3, 8].\n\n**In the U.S., political affiliation plays a crucial role**. Republicans and Republican-leaning independents are more supportive of the American military presence in Germany, with 62% in 2017 and 59% in 2018 expressing support, as shown in image 2.

According to the provided text and image quotes, there is a clear partisan divide in opinions on whether the U.S. should focus on its own problems or help other nations. Republicans, particularly conservatives, are more likely to believe the U.S. should deal with its own problems, with 76% of Republicans and 80% of conservative Republicans holding this view (Text [5], [6]). In contrast, Democrats, especially liberal Democrats, are more inclined to support helping other countries, with 64% of liberal Democrats favoring this stance (Text [8]).\n\nEducation also plays a role in shaping these views. Higher education levels correlate with a greater willingness to support international assistance. For instance, 60% of postgraduates believe the U.S. should help other countries deal with their problems, compared to 29% of those with a high school diploma or less (Text [10]). College graduates are evenly split, while those with some college experience and those with a high school diploma or less are more likely to prioritize domestic issues (Text [10]).\n\nThe data from the images further illustrate these trends. Image 1 shows that across all age groups, older Americans are more critical of China's handling of the pandemic, but they are also more likely to believe the U.S. should deal with its own problems (Text [4]). Image 2 highlights a shift over time, with a growing perception that the U.S. has given too much aid internationally, peaking at 62% in 2020 (Text [8]). Image 3 confirms that Democrats, especially liberals, are more supportive of international aid, with 64% of liberal Democrats favoring this approach, compared to 53% of conservative Democrats (Text [8]). Image 4 breaks down these views by race and age, showing that younger and minority groups are more likely to support international engagement, while older and white groups are more skeptical (Text [4]).\n\nIn summary, political affiliation and education are key determinants of views on U.S. global engagement. Republicans and those with lower educational attainment are more likely to advocate for focusing on domestic issues, while Democrats and those with higher education levels are more supportive of international assistance.\n\n![Political and educational differences in views on U.S. global engagement](image1)  \n![Shift in perceptions of international aid](image2"}

According to the provided quotes and images, Republicans are more likely to believe that the U.S. can learn from other countries and tend to evaluate the U.S.'s handling of the pandemic less positively compared to those who think the U.S. cannot learn from abroad. For instance, only 44% of Republicans who believe the U.S. can learn from other countries say the U.S. is doing an excellent or good job handling the outbreak, compared to 63% of those who think the U.S. cannot learn much from overseas [5]. This partisan divide is also evident in evaluations of China's handling of the pandemic, where Republicans are much more likely to say China has not handled the crisis well, with 80% of conservative Republicans holding this view [9].\n\nDemocrats, on the other hand, are more likely to give high marks to South Korea and Germany, with differences of less than 10 percentage points between Democrats and Republicans in these evaluations [4]. However, when it comes to the U.S. itself, Democrats are divided along partisan lines, with only 27% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents believing the U.S. has done a good or excellent job handling the outbreak, compared to 71% of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents [8].\n\nThe images further illustrate these partisan differences. Image 1 shows that Republicans are more likely to believe the U.S. can learn from other countries, with a 22% difference in positive evaluations of Germany, while Democrats are more critical of China's handling of the pandemic [1]. Image 2 highlights the significant partisan gap in evaluating the U.S.'s handling of the pandemic, with 71% of Republicans and 27% of Democrats holding a positive view [8]. Image 3 and Image 4 provide detailed breakdowns by age, education, and political ideology, showing consistent partisan divides in perceptions of both the U.S. and China's responses to the pandemic.\n\nIn summary, political affiliation plays a crucial role in shaping perceptions of pandemic responses, with Republicans generally being more critical of the U.S. and more positive about learning from other countries, while Democrats tend to have more positive views of other nations' responses and are more divided on the U.S.'s handling of the crisis.\n\n![Partisan differences in U.S. and China's handling of COVID-19]()\n\n![Partisan differences in"}

According to the text and images provided:\n\n- **Overall Optimism**: Latinos are more optimistic about their financial future than the general public. In 2015, 81% of Latinos expected their family's finances to improve, compared to 61% of the general population, marking the largest gap since the series began [3, 9, 10]. This optimism has grown by 14 percentage points since 2008 [9, 10].\n\n- **Education Level**: The optimism gap is particularly pronounced among those with some college education, who saw a 20 percentage point increase, compared to a 9-point increase for those with a high school diploma or less [2]. This aligns with the trend that Americans with more education fared better during the Great Recession and recovered faster [5].\n\n- **Age Group**: Younger Hispanics (ages 18-29) and middle-aged groups (30-49, 50-64) saw the largest gains in optimism, with increases of 13, 16, and 16 percentage points, respectively [5]. Older Hispanics (65 and older) also showed improvement, albeit less pronounced, with a 7-point increase [5].\n\n- **Demographic Breakdown**: Both Latino men and women became more optimistic, with men showing an 18-point increase and women an 11-point increase [6].

According to the text and image quotes, Latino adults reported a positive shift in their economic well-being, with a notable increase in the percentage of those who felt their family income was not keeping up with the cost of living. In 2015, about 53% of Latinos said their family income was not keeping up with the cost of living, compared to 59% in 2014, indicating a decrease in this perception over the year. This improvement is further highlighted by the fact that ratings of personal finances improved among most Latino demographic subgroups, with increases of 16 to 18 percentage points across various categories such as age, education level, and generational status [3][6][10].\n\nThe data from image1 shows that in 2015, 53% of Hispanics felt their income was falling behind, 37% felt it was staying about even, and 10% felt it was going up faster than the cost of living. This is a shift from 2014, where 53% felt they were falling behind, 34% felt it was staying even, and 9% felt it was going up faster. The general public's view, as shown in image4, also improved, with the percentage of Hispanics rating their financial situation as excellent or good increasing from 76% in 2008 to 81% in 2015, while the general public's rating increased from 61% to 67% over the same period.\n\nImage2 provides a timeline showing that Latino views of their financial situation were more positive in 2015 than in 2004, when only 31% rated their financial condition as excellent or good.

Seniors, particularly those aged 65 and older, exhibit lower rates of internet access and device ownership compared to the general adult population. According to the text and images provided:\n\n- **Internet Usage**: The percentage of seniors who use the internet is lower than that of all adults. For instance, the text states that 27% of online seniors represent 27% of the total older adult population, and 46% of online seniors use social networking sites like Facebook. This indicates a substantial gap in internet adoption between seniors and younger adults. Image 1 illustrates this trend, showing that only 71% of seniors go online every day or almost every day, compared to higher percentages in younger age groups (e.g., 94% of 18-29 year olds).\n\n- **Device Ownership**: Seniors also have lower smartphone ownership rates. Image 3 shows that only 18% of seniors own a smartphone, compared to 55% of all adults. This is further supported by the text, which mentions that smartphone ownership decreases substantially for seniors in their mid-70s and nearly disappears among those 80 and older. Additionally, broadband adoption is lower among seniors, as seen in Image 2, where only 37% of seniors have broadband at home, compared to 65% of those aged 65-69.\n\n- **Daily Internet Usage**: Despite lower initial adoption rates, once seniors become internet users, they tend to integrate it into their daily routines. The text highlights that 71% of seniors who use the internet go online every day or almost every day, and an additional 11% do so three to five times per week. Image 1 confirms this, showing that 71% of seniors go online daily or almost daily, which is lower than the 94% of 18-29 year olds but still significant.\n\n- **Influence of Income and Education**: The text notes that younger, higher-income, and more highly educated seniors adopt technology at higher rates. Image 5 supports this by showing that 91% of all adults own a cell phone, compared to 77% of seniors, and 86% of all adults have internet access compared to 59% of seniors.

According to the text and image quotes, seniors who have graduated from college are **three times as likely** to own both an e-book reader and a tablet compared to those who have not attended college. Specifically, **30%** of college graduates own both devices, compared to **12%** of those with a high school diploma or less. This trend is consistent with the national average, where tablets and e-book readers are more popular among college graduates and higher-income Americans [4]. \n\nThe data in image3 supports this, showing that tablet and e-book reader ownership is highest among seniors with a college degree, at **31%** for tablets and **30%** for e-book readers, compared to **11%** for those with a high school diploma or less. This indicates a strong correlation between higher education and technology adoption.\n\nComparing this to the adoption trends of technology among different age groups over time, image4 illustrates that younger age groups (18-29 and 30-49) have higher adoption rates of tablets and e-book readers compared to older age groups (50-64 and 65+).

Workers with higher levels of education tend to view these technologies more positively, finding them to make their work more interesting and provide opportunities for career advancement. For instance, 64% of college graduates report that technology has made their work more interesting, compared to 38% of those with a high school diploma or less. Similarly, 53% of college graduates feel technology has increased their opportunities for career advancement, compared to 32% of their less-educated counterparts. This disparity is evident in the data from image1, which shows that college graduates are more likely to find technology beneficial in terms of job interest and career advancement.\n\nMoreover, the impact of technology on job interest and career advancement is more pronounced among college graduates. As depicted in image1, college graduates are more likely to find technology interesting (64% vs. 38%) and to see it as a driver for career advancement (53% vs. 32%). This suggests that higher education equips individuals with the skills and knowledge to leverage technological advancements effectively, enhancing their professional experiences.\n\nRegarding the future of driverless car technology, the public's expectations are quite optimistic. As stated in text quote [2], 94% of Americans are aware of the development of driverless vehicles, and a substantial majority anticipates their widespread adoption.

Workers with higher education levels tend to have more positive views of technology's impact on their careers compared to those with lower educational attainment. For instance, college graduates are more likely to believe that technology has made their work more interesting (64% vs. 38%) and increased their opportunities for career advancement (53% vs. 32%) compared to those with a high school diploma or less [9]. This is further supported by the data in image1, which shows that college graduates have markedly higher positive impacts from technologies like word processing or spreadsheet software (90% vs. 45%) and email or social media (72% vs. 45%) compared to those with a high school diploma or less.\n\nIn contrast, workers with lower educational attainment are more likely to perceive technology as having had no meaningful impact on their careers. For example, 44% of workers with a high school diploma or less report that technologies like word processing or email have not impacted their careers in any significant way [7]. Image1 also highlights this disparity, showing that a significant portion of non-college educated workers (45% for word processing or spreadsheet software) feel these technologies have had no positive impact on their jobs or careers, compared to just 2% of college graduates.\n\nAdditionally, image3 illustrates that college graduates are more likely to find their work more interesting (64%) and have increased opportunities for advancement (53%) due to technology, while those with a high school diploma or less are less likely to see these positive effects (38% and 32%, respectively). This trend is consistent across various technologies, as shown in image1, where the differences in positive impacts are substantial for tools like smartphones (27 points) and software managing daily schedules (21 points).\n\nThe data in image2 further supports this, showing that younger workers (ages 18-24) and those employed part-time are more likely to have had their pay or hours reduced due to automation, which may contribute to their more negative perceptions. However, the overall trend remains that higher education levels correlate with more positive perceptions of technology's impact on job opportunities and work interest.\n\n### Conclusion:\nWorkers with higher educational attainment are more likely to view technology positively in terms of job opportunities and work interest, while those with lower educational levels are more likely to perceive little or no impact from technological advancements.

According to the text and image quotes:\n\n- **Bullying and Deception**: Men are more likely than women to encounter bullying and deceptive behavior on social media. Specifically, 29% of men frequently see people being mean or bullying, compared to 19% of women [9]. In terms of deception, 24% of men see people trying to be deceptive, while only 13% of women do so [5]. Image 1 visually supports these findings, showing that men report higher percentages of both bullying (29%) and deceptive behavior (24%) compared to women (19% and 13%, respectively).\n\n- **Correcting Misinformation**: When it comes to correcting misinformation, the survey indicates a more balanced view between men and women. Around two-thirds of users see an even mix of people trying to be deceptive and those trying to correct misinformation. Men (58%) and women (67%) are equally likely to see an equal mix of both behaviors [5]. Image 1 also shows that both genders perceive an equal mix of deceptive and corrective behavior, with 17% of men and 17% of women more often seeing corrective actions.\n\n- **Frequency of Dramatic Posts**: The frequency of encountering dramatic or exaggerated posts is high for both genders, with 58% of users frequently seeing such content [3]. Image 4 confirms this, showing that 58% of users frequently encounter posts that are overly dramatic or exaggerated.\n\nThe differences in perceptions may relate to the frequency of encountering dramatic posts, as men might be more exposed to exaggerated content, which could influence their perception of other online behaviors. The high frequency of dramatic posts (88%) suggests that users are regularly exposed to content that might skew their views on the prevalence of other behaviors like bullying and deception.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nMen are more likely than women to encounter bullying and deceptive behavior on social media, while both genders perceive an equal mix of corrective actions. The high frequency of dramatic posts (88%) may contribute to these perceptions, as users are frequently exposed to exaggerated content that could affect their interpretation of other online behaviors. \n\n![Men more likely to see bullying and deception](image1)  \n![Equal mix of corrective actions](image1)  \n![High frequency of dramatic posts](image4)"}

And in this instance, a slightly larger share of men (29%) than women (19%) say they more often see people being mean or bullying content on social media platforms than see kind behavior. Women, on the other hand, are slightly more likely than men to say that they more often see people being kind or supportive.

According to the data, men are 29% more likely than women to see mean or bullying content on social media, and they are twice as likely to perceive deceptive posts compared to women (24% vs. 13%). In contrast, women are slightly more likely to see kind or supportive behavior (24% vs. 17%). These differences suggest that social media platforms may need to tailor their recommendations and advertisements to address these gender-specific concerns. For instance, platforms could implement more robust content moderation to reduce bullying and deceptive behavior, especially for men. Additionally, they might"}

Republicans and Democrats have starkly different views on the U.S. response compared to other affluent nations, with Republicans showing a slight majority (22%) believing the U.S. has been more effective, while Democrats overwhelmingly (87%) disagree [1]. This partisan gap is evident in views of public health officials, where Democrats trust CDC officials more (72%) than Republicans (53%) [4]. Similarly, Democrats are more likely to give positive ratings to state and local government officials [9], and more likely to attribute the rise in confirmed cases to rising infections rather than increased testing [3]. The data also shows that geographic differences in COVID-19 impact do not overshadow these partisan divides, with Democrats consistently attributing higher increases in cases to rising infections [3]. \n\n![image1](image1) illustrates these partisan differences, showing that only 22% of Republicans believe the U.S. response has been more effective than other wealthy nations, compared to 87% of Democrats. \n\n![image2](image2) further emphasizes the partisan divide in trust in institutions, with Democrats having higher approval ratings for hospitals, public health officials, local, and state officials, while Republicans have significantly lower approval ratings for Trump and public health officials. \n\n![image3](image3) highlights that Democrats are more likely to believe confirmed cases are due to rising infections, while Republicans are more likely to attribute increases to testing, with geographic differences playing a minor role in these perceptions. \n\n![image5](image5) shows a decline in trust in public health officials and local elected officials over time, with Democrats maintaining higher trust levels than Republicans. \n\nOverall, partisan divides are a dominant factor in perceptions of COVID-19 response effectiveness and trust in institutions, overshadowing geographic differences in health impacts.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nPartisan divides significantly shape perceptions of COVID-19 response effectiveness and trust in institutions, with Democrats generally viewing the U.S. response more critically and trusting public health officials more than Republicans."}

According to the data, Democrats are more likely to hold the federal government accountable, with 82% viewing an inadequate response as a major reason for the outbreak's continuation, compared to only 21% of Republicans [5]. In contrast, Republicans are more inclined to believe that state and local governments should be primarily responsible, with 68% of Republicans and leaners holding this view [9].\n\nThe major reasons cited for the continuation of the COVID-19 outbreak are largely consistent across political affiliations, with insufficient adherence to social distancing and mask-wearing guidelines being the most commonly cited reason by both Democrats and Republicans [7]. However, there are notable differences in the perception of other factors. For instance, a larger proportion of Democrats believe that lifting restrictions too quickly is a major reason (82%) compared to Republicans (31%) [5]. Conversely, Republicans are more likely to blame the Chinese government's initial handling of the outbreak for the global spread (73% vs. 38% of Democrats) [8].\n\nThe data also highlights a partisan divide in opinions about testing.

White adults are less supportive of requiring photo identification compared to Black, Hispanic, and Asian adults. For instance, only 54% of White Democrats favor requiring voters to show government-issued photo identification, while 65% of Black Democrats, 72% of Hispanic Democrats, and 71% of Asian Democrats support this policy [6]. This trend is consistent across both parties, with Republicans being more likely to strongly favor photo identification requirements (81% strongly favor compared to 30% of Democrats) [9].\n\nIn terms of voting accessibility policies, there are notable differences as well. For example, a sizable majority of adults, regardless of race, strongly or somewhat favor requiring electronic voting machines to print a paper backup of the ballot (82%), making early, in-person voting available for at least two weeks prior to Election Day (78%), and requiring all voters to show government-issued photo identification to vote (76%) [10]. However, Black adults are more supportive of policies like allowing people convicted of felonies to vote after serving their sentences (85% in favor) compared to White, Hispanic, and Asian Americans [7]. \n\nThe data from the images further illustrate these trends. Image1 shows that Black and Hispanic adults have higher approval rates for requiring photo identification compared to White and Asian adults.

This trend has been relatively stable over the past few years, with a slight increase in Democratic identification from 2019 to 2022, as depicted in image2. The Democratic Party's support among Latino registered voters has remained strong, with 63% identifying as Democrats or leaning Democratic in 2022, compared to 64% in 2019. In contrast, Republican identification has decreased slightly from 34% in 2019 to 33% in 2022.\n\nThe importance of various issues has also evolved. In 2022, abortion has become a more critical issue for Latino voters, with 57% considering it very important, up from 42% in March 2022, as shown in image3. This shift is linked to the Supreme Court's decision to end the federal guarantee of a right to legal abortion in the United States. The economy remains the top issue, with 80% of Latino voters considering it very important, unchanged since March, while health care, violent crime, and education are also significant concerns, each with 70% or more importance.\n\nDemographic factors play a role in these preferences. For instance, Latino voters who strongly identify as Hispanic are more likely to support Democratic candidates, with 60% saying being Hispanic is extremely or very important to their identity, and 53% leaning toward the Democratic candidate, as noted in [7] and image4. In contrast, those with no religious affiliation or those who are Catholic show a closer split, with 60% and 59%, respectively, leaning toward the Democratic candidate, but with a smaller margin.\n\nThe data also indicate that Latino voters' party affiliation is not entirely fixed, with 18% unsure or leaning toward another candidate, reflecting the uncertainty mentioned in [3].

This is further illustrated in image5, which shows that 73% of Hispanic registered voters want Trump to not remain a national political figure, while 35% of Hispanic Republicans and 41% of GOP leaners support him remaining a national figure or running for president.\n\n- **Perceptions of Racial Discrimination**: The views on racial discrimination differ significantly between Hispanic Democrats and Republicans. As noted in the text and image2, a majority of Hispanics (57%) believe abortion should be legal in at least some cases, with 69% of Democrats and Democratic leaners agreeing. In terms of racial discrimination, 62% of Republicans and Republican leaners think people not seeing racial discrimination where it exists is a bigger problem, while 73% of Latino Democrats and Democratic leaners believe people not seeing racial discrimination is a bigger problem. Image2 visually represents this with 62% of Republicans and 73% of Democrats perceiving the issue of people not seeing racial discrimination as more significant.\n\n### Conclusion:\nHispanic Democrats are more likely to oppose Trump's political role and perceive racial discrimination as a significant issue, whereas Hispanic Republicans are more supportive of Trump's political presence and are more likely to believe that people not seeing racial discrimination is a bigger problem.\n\n![Hispanic Democrats oppose Trump and see racial discrimination as a bigger issue](image5)  \n![Hispanic Republicans support Trump and perceive less racial discrimination](image2)"}

Hispanic Republicans and Republican leaners are more likely to perceive the Democratic Party as working hard to earn Latino votes, with 56% of them holding this view, compared to only 35% of Hispanic Democrats and Democratic leaners who see the Republican Party in the same light. This suggests a partisan divide in how Latino voters perceive the parties' efforts to engage with their community.\n\n![image4](image4) illustrates these perceptions, showing that a substantial minority of Hispanic partisans have at least a somewhat favorable view of the opposing party. For instance, 36% of Latino Republicans and GOP leaners believe the Democratic Party really cares about Latinos, while only 21% of Latino Democrats and Democratic leaners think the Republican Party does the same. This indicates a reciprocal perception where each party is seen as more attentive to the other's community by the opposing party's supporters.\n\nThe data also show that perceptions of the parties' efforts to engage with Latino voters are closely tied to party affiliation. For example, 81% of Hispanic Republicans and GOP leaners believe the Democratic Party works hard to earn Latino votes, while 72% of Hispanic Democrats and Democratic leaners believe the Republican Party does the same. This reciprocal perception is a key factor in shaping Latino voters' party affiliations.\n\n![image5](image5) further emphasizes this trend, with 78% of Hispanic Republicans and GOP leaners believing the Democratic Party really cares about Latinos, and 68% of Hispanic Democrats and Democratic leaners believing the Republican Party does the same.

According to text quote [7], there is rapid growth in these areas, which is expected to continue as more people move to these regions. This growth is driven by the trend of millennials, as noted in text quote [10], who prefer living in areas without a need for a car, thus increasing the demand for public transportation. The text quote [1] highlights the need to accommodate significant job growth in a limited area, which likely contributes to the high ridership in these regions.\n\nText quote [4] emphasizes the need to double the daily ridership on Cal Train to 120,000 trips by the next decade, indicating that the current capacity is insufficient to meet future demands. Image1 visually supports this by showing a crowded train, which is a direct result of the high ridership. The rapid growth in ridership, as shown in image3, further exacerbates the capacity issues, as the trains are already crowded, as seen in image1.\n\n### Quote Citation:\n- **Text:**\n  - [7] Rapid growth in Mountain View, Palo Alto\n  - [4] We need to double Cal train rider ship from 60,0"}

According to the text quotes, Europe is producing higher exit multiples, with a median multiple of cash invested of 7.2 compared to 4.5 in the USA [2][3][7]. This indicates that European venture capital firms are achieving better returns on their investments relative to the amount of capital invested. Additionally, the percentage of exits with a multiple of cash invested of at least 5 is higher in Europe (57.26%) compared to the USA (47.27%) [2][7].\n\nThe image quotes further illustrate these points. Image 1 shows the IPO index values over time, where Europe's IPO performance has matched or exceeded that of the USA, both pre- and post-IPO [6]. Image 2 provides a visual comparison of median multiples of cash invested, clearly showing that Europe has a higher median multiple [2]. Image 3 highlights the proportion of successful exits, with Europe having a higher percentage of exits exceeding certain thresholds [7]. Image 4 shows the total capital invested and exits, indicating that Europe's venture capital market is more efficient in terms of capital utilization [4].\n\nDespite lower average exit values, the higher exit multiples and capital efficiency in Europe compensate for this disadvantage [1]. The scarcity of VC money in Europe has driven up capital efficiency by about 70% compared to the USA, allowing investors to be more selective [10]. This selective approach has led to better performance in exits, as evidenced by recent top-tier fund exits [7].\n\nIn summary, while average exit values in Europe are about 25% smaller, the higher exit multiples and capital efficiency make European venture capital performance superior to that in the USA.\n\n![Higher exit multiples and capital efficiency in Europe](image1)  \n![Median multiples of cash invested in Europe vs. USA](image2)  \n![Proportion of successful exits in Europe vs. USA](image3)  \n![Capital invested and exits in Europe vs. USA](image4)\n\n### Conclusion\n\nEuropean venture capital performance is superior to that in the USA in terms of investment multiples and exit values, driven by higher exit multiples and capital efficiency, despite lower average exit values."}

All sources of supervision appear to be useful, with crowdsourced examples making the biggest impact. Head word supervision is particularly helpful for predicting ultra-fine labels, while entity linking improves fine label prediction.

When knowledge is absent from the knowledge graph, the precision and recall metrics exhibit distinct trends. Precision, represented by the yellow line in [image3], shows a clear upward trend, indicating that the model becomes better at filtering out incorrect knowledge as more knowledge is absent. This suggests that the model has the ability to identify and exclude irrelevant information, maintaining a higher level of correctness in its outputs. In contrast, recall, shown by the green line, remains stable at about 15, indicating that the model struggles to locate absent knowledge. This stability in recall implies that the model has limited ability to identify missing information, highlighting a significant challenge in handling gaps in the knowledge graph.\n\nThe F1-Score, depicted by the blue line, also shows an upward trend, reflecting the model's improved ability to locate absent knowledge more accurately as the coverage problem worsens. This upward trend in F1-Score underscores the increasing importance of the 'Conscious Incompetence' setting, where the model is prompted to recognize the knowledge required but not present in the knowledge graph. The increasing effectiveness of this setting is crucial when the coverage of the knowledge graph is poor, as it enables the model to better manage the absence of knowledge and improve the quality of its outputs.\n\nThese changes imply that while the model can filter out incorrect information to some extent, it faces significant challenges in identifying missing knowledge. The upward trend in precision and F1-Score suggests that the model's ability to handle absent knowledge improves with the 'Conscious Incompetence' setting, but recall remains a critical area for improvement. The results in [image3] demonstrate that as retrieval accuracy decreases, the model's ability to correctly cite absent knowledge becomes more pronounced, reinforcing the need for better mechanisms to handle knowledge gaps.\n\n![Conscious Incompetence](image3)\n\nThe removal of knowledge elements affects precision, recall, and F1-Score in the context of 'Conscious Incompetence' and retrieval analysis, as shown in [image3].

This indicates that it is important to tell LLMs both \"What\" (demonstrations) and \"How\" (logical constraints).\n  - [3] What Is The Relation Between Logical Consistency And Model Performance?  From Figure 2, we find that: 1) The model directly receives significant improvements on both MAVEN-ERE and Proof Writer when adding relevant logic; 2) When adding some irrelevant logic, the results show some fluctuations (exaltation in MAVEN-ERE and degeneration in Proof Writer). That means directly adding logic without any constraints will bring some uncertainty; 3) Typically, a higher logical inconsistency corresponds to a poorer micro-F1, however, rectifying logical inconsistency does not necessarily lead to the same degree of increase in micro-F1.\n  - [4] one-shot setting is remarkable, but there is still a gap with the fully-finetuned baseline. 2) Directly using CoT to infer logic does not help much for ERE tasks, a possible reason is that the inherent issues may lead to the failure of LLM in the precise rationale generation (i.e., a high ratio of logical inconsistency). We give a case study for this in Appendix E. 3) When using generative-based approaches to encourage LLMs to produce logical constraints in the reasoning process, LLMs can significantly improve their performance on both two tasks.

It shows that models with logical constraints generally outperform those with post-processing alone.\n- **Image 5**: The left graph in this image shows the impact of the number of demonstration samples on Micro-F1 and logical inconsistency (LI) for MAVEN-ERE and Causal-TimeBank datasets. The right graph shows the effect of iterative retrieval on logical inconsistency, indicating that logical constraints are more effective in reducing inconsistency compared to post-processing.\n\n### Analysis:\n- **Logical Constraints**: According to the text and Image 1, incorporating logical constraints into LLM instructions significantly reduces logical inconsistency. For instance, models like Llama-2-13B-PT and Vicuna-13B show substantial improvements in Micro-F1 when logical constraints are used, as seen in Image 1. This indicates that logical constraints are more effective in guiding the model to produce logically consistent answers.\n- **Post-Processing**: While post-processing can eliminate logical conflicts (as shown in Image 1 with 0% LI), it often leads to a decrease in overall performance and quality of the generated answers. This is because post-processing may not fully capture the context or semantics of the generated text, as noted in Quote 8.\n\n### Conclusion:\nLogical constraints are more effective than post-processing in reducing logical inconsistency in LLM models across the MAVEN"}

According to the text quote [9], the Chameleon-7B model had only 0.39% unsafe responses and the Chameleon-30B model had 0.095% unsafe responses when crowdsourced prompts were used to evaluate potential unsafe content. This demonstrates that Chameleon maintains a strong safety record, with overwhelming majority responses considered safe. The dataset used for these evaluations, as mentioned in the text, includes both crowdsourced prompts and those from the Red Team, which further validates the safety assessments.\n\nThe level of agreement among annotators in model comparisons involving Chameleon is detailed in image1. The table shows that for Chameleon vs. Gemini+, 31.5% of cases had all three annotators agreeing, 58.1% had two out of three agreeing, and 10.3% had no agreement. For Chameleon vs. GPT-4V+, the numbers are 35.4% all agreeing, 55.2% two agreeing, and 9.3% no agreement. This indicates a relatively high level of agreement, with over 50% of cases having at least two out of three annotators agreeing, suggesting that the evaluations are consistent and reliable. However, there is still a notable percentage of cases (around 10%) where there is no agreement, which may reflect the complexity of evaluating models like Chameleon in comparison to other advanced models.\n\n![{Chameleon safety and annotator agreement}](image1)\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe safety evaluations show that Chameleon models have a very low rate of unsafe responses, with 99.2% to 99.7% of responses considered safe. The level of agreement among annotators in model comparisons involving Chameleon is generally high, with over 50% of cases having at least two out of three annotators agreeing, though there is still a small percentage (around 10%) where no agreement is reached. This suggests that while Chameleon is highly safe, the relative evaluation of its performance against other models can be challenging due to the complexity of the tasks and the diversity of annotators' judgments."}

In object detection datasets, our methodology for extracting image embeddings \\(e_{\\mathrm{img}}\\) is slightly different from the approach discussed previously. As presented in Fig. 3, we apply two additional pre-processing steps: cropping and blurring. Some previous works have proposed similar methods in CLIP like [33, 53]. In the object detection dataset, an image typically contains multiple objects of varying sizes. Some objects may dominate a large portion of the image, whereas others occupy minimal space. Accordingly, our object detection procedure begins with cropping the image regions based on proposal bounding box coordinates, subsequently resizing the cropped region to a fixed proportion. Moreover, unlike image classification tasks the objects of interest generally appear large and centrally positioned, the objects within object detection datasets are smaller and their positions more varied. To help the MLLMs understand the objects to be detected, we employ a blurring technique on the non-target areas surrounding the objects of interest. The blurring strategy is designed to direct the MLLMs’ focus toward the relevant objects, thereby facilitating their identification in object detection tasks.\n  - [4] class b, class c, class d, class e], which is dynamically generated to include the top-k class names retrieved from our multimodal retriever. Our method uses the MLLM’s ability to rank these retrieved class names. Unlike traditional approaches that might rely solely on the initial retrieval order, our MLLM employs advanced linguistic and semantic analysis to assess the contextual appropriateness of each class name with the input image.\n  - [5] Following the retrieval phase, the retrieved category labels alongside image embedding \\(e\\) are integrated and sent to the MLLMs through our ranking prompt. The MLLMs, combining the internal knowledge and the retrieved information, make the final prediction of the image category.\n  - [6] Since these cropped sub-images are usually small, CLIP’s ability to extract features from these low-resolution images is limited. Therefore, in the object detection task, we do not perform image-to-image retrieval but use CLIP’s inherent image-text interaction capabilities to conduct image-to-text retrieval. Finally, we also obtain the top-k category information with the highest similarity.\n\n- **Image Quotes:**\n  - **image4"}

According to [5], the SnapNTell model surpasses existing baseline models across all metrics, highlighting the effectiveness of its retrieval-augmented multimodal architecture. This performance is further validated by the pairwise comparison results shown in Figure 4, where SnapNTell outperforms baselines by displaying a smaller difference against manually annotated ground-truth samples [7]. Additionally, the model's ability to handle long-tail entities is significantly enhanced through retrieval augmentation, as shown in Table 6, where performance improvement for torso-to-tail entities far exceeds that of head entities [6].\n\nThe key components contributing to SnapNTell's performance include the retrieval-augmented multimodal architecture, as illustrated in Figure 3 [2]. This architecture begins with retrieval augmentation to source relevant information about the entity in the image, which is then processed through word embeddings and integrated with image-projected embeddings before entering the large language model (LLM). The inclusion of entity detection (ED), as shown in Table 5 and Table 7, is crucial, as it markedly improves performance metrics such as ROUGE, BLEU, METEOR, and BLEURT [10].

According to the text quotes, SPECTER achieves an average performance of 80.0 across all metrics, which is a 3.1 point absolute improvement over the next-best baseline [1]. This is further highlighted in Table 1, where SPECTER outperforms other models on tasks such as classification, user activity prediction, citation prediction, and recommendations. For instance, on the MeSH dataset, SPECTER obtains an F1 score of 86.4, which is a 2.3 point increase over the best baseline [6]. On the co-view task, SPECTER achieves a MAP score of 83.8, improving by 2.7 points over the best baseline, and on the co-citation task, it achieves an nDCG of 94.8, outperforming SGC by 2.3 points [6].\n\nThe inclusion of additional metadata such as venue and author has mixed effects on SPECTER's performance. Adding venues slightly decreases performance, except on document classification, where venues are expected to have high correlation with paper topics [3]. However, adding authors as an input, along with the title and abstract, surprisingly hurts performance. This could be due to the sparsity of author names in the corpus, making it difficult for the model to infer document-level relatedness, or suboptimal tokenization using Wordpieces, which may split author names into subwords and create noisy correlations [3]. In contrast, the model does not require inputs like authors or venues, making it applicable in situations where this metadata is not available, such as matching reviewers with anonymized submissions or performing recommendations on anonymized preprints [4].\n\nThe visualizations in image1 and image2 provide further insight into how SPECTER's embeddings compare to SciBERT. The DBScan clustering algorithm shows that SPECTER's embeddings are better at encoding topical information, with higher homogeneity and completeness values (0.41 and 0.72 for SPECTER vs. 0.19 and 0.63 for SciBERT) [8].

The augmentation techniques involve using either positive or negative training examples as templates, resulting in training sets with different class distributions. For instance, using positive examples as templates leads to a balanced dataset with 21% positive and 79% negative examples, while using negative examples as templates creates a more imbalanced dataset. The performance of these augmented models is then evaluated on the original QQP test set.\n\nThe results are shown in Table 8, where the performance of BERT models with different augmentation techniques is compared. The table indicates that using positive examples as templates (+positive) improves performance over the original dataset, while using negative examples as templates (+negative) underperforms the original dataset. This is because +positive creates a balanced dataset, which helps the model learn more effectively, whereas +negative creates a more imbalanced dataset, leading to inferior performance due to a decrease in the number of training examples.\n\nIn sentiment analysis tasks, the effect of data augmentation is also observed. For example, in the SST-2 and SST-5 datasets, the use of dice loss (DSC) and dynamic weight adjusting strategy (DSC) slightly underperforms cross-entropy (CE) for balanced datasets but significantly outperforms it for imbalanced datasets. This is because DSC is designed to handle imbalanced data better by dynamically adjusting weights, making the model more attentive to hard-negative examples.\n\nIn named entity recognition tasks, the Tversky index (TI) with adjustable hyperparameters α and β is explored. The results, shown in Table 10, demonstrate that the performance varies significantly with different α values, indicating that TI is sensitive to these hyperparameters and can be tuned to optimize performance on imbalanced datasets.\n\n![Effect of data augmentation on QQP dataset performance](image5) shows the performance of BERT models with different augmentation techniques on the QQP dataset, confirming that +positive augmentation leads to better performance compared to +negative augmentation.\n\n![Tversky index performance on Chinese OntoNotes4.0 and English QuoRef](image2) illustrates how the Tversky index's α parameter affects performance on different datasets, highlighting the importance of tuning hyperparameters for optimal results.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nDifferent data augmentation techniques impact BERT model performance on the QQP dataset by altering the class distribution of the training set.

We included language pairs for which we could retrieve data for at least ten different MT systems (i.e. all but kk-en and gu-en). We contrast against the strong recently proposed B ERTSCORE and B LEURT, with B LEU as a baseline. Results are presented in Figure 3.\n  - [3] In this paper we present C OMET, a novel neural framework for training MT evaluation models that can serve as automatic metrics and easily be adapted and optimized to different types of human judgements of MT quality.\n  - [4] All three of our C OMET models were trained on data involving English (either as a source or as a target). Nevertheless, to demonstrate that our metrics generalize well we test them on the three WMT 2019 language pairs that do not include English in either source or target. As can be seen in Table 3, our results are consistent with observations in Tables 1 and 2.\n  - [9] Table 2 shows results for the seven to-English language pairs. Again, we contrast our three C OMET models against baseline metrics such as B LEU and CHR F, the 2019 task winning metric Y I S I -1, as well as the recently published metrics B ERTSCORE and B LEURT. As in Table 1 the DA RR model shows strong correlations with human judgements outperforming the recently proposed English-specific B LEURT metric in five out of seven language pairs.\n  - [10] Table 1 shows results for all eight language pairs with English as source. We contrast our three C OMET models against baseline metrics such as B LEU and CHR F, the 2019 task winning metric Y I S I -1, as well as the more recent B ERTSCORE. We observe that across the board our three models trained with the C OMET framework outperform, often by significant margins, all other metrics.

According to the results presented in Table 2a, the SciIE model achieves the highest F1 scores in entity recognition (68.1) and relation extraction (39.5), outperforming other models like LSTM+CRF, LSTM+CRF+ELMo, and E2E Rel+ELMo. In coreference resolution, SciIE also shows competitive results with an F1 score of 58.0, as depicted in Table 2b. This performance is attributed to the model's ability to share span representations and leverage cross-sentence information, as highlighted in text [4].\n\nThe multitask learning approach of SciIE is crucial for its performance gains. As shown in Table 3, the SciIE model outperforms single-task models in all three tasks: entity recognition, relation extraction, and coreference resolution. The ablation study in Table 3 indicates that multitask learning significantly improves performance across all tasks, confirming the benefits of cross-task information propagation via span representations, as discussed in text [3]. This approach is distinct from other models that use word-level representations or high-order cross-task factors, as noted in text [3].\n\nAdditionally, the SciIE model's performance on the SemEval 17 dataset, as shown in Table 4, is competitive with state-of-the-art models, especially in span identification, where it achieves a high F1 score of 58.6. The model's effectiveness in enumerating spans, rather than using BIO tagging, is a key advantage, as mentioned in text [7].

According to the text quotes, GEM outperforms both naive fine-tuning and EWC in overcoming catastrophic forgetting when fine-tuning on new domains. For instance, when fine-tuning on the **attraction** domain, GEM achieves a joint accuracy of 34.73%, whereas naive fine-tuning only reaches 29.39% [1]. This indicates that GEM maintains better performance on the original domains after adapting to a new domain, as seen in the hotel domain where GEM's performance drops only 5.44% from 58.98% to 53.54%, compared to a 22.9% drop with naive fine-tuning [5].\n\nThe text also highlights that fine-tuning from the base model (pre-trained on four domains) generally outperforms training from scratch on the new domain [6]. This is supported by the results in Table 3, where GEM fine-tuning on the base model achieves higher joint and slot accuracy on the new domain compared to training from scratch [9].\n\nSlot similarities play a crucial role in the model's performance. As shown in image2, knowledge about slots like **people**, **area**, **price range**, and **day** is successfully transferred from the pre-trained domains to the **hotel** and **restaurant** domains. However, unseen slots like **parking**, **stars**, and **internet** in the hotel domain, and **food** in the restaurant domain, are harder to track correctly [7]. This suggests that the model leverages transferred knowledge effectively for common slots but struggles with unique slots in new domains.\n\nThe slot error rates in image4 further illustrate this, where common slots like **name** and **type** have lower error rates compared to unique slots like **internet** and **arriveby**. This indicates that slot similarities significantly impact the model's ability to adapt and perform well in new domains.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nGEM outperforms EWC and naive fine-tuning by maintaining higher performance on original domains when adapting to new data, while slot similarities affect the model's ability to transfer knowledge, with common slots benefiting more from transfer learning than unique slots. \n\n![GEM outperforms EWC and naive fine-tuning in overcoming catastrophic forgetting]"}

The table in **image2** indicates that the accuracy improved from 53.1% to 63.5% in Spanish, from 37.7% to 48.9% in Russian, and from 38.4% to 42.9% in Ukrainian when stereotypical adjectives were added.\n\n**image4** further supports this by showing that in French and German, the Δ_S (difference in performance between pro-stereotypical and anti-stereotypical assignments) is reduced, indicating a decrease in bias. For example, in French, the Δ_S decreased from 16.1 to 8.4, and in German, it decreased from 8.4 to 0.0, suggesting that the adjustments effectively reduced gender bias.\n\n### Quote Citation:\n- **Text Quote [8]**: \"Finally, we tested whether we can affect the translations by automatically creating a version of WinoMT with the adjectives “handsome” and “pretty” prepended to male and"}

For example, we found 35% of bridge questions are currently single-hop but may become multi-hop when combined with stronger distractors (Section 4.1). However, as we demonstrate in Section 5, selecting strong distractors for RC questions is non-trivial. We suspect this is also due to the insufficiencies of standard TF-IDF retrieval for multi-hop questions. In particular, Table 5 shows that single-paragraph BERT achieves 53.12 F1 even when using 500 distractors (rather than eight), indicating that 500 distractors are still insufficient.\"\n   - [5] \"Open-domain Questions Our single-hop model struggles in the open-domain setting. We largely attribute this to the insufficiencies of standard TF-IDF retrieval for multi-hop questions. For example, we fail to retrieve the paragraph about “Bonobo apes” in Figure 1, because the question does not contain terms about “Bonobo apes.” Table 5 shows that the model achieves 39.12 F1 given 500 retrieved paragraphs, but achieves 53.12 F1 when additional two gold paragraphs are given, demonstrating the significant effect of failure to retrieve gold paragraphs.\"\n   - [6] \"Type Distractors We also experiment with filtering the initial list of 50 paragraph to ones whose entity type (e.g., person) matches that of the gold paragraphs. This can help to eliminate the entity type bias described in Section 4.1. As shown in Table 4, the original model’s accuracy degrades significantly (drops to 40.73 F1).

According to the text quotes, the original ARCT dataset contains statistical cues that can be exploited by models, leading to misleadingly high performance. By negating claims and inverting labels, the adversarial dataset mirrors the distribution of cues around both labels, effectively removing these cues. This setup forces models to rely on genuine understanding rather than superficial patterns.\n\n**Evidence from Text:**\n- **Quote 3** states that the adversarial dataset eliminates the problem of exploiting statistical cues, resulting in all models performing randomly, with BERT achieving a maximum test set accuracy of 53%.\n- **Quote 6** confirms that training and validating on the original data leads to overfitting, while training from scratch on the adversarial data results in BERT's peak performance reducing to 53%, with mean and median at 50%.\n- **Quote 7** highlights that BERT's performance on the adversarial test set is just three points below the average untrained human baseline, indicating it has learned nothing about argument comprehension.\n\n**Evidence from Images:**\n- **Image 1** shows the performance metrics for BERT on the adversarial test set, with a mean accuracy of 50.4% and a maximum of 53.3%, indicating random performance.\n- **Image 4** provides a detailed breakdown of BERT's performance on the adversarial test set, showing mean, median, and maximum accuracies, all around 50%, reinforcing the conclusion of random performance.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe adversarial dataset successfully eliminates spurious statistical cues, forcing models to demonstrate true argument comprehension. BERT's performance on this dataset, reduced to 53% maximum accuracy, suggests it has not learned meaningful argument comprehension but rather exploited cues. This result underscores the necessity of using the adversarial dataset for future evaluations to ensure models genuinely understand arguments.\n\n![Adversarial dataset performance](image1) ![BERT performance on adversarial test set](image4)\n\n### Answer\nThe adversarial data setup significantly reduces BERT's performance on the ARCT dataset to random levels, indicating it has not learned meaningful argument comprehension but rather exploited spurious statistical cues.

This indicates that greedy decoding is highly effective, with a performance gap of only 10% compared to human evaluation. In contrast, other methods like top-5 and top-10 random sampling and beam search with varying beam sizes show lower scores, with the lowest being 53.27 for top-5 random sampling. This suggests that while greedy decoding is optimal, other methods may introduce variability that affects performance.\n\nRegarding training data percentages, **image3** illustrates that as the percentage of training data increases, the model's perplexity (PPL) decreases, indicating improved model confidence. For instance, with 10% training data, the PPL is 13.74, and with 50% training data, it drops to 11.82. BLEU-2 scores also increase, with 50% training data achieving 13.97, compared to 12.72 with 10% data. Novelty metrics (N/T) and other scores also improve with more training data, showing that larger datasets enhance the model's ability to generate high-quality and novel commonsense inferences.\n\n### Evidence\n- **image1** shows that greedy decoding outperforms other methods, with an average score of 77.53, nearly matching human validation.\n- **image3** demonstrates that increasing training data from 1% to 50% significantly improves PPL and BLEU-2 scores, indicating better model performance and quality.\n\n### Conclusion\nGreedy decoding is the most effective method for generating commonsense inferences, closely aligning with human validation.

According to the text [3], COMET is designed to generate rich and diverse commonsense descriptions, and empirical results show that it produces novel knowledge that humans rate as high quality. The text [7] further supports this by stating that COMET achieves 91.7% precision at top 1 for ConceptNet relations, which is close to human performance. \n\nIn `image1`, the table compares the performance of different models on the ConceptNet dataset. The COMET model, with a perplexity (PPL) of 4.32 and a human evaluation score of 91.69, outperforms the LSTM and CKBG models. The N/T o metric, which measures novelty, is also higher for COMET (3.75) compared to the other models, indicating that it generates more novel tuples. The human evaluation score of 91.69 for COMET is notably high, suggesting that the generated tuples are highly plausible and accurate.\n\nThe text [10] also highlights the quality of the knowledge generated by COMET, noting that the low perplexity scores and high classifier scores indicate the model's confidence in its predictions. The human evaluation results in Table 7 (not shown here) further validate the model's ability to produce correct and novel tuples.\n\nThe effectiveness of the COMET model is implied by its ability to generate high-quality, novel, and accurate tuples, as shown in `image1` and supported by the text quotes.

Additionally, there was a slight increase in the gross carrying amount from $471 million in 2019 to $491 million in 2020, but the net carrying amount was affected by the higher amortization expense.\n\n![{Net carrying amounts decreased by $165 million due to higher amortization}](image5)\n\nThe amortization expense increased, which directly reduced the net carrying amount of the intangible assets. The table in image5 shows the gross carrying amount, accumulated amortization, and net carrying amount for both years, highlighting the impact of amortization on the net carrying value.\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Amortization Expense**: The increase in amortization from $113 million in 2019 to $162 million in 2020 is the primary factor in the decrease of the net carrying amount. Amortization is the process of allocating the cost of an intangible asset over its useful life, and higher amortization reduces the net carrying value.\n- **Gross Carrying Amount**: The gross carrying amount increased slightly from $471 million in 2019 to $491 million in 2020, indicating some addition or revaluation of intangible assets, but this was offset by the higher amortization expense.\n\nThis change reflects the ongoing use and consumption of the intangible assets over time, as well as any adjustments in their valuation."}

The Total Comprehensive Income for the Year saw a significant increase in 2020 due to higher other comprehensive income, primarily from fair value changes on financial assets and currency translation differences, despite a decrease in net income.\n\n![Retained Earnings and Total Comprehensive Income Changes](image1)\n\n**Evidence Selection:**\n\n- **Text Quote [1]:** The decrease in Retained Earnings is noted in the financial statements, showing a reduction from RMB3,982 million in 2019 to RMB3,924 million in 2020.\n- **Text Quote [5]:** The decrease in Total Comprehensive Income for the Year is explained by the changes in other comprehensive income and currency translation differences.\n- **Image Quote [1]:** The financial statement for 2020 shows the Retained Earnings and Total Comprehensive Income for the Year, highlighting the changes.\n\n**Answer Construction:**\n\nThe financial statements indicate that Retained Earnings decreased from RMB3,982 million in 2019 to RMB3,924 million in 2020, a reduction of RMB58 million. This decrease is primarily due to the company's profit for the year and other comprehensive income losses, which were partially offset by currency translation differences. In contrast, the Total Comprehensive Income for the Year increased from RMB5,268 million in 2019 to RMB8,100 million in 2020, a significant rise of RMB2,832 million. This increase is attributed to higher other comprehensive income, particularly from fair value changes on financial assets and currency translation differences, which more than offset the decrease in net income.\n\n**Quote Citation:**\n\n- **Text"}

This trend is primarily driven by the growth in the current provision, which includes federal, state and local, and foreign taxes. The current provision increased from $3,520 million in 2018 to $4,981 million in 2020, reflecting higher taxable income and possibly changes in tax rates or regulations. The deferred (benefit) provision, however, decreased from $42 million in 2018 to $(8) million in 2020, indicating a reduction in deferred tax liabilities or an increase in deferred tax assets.\n\nThe deferred income tax assets and liabilities play a crucial role in these trends. Deferred income tax assets, which include items like accrued expenses, net operating loss carryforwards, and share-based compensation, increased from $2,868 million in 2019 to $3,391 million in 2020. This growth in assets suggests that the company is recognizing more tax benefits that can be realized in the future, which reduces the deferred tax liabilities. Conversely, deferred income tax liabilities, such as U.S. federal and state intangible assets and non-U.S. goodwill and intangible assets, decreased from $5,861 million in 2019 to $3,367 million in 2020. This reduction in liabilities indicates that the company is recognizing more taxable differences that increase the deferred tax assets, thereby reducing the deferred tax liabilities.\n\nThe reconciliation of the tax provision at the U.S. federal statutory rate to the provision for income taxes and the effective tax rate for the years ended December 31 is shown in image1. This reconciliation highlights the components contributing to the effective tax rate, including state income taxes, share-based awards, non-deductible compensation, health insurance tax, foreign rate differential, and other, net. The effective tax rate increased from 22.3% in 2018 to 24.0% in 2020, reflecting the impact of these components on the overall tax provision.\n\nThe components of deferred income tax assets and liabilities as of December 31 are detailed in image3."}

The key changes are as follows:\n\n1. **Card Member Loans and Receivables:**\n   - **Card Member Loans:** There was a 21% increase in card member loans, which was lower than the growth in billed business due to higher paydown rates. This increase was driven by the continued liquidity and financial strength of the customer base. Provisions for credit losses decreased, resulting in a net benefit, primarily due to a $2.5 billion reserve release in the current year versus a reserve build in the prior year and lower net write-offs in the current year. The reserve release was driven by improved portfolio quality and macroeconomic outlook, partially offset by an increase in outstanding loan balances.

The company's commitment to sustainable growth is evident in its strategic approach to shareholder returns and its proactive measures in electrification, as illustrated by the following evidence:\n\n1. **Shareholder Returns and Financial Stability**:\n   - Toyota evaluates its consolidated operating income and the volatility of its share price to ensure financial stability. The evaluation weight for consolidated operating income is 50%, with a reference value of 1 trillion yen, and the volatility of Toyota's share price is also 50%, using a reference value of 150% (image1). This dual focus on income and share price volatility ensures that shareholder returns are stable and aligned with market expectations.\n   - The company's financial strategy aims to maintain adequate stability while pursuing growth and efficiency, as stated in text [7]. This is reflected in the table showing Toyota's consolidated remuneration for directors, where performance-linked remuneration is a significant component, indicating a direct link between executive performance and shareholder value (image2).\n\n2. **Electrification Measures and Climate Scenarios**:\n   - Toyota's response to climate scenarios, such as the 1.5°C scenario, involves significant electrification measures. The company's future image under the 1.5°C scenario includes a major increase in the percentage of electrified vehicles, advances in battery technology, and a shift towards CO2-free fuel use (image4). These measures are crucial for reducing emissions and aligning with stricter environmental regulations.\n   - The financial strategy supports these measures by investing in advanced technologies and securing funds through cost reduction and the Toyota Production System (TPS), as mentioned in text [6]. The company's focus on electrification is also reflected in the shareholder return data, where total shareholder return has been a key metric, with a total return ratio of 41.0% in 2021/3 (image5).\n\n3. **Risk Management and Shareholder Engagement**:\n   - Toyota engages in constructive dialogue with shareholders to improve corporate value and achieve sustainable growth, as stated in text [3]. This engagement is crucial for aligning shareholder expectations with the company's climate response strategies.\n   - The company's adherence to the TCFD recommendations ensures transparent disclosure of climate-related risks and opportunities, enhancing trust and shareholder confidence (text [9]).\n\n   ![Cons"}

This significant improvement is primarily due to a reduction in credit impairment charges, which decreased by $35 million, and a decrease in operating expenses by $273 million.\n  - **Profit Before Tax**: The profit before tax also saw a substantial increase, rising by $387 million, or 42%. This growth is attributed to a decrease in operating expenses and a reduction in credit impairment charges, alongside a share of profit in associates and joint ventures that decreased by $243 million.\n\n- **Global Banking and Markets**:\n  - **Net Operating Income**: The net operating income decreased by $262 million in 2020, a 60% drop.

The adjusted revenue increased by $0.4 billion, primarily due to the strong performance in Global Markets, which more than offset the impacts of lower global interest rates and adverse movements in credit and funding valuation adjustments. This performance was achieved with a decrease in risk-weighted assets (RWAs) and no increase in trading value at risk (VaR). The Global Banking segment saw a revenue decrease of $0.1 billion or 2%, mainly due to lower real estate and structured finance fee income and losses on legacy corporate restructuring positions, but it also experienced growth in capital markets revenue and an increase in net interest income from corporate lending. The adjusted profit before tax for GBM was $12.1 billion, down 45% compared to 2019, while the adjusted revenue increased by $0.4 billion. \n\nFor the Corporate Centre, the financial performance was marked by a net operating income of $15.3 billion, a 3% increase from 2019. However, there was a significant change in expected credit losses and other credit impairment charges, which decreased by $1.2 billion, and operating expenses increased by $280 million.

The text explains that these declines were attributed to lower income from these assets, which were affected by the prevailing low interest rates over the period. Additionally, the text mentions that the company continued to hold substantial balances of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term U.S. Treasury Bills, indicating a focus on maintaining liquidity over maximizing yield.\n\nThe asset allocations in image1 show a significant increase in cash, cash equivalents, and U.S. Treasury Bills from $67,082 million in 2020 to $90,688 million in 2021. This increase reflects the company's strategy to prioritize safety and liquidity, which aligns with the text's emphasis on maintaining ample liquidity despite the lower interest income. The allocation to equity securities and fixed maturity securities also decreased, from $269,498 million and $20,317 million in 2020 to $334,907 million and $16,386 million in 2021, respectively. This shift indicates a reduction in riskier investments, which is consistent with the company's decision to focus on stability over yield.\n\nThe decline in net investment income is further supported by the data in image5, which shows a decrease in interest and other investment income from $1,059 million in 2020 to $589 million in 2021. This decline is a direct result of the lower income from short-term investments and fixed maturity securities, as noted in the text and reflected in the asset allocations.\n\nIn summary, the decline in net investment income from 2020 to 2021 was due to lower income from short-term investments and fixed maturity securities, driven by low interest rates. The asset allocations, as shown in image1, reflect this strategy by increasing holdings in cash and U.S. Treasury Bills while reducing exposure to equity and fixed maturity securities.\n\n![{The decline in net investment income from 2020 to 2021 was due to lower income from short-term investments and fixed maturity securities, driven by low interest rates.

The company reported a net cash provided by operating activities of $10.613 billion in 2020, a 10% increase from $9.649 billion in 2019 [2]. This increase was primarily due to lower net cash tax payments and lower pre-tax pension and retiree medical plan contributions [2]. However, net cash used for investing activities was $11.619 billion, reflecting acquisitions and capital spending [3]. The free cash flow, a non-GAAP measure, increased by 15% from $5,587 million in 2019 to $6,428 million in 2020 [4].\n\nIn terms of contractual commitments, PepsiCo had non-cancelable commitments for commodities, outsourcing services, and sports marketing, primarily in the normal course of business [g, h]. These commitments did not include purchases based on plans but were not obligated to incur [g]. The transition tax liability, contingent consideration, and commitments to socioeconomic programs were also part of the financial commitments [d, e, i].

According to the text quotes, the net operating income decreased by $434 million, or 3%, from $15,303 million in 2019 to $14,869 million in 2020. The profit before tax also fell by $342 million, or 7%, from $5,172 million in 2019 to $4,830 million in 2020. These declines were attributed to higher expected credit losses and other credit impairment charges (ECL) and lower revenue, as noted in quotes [2] and [6]. Additionally, the text highlights that the adjusted profit before tax decreased by 45% to $12.1 billion, reflecting lower revenue and increased ECL directly linked to the pandemic [5].\n\nThe image quotes provide further context, with image3 showing the detailed financial performance, including the decline in profit before tax.

This growth was driven by strong performance in Foreign Exchange and Credit, with Foreign Exchange revenue increasing by $702 million or 26% and Credit revenue by $283 million or 20% [4].\n- **Global Banking**: In contrast, Global Banking revenue decreased by $1 billion or 2% due to lower real estate and structured finance fee income and losses on legacy corporate restructuring positions [2].\n\n#### Contributing Factors\n- **Covid-19 Impact**: The pandemic led to economic uncertainty, affecting client activity and market volatility, which benefited the FICC (Fixed Income, Currency, and Commodities) segment [6, 8].\n- **Strategic Reallocation**: The reallocation of revenue and expenses, including the impact of hyperinflation in Argentina and funding costs, improved the reflection of revenue and expenses related to global businesses [1].\n- **Risk Management**: HSBC adjusted its risk appetite to support customers and strategic goals, which may have influenced revenue and income adjustments [4].\n\n![Net Operating Income Change](image1) shows the net operating income figures, highlighting the slight increase in 2020 compared to 2019. ![Adjusted"}

This change was primarily due to several key factors as reflected in the financial statements:\n\n1. **Reduction for Distributions to Shareholders**: The reduction for distributions to ExxonMobil shareholders was $14.7 billion, all in the form of dividends. This significant outflow contributed to the decrease in equity.\n\n2. **Reduction for Losses**: The reduction for losses was $22.4 billion, which also impacted the equity negatively.\n\n3. **Foreign Exchange Translation Effects**: A positive effect of $1.4 billion due to the weaker U.S. dollar increased equity, but this was partially offset by a $1.4 billion change in the funded status of the postretirement benefits reserves, which reduced equity.\n\n4. **Earnings Reinvestment**: The addition to equity for earnings was $14.3 billion, which partially offset the reductions but was not enough to counterbalance the total reductions.\n\nThe financial statements, particularly the equity section and the cash flow statement, provide detailed insights into these changes.

The major changes are as follows:\n\n1. **Tax Expenses:**\n   - **Current Tax Expense:** The current tax expense decreased from $17,264,000 in 2019 to $8,775,000 in 2020, a reduction of $8,489,000. This decrease was primarily due to the recognition of deferred tax assets and the utilization of carried-forward tax losses.\n   - **Deferred Tax Expense:** The deferred tax expense was $393,000 in 2020, compared to a deferred tax benefit of $(1,792),000 in 2019, indicating a shift from a benefit to an expense.\n   - **Total Income Tax Expense:** The total income tax expense was $9,641,000 in 2020, a significant decrease from $15,575,000 in 2019.\n\n2. **Impairment Charges:**\n   - **Impairment Charges:** In 2020, Lovisa Holdings recorded impairment charges of $6,117,000, which included $3,360,000 related to exiting the Spanish market and $2,757,000 for other store impairment charges. In contrast, there were no impairment charges in 2019.\n\nThese changes reflect the company's strategic decisions, such as exiting the Spanish market and the impact of COVID-19 on its operations, leading to significant write-downs and adjustments in tax liabilities.\n\n![Deferred tax assets expected to be settled within 12 months](image1)  \n![Basic and Diluted EPS for Lovisa Holdings](image2)  \n![Impairment charges pertaining to exit from Spanish market](image4)\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe major changes in tax expenses and impairment charges for Lovisa Holdings between 2019 and 2020 were a significant reduction in current and total income tax expenses due to deferred tax asset recognition and tax loss utilization, along with substantial impairment charges related to strategic market exits and store closures."}

Additionally, fair values of interest rate sensitive instruments may be affected by the credit worthiness of the issuer, prepayment options, relative values of alternative investments, the liquidity of the instrument and other general market conditions.\n- [10] Derivative contract gains/losses include the changes in fair value of our equity index put option contract liabilities, which relate to contracts that were originated prior to March 2008. A vast majority of these contracts have since expired. Contracts comprising 63% of the remaining notional value as of December 31, 2021 will expire in the first quarter of 2022. The periodic changes in the fair values of these liabilities are recorded in earnings and, historically, were significant, primarily due to the volatility of underlying equity markets. As of December 31, 2021, the intrinsic value of our equity index put option contracts was near zero and our recorded liability at fair value was approximately $99 million. Our ultimate payment obligations, if any, under our contracts will be determined as of the contract expiration dates based on the intrinsic value as defined under the contracts. The pre-tax gains and losses in each of the past three years reflected changes in the equity index values and shorter remaining contract durations. Settlement payments to counterparties over the past three years were insignificant.\n- [8] The carrying values of Berkshire and BHFC non-U.S. Dollar denominated senior notes (€6.9 billion, £1.75 billion and $785.5 billion par) reflect the applicable exchange rates as of the balance sheet dates.

According to the text quote [2], forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, including supply chain disruptions. The report details that major events impacting raw material sourcing and/or internal or external manufacturing facilities can disrupt supply chains, leading to increased input prices and operational costs. This is particularly relevant given the global nature of Nestlé's operations, as illustrated by the distribution of its factories across various regions.\n\n**Potential Impacts:**\n- **Operational Disruption:** Major events can disrupt sourcing and manufacturing, affecting the reliability of supply chains.\n- **Increased Costs:** Disruptions can lead to higher input prices and operational costs.\n- **Customer Trust:** Loss of consumer trust due to supply chain failures.\n\n**Mitigations:**\n- **Business Continuity Plans:** Nestlé has developed business continuity and disaster recovery plans for key sites to ensure operational resilience.\n- **Price Risk Management:** Active management of price risks on key commodities to mitigate financial impacts.\n- **Diversification:** Broader exposures for the Group to manage risks associated with supply chain disruptions.\n\nThe report also emphasizes the importance of data capture and sharing across the value chain, as seen in quote [5], where Nestlé works with supply chain partners to pilot solutions for efficiency and resiliency. This includes the Transport Hub technologies and AI-powered network optimization tools, which enhance the ability to respond quickly to demand changes and optimize transport and production schedules.\n\n**Regional Distribution:**\n- **Americas (AMS):** As shown in image3, Nestlé has a significant presence in the Americas, with major operations in the United States, Mexico, and Brazil. The distribution of factories across these regions helps mitigate regional supply chain risks.\n- **Europe, Middle East and North Africa (EMENA):** Image5 shows a strong presence in countries like Germany, France, and the United Kingdom, which are critical for regional supply chain stability.\n- **Global Network:** The pie chart in image4 indicates the geographic distribution of Nestlé's operations, with significant contributions from Switzerland and the United States. This global footprint allows Nestlé to balance efficiency and resilience by leveraging regional strengths and mitigations.\n\nBy diversifying its supply chain and implementing robust mitigation strategies, Nestlé aims to reduce the impact of disruptions and maintain operational continuity across its global network.\n\n![Supply chain disruptions impacts and mitigations](image2)  \n![Nestlé's factory distribution across regions](image3)  \n![Global"}

According to the data in **image3**, the total shipment volume decreased by 11.6% in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to the deconsolidation of RBH and the shift to smoke-free alternatives. This decline in shipment volumes is reflected in the financial activities, as seen in **image5**, where net cash provided by operating activities decreased by $0.3 billion in 2020 compared to 2019. The decrease was partially offset by higher working capital requirements of $0.5 billion and higher cash payments for asset impairment and exit costs, as noted in text quote [7].\n\nThe financial summary in **image4** shows that net revenues decreased by 22.9% in 2020, with a significant portion of the variance attributed to currency fluctuations and volume/mix changes. Operating income, however, increased by 100%, indicating that despite the revenue decline, the company managed to improve its operational efficiency. The text quote [3] mentions that PMI continued to optimize its global manufacturing infrastructure, which may have contributed to this operational improvement.\n\nIn summary, the decline in shipment volumes and the associated financial adjustments led to a decrease in net cash provided by operating activities, but the company's operational efficiency improvements helped mitigate some of the financial impacts.\n\n![Net Cash Impact](image5)  \n![Shipment Volume Change](image3)\n\nThe overall financial performance in Latin America & Canada was negatively affected by the decrease in shipment volumes, but operational efficiencies helped to partially offset these effects."}

This increase was primarily due to lower cost of funds, partially offset by lower average revolving Card Member loan balances. [6]\n\n- **Average Card Member Loans:** The average Card Member loans increased from $52.8 billion in 2019 to $52.9 billion in 2021, showing a slight increase of 0.2%. [4]\n\n- **Provisions for Credit Losses:** Provisions for credit losses decreased, resulting in a net benefit, primarily due to reserve releases in the current year versus reserve builds in the prior year and lower net write-offs.

This expense reduces the equity attributable to shareholders by the amount of the compensation granted, as it is considered a form of compensation for employees rather than a cash outflow.\n- **Impact on Cash Position:** Share-based compensation does not directly affect cash flow from operating activities. It is a non-cash expense, meaning it does not involve an immediate cash transaction. However, it impacts the equity section of the balance sheet.\n\n**Cash Flow from Operating Activities:**\n- **Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities:** For the year 2020, Accenture plc reported a net cash provided by operating activities of $6,215,152. This includes adjustments to reconcile net income, such as depreciation, amortization, and share-based compensation expense, which are added back to net income to arrive at the cash provided by operating activities.\n- **Share-based Compensation in Cash Flows:** The share-based compensation expense of $1,197,806 is added back to net income in the cash flow statement to determine the cash provided by operating activities. This adjustment reflects the non-cash nature of the expense, ensuring that the cash flow statement accurately represents the cash generated from core business operations.\n\n**Combined Impact:**\n- **Shareholders' Equity:** The share-based compensation expense reduces the additional paid-in capital, thereby affecting the total shareholders' equity. However, it does not directly impact the cash position.\n- **Cash Position:** The cash flow from operating activities, adjusted for non-cash expenses like share-based compensation, provides insight into the company's ability to generate cash from its core operations, which is crucial for sustaining and growing the business.\n\n- **Conclusion:** Share-based compensation affects shareholders' equity through the reduction of additional paid-in capital, while cash flow from operating activities reflects the company's cash generation capabilities, adjusted for non-cash expenses like share-based compensation.\n\n![Share-based compensation and cash flow impact on equity and cash position](image1)\n\n![Cash flow from operating activities](image2)\n\n**Answer:**\nShare"}

The equity increased by €3,828 million to €16,339 million, primarily due to the issuance of new shares to finance the acquisition of Varian, as noted in text [10]. This issuance boosted both the issued capital and capital reserves. The equity ratio declined from 76% to 55%, mainly because of the substantial increase in loan liabilities, which was offset by the capital increase, as mentioned in text [3].\n\nLiabilities, particularly current liabilities, increased notably. The total current liabilities rose from €1,936 million in 2020 to €3,104 million in 2021, as shown in image3. This increase was driven by higher provisions, other current financial liabilities, and income tax liabilities. The deferred tax liabilities also increased from €470 million to €2,082 million, indicating a rise in deferred tax obligations, as seen in image4. The equity ratio's decline was partly offset by these liabilities, reflecting a more leveraged financial structure.\n\nThe key components driving these changes were the issuance of new shares, the acquisition of Varian, and the resulting increase in liabilities, which were necessary to support the company's growth and operational needs.\n\n![Equity increase due to share issuance](image1)  \n![Liabilities increase due to provisions and deferred tax](image3)  \n![Deferred tax liabilities increase](image4)\n\n### Conclusion:\nSiemens Healthineers' equity increased significantly due to share issuance, while liabilities rose due to higher provisions and deferred tax obligations, leading to a decrease in the equity ratio from 76% to 55%."}

Concurrently, cash flow from operating activities improved significantly, from $3,003 million in 2020 to $6,493 million in 2021, an increase of $3,490 million.

This increase was primarily due to gross increases in current year tax positions and prior year tax positions, which amounted to $416 million and $120 million, respectively, in 2020. However, there were also gross decreases of $130 million in prior year tax positions, settlements, and statute of limitations lapses, resulting in a net increase of $1,829 million in gross unrecognized tax benefits by the end of 2020. This reflects the company's ongoing tax position adjustments and the expiration of statutes of limitations, which reduced the liability for unrecognized tax benefits by $39 million in 2020 as a result of audit settlements and the expiration of statutes of limitations.\n\nRegarding common share repurchases, the company repurchased 14 million shares in 2020 at an average price of $300.58 per share, with an aggregate cost of $4,250 million. This reduced the Board-authorized shares remaining to 58 million by the end of 2020, from 72 million in 2019. The repurchase program aimed to optimize the company's capital structure and cost of capital, thereby improving returns to shareholders and offsetting the dilutive impact of share-based awards. The financial position was positively impacted by these repurchases, as they reduced the number of outstanding shares, potentially increasing earnings per share and enhancing shareholder value.\n\n![gross unrecognized tax benefits change](image4) ![common share repurchases](image1)\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe company's gross unrecognized tax benefits increased from $598 million in 2018 to $1,423 million in 2020, driven by tax position adjustments. Simultaneously, the company repurchased 14 million shares in 2020, reducing authorized shares and enhancing shareholder value."}

This drop is partly due to the recognition of deferred tax assets and the benefit from the FDII (Foreign-Derived Intangible Income) deduction.\n\n2. **Deferred Tax Assets:**\n   - In 2019, Qualcomm recognized a deferred tax asset of $2.472 billion related to the derecognition of a deferred tax asset on distributed intellectual property. This was a one-time event that significantly impacted the tax provision for that year.\n   - In 2020 and 2021, there were no similar large-scale derecognitions, but the company continued to benefit from other deferred tax assets, such as those related to research and development tax credits and share-based awards.\n\n3. **Tax Provisions:**\n   - The total tax provision increased from $3,095 million in 2019 to $1,231 million in 2021, reflecting changes in the company's taxable income and the application of tax credits.\n   - The increase in 2020 was primarily due to the derecognition of the deferred tax asset on distributed intellectual property, which was a significant one-time adjustment.\n\n4. **Unrecognized Tax Benefits:**\n   - Unrecognized tax benefits were $2.1 billion at the end of 2021, up from $1.9 billion in 2020, indicating ongoing tax audits and potential adjustments. The increase was mainly due to expected refunds of Korean withholding taxes, which had an insignificant impact on the income tax provision but required adjustments in deferred taxes.\n\n5. **Current and Deferred Provisions:**\n   - The current tax provision decreased from $1,563 million in 2019 to $942 million in 2021, while the deferred tax provision saw a reduction from $1,158 million in 2019 to $237 million in"}

According to the text and image quotes:\n\n- **Impact on Assets Under Management (AUM):** The sale of WFAM led to a substantial decrease in the company's AUM. Image 2 shows that the total AUM for Wells Fargo Advisors and The Private Bank decreased from $852.7 billion in 2020 to $663.3 billion in 2021, reflecting the divestiture of WFAM. This reduction is evident in the transition services agreement mentioned in text [4], which terminated in June 2022, indicating the end of WFAM's operations under Wells Fargo.\n\n- **Income Statement Effects:** The sale of WFAM contributed to the company's income statement. Text [2] and [10] mention net gains of $269 million from the sale, which is partially offset by lower asset-based fees due to the sale. Image 4 shows a net income increase in 2021 compared to 2020, partly due to these gains. The income statement also reflects a decrease in investment advisory and other asset-based fees, as seen in the decline in noninterest income from $10,225 million in 2020 to $10,036 million in 2021.\n\n- **Balance Sheet Effects:** Image 3 indicates a decrease in total assets from $728,667 million in 2020 to $721,335 million in 2021, which aligns with the divestiture of WFAM. The sale also affected equity securities and other assets, as shown in the balance sheet data, with a slight increase in equity securities and a decrease in total loans and deposits.\n\n- **Broader Effects:** The sale of WFAM led to lower gains on debt securities and asset-based fees, as noted in text [3] and [7]. However, the net gains from the sale provided a positive impact on the company's financial results, as highlighted in the income statement and balance sheet data.\n\nIn summary, the sale of WFAM reduced the company's AUM and total assets but provided net gains that positively affected the income statement, offsetting some of the losses from lower fees and gains on debt securities.\n\n"}

This increase is primarily due to gross increases in current year tax positions, which amounted to $416 million, and prior year tax positions, adding $120 million. However, there were also gross decreases from prior year tax positions, settlements, and statute of limitations lapses, totaling $130 million. The net effect resulted in a slight increase in gross unrecognized tax benefits.\n- **Implications:** The increase in gross unrecognized tax benefits indicates ongoing tax disputes and potential future tax liabilities, which could impact the company's effective tax rate and cash flow.\n\n**Common Share Repurchases:**\n- **2019 to 2020:** The company repurchased 14 million shares in 2020 compared to 22 million shares in 2019. The average price per share increased from $245.97 to $300.58, and the aggregate cost of repurchases rose from $5,500 million to $4,250 million.\n- **Implications:** Despite a decrease in the number of shares repurchased, the higher average price per share suggests a strategic focus on optimizing capital structure and cost of capital. The remaining authorization for share repurchases was 58 million shares as of December 31, 2020, indicating ongoing flexibility to adjust capital management strategies.\n\n**Financial Position:**\n- The company's financial position reflects a balance between tax strategy and capital management. The increase in unrecognized tax benefits suggests active tax planning, while the share repurchase program indicates a commitment to returning value to shareholders through capital structure optimization.\n\n- **Conclusion:** The company's financial position is characterized by strategic tax management and capital allocation, with a focus on optimizing returns to shareholders through share repurchases and managing tax liabilities.\n\n![Gross unrecognized tax benefits increased from 2019 to 2020]()\n\n![Common share repurchases decreased in number but increased in average price per share]()\n\n### Evidence Selection and Citation:\n\n- **Text Quotes:**\n  - [3] The Company had $128 million and"}

For lease liabilities, the adoption of AASB 16 required the recognition of lease liabilities at the present value of the remaining lease payments, discounted at the Group’s incremental borrowing rate as of 1 July 2019. This change led to a substantial increase in lease liabilities, as seen in the financial statements. The Group recognized a lease liability of $143,621,000 at the initial application of AASB 16, which was adjusted to $167,154,000 by the end of 2020, reflecting the re-measurement of lease liabilities due to changes in lease terms, including extensions (quote [8] and [3]). The table in image1 shows the detailed breakdown of lease liabilities, including the recognition of liabilities, re-measurements, and payments made during the period, resulting in a current lease liability of $36,019,000 and a non-current lease liability of $131,135,000 at the end of 2020.\n\nFor employee benefit liabilities, the transition to AASB 16 did not significantly alter the recognition of liabilities for annual and long-service leave, as the Group continued to calculate these at undiscounted amounts based on expected remuneration rates (quote [1]). However, the total employee benefit liabilities decreased slightly from $4,054,000 in 2019 to $4,092,000 in 2020, primarily due to a decrease in the liability for long-service leave (image3).\n\nThe adoption of AASB 16 also affected the accounting for lease incentives, with the Group no longer recognizing provisions for straight-line rent and lease incentives, instead including payments due under the lease in the lease liability (image4). This change streamlined the accounting but did not directly impact the liability figures reported in 2020.\n\nIn summary, the transition to AASB 16 led to a significant increase in lease liabilities due to the recognition of lease liabilities and re-measurements, while the employee benefit liabilities remained relatively stable.\n\n![Lease liabilities impact](image1)  \n![Employee benefit liabilities](image3)\n\nThe financial impacts of the transition to AASB "}

The remuneration system is designed to align executive compensation with corporate performance, ensuring that executives are rewarded based on their contributions to the company's success. This alignment is achieved through several key components:\n\n1. **Consolidated Operating Income**: As highlighted in [1], [3], and [10], consolidated operating income is a critical factor in determining the Annual Total Remuneration. This metric reflects the company's profitability and operational efficiency, directly impacting the performance-linked portion of executive compensation. The evaluation method for consolidated operating income, as shown in image3, involves assessing the degree of attainment of this income against a reference value set for sustainable growth, emphasizing the importance of financial performance in remuneration decisions.\n\n2. **Volatility of Toyota's Share Price**: The volatility of Toyota's share price is another significant indicator, as mentioned in [1], [3], and [10]. Image1 illustrates that this volatility is used as a corporate value indicator for shareholders and investors to evaluate Toyota's efforts. The evaluation method for share price volatility involves comparing it to the Nikkei stock average, ensuring that executives are rewarded based on market perception and shareholder value.\n\n3. **Individual Performance Evaluation**: Qualitative evaluations of each director's performance, as noted in [1], [10], and image1, play a crucial role. These evaluations consider the efforts made by executives in line with the \"Toyoda\" concept, ensuring that personal contributions are recognized and rewarded appropriately.\n\n4. **Fixed and Performance-Linked Remuneration**: The remuneration system consists of fixed remuneration, which is based on job responsibilities and home country standards, and performance-linked remuneration, which is contingent on consolidated operating income and share price volatility. This dual structure ensures that executives are both compensated for their roles and incentivized to drive business performance and shareholder value.\n\n5. **Board of Directors' Oversight**: The Board of Directors, as described in [2], [5], and [10], oversees the remuneration policy, ensuring that it reflects corporate performance and individual responsibilities. The delegation of remuneration determination to the Executive Compensation Meeting, as mentioned in [5], further ensures that decisions are aligned with the established policy.\n\n6. **Shareholder Value and Dividend Policy**: Toyota's commitment to shareholder value is evident in"}

For instance, North America sales increased by 23% due to higher end-user demand and favorable price realization.\n- Image 2 visually represents the impact of sales volume and price realization on revenue, showing significant contributions from these factors.\n\n**Segments with Significant Improvements:**\n- **Construction Industries** (31% increase) and **Energy & Transportation** (16% increase) were the primary contributors, as detailed in text [4] and [7]. These segments benefited from higher sales volume and favorable currency impacts.\n- Image 3 further supports this, showing substantial revenue increases in these segments, with Construction Industries seeing a $5.188 billion increase and Energy & Transportation a $2.817 billion increase.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe combined effects of increased sales volume and favorable price realization, along with changes in dealer inventories and currency impacts, led to Caterpillar's 22% revenue growth in 2021. The Construction Industries and Energy & Transportation segments showed the most significant improvements, driven by robust demand and favorable market conditions.\n\n![Sales Volume and Price Realization Contribution](image1)  \n![Revenue Comparison 2021 vs. 2020](image2)  \n![Segment Revenue Breakdown](image3)  \n\nCaterpillar's "}

Of the charges incurred in fiscal year 2021, $176 were recorded in SG&A, $134 in Costs of products sold and $20 in Other non-operating income, net.\n- **[10]** Restructuring costs incurred consist primarily of costs to separate employees, asset-related costs to exit facilities and other costs. Employee separation costs relate to severance packages that are primarily voluntary and the amounts calculated are based on salary levels and past service periods. Asset-related costs consist of both asset write-downs and accelerated depreciation. Asset write-downs relate to the establishment of a new fair value basis for assets held-for-sale or for disposal. These assets are written down to the lower of their current carrying basis or amounts expected to be realized upon disposal, less minor disposal costs. Charges for accelerated depreciation relate to long-lived assets that will be taken out of service prior to the end of their normal service period. These assets relate primarily to manufacturing consolidations and technology standardization. The asset-related charges will not have a significant impact on future depreciation charges. Other restructuring-type charges primarily include asset removal and termination of contracts related to supply chain and overhead optimization.\n\n**Image Evidence:**\n\n- **image3** provides a detailed breakdown of restructuring costs by category for the years ended June 30, 2020, 2021, and 2022.\n- **image5** shows the total restructuring costs by segment for the years ended June 30, 202"}

The report highlights that fluctuations in the market price of minerals, metals, or petroleum directly affect BHP's revenues, cash flows, and asset values. For coal, the report notes that the average realized sales price for FY2021 was US\\$16,250 per tonne, up from US\\$13,860 per tonne in FY2020, indicating a positive impact on revenue. However, the report also mentions that lower volumes decreased Underlying EBITDA by US\\$168 million for Coal, and that the prices obtained for products are a key driver of value for BHP. This suggests that while higher prices can boost revenue, lower volumes can offset these gains.\n\nFor nickel, the report states that the average realized sales price for FY2021 was US\\$16,250 per tonne, benefiting from positive investor sentiment and strong demand. An announcement by a major nickel producer to convert some nickel pig iron to nickel matte in Indonesia led to a brief correction in March, but prices rebounded due to strong demand and supply disruptions. This indicates that both market demand and supply-side factors play crucial roles in nickel price fluctuations.\n\nThe report also provides a table showing the impact of commodity price changes on profit after taxation and Underlying EBITDA. For example, a US\\$1/lb increase in nickel price impacts profit after taxation by US\\$1 and Underlying EBITDA by US\\$1, as shown in image1. This table quantifies the sensitivity of BHP's financial results to commodity price changes, emphasizing the importance of nickel and coal prices in driving profitability.\n\nAdditionally, the report mentions that the prices of coal and nickel are influenced by foreign currency exchange rates and market conditions, which can lead to uncertainties in future revenues and project feasibility. The financial statements in image2 show the revenue and Underlying EBITDA for FY2021, highlighting the financial performance influenced by these price changes.\n\nIn summary, changes in commodity prices, particularly coal and nickel, significantly impact BHP's financial results through revenue generation and cost structures. The report emphasizes the importance of monitoring these prices and their fluctuations to manage financial performance effectively.\n\n![Impact of commodity price changes on profit and EBITDA]()\n\n![Financial performance summary for FY2021]()\n\n### Conclusion\n\nChanges in commodity prices, especially coal and nickel, significantly impact B"}

This decline is attributed to the growth of the cigarette new taste dimension segment, where PMI has a relatively low market share, which partly offset the higher total market growth.\n- **Heated Tobacco Units:** There was a significant increase of 10.4% in heated tobacco unit sales volume from 30,677 million units in 2019 to 33,862 million units in 2020. This growth is driven by higher shipment volumes, particularly in Japan.\n\n**Latin America & Canada:**\n- **Cigarettes:** The cigarette sales volume decreased by 11.8% from 72,293 million units in 2019 to 63,749 million units in 2020. This decline is primarily due to lower market share, with adult smokers down-trading to ultra-low-price brands produced by local manufacturers and retail out-of-stock of PMI brands during the second quarter.\n- **Heated Tobacco Units:** There was a substantial increase of 50.8% in heated tobacco unit sales volume from 299 million units in 2019 to 451 million units in 2020.

This increase can be attributed to several factors, as detailed in the financial statements and highlighted in the relevant quotes and images.\n\n**Text Evidence:**\n- **Quote [8]**: \"Our Board of Directors declared quarterly dividends totaling $4.6 billion in 2021.

The net income increased from a loss of $5.70 billion in 2020 to an income of $9.67 billion in 2021, a substantial increase of $15.37 billion. This improvement was primarily driven by higher upstream realizations, higher downstream margins, and the absence of impairments and write-offs from the previous year [4].

According to the text and image quotes, female employees have a higher entitlement to parental leave compared to male employees, with 21,746 females entitled versus 98,347 males. However, the actual availed leave is much lower for females, with only 1,025 availing it compared to 2,023 males. This results in a return rate of 94% for females and 96% for males after availing leave, indicating that while more females are entitled to leave, fewer actually take it. The return rate after 12 months is even lower, with 6% of female employees returning compared to 4% of male employees.\n\n![Parental leave entitlement and usage differences](image1)\n\nThis data suggests that despite policies aimed at promoting gender diversity and inclusion, there are barriers preventing female employees from utilizing their parental leave. The image of women and children engaged in a dance activity (image2) symbolizes the cultural and social dynamics that may influence these disparities. The bank's efforts to create an inclusive work environment, as mentioned in the text, include initiatives like the 'Uncovering Unconscious Biases' campaign and the 'Shrishti' program to support women, but the data indicates that these efforts may not yet be fully effective in addressing the practical challenges faced by female employees in balancing work and family responsibilities.\n\nThe text also highlights the bank's commitment to gender diversity, with a target to increase women's representation to 25% by FY25 and various programs to support women's career progression. However, the parental leave data underscores the need for more comprehensive policies to ensure equal access and utilization of benefits for all genders.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe parental leave entitlement and usage data at HDFC Bank shows that while female employees are entitled to more leave, they are less likely to avail it, reflecting ongoing challenges in gender diversity policies and practices. This discrepancy suggests a need for more inclusive policies to support all employees in balancing work and family life effectively."}

[4] Additionally, the FDA approved a second biosimilar version of ENBREL in April 2019, leading to ongoing patent litigations. [8] The sales data from the image quotes show a consistent decline in ENBREL sales, with a 4% decrease in 2020 compared to 2019. [4] [8] [image1]\n\n**Prolia**, on the other hand, saw an increase in sales for 2020, driven by higher unit demand and net selling price. [3] The increase in 2019 was also attributed to higher unit demand. [5] However, disruptions in patient visits due to the COVID-19 pandemic affected demand in 2020, decelerating the historical growth rates. [6] The sales data indicate a 3% increase in 2020 compared to 2019, reflecting these market dynamics.

In 2020, the gross margin percentage was 10.04%, which dropped to 9.65% in 2021, and further decreased to 8.88% in 2022. This decline was primarily due to several factors:\n\n1. **Decreases in Core Merchandise Categories**: The gross margin in core merchandise categories, when expressed as a percentage of core merchandise sales, decreased by 27 basis points, with the most significant drop in fresh foods and foods and sundries. This indicates that the cost of goods sold increased more rapidly than sales in these categories [3].\n\n2. **LIFO Charge**: A LIFO (Last-In, First-Out) charge for higher merchandise costs negatively impacted the gross margin by 19 basis points [5].\n\n3. **Increased Rewards**: The increase in rewards by 2% also contributed to a slight decrease in gross margin [1].\n\n4. **Inflation and Cost Increases**: Merchandise costs were impacted by inflation higher than experienced in recent years. Strategies to manage these costs, such as working with suppliers to absorb cost increases and offering seasonal merchandise outside its season, negatively affected gross margin [3].\n\n5. **Gasoline Price Inflation**: While higher gasoline prices positively impacted net sales, they negatively affected the gross margin percentage due to the lower gross margin of gasoline business compared to non-gasoline business [2].\n\n6. **Currency Fluctuations**: Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted gross margin by approximately $176 million in 2022, primarily due to operations in other international markets [5].\n\nThe gross margin percentage in 2022 was 8.88%, a 1.16 percentage point decrease from 2020, reflecting these challenges in managing costs and maintaining profitability [1, 5].\n\n![Gross Margin Percentage Change](image1)\n\n![Gross Margin Percentage Change](image2)\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe gross margin percentage decreased from 2020 to 2022 due to cost increases in core merchandise, LIFO charges, higher rewards, inflation, and currency fluctuations, despite the positive impact of gasoline sales on net sales.\n\n---\n\n**Evidence Selection and Citation:**\n\n- **Text Quotes:**\n  - [1]: Gross margin decreased across all segments, impacted by decreases in core merchandise categories"}

The substantial adjustments in net sales due to these factors underscore the impact of these estimates on financial statements.\n\n- **Image Quote [image1]**: The financial data indicates a substantial increase in net sales from 2019 to 2020, with a notable portion attributed to the Diabetes and Obesity care segment. This growth could be influenced by the accuracy of these high-risk estimates.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe principal accounting policies with high estimation risk are the estimates of US sales deductions and provisions for sales rebates, as they require significant judgment and are subject to substantial uncertainty, particularly in the competitive US healthcare market. These estimates are critical for accurately reflecting the financial position and performance of the company.\n\n![High estimation risk](image5)"}

According to the text quote [4], the scarcity of venture capital (VC) money in Europe has led to higher capital efficiency and a more selective investment approach. This scarcity has caused a shift in the investment strategy, favoring more mature stages of companies.\n\nIn the 1998 fund, as depicted in image1, the distribution was relatively balanced across early, mid, and seed stages. However, by the 2007 fund, there is a noticeable shift towards later-stage investments. Image1 shows that the 2007 fund has a higher proportion of investments in mid-stage companies compared to the 1998 and 2000 funds. This indicates that European venture capitalists have become more selective, focusing on companies that are further along in their development, likely due to the reduced availability of capital and the need to maximize returns.\n\n### Quote Citation:\n- **Text Quote [4]**: \"The scarcity of VC money in Europe not only has led to low entry valuations. but also has driven up capital efficiency (roughly 70 percent higher than in the US) and yield (hit rate) because the scarcity of money allows the very few investors to simply be more selective.\"\n- **Image Quote image1**: This image illustrates the change in investment stage distribution from the 1998 fund to the 2007 fund.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe distribution of investment stages in European venture capital funds shifted from a more balanced approach in the 1998 fund to a greater focus on later-stage investments in the 2007 fund, reflecting"}

According to the text, 36% of women in STEM jobs consider sexual harassment a problem, compared to 28% of men [1]. This perception is particularly pronounced in majority-male settings and in computer jobs, where nearly half (48%) of female STEM workers in majority-male workplaces and about four-in-ten (42%) women in computer jobs see it as a problem, compared to 30% of men in computer jobs [1]. The data from image1 also supports this, showing that women in health-related jobs and computer majors are more likely to perceive sexual harassment as a problem, with 69% and 38% of women, respectively, compared to 61% and 38% of men [1].\n\nIn contrast, the text indicates that women in STEM jobs are about three times as likely as men to have experienced sexual harassment in the workplace [2]. This is further illustrated in image3, which shows that 22% of women in STEM jobs have experienced sexual harassment, compared to 7% of men [3]. The same survey also reveals that women in non-STEM jobs are more likely than men to have experienced sexual harassment, with 22% of women and 7% of men reporting such experiences [7].\n\nThe text highlights that women in STEM jobs are more likely to report experiences with and concerns about gender inequities in the workplace compared to men in these roles [4]. Image5 provides additional context, showing that women in STEM jobs, particularly those in computer positions, workplaces with more men, and those with advanced degrees, are more likely to have concerns about gender equity and have experienced gender discrimination [4].\n\nIn summary, women in STEM jobs perceive sexual harassment as a more significant issue and are more likely to have experienced it compared to their male counterparts, as evidenced by both textual data and visual representations in the provided images.\n\n![Women in STEM jobs are more likely to perceive sexual harassment as a problem](image1)  \n![Women in STEM jobs are more likely to have experienced sexual harassment](image3)  \n![Women in STEM jobs are more likely to experience gender inequities](image5)\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWomen in STEM jobs are more likely than men to perceive sexual harassment as a problem in their workplace and are more likely to have experienced it.

According to the text quotes, younger Americans are more likely to prioritize human rights, while older Americans are more likely to see China as a competitor or an enemy. Specifically, the text [5] states that \"nearly three-quarters of Americans choose human rights, even if it harms economic relations with China.\" This preference is consistent across all age groups, as noted in quote [7]. However, the intensity of this preference increases with age, with older Americans being more negative towards China. Quote [2] highlights that \"Americans ages 50 and older are substantially more negative\" towards China, with 81% having an unfavorable view, compared to 71% of those aged 30 to 49 and 56% of those under 30. This negative sentiment is reflected in their views on human rights, as older Americans are more likely to support promoting human rights over economic relations, as seen in image3, which shows that 71% of those aged 50 and older prefer human rights over economic relations, compared to 24% who prioritize economic relations.\n\nThe partisan divide also influences these views, with Democrats more likely to emphasize human rights, as noted in quote [4]. However, the overall trend across all age groups is a strong preference for human rights, with image3 showing that 73% of the total population supports this stance. This preference is evident across all age groups, with younger Americans showing a slightly higher preference for human rights, but the gap narrows as age increases.\n\nIn summary, while all age groups favor promoting human rights over economic relations with China, older Americans are more likely to hold this view due to their increased negative perception of China, as depicted in image3.\n\n![Preference for human rights over economic relations by age](image3)\n\n### Conclusion:\nOlder Americans are more likely to prioritize promoting human rights over economic relations with China compared to younger Americans, reflecting their more negative views of the country."}

According to the text quotes, more educated Americans are more critical of the U.S.'s handling of the disease. Around two-thirds of those with a postgraduate degree say the U.S. has done a poor job, as do around six-in-ten college graduates. In comparison, about four-in-ten of those with a high school degree or less (43%) say the same. This indicates a clear correlation between higher education levels and more negative assessments of the U.S. response. Additionally, the text notes that people with higher levels of education are more likely to believe the U.S. should help other countries deal with their problems and to think the U.S. can learn from other countries about effective ways to combat coronavirus. This suggests that education not only influences opinions on domestic performance but also on international cooperation and learning from other nations.\n\nThe image quotes further illustrate this trend. Image 1 shows that a higher percentage of Americans with postgraduate degrees believe the U.S. can learn from other countries compared to those with lower education levels. This aligns with the text, which states that those with higher education levels are more likely to think the U.S. can learn from other countries. Image 2 provides a detailed breakdown, showing that younger Americans, particularly those under 30, are more likely to approve of the WHO's performance, which is also a form of international evaluation. However, the text indicates that younger Americans are not necessarily more critical of the U.S. response, suggesting that age and education are distinct factors influencing evaluations.\n\nImage 3 and Image 4 offer additional insights. Image 3 shows that Black and Hispanic Americans rate the U.S. response more negatively than white, non-Hispanic Americans, but the text does not directly link this to education levels. Image 4 highlights that evaluations are also divided along party lines, with Republicans and Republican-leaning independents praising the U.S.'s handling of the outbreak, while Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents are critical. This partisan divide is further emphasized in the text, which states that opinions are most divided along party lines.\n\nIn summary, the data from both text and images indicate that higher education levels are associated with more critical evaluations of the U.S. COVID-19 response, a belief in learning from other countries, and a greater willingness to help other nations.

Initially, the population surged dramatically in the late 1800s due to the Transcontinental Railroad Act and the Homestead Act, which facilitated westward expansion and agricultural development. By 1890, the county reached its peak at 14,096 residents, as highlighted in the census data from image3. However, this growth was short-lived, and the population began to decline steadily thereafter. By 2000, the population had decreased to 9,403, reflecting broader trends of rural depopulation in the Midwest and Great Plains.\n\nHistorical factors such as the introduction of mechanized farming, as noted in text4, led to consolidation of farms and a shift from small-scale to large-scale operations, reducing the number of farms and increasing their size. This mechanization, combined with the decline in agricultural profitability, contributed to the decline in rural populations. Additionally, the consolidation of rural school districts, as mentioned in text6, indicates a reduction in community infrastructure, further impacting population stability.\n\nThe image3 census data provides a clear visual representation of these trends, showing a peak in 1890 and a gradual decline through the 20th century. The map in image5 situates Hamilton County within Nebraska, illustrating its geographical context and the influence of transportation routes like the Transcontinental Railroad, which initially spurred growth but later became less significant as the agricultural landscape evolved.\n\n### Evidence Selection and Citation\n\n- **Text Evidence**:\n  - Text3: \"Five of the seven rural communities peaked in population between 1900 and 1940, which is typical of most small towns in the Midwest and Great Plains.\"\n  - Text5: \"The Transcontinental Railroad Act and the Homestead Act, both passed in 1862, transformed the Nebraska landscape.\"\n  - Text6: \"The consolidation trend continues.

The text does not provide a direct percentage for those who are very confident, but it does mention that 40% have confidence in Trump on immigration policy, which includes those who are very or somewhat confident. Since 40% is the total confidence, and 45% are not at all confident, we can infer that the remaining percentage (100% - 45% = 55%) is the combined percentage of those who are very or somewhat confident. However, the question specifically asks for the percentage difference between those who are very confident and those who are not at all confident.\n\nGiven the data:\n- **Not at all confident**: 45%\n- **Very confident**: 100% - 45% = 55% (assuming the remaining 10% are somewhat confident)\n\nThe percentage difference between those who are very confident (55%) and those who are not at all confident (45%) is:\n\\[ 55\\% - 45\\% = 10\\% \\]\n\n### Quote Citation:\n- **Text Quote [10]**: [10]\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe percentage difference between the proportion of people who are very confident in Trump's ability to make wise decisions about immigration policy and those who are not confident at all is **10%**.\n\n![{10"}

In March 2020, 74% of Democrats rated public health officials positively, and this figure remained largely unchanged at 72% in the current survey period [3]. This is reflected in image1, which shows a steady approval rating for Democrats over time, with a slight dip in 2020 but still above 70%.\n\n- **Republicans**, however, have seen a sharp decline in their positive ratings. In March 2020, 84% of Republicans rated public health officials positively, but this dropped to 53% in the current survey period [3].

According to the survey, **50% of Americans believe China will have less influence in world affairs after the coronavirus outbreak** [3]. This perception is influenced by rising negative attitudes toward China, with **66% of Americans expressing an unfavorable opinion**, the most negative rating since the Pew Research Center began tracking this in 2005 [3]. The partisan divide is stark: **60% of Republicans believe China's influence will diminish**, compared to **40% of Democrats** [1]. Additionally, **half of Americans think China's global influence will decline**, while only a small fraction, **17%**, believe it will grow [4]. The survey also highlights that **far fewer Americans think the U.S. or the European Union will have less influence** compared to China [9].\n\n![image1](image1) illustrates that a significant majority, **84%**, believe the U.S. influence will not be much or at all affected by the pandemic, with only **15%** thinking it will be bolstered [8]. This sentiment is reflected in the partisan differences, where **56% of liberal Democrats** believe the U.S. will have less influence, compared to just **8% of conservative Republicans** [6]. The trend of unfavorable views toward China has increased over the past two years, with Republicans expressing more negative attitudes [7].\n\n### Conclusion:\nAmericans generally expect China's global influence to decrease post-pandemic, with a significant partisan gap, and a majority believing the U.S. influence will remain unchanged or be bolstered. \n\n![image1](image1)"}

Initially, in 1990, a majority of Americans were satisfied with the way things were going in the country, with 54% expressing satisfaction, as depicted in image4. However, this trend has reversed over the years. By 2019, the percentage of satisfied Americans had dropped to 26%, as shown in the same image.

According to the text and images provided:\n\n- **Text Quote [10]**: The composition of the sample in terms of rural and urban settlement reflects the actual national figure of the 2011 census. Out of the total respondents interviewed in three surveys, 83% were from rural areas and 17% from urban areas.\n\n- **Image Quote [image4]**: The image shows that in rural areas, 77% of respondents listen to the radio, while in urban areas, 49% do so. This indicates a higher reliance on radio for information in rural regions compared to urban areas.\n\n- **Image Quote [image5]**: The image further breaks down the listening habits by gender and device. In rural areas, 75% of males and 77% of females listen to the radio, whereas in urban areas, 70% of males and 36% of females do so. Additionally, 39% of rural respondents use mobile phones to listen to the radio, compared to 43% of males and 36% of females in urban areas.\n\n- **Image Quote [image4]**: The image also highlights that 76% of rural respondents use a radio, while only 40% of urban respondents do so. This suggests that radio remains a primary medium for information in rural areas, possibly due to limited access to other media.\n\n- **Image Quote [image4]**: The image indicates that 77% of rural respondents use mobile phones to listen to the radio, compared to 70% of urban respondents. This suggests that mobile phones are a more common device for radio listening in both rural and urban areas, but the preference for radio over mobile phone listening is stronger in rural areas.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn summary, radio listening habits are more prevalent in rural areas (83% of rural respondents) compared to urban areas (49% of urban respondents). Rural areas have a higher percentage of radio listeners and a greater reliance on radio over mobile phones for listening, while urban areas show a more balanced use of mobile phones and radio. This reflects the varying access to and preference for different media in rural and urban settings. \n\n![Rural vs. Urban Radio Listening Habits](image4)"}

According to the text, a majority of both Republicans (62%) and Democrats (56%) believe that problems in the world would be worse without U.S. involvement, indicating a general consensus on the importance of U.S. efforts in addressing global issues. However, the text also reveals that there are notable differences in how each group views the effectiveness of these efforts. For instance, while Democrats are now the only partisan group where a majority (64%) say the government is doing at least fairly well in combating terrorism, this is a significant drop from earlier assessments. In contrast, Republicans have seen a substantial decline in their positive ratings, with only 27% now saying the government is doing very or fairly well in reducing the terrorist threat, down from 63% at the beginning of the year.\n\nThe image quotes further illustrate these differences. Image 1 shows that Republicans are consistently more concerned about Islamic extremism around the world compared to Democrats and Independents, with percentages ranging from 82% to 83%. This heightened concern is mirrored in Image 4, where a higher percentage of Republicans express concern about Islamic extremism both globally and domestically. Image 5 provides a comparative view of opinions on U.S. efforts to solve problems, showing that a larger proportion of Republicans (38%) believe these efforts make things worse compared to Democrats (37%) and Independents (43%). This suggests that while Republicans may perceive a greater need for U.S. involvement, they are also more critical of the effectiveness of current efforts.\n\nIn summary, while both Republicans and Democrats recognize the importance of U.S. involvement in global problem-solving, Republicans are more critical of the government's effectiveness in addressing these issues, as evidenced by their lower approval ratings and greater concern about Islamic extremism.\n\n![Perceptions of U.S. involvement in solving global problems differ significantly among political affiliations, with Republicans more critical of government effectiveness and Democrats more supportive.](image1)\n\n![Republicans are more concerned about Islamic extremism and critical of government efforts compared to Democrats.](image4)\n\n![Republicans are more likely to believe U.S. efforts make things worse, reflecting a higher level of skepticism.](image5)"}

According to the text and image quotes, foreign-born Hispanics are most likely to say they have Hispanic friends, with 64% reporting this. This is followed by second-generation Hispanics at 55%, and third or higher generation Hispanics at 37%. The data from image1 supports this trend, showing that 64% of self-identified Hispanics have all or most Hispanic friends, with this percentage decreasing as generations increase. The text also highlights that the share of self-identified Hispanics with all or most Hispanic friends drops from 77% among foreign-born individuals to 55% among the second generation and further to 37% among third or higher generations.\n\nThe text and image quotes also indicate that the composition of networks of friends varies widely across immigrant generations. Most immigrant Latinos (77%) say all or most of their friends are Latinos, but this share drops to 55% among second-generation self-identified Latinos and only 37% among third or higher generation self-identified Latinos.

According to the text and image quotes, older adults with physical or health conditions that make using technology challenging are less likely to engage with digital tools. For instance, the text states that 23% of older adults have a condition that makes reading difficult, and 29% have a disability, handicap, or chronic disease that prevents full participation in daily activities [8]. This group is less likely to go online (49% vs. 66%), have broadband at home (38% vs. 53%), own a cell phone (69% vs. 82%), and have a smartphone (13% vs. 22%) [3]. \n\nImage 1 visually supports this by showing that among older adults, 23% report a physical or health condition making reading difficult, compared to 16% of all adults. Similarly, 29% of older adults have a disability or chronic disease affecting daily activities, compared to 18% of all adults. These figures highlight the greater prevalence of physical challenges in older adults, contributing to their lower technology adoption rates.\n\nThe text also notes that older adults with significant health challenges are less likely to use tablets and e-book readers, with 22% owning either device compared to 31% of all adults [10]. This further underscores the barriers posed by physical conditions to technology use.\n\nIn summary, physical health conditions are a major barrier to technology adoption among older adults, affecting their online presence, device ownership, and digital engagement compared to the general adult population.\n\n![Physical or health condition makes reading difficult or challenging](image1)  \n![Disability, handicap, or chronic disease that prevents full participation in work, school, or other activities](image1)  \n![Technology ownership among older adults](image2)  \n\n**Answer:** Older adults with physical health conditions are significantly less likely to use technology compared to all adults, with lower rates of internet access, broadband, cell phone, and smartphone ownership."}

Initially, the population surged dramatically, reaching its peak in 1890 at 14,096, as indicated in [1]. This rapid increase was driven by pioneer overland travel and settlement, which is further supported by the establishment of numerous rural school districts, as noted in [2]. The population continued to grow, reaching 8,267 by 1880 and 13,330 by 1900, as shown in [3] and [4].\n\nHowever, after peaking in 1890, the population began to decline. By 1900, it had dropped to 13,330, and continued to decrease in subsequent decades, as seen in [3] and [4]. The population reached 9,403 in 2000, reflecting a long-term decline from its peak, as illustrated in [3] and [4]. This trend is consistent with the consolidation of rural school districts and the challenges faced by small towns, as discussed in [2] and [5].\n\nThe population trends in specific towns also reflect this broader pattern. For example, Aurora, one of the larger towns, peaked in 2000 with 4,225 citizens and has since seen steady growth, as noted in [4]. In contrast, other towns like Hordville and Polk have experienced population declines, as mentioned in [5]. The consolidation of farms and the shift in agricultural practices, as described in [6], have likely contributed to these demographic changes.\n\nThe images provide visual context to these trends. Image1 shows a church, which may represent the community structures that supported the population growth, while Image4 depicts a gravestone, symbolizing the historical roots of the settlement. Image3 offers a numerical representation of the population changes over time, highlighting the peak in 1890 and subsequent decline.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe population of Hamilton County grew rapidly from 1870 to 1890, peaking at 14,096, and then gradually declined to 9,403 by 2000, influenced by factors such as farm consolidation and changes in agricultural practices.\n\n![Population decline from 1870 to 2000]()\n\n![Population trends"}

The main components and their functions are as follows:\n\n1. **Multimodal Retriever**:\n   - **Function**: This component is responsible for querying a large multimodal external memory or database to find information relevant to the input query or context. It encodes and stores a large volume of images and text embeddings for quick, accurate retrieval.\n   - **Details**: As shown in `![Multimodal Retrieval Process](image3)`, the retriever uses an image encoder to extract embeddings from input images, which are then indexed for efficient retrieval. The retriever supports both image-image and image-text k-NN searches, allowing it to retrieve the most similar class names to the input image.\n\n2. **Memory Bank**:\n   - **Function**: The memory bank stores multimodal embeddings for various categories, which are used to retrieve relevant information during the inference stage.\n   - **Details**: The memory bank is constructed using a multimodal retriever, as depicted in `![Multimodal Retrieval Process](image3)`, where embeddings are stored and indexed to facilitate fast retrieval.\n\n3. **Retrieving & Ranking**:\n   - **Function**: Upon receiving an input image, the pipeline retrieves the top-$k$ class names most similar to the image from the memory bank. Subsequently, the MLLMs rank these retrieved candidate results to make the final prediction.\n   - **Details**: The process is illustrated in `![Multimodal Retrieval Process](image3)`, where the retrieved top-$k$ categories are combined with the image embeddings and sent to the MLLM for ranking, ensuring a more accurate and contextually aware classification prediction.\n\n4. **Prompt**:\n   - **Function**: The prompt merges the input image with the retrieved category information and guides the MLLM to rank the retrieved results based on similarity.\n   - **Details**: The prompt format, as shown in `![Ranking Prompt Example](image4)`, sorts the retrieved categories, helping the MLLM focus on the most relevant ones for classification.\n\n5. **Index System (HNSW)**:\n   - **Function**: To enhance retrieval speed, the index system uses the HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World) algorithm, which reduces dimensionality"}

Specifically, the unmasked performance for the \"No relation types\" scenario is 62.7, which is very close to the 62.4 of the \"No R-GCN\" scenario. This indicates that removing relation types did not significantly impact the unmasked performance compared to the full (single) model.\n\n**Quote Citation:**\n- Text quote [7]: [7]\n- Image quote image1: `![62.7 vs 62.4](image1)`\n\n**Interleaved Answer:**\nBased on Table 3 and the analysis in the text, removing relation types did not significantly affect the unmasked performance compared to the full (single) model. The unmasked performance for the \"No relation types\" scenario is 62.7, which is only slightly higher than the 62.4 for the \"No R-GCN\" scenario. This suggests that distinguishing edges by type does not add much value in the unmasked setting.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nRemoving relation types slightly improved the unmasked performance from 62.4 to 62.7 compared to the full (single) model, indicating a marginal impact.\n\n`![62.7 vs 62.4](image1)`"}

According to the text quotes, object queries are used in the transformer decoder to transform the embeddings of size \\(d\\) using multi-headed self- and encoder-decoder attention mechanisms. These queries are initialized to zero and are passed through the decoder along with positional encodings, which are added to the input of each attention layer. The object queries are then independently decoded into box coordinates and class labels by a feed forward network, resulting in the final set of predictions. This approach allows the model to reason about all objects in parallel, leveraging the global context provided by the self-attention mechanisms to model relations between different detections.\n\n![{DETR uses object queries to simplify detection by predicting all objects in parallel}](image3)\n\nIn the DETR architecture, as depicted in `image3`, the CNN backbone extracts a compact feature representation, which is passed through the transformer encoder with positional encodings. The decoder receives these object queries, which are initially set to zero, along with output positional encodings and encoder memory. The decoder then produces the final set of predicted class labels and bounding boxes through multiple multi-head self-attention and decoder-encoder attention layers. The use of object queries enables the model to process global information and pairwise relations between objects efficiently, as shown in the detailed architecture in `image3`.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe DETR model uses object queries to simplify the detection pipeline by predicting all objects in parallel, leveraging the transformer's self-attention mechanisms to reason about global image context and object relations."}

The system message defines the desired tone and style of the generated instruction-response pairs, while visual annotations provide essential image information such as bounding boxes and image descriptions. This step sets the context and guidelines for the subsequent generation.\n\n2. **Generate Instruction-Response Pairs (Step 2)**: Using ChatGPT, the system generates instruction-response pairs based on the visual content provided in the previous step. This involves leveraging the system message and visual annotations to guide the language model in creating relevant and contextually appropriate pairs.\n\n3. **Filtering (Step 3)**: The generated pairs undergo a filtering process to ensure quality. This step involves evaluating the generated pairs to remove any low-quality or irrelevant responses, ensuring that only high-quality pairs are selected for further use.\n\n4. **Translation (Step 4)**: The final step involves translating the high-quality instruction-response pairs into multiple languages, including Chinese (zh), Japanese (ja), Spanish (es), German (de), French (fr), Korean (ko), and Arabic (ar).

The figure indicates that relation propagation achieves significant improvement in sentences with more entities.\n- **Quote 10** refers to Figure 3b, which shows the effect of the number of iterations for relation propagation in the relation extraction task. It notes that the model achieves the best performance on the second iteration (M=2).\n\n### Image Evidence:\n- **Image2** is a graph showing relation scores as a function of the number of entities in a sentence for DyGIE and DyGIE without relation propagation. The graph indicates that DyGIE with relation propagation (RelProp) outperforms DyGIE without it, especially in sentences with 6-11 entities.\n- **Image4** is a table showing the performance of DyGIE with and without relation propagation. It highlights that DyGIE with relation propagation achieves higher F1 scores for relation extraction, especially noticeable in sentences with more entities.\n\n### Answer Construction:\nThe relation extraction performance improves significantly with the number of entities in a sentence when relation propagation is utilized. This is evident from **Image2**, which shows that DyGIE with relation propagation (RelProp) achieves higher F1 scores compared to DyGIE without it, particularly in sentences containing 6-11 entities. This suggests that relation propagation helps in capturing the broader context, which is crucial when multiple entities and relations are present in a sentence.\n\n**Image4** further supports this by showing that DyGIE with relation propagation achieves substantial improvements in relation extraction, especially in sentences with more entities. The performance peaks at the second iteration (M=2), as mentioned in **Quote 10** and **Image4**.\n\n### Conclusion:\nRelation propagation enhances relation extraction performance, especially in sentences with multiple entities. The added computation cost is minimal, and the memory cost is controlled, making it a beneficial addition to the DyGIE framework.\n\n```markdown\n"}

This is depicted in the iterative flowchart in image5, where the system retrieves information, generates a response, judges the relevance, and iterates up to a maximum number of times or a threshold. This method is effective for providing more context information with each iteration, as shown in the iterative section of image5.\n\n- **Recursive Retrieval** breaks down complex problems into smaller, manageable steps. It involves a hierarchical approach where the system retrieves information, generates a response, judges the relevance, and then recursively decomposes the query or transforms it to retrieve more specific information. This is illustrated in the recursive section of image5, where the system uses query transformation/decomposition to refine the search step by step, breaking down complex queries into simpler ones.\n\n- **Adaptive Retrieval** offers the most flexibility and active control over the retrieval and generation process. It involves a judge module that evaluates the necessity of retrieval based on different scenarios. The system can decide to retrieve on demand or generate a special token when a threshold is reached. This adaptive control allows the system to dynamically adjust the retrieval process, as shown in the adaptive section of image5, where the judge module actively controls the flow based on predefined criteria.\n\n**Image:**\n\n![Iterative, Recursive, and Adaptive Retrieval Processes](image5)\n\n![Evaluation Metrics](image1)\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe iterative retrieval process in RAG systems involves multiple iterations to refine search results, providing more context with each iteration.

However, the quote also highlights the importance of addressing dataset biases, as the baseline's performance before filtering shows how vital it is to investigate and address these issues.\n\nIn image2, we see the performance of the document-cue baseline on WIKIHOP. Before filtering, the document-cue baseline achieves 58.4% accuracy on the standard test set and 67.3% on the masked test set. This demonstrates its effectiveness in predicting answers based on document cues alone, even when the dataset is sub-sampled.\n\n### Quote Citation:\n- **Text Quote [2]**: The relative strength of the document-cue baseline before filtering shows its importance in addressing dataset biases.\n- **Image Quote image2**: The table provides specific accuracy numbers for the document-cue baseline on WIKIHOP.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe document-cue model's accuracy on WIKIHOP is significantly high, achieving 58.4% on the standard test set and 67.3% on the masked test set before filtering. This indicates its capability to predict answers based on document cues effectively, even when the dataset is sub-sampled. However, the need to address dataset biases is emphasized, as the baseline's performance before filtering highlights the importance of this issue.\n\n![Document-cue baseline accuracy on WIKIHOP before filtering](image2)\n\nThe document-cue model's accuracy on WIKIHOP is notably high, with 58.4% on the standard test set and 67.3% on the masked test set before filtering, demonstrating its effectiveness in predicting answers based on document cues."}

This is illustrated in image3, where the model selects \"Super Mario Land\" as the parent entity and follows the \"Publisher\" relation to select \"Nintendo\" as the entity to render. The model uses the hidden state vector \\(\\mathbf{h}_{t}\\) to predict the type of the token, which includes predicting words, parents, and relations. The type of the token \\(t_{t}\\) is computed using a single-layer softmax over \\(\\mathbf{h}_{t,x}\\) to predict one of {new, related, \\(\\varnothing\\)}.\n\nText quote [9] further explains that if there is an entity to render, the model constructs a distribution over the original vocabulary and a vocabulary containing all the tokens that appear in aliases of \\(e_{t}\\). This distribution is conditioned on \\(e_{t}\\) in addition to \\(x_{t}\\). The model uses a weight matrix \\(\\mathbf{W}_{\\mathrm{proj}}\\) to project the concatenated vector into the same vector space as \\(\\mathbf{h}_{t,x}\\) to compute scores over the original vocabulary.\n\nImage3 provides a visual representation of this process. It shows that when rendering an entity, the model first identifies the parent entity from local entities and then selects the relation to render. In the context of 'published by', the model picks \"Nintendo\" as the entity to render by following the \"Publisher\" relation from \"Super Mario Land\".\n\nAdditionally, text quote [10] describes the process illustrated in Figure 1, where the model uses \"Super Mario Land\" to render the first three tokens and then selects \"Super Mario Land\" as the parent entity, \"Publication Date\" as the relation to render, and copies one of the tokens of the date entity as the token (\"1989\" in this case).\n\nCombining these insights, the model decides which entity to render by first identifying the parent entity and then selecting the appropriate relation to follow, using the hidden state vector and a projection matrix to determine the most relevant entity from the vocabulary, including aliases.\n\n![{The model selects \"Nintendo\" as the entity to render by following the \"Publisher\" relation from \""}

They show that the RetNRef model can indeed improve perplexity with label neighbors or the label itself. However, surprisingly there is almost no difference between using no retrieval, random labels, or our best retriever. The RetNRef++ model – that truncates the dialogue history and focuses more on the retrieval utterance – does even worse in terms of perplexity: 48.4 using the Memory Network retriever.\n- **[5]** Perplexity Dialogue is known to be notoriously hard to evaluate with automated metrics. In contrast to machine translation, there is much less constraint on the output with many valid answers with little word overlap, e.g., there are many answers to “what are you doing tonight?”.\n- **[8]** RetrieveNRef obtains statistically significant wins over the retriever Memory Network model and the generator Seq2Seq model using a binomial two-tailed test, with win rate ~54% breaking down the wins between when RetNRef exactly copies the retrieval utterance vs. generates we see that it chooses them about equally, with wins about equal in both cases. This shows it can effectively learn when to choose the retrieval utterance (when it is good), and when to ignore it and generate instead (when it is bad).\n\n**Image Evidence:**\n- **image2** shows the perplexity (PPL) results for different retrieval methods. The Memory Network retriever has a PPL of 31.8, which is lower than the Vanilla Seq2Seq (31.4) but higher than the true label (9.2).\n\n**Analysis:**\n- The text indicates that the Memory Network retriever has a perplexity of 31.8, which is slightly higher than the Vanilla Seq2Seq model (31.4) but significantly lower than the true label (9.2).\n- Image2 confirms this by showing the PPL values, where the Memory Network retriever has a PPL of 31.8, which is better than the Vanilla Seq2Seq but not as good as the true label.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe Memory Network retriever shows the best performance in terms of perplexity when used with a Seq2Seq model, as it has a lower perplexity score"}

These mechanisms include:\n\n1. **Base Excision Repair (BER)**: This pathway is depicted as the most frequent DNA repair pathway, particularly for single-strand point mutations affecting one or a few bases. It involves the recognition of a damaged base by a glycosylase enzyme, which removes the damaged base via hydrolysis of the N-glycosyl bond. This creates an abasic site, which is then processed by an endonuclease and ligase to restore the DNA strand.\n\n2. **Nucleotide Excision Repair (NER)**: This mechanism is highlighted for its ability to excise bulky DNA lesions, such as UV-induced pyrimidine dimers and other adducts. It involves the removal of the damaged segment and the synthesis of a new DNA strand to replace it.\n\n3. **Mismatch Repair (MMR)**: This system corrects mismatched or unpaired bases resulting from errors during DNA replication. It involves complex interactions of enzymes and proteins to identify and correct the mismatched bases, ensuring the fidelity of DNA replication.\n\n4. **Direct Reversal Repair**: This mechanism directly repairs specific types of damage, such as UV-induced pyrimidine dimers and alkylation adducts, without the need for incision or synthesis of new DNA. It uses enzymes like DNA photolyase for pyrimidine dimer repair.\n\n5. **Transcription-Coupled Repair (TCR)**: Although not explicitly mentioned in the text, TCR is implied to be part of the broader DNA repair pathways, focusing on repairing damage that occurs during transcription.\n\n6. **Recombination Repair**: This mechanism is crucial for repairing double-strand breaks, which can lead to significant genomic instability. It includes homologous recombination repair (HR) and non-homologous end-joining repair (NHEJ), with HR being more accurate and NHEJ being more prone to errors.\n\nThese mechanisms work collaboratively to detect and repair various types of DNA damage, ensuring the integrity and stability of the genome.\n\n![Cut-and-paste and copy-and-paste mechanisms of transposition](image1)  \n![Consequences of genomic imprinting defects](image2)  \n![DNA damage and repair pathways](image3)  \n![Karyotypes of genetic disorders](image4)  \n![Isochromosome formation](image5)  \n\nThese images collectively highlight the complexity and diversity of DNA repair mechanisms, emphasizing"}

The model first uses a **Problem Formulator** to translate the natural language description of the problem into a symbolic formulation, identifying key entities, facts, and rules. This stage is crucial for converting the problem into a format that can be processed by symbolic solvers. The text [2] and image5 provide a detailed breakdown of this process, showing how the model handles different types of logical reasoning problems by converting them into specific symbolic formulations like LP (Logic Programming), FOL (First-Order Logic), CSP (Constraint Satisfaction Problem), and SAT (Analytical Reasoning).\n\nNext, the **Symbolic Reasoner** performs inference on the symbolic formulation. This stage leverages deterministic symbolic solvers, such as logic programming engines or constraint optimization tools, to derive a symbolic-represented answer. The text [1] and image5 highlight the use of these solvers, emphasizing their role in ensuring logical faithfulness and transparency in the reasoning process.\n\nFinally, the **Result Interpreter** translates the symbolic answer back into natural language, providing a human-readable explanation. This ensures that the output is understandable and aligns with the original problem's context. The text [1] and image5 both underscore the importance of this step in making the model's reasoning accessible.\n\nThe model also incorporates a **self-refinement** module, which iteratively revises the symbolic formulation based on error messages from the symbolic solver, improving the accuracy of the parsing. This is particularly useful for handling complex grammatical structures in natural language, as noted in the text [10].\n\n**Image1** and **image4** provide a tabular summary of the datasets and their corresponding symbolic formulations, while **image5** visually represents the entire process, showing how each module interacts to solve a logical reasoning problem.\n\n![LOGIC-LM's three-stage process](image5)\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe LOGIC-LM model solves a problem by first formulating it into a symbolic representation, then using a symbolic solver to reason through the problem, and finally interpreting the result back into natural language, with iterative refinement to enhance accuracy. This approach combines the strengths of large language models and symbolic reasoning to achieve more faithful and transparent logical reasoning."}

This indicates a more controlled and possibly more complex setup for MedHop compared to WikiHop, where the number of candidates is not explicitly mentioned but can be inferred to be less due to the simpler query types and fewer documents per sample.\n  - [1] Few samples have less than 9 candidates, and samples would have far more false candidates if more than 64 support documents were included. This suggests that MedHop has a higher potential for false candidates due to the inclusion of more documents, which is managed by limiting the number of documents per sample.\n\n- **Document Statistics:**\n  - [7] The bipartite graph for MedHop is orders of magnitude more densely connected than for WikiHop. This can lead to potentially large support document sets, making it computationally infeasible for many existing RC models. MedHop requires subsampling documents to ensure computational feasibility, while WikiHop does not face this issue as much.\n  - [8] For MedHop, annotators verified the dataset quality by providing only the subset of documents relevant to support the correct answer. This indicates a more complex document structure in MedHop compared to WikiHop, where the document complexity and number of documents per sample are significantly larger.\n\n**Image Evidence:**\n- **Image 4** shows the statistics on the number of candidates and documents per sample. For MedHop, the average number of candidates is 8.9, and the average number of documents is 36.4, with a median of 9 candidates and 29 documents. In contrast, WikiHop has a higher average number of candidates (19.8) and documents (100.4), with a median of 14 candidates and 11 documents.

According to the text quotes and the provided tables, the CAUSALCoT method improves GPT-4's accuracy on the CL ADDER task from 62.03% to 70.40%, which is an 8.37% increase. This improvement is especially notable in the anti-common sense and nonsensical data subsets, where the original GPT-4 performs poorly. The approach also shows substantial gains in the accuracy by commonsense alignment degree, achieving 70.12% on the anti-common sense subset, which is a 9.65-point improvement over the original GPT-4. \n\nThe tables and images provide detailed insights into these improvements. **Image1** shows the overall accuracy and performance by rung, highlighting that CAUSALCoT achieves the highest performance across all rungs, with the best results on the anti-common sense subset. **Image2** breaks down the performance by steps, indicating that while CAUSALCoT excels in the initial step of extracting causal graphs, it struggles more in subsequent steps like estimation and arithmetic, which are critical for formal causal reasoning. This suggests that CAUSALCoT is particularly effective in improving the model's ability to handle unseen data and complex reasoning tasks.\n\nThe fine-grained error analysis in **Image2** reveals that CAUSALCoT's performance is strong in the first step but declines in later steps, indicating areas for future improvement. **Image3** provides dataset statistics, showing that the dataset is designed to challenge models with varying complexities, which helps in evaluating the model's robustness. **Image4** and **Image5** illustrate the evaluation framework used, focusing on semantic consistency, logicality, and factuality, which are crucial for assessing the interpretability of the model's outputs.\n\nIn summary, the CAUSALCoT approach substantially improves GPT-4's performance on causal reasoning tasks, especially on unseen data, by enhancing its ability to handle complex and formal reasoning, as evidenced by the significant accuracy improvements and detailed step-by-step analysis.\n\n![CAUSALCoT improves GPT-4 performance by 8.37% on CL ADDER](image1)  \n![CAUSALCoT excels in initial steps but struggles in later reasoning steps](image2)  \n![Dataset complexity and evaluation framework](image3"}

According to the text quote [1], the hierarchical CRF model consists of a character-level neural network, either an RNN or a CNN, that allows the model to capture subword information such as morphological variations and capitalization patterns. This is crucial for handling the nuances of language that go beyond the boundaries of individual words, such as prefixes, suffixes, and capitalization, which can significantly impact the meaning and context of a word. \n\nAdditionally, the word-level neural network, usually an RNN, consumes word representations and produces context-sensitive hidden representations for each word. This helps in understanding the context and dependencies between words within a sentence. The combination of these two types of embeddings allows the model to leverage the strengths of both subword-level and word-level information. \n\nThe text quote [5] further elaborates on this by explaining that the model first produces a representation for each word by concatenating its character representation with its word embedding. This integration ensures that the model can handle morphological variations and capitalization patterns at the subword level while also considering the contextual dependencies within each sentence at the word level. \n\n![Model Architecture](image5) illustrates this architecture, showing how character-level and word-level embeddings are combined and processed through Bi-LSTMs before being fed into a CRF layer for dependency modeling.\n\nIn summary, using both word-level and character-level embeddings enables the model to capture both the fine-grained details of subword units and the broader context of words, leading to more accurate and contextually rich representations.\n\nThe answer is: The model uses both word-level and character-level embeddings to capture subword information and context-sensitive word representations, allowing it to handle morphological variations, capitalization patterns, and contextual dependencies effectively."}

In object detection datasets, our methodology for extracting image embeddings \\(e_{\\mathrm{img}}\\) is slightly different from the approach discussed previously. As presented in Fig. 3, we apply two additional pre-processing steps: cropping and blurring. Some previous works have proposed similar methods in CLIP like [33, 53]. In the object detection dataset, an image typically contains multiple objects of varying sizes. Some objects may dominate a large portion of the image, whereas others occupy minimal space. Accordingly, our object detection procedure begins with cropping the image regions based on proposal bounding box coordinates, subsequently resizing the cropped region to a fixed proportion. Moreover, unlike image classification tasks the objects of interest generally appear large and centrally positioned, the objects within object detection datasets are smaller and their positions more varied. To help the MLLMs understand the objects to be detected, we employ a blurring technique on the non-target areas surrounding the objects of interest. The blurring strategy is designed to direct the MLLMs’ focus toward the relevant objects, thereby facilitating their identification in object detection tasks.\"\n- **Image Quote [image2]**: This image illustrates the pre-processing steps, including cropping and blurring, applied to different bounding boxes in an image.\n\n### Answer Construction:\nThe pre-processing step in the zero-shot recognition system is crucial for enhancing the model's ability to detect and recognize objects accurately.

These steps are specifically designed to handle the variability in object sizes and positions within an image, which is common in object detection datasets. \n\n**Cropping** involves selecting regions of interest based on bounding box coordinates, ensuring that the model focuses on the relevant areas. This is particularly important because objects of interest in object detection tasks are often smaller and located at varying positions compared to image classification tasks. By cropping, the system isolates the objects, making it easier for the model to process and recognize them.\n\n**Blurring** is applied to the non-target areas surrounding the objects of interest. This technique directs the model's attention to the relevant objects by reducing distractions from the background or other non-relevant elements.

Table 1 gives concrete examples: for the Named Entity Recognition (NER) task (Sang and De Meulder, 2003; Nadeau and Sekine, 2007), most tokens are backgrounds with tagging class O. Specifically, the number of tokens with tagging class O is 5 times as many as those with entity labels for the CoNLL03 dataset and 8 times for the OntoNotes5.0 dataset; Data-imbalanced issue is more severe for MRC tasks (Rajpurkar et al., 2016; Nguyen et al., 2016; Rajpurkar et al., 2018; Kocisk y et al., 2018; Dasigi et al., 2019) with the value of negative-positive ratio being 50-200, which is due to the reason that the task of MRC is usually formalized as predicting the starting and ending indexes conditioned on the query and the context, and given a chunk of text of an arbitrary length, only two tokens are positive (or of interest) with all the rest being background.\n\n**Image Quote:**\n- image2 is ![QUOREF dataset ratio](image2)\n\n**Answer Construction:**\nThe QUOREF dataset has a negative to positive ratio of 169, as shown in image2. This is significantly higher than the ratios observed in other datasets listed in the table. For instance, the CoNLL03 NER dataset has a ratio of 4.98, OntoNotes5.0 NER has a ratio of 8.18, and the SQuAD 1.1 dataset has a ratio of 55.9. The QUOREF dataset's ratio of 169 indicates a much more severe imbalance, where there are 169 times more negative instances than positive ones. This extreme imbalance is typical for machine reading comprehension (MRC) tasks, where only a small number of tokens are positive (or of interest) within a larger context.\n\n```markdown\n![QUOREF dataset ratio](image2"}

According to the text quotes, removing the abstract from the input to SPECTER results in a substantial decrease in performance, as noted in quote [4]. This suggests that the abstract is a crucial feature for the model's ability to capture document-level relatedness. Conversely, adding authors as an input, along with the title and abstract, surprisingly hurts performance, as mentioned in quote [10]. One possible explanation for this behavior is that author names are sparse in the corpus, making it difficult for the model to infer document-level relatedness from them. Additionally, tokenization using Wordpieces might be suboptimal for author names, leading to noisy correlations. Adding venues slightly decreases performance, except on document classification, where venues are expected to have high correlation, as stated in quote [10].\n\nThe ablation study in quote [10] and image4 provide empirical evidence of these effects. Image4 shows that when the abstract is removed, the average performance drops to 68.1, indicating the importance of the abstract. Adding venues improves performance slightly on document classification but decreases it in other tasks, as seen in the comparison of different configurations. The inclusion of hard negatives, as shown in image4, also significantly boosts performance, with the model achieving an average of 80.0 when using hard negatives compared to 77.5 without them.\n\nFurthermore, using a general-domain language model like BERT-Large instead of SciBERT, which is pretrained on scientific text, reduces performance considerably, as noted in quote [2]. This highlights the importance of domain-specific pretraining for scientific text.\n\nIn summary, the SPECTER model benefits from the inclusion of the abstract and hard negatives, while the addition of authors and venues can negatively impact performance, depending on the task.\n\n```markdown\n![Ablation Study Impact on SPECTER Performance](image4)\n\nThe inclusion of the abstract and hard negatives significantly improves the SPECTER model's performance across various tasks, while adding authors and venues can decrease performance, especially in tasks other than document classification.\n```\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe inclusion of the abstract and hard negatives enhances the SPECTER model's performance, while adding authors and venues can negatively impact it, depending on the specific task."}

The key findings are as follows:\n\n1. **Original BERT Performance**: The original BERT model achieves a peak test performance of 77% (Table 3), which is surprising given that it is only three points below the average untrained human baseline. This high performance is attributed to the exploitation of spurious statistical cues in the dataset, as detailed in the text quotes [1], [2], and [6].\n\n2. **Impact of Warrants (W)**: When considering only warrants (W), BERT's performance drops to 71% (Table 3), indicating that warrants alone account for 6 percentage points of the original 77% performance. This suggests that warrants are a significant factor in BERT's high performance.\n\n3. **Impact of Reasons (R) and Claims (C)**: Adding reasons (R) and claims (C) to warrants (W) further reduces BERT's performance to 53% (Table 4). The performance is 50% on both the mean and median, with a maximum of 53%. This indicates that the inclusion of reasons and claims diminishes BERT's ability to exploit spurious cues, as shown in the text quotes [3], [7], and [9].\n\n4. **Adversarial Dataset Performance**: On the adversarial dataset, BERT's performance is significantly reduced to 50% (Table 4). This result confirms that the adversarial dataset successfully eliminates the spurious statistical cues, providing a more robust evaluation of argument comprehension. The text quotes [3], [7], and [9] highlight this finding, emphasizing that BERT's performance on the adversarial dataset is random, indicating it has learned nothing about argument comprehension.\n\n5. **Comparison with Baselines**: The table also shows that BoV and BiLSTM models perform consistently lower than BERT, with their best performances being around 55-60% (Table 3).

This alignment is crucial for the proper segregation of chromosomes during the subsequent division.\n\n2. **Spindle Attachment**: The spindle fibers from the centrosomes attach to the kinetochores of the sister chromatids. This ensures that each homologous pair is correctly positioned and ready for separation.\n\n3. **Tetrads Formation**: Homologous chromosomes pair up to form tetrads, each consisting of four chromatids. This pairing is essential for genetic recombination through crossing over, which occurs during prophase I.\n\n4. **Metaphase Plate**: The metaphase plate is the central plane where the homologous chromosomes align. This ensures that each daughter cell will receive one chromosome from each homologous pair.\n\n5. **Centromere Positioning**: The centromeres of the chromosomes are aligned along the metaphase plate, preparing for the separation of sister chromatids in anaphase I.\n\n![Metaphase I](image5)\n\n![Tetrad Formation](image1)\n\n![Meiosis I Stages](image2)\n\nThese processes ensure the accurate distribution of genetic material into the two daughter cells, reducing the chromosome number by half.\n\n### Evidence from Quotes\n\n- **[4]**: \"During meiosis I, homologous chromosomes separate. The chromosome number is reduced by half.\"\n- **[5]**: \"Meiosis is a process that converts diploid nuclei to haploid nuclei.\"\n- **[10]**: \"To prepare for division, the chromatin becomes highly compact, and the chromosomes are visible with a microscope. Early in the division process, chromosomes duplicate. Each chromosome appears as two sister chromatids, containing identical DNA molecules.\"\n\n### Conclusion\n\nDuring Metaphase I of meiosis, homologous chromosomes align at the metaphase plate, and spindle fibers attach to the kinetochores, preparing for their separation in anaphase I. This stage is critical for genetic recombination and the accurate distribution of chromosomes."}

This allows the genetic material to become less visible under a microscope.\n- **Nuclear Membrane Reformation**: The nuclear envelope reassembles around the separated chromosomes, forming two distinct nuclei. This is indicated by the text quote [1], which states, \"Cytokinesis often overlaps telophase.\"\n- **Cytokinesis Begins**: The cell starts to physically divide, with the plasma membrane growing inward at the midpoint to form a cleavage furrow in animal cells or a cell plate in plant cells. This is described in quote [2], which mentions, \"The plasma membrane grows inward at the midpoint to divide the cells.\"\n\n**Cytokinesis** is the process of cytoplasmic division and is crucial for the final separation of the cell into two distinct entities:\n- **Cytoplasm Division**: The cytoplasm divides, ensuring that each daughter cell receives a complete set of organelles and other cellular components. This is part of the steps outlined in quote [4], which states, \"Occurs in prokaryotic cells - Two identical cells arise from one cell - Steps in the process: Mitotic phase: division of the nucleus Cytokinesis: division of cytoplasm.\"\n- **Formation of the Cleavage Furrow**: In animal cells, the cleavage furrow pinches the cell into two, as depicted in image1 and image2, which show the progression of cytokinesis.

Mendel's experiments with pea plants demonstrated that traits are inherited as discrete units, now known as genes, which are located at specific positions on chromosomes called gene loci [3]. In the F1 generation, all plants exhibit the dominant phenotype, as seen in image4, where all F1 plants are purple (PP) due to the presence of two dominant alleles. This is because the F1 generation results from a cross between true-breeding parents, one with the genotype PP (purple flowers) and the other with pp (white flowers), producing offspring with the genotype Pp [5].\n\nIn the F2 generation, the F1 plants (Pp) self-pollinate, leading to a 3:1 phenotypic ratio of purple to white flowers, as shown in image4. This ratio arises from the segregation of alleles during gamete formation and fertilization. Each F1 plant produces gametes with a 50% chance of carrying the dominant allele (P) and a 50% chance of carrying the recessive allele (p). When these gam"}

The F1 generation, which is heterozygous (Pp), produces gametes that are either P or p. When these gametes combine, the F2 generation can have three possible genotypes: PP, Pp, and pp. \n\n- **Genotypic Ratio**: The genotypic ratio in the F2 generation is 1 PP : 2 Pp : 1 pp. This is derived from the Punnett square, which shows that there is a 25% chance of each genotype occurring.\n- **Phenotypic Ratio**: The phenotypic ratio is 3 purple flowers : 1 white flower.

This new legislation, as detailed in the provided image, replaced the previous Libel and Defamation Act of 2020. The new law, § 18, outlines specific provisions that define the conditions under which defamation can be prosecuted. It states that unless a publication is made with malice, it is not subject to the provisions of this section, thereby providing a safeguard for publications made in good faith. The law also includes provisions to protect the publication of any matter prohibited by law, limit or abridge any privilege subsisting before the commencement of this Act, and protect the publication of blasphemous or obscene material under certain conditions. \n\nThe law emphasizes that the publication must be for the public benefit and not for personal gain. Additionally, it introduces a qualified privilege defense, which allows for a defense if the plaintiff has requested the publication at the defendant's expense and in a reasonable manner, or if the defendant has refused or neglected to do so in a manner not adequate to the circumstances.

All the countries reviewed are parties to the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees and its 1967 Protocol, except for India and Saudi Arabia. In all the other surveyed jurisdictions, these issues are governed by national laws and executive regulations issued by authorities in charge of resolving migration-related issues. Most of the countries included in this survey require an applicant’s physical presence at the border or within the country’s territory. In some countries (Argentina, Mexico, Russia, South Africa, and Turkey), a time limit for the period when an application can be submitted is in place. Canada and Mexico each accept asylum applications from outside of the country. Canada processes such applications as a part of its visa application process, while Mexico allows submitting a petition from outside of the country for political asylum only. Brazil, as a party to the Convention on Diplomatic Asylum of the Organization of American States, allows applicants to request diplomatic asylum in Brazilian embassies abroad. Australia and Canada allow humanitarian protection and refugee status requests from abroad when protection is sought through a resettlement program administered by the United Nations, another designated referral agency, or by private sponsorship. In Russia, current legislation enables consular offices abroad to review applications and grant temporary protection status that allows entry to the country; however, this provision is excluded from a recently introduced bill.\n[5] Argentina • Australia • Brazil • Canada • China  Germany • India • Italy • Japan • Mexico   $\\bullet$   Russia  Saudi Arabia • South Africa   $\\bullet$   South Korea  Turkey   $\\bullet$   United Kingdom\n[6] February 2023\n[7] This report is provided for reference purposes only.

This involves using geo-referenced items and SPARQL queries to visualize data on maps. The module emphasizes foundational skills in map-making, such as understanding how to reference geographic data and manipulate it through SPARQL queries. This is illustrated in `image1`, which shows a map with clustered orange markers, representing a basic flat map, and `image4`, which highlights the variety of basic flat and layered maps created using geo-referenced data.\n\n- **Module 2: Intermediate**  \n  The focus shifts to embedding these maps within Wikimedia projects like Wikipedia and Wikimedia Commons. This module teaches how to integrate Wikidata-driven maps into existing platforms, enhancing their accessibility and utility within the Wikimedia ecosystem. `image2` and `image3` provide visual examples of embedding maps, showing how they can be displayed on Wikimedia Commons and integrated into a Jupyter notebook, respectively.\n\n- **Module 3: Advanced**  \n  The final module is about creating interactive, layered Wikidata-driven maps that can be used off-Wiki. This involves advanced techniques in Python and Jupyter notebooks to build dynamic maps that can be used outside of Wikimedia platforms. `image5` exemplifies the advanced capabilities, showing a detailed map with various colored markers, indicating interactive and layered features.\n\nThe structured progression from basic to advanced objectives ensures a comprehensive understanding of map-making with Wikidata, from initial creation to advanced embedding and interactivity.\n\n![Learning objectives](image2)  \n![Learning objectives](image3)  \n![Learning objectives](image5)  \n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe learning objectives for creating and embedding maps using Wikidata are structured across three modules: basic, intermediate, and advanced.

However, the focus on the wrong metrics, like reach over engagement, and drowning in data that is not insightful, are cited as issues. **Image5** shows that 52% of respondents attribute activity to the most recent touchpoint, which may not provide a comprehensive view of customer behavior.\n\n5. **Cultural and Organizational Barriers**: The text and **image1** also highlight cultural and organizational barriers, such as a lack of clear roles and responsibilities, and a misalignment between business lines and product/brand goals.\n\n6. **Attribution Methods**: The reliance on outdated attribution methods, like first-click or last-click attribution, is another barrier. **Image5** indicates that 52% of respondents attribute activity to the most recent touchpoint, which can skew insights and prevent a holistic understanding of customer journeys.\n\n7. **Customer-Centric Focus**: While 44% of respondents focus on customers, **image2** shows that a significant portion (35%) still focus on product or brand, indicating a shift is needed towards a more customer-centric approach.\n\n8. **Complexity and Misalignment**: The complexity of marketing metrics and the need for a 360-degree view are also barriers. **Image2** shows a preference for a customer-focused approach, but"}

The utility starts at +10 for the first hot dog, decreases to +4 for the second, and reaches 0 for the third. Beyond the third hot dog, the utility becomes negative, with -1 for the fourth, -4 for the fifth, and -10 for the sixth. This pattern illustrates the concept of diminishing marginal utility, where each additional unit of consumption provides less satisfaction than the previous one. \n\n![image4](image4) \n\nThis implies that consumption behavior is not linear; individuals may initially enjoy the activity (in this case, eating hot dogs) but eventually reach a point of diminishing returns, where further consumption leads to negative utility. This can be seen in the context of the image, where excessive consumption leads to a decrease in enjoyment and potential negative consequences, such as discomfort or regret. \n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe utility decreases with each additional hot dog consumed, indicating diminishing marginal utility and suggesting that consumption should be balanced to avoid negative outcomes."}

This process occurs during **Prophase I**, **Metaphase I**, **Anaphase I**, and **Telophase I**. During **Anaphase I**, homologous chromosomes are pulled to opposite poles of the cell, as depicted in **image1** and **image3**. This separation is crucial because it ensures that each daughter cell receives one chromosome from each homologous pair, halving the chromosome number from diploid to haploid. **Image1** shows the alignment of homologous chromosomes at the metaphase plate and their subsequent separation, while **image3** illustrates the cleavage furrow formation leading to the formation of haploid daughter cells.\n\n**Meiosis II**, on the other hand, is similar to mitosis and involves the separation of sister chromatids. This occurs during **Prophase II**, **Metaphase II**, **Anaphase II**, and **Telophase II**. During **Anaphase II**, sister chromatids are pulled to opposite poles, as shown in **image4**. This ensures that each of the two resulting cells from meiosis I receives a complete set of chromosomes, but with only one copy of each chromosome, maintaining the haploid state. **Image4** highlights the separation of sister chromatids, leading to the formation of four haploid cells.\n\n**Image2** provides a visual representation of the entire meiosis process, showing the progression from a diploid cell through meiosis I and II to four haploid cells. The images collectively demonstrate how meiosis I focuses on the separation of homologous chromosomes, while meiosis II focuses on the separation of sister chromatids, resulting in the production of four genetically diverse haploid cells.\n\nIn summary, meiosis I reduces the chromosome number by separating homologous chromosomes, while meiosis II separates sister chromatids, ensuring the production of four haploid cells with half the original chromosome number.\n\n![Meiosis I: Homologous chromosomes separate](image1)  \n![Meiosis II: Sister chromatids separate](image3)  \n![Meiosis process](image2)  \n![Meiosis II: Sister chromatids separate](image4)  \n\nMeiosis I separates homologous chromosomes, reducing the chromosome number by half"}

This is usually sufficient for most pours.\n- [6] Thicker plywood maybe used when the weight of concrete causes a standard thickness plywood to bow out, distorting the concrete face.\n- [8] This is by far the most common material used for the facing panel. It is easily cut to shape onsite, and if handled and stored carefully, it can be used many times.\n- [10] However, if the formwork is curved, a thinner plywood is used to facilitate bending.\n\n**Image Evidence:**\n- **Image1** shows a traditional timber formwork setup, which typically uses plywood sheets. The thickness of the plywood used in such setups can vary based on the specific requirements of the pour.\n- **Image2** depicts a formwork setup with red panels, which might indicate a different type of sheathing material, possibly metal or engineered wood, but the focus here is on the formwork structure rather than the sheathing thickness.\n- **Image3** provides specifications for sheathing, indicating that 25mm to 40mm thickness is common for slabs, beams, column sides, and beam bottoms. This suggests that 25mm is a standard thickness for such applications.\n- **Image4** and **Image5** show metal formwork systems, which are not directly related to the question about timber formwork.\n\n**Analysis:**\n- The text indicates that 18mm is a standard thickness for plywood, but thicker plywood (25mm or more) is used when necessary to prevent bowing under the weight of concrete.\n- Image3 supports this by specifying that 25mm to 40mm is the standard range for sheathing in timber formwork applications.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the evidence, 25mm sheathing is more appropriate for timber formwork as it is a standard thickness that can handle the weight of concrete without bowing, ensuring a smooth finish and structural integrity.\n\n![25mm Sheeting is appropriate for timber formwork]()\n\n25mm sheathing is an appropriate size for timber formwork as it is a standard thickness that can handle the weight of concrete without bowing, ensuring a smooth finish and structural integrity."}

It begins with the duplication of the single circular chromosome, ensuring that each new cell will have an identical set of genetic material. The cell then elongates, allowing the separated chromosomal copies to move apart. Finally, the plasma membrane invaginates and pinches the cell in two, creating two genetically identical daughter cells. This process is depicted in the image, showing the step-by-step division of the cell."}

In standard consumption, diminishing marginal utility suggests that as one consumes more of a good, the additional satisfaction (utility) gained from each additional unit decreases. This is evident in Image4, where the utility from each hot dog consumed decreases from +10 to -10 as the number of hot dogs increases. This pattern reflects the natural human tendency to derive less satisfaction from repeated consumption of the same item.\n\nIn competitive contexts, however, as seen in Image5, the utility from each hot dog can increase, especially when the activity is framed as a competition. The table shows that while the utility from each hot dog decreases in a standard consumption scenario, in a competitive setting, the utility can become positive even for higher quantities. For example, Joey Chestnut's consumption of 64 hot dogs yields a utility of +5000, and 65 yields +10000, indicating that the competitive environment can enhance the perceived value and satisfaction derived from the activity. This is because competition introduces elements of mastery, achievement, and social recognition, which can override the natural diminishing returns of repeated consumption.\n\n**Quote Citation:**\n\n- **Quote [3]:** \"Variety is important because diminishing marginal utility changes preferences.

These processes ensure that the project team understands and incorporates stakeholder requirements effectively, leading to a solution that meets their expectations. \n\n**Needs Exploration** involves identifying and defining the requirements and constraints of the project. This stage is critical for understanding the scope and goals of the project, ensuring that the team is aligned with stakeholder expectations. It includes activities like high-level requirements specification, detailed requirements specification, and acceptance test-driven development (ATDD), which help in creating a clear and actionable plan.\n\n**Elicitation Methods**, on the other hand, are the techniques used to gather these requirements from stakeholders. The image shows various methods such as Just-in-time (JIT) model storming, look-ahead modeling, and all-hands demos. These methods are particularly useful in distributed environments, where stakeholders may be geographically dispersed. For instance, **JIT model storming** allows for real-time collaboration and feedback, while **all-hands demos** provide opportunities for stakeholders to see progress and provide input.\n\nTogether, these processes ensure that stakeholder needs are captured accurately and addressed throughout the project lifecycle, leading to a more successful and stakeholder-satisfying outcome.\n\n![Needs Exploration and Elicitation Methods](image1)  \n![Elicitation Methods](image2)\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe combination of Needs Exploration and Elicitation Methods ensures that stakeholder needs are thoroughly understood and integrated into the agile project, facilitating a more effective and collaborative development process."}

This image also provides a visual representation of the lead funnel progression, highlighting the significant drop from MQL to SAL.\n\n#### Answer Construction\n\nThe conversion rate from Marketing Qualified Leads (MQL) to Sales Accepted Leads (SAL) is 1.50%, as depicted in the lead funnel progression in image4. This low conversion rate indicates that only a small fraction of MQLs are progressing to SALs. In contrast, the conversion rate from Sales Accepted Leads (SAL) to Sales Qualified Leads (SQL) is 83.08%, as shown in the same image. This high conversion rate suggests that once leads are accepted by sales, they are more likely to be qualified further.\n\n**Implications:**\n- The low MQL to SAL conversion rate (1.50%) implies that there is a significant drop-off in the sales pipeline, indicating potential issues in lead nurturing, communication, or alignment between marketing and sales teams. This could be due to ineffective lead scoring, poor lead quality, or inadequate follow-up processes.\n- The high SAL to SQL conversion rate (83.08%) suggests that once leads are accepted by sales, they are well-qualified and ready for further engagement, highlighting the effectiveness of the sales team in qualifying leads.\n- The overall funnel progression in image4 shows that while a large number of leads are generated (19,503), only a small percentage ("}
