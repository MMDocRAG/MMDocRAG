For instance, when using adversarial distractors, the model's accuracy on the original distractors improves from 40.73 F1 to 58.42 F1, as shown in Table 4 [10]. This indicates that adversarial training helps the model generalize better. However, when entity type filtering is applied, the accuracy drops to 40.73 F1, suggesting that entity type bias can hinder performance [1]. \n\nIn single-hop tasks, the model achieves a high F1 score of 67.08 on original distractors but declines to 46.84 when using adversarial distractors [4]. Retraining on adversarial distractors recovers the score to 60.10 F1, highlighting the importance of robust training data [4]. Image 2 provides a comparison of various models, showing that single-paragraph BERT achieves 67.08 F1 on distractors, while BiDAF and GRN models perform lower, emphasizing the effectiveness of BERT in single-hop tasks.\n\nImage 6 illustrates the model's outputs, where the lowest confidence is shown for empty answers, indicating challenges in distinguishing between relevant and irrelevant information. Image 7 shows that adding gold paragraphs improves F1 scores from 39.12 to 53.12 in open-domain settings, demonstrating the critical role of relevant evidence [8]. Image 8 further confirms that adversarial training enhances performance, especially when combined with entity type filtering, achieving 58.42 F1 [10].\n\nIn summary, adversarial training and careful distractor selection are crucial for improving F1 scores, while entity type bias and insufficient evidence retrieval can negatively impact performance.

Initially, BERT achieved a peak performance of 77%, which was just three points below the average untrained human baseline. However, this result was attributed to exploiting spurious statistical cues in the dataset. By constructing an adversarial dataset that eliminates these cues, the performance of BERT dropped dramatically. Specifically, when models were trained and evaluated on the adversarial dataset, BERT's peak performance reduced to 53%, with mean and median accuracy at 50%. This reduction indicates that the adversarial dataset effectively removes the exploitable cues, providing a more robust evaluation of argument comprehension. The results suggest that BERT has not truly learned argument comprehension but rather relies on statistical patterns. The adversarial dataset should be adopted as the standard for future work to ensure evaluations reflect genuine understanding rather than exploitation of dataset biases.\n\n![BERT's performance on the adversarial test set](image3) shows that BERT's mean accuracy drops to 50.4%, confirming the elimination of cues. This aligns with the conclusion that BERT's performance was not indicative of comprehension but rather exploitation of dataset patterns.\n\nConclusion: The adversarial dataset eliminates spurious cues, reducing BERT's performance to random levels, demonstrating that BERT does not truly comprehend arguments."}

In 2018, the provision was $3,562 million, which increased to $3,742 million in 2019, and further rose to $4,973 million in 2020. This upward trend is evident in the image3 table, which shows the total provision for income taxes increasing each year. The deferred income tax assets and liabilities also contribute to this trend. As seen in image8, the total deferred income tax assets increased from $3,015 million in 2019 to $3,561 million in 2020, while the total deferred income tax liabilities rose from $2,993 million in 2019 to $3,367 million in 2020. The increase in deferred income tax assets and liabilities suggests that the company has more tax benefits and obligations recognized over time, which impacts the overall provision for income taxes. The deferred income tax assets include items like U.S. federal and state net operating loss carryforwards and non-U.S. tax loss carryforwards, which have indefinite carryforward periods, as noted in text quote [8]. These carryforwards can be realized in future periods, influencing the current provisions. The image5 table further illustrates the changes in unrecognized tax benefits, showing an increase from $1,056 million in 2018 to $1,423 million in 2019 and $1,829 million in 2020, indicating potential future tax benefits that are not yet realized.

Concurrently, the total debt also increased from $21,517 million in 2019 to $21,193 million in 2020, as depicted in image7. The decrease in total debt despite the rise in liabilities is attributed to the reclassification of certain borrowings as long-term debt, supported by the availability under the Five-Year Facility, as mentioned in text quote [2]. This facility allowed the company to refinance short-term obligations into long-term debt, thereby reducing the total current liabilities and adjusting the overall debt structure.

However, adjusted revenue from Global Markets increased significantly from $5,728 million in 2019 to $7,290 million in 2020, marking a $1,562 million or 27% rise. This growth was driven by higher volatility and increased client activity, particularly in Foreign Exchange and Credit, as well as strong performance in Rates due to increased trading in government bonds. The improved FICC (Fixed Income, Currency, and Commodities) performance, especially in Foreign Exchange and Credit, contributed significantly to the revenue increase. Additionally, the reallocation of financial and non-financial resources and adaptations in the risk appetite statement helped support customers and strategic goals during the pandemic.

This stability indicates a controlled and unchanged ownership structure within the Tata group.\n\nFor public shareholders, image8 provides a detailed breakdown. Institutions, which include mutual funds, financial institutions, and venture capital funds, saw a slight increase in their shareholding from 2.5% to 2.6% of the total shares. Mutual funds and financial institutions specifically increased their holdings, while other categories like foreign institutional investors and qualified foreign investors also saw minor changes. Individual shareholders holding nominal capital up to ₹1 lakh saw a slight decrease in their shareholding from 15.7% to 15.7%, indicating a stable but slightly reduced presence. Overall, the public shareholding structure remained largely stable with minor fluctuations among different institutional categories.\n\nIn summary, the Tata group maintained a consistent shareholding structure, while public shareholders experienced minor adjustments, primarily among institutional investors. This stability in ownership reflects a controlled environment within the Tata group and a slight shift in public investment focus among institutional categories.\n\n![Shareholding Stability](image4) ![Public Shareholding Changes](image8)"}

According to the provided text quotes and images, the defined benefit obligation decreased by €191 million in 2021 compared to 2020, as shown in image1. This reduction was primarily due to changes in demographic and financial assumptions, as detailed in image4. Specifically, changes in financial assumptions led to a decrease of €26 million, while changes in demographic assumptions resulted in an 8 million decrease. Image7 further illustrates the effect of a 0.5 percentage-point change in assumptions, showing that a decrease in the discount rate had a substantial impact, reducing the obligation by €242 million. Conversely, compensation increases and pension progression had a positive effect, increasing the obligation by €16 million and €158 million, respectively. \n\nRegarding plan assets, image6 shows that the total plan assets increased from €2,813 million in 2020 to €3,259 million in 2021. This growth was driven by various investments, including corporate bonds and alternative investments, as detailed in image6. The increase in assets partially offset the decrease in the defined benefit obligation, contributing to a net defined benefit balance of €993 million in 2021, down from €1,002 million in 2020. The sensitivity analysis in image7 also highlights that a 0.5 percentage-point increase in the discount rate would have increased the obligation by €271 million, emphasizing the sensitivity of the obligation to discount rate changes.\n\nIn summary, while the defined benefit obligation decreased due to changes in assumptions, the increase in plan assets helped mitigate this impact, resulting in a net decrease in the defined benefit balance. The sensitivity analysis underscores the significant influence of discount rates and other assumptions on the financial outcomes.\n\n![Changes in defined benefit obligation and plan assets due to actuarial assumptions](image1) ![Sensitivity analysis of actuarial assumptions](image7)"}

According to the provided text quotes and images, the RWA decreased under the Advanced Approach in 2020 due to a decline in litigation-related losses [1]. Additionally, credit risk RWA increased primarily due to higher Derivatives exposures and Investment securities [12], while market risk RWA increased due to higher market volatility [8]. These changes in RWA components influenced the TLAC requirements.\n\nImage7 shows the External TLAC as a percentage of RWA, which decreased from 49.9% in 2019 to 47.7% in 2020. This reduction is attributed to the decrease in RWA, despite the increase in TLAC requirements. The image also indicates that the TLAC as a percentage of leverage exposure increased from 17.0% to 18.1%, reflecting the firm's efforts to maintain or increase its loss-absorbing capacity relative to its leverage exposure.\n\nIn summary, the decrease in RWA due to reduced litigation losses and increased TLAC requirements led to a slight decrease in TLAC as a percentage of RWA, while TLAC as a percentage of leverage exposure increased.

Image6 highlights that 65% of third or higher generation Hispanics do not identify as non-Hispanic, compared to 96% of self-identified non-Hispanics. This trend suggests that as generations progress, the connection to Hispanic heritage weakens, with fewer individuals maintaining strong identification with their ancestral roots. Additionally, image8 shows that third or higher generation Hispanics are less likely to speak Spanish (7%) and have a Spanish last name (7%), further indicating a diminishing cultural link. The data collectively indicate a fading Hispanic identity across generations, with non-Hispanics more likely to identify as such, as seen in image10 where 59% of self-identified non-Hispanics are seen as white.

[6] notes that blacks share concerns with Asians and Hispanics about fair treatment, particularly in promotions. Image1 visually supports these statistics, showing that 62% of blacks in STEM have experienced discrimination, compared to 13% of whites. Additionally, [8] indicates that blacks (40%) and Asians (31%) are more likely than whites (5%) to feel their race has made success harder. Image5 further illustrates that men and women in STEM value different aspects, with women valuing respect and helping others more, while men value high-paying jobs and opportunities for promotion more. This highlights differing perceptions and experiences within STEM jobs.\n\n![Blacks in STEM experience higher discrimination rates and lower perceptions of fairness compared to whites](image1)\n\nConclusion: Blacks in STEM jobs face significantly higher discrimination and lower perceptions of fairness compared to whites, with notable disparities in hiring and promotion processes."}

Here's an interleaved explanation with relevant text and images:\n\n**Text Evidence**:\n- **Multimodal Retriever**: The retriever is responsible for querying a large multi-modal external memory or database to find information relevant to the input query or context. It creates and stores multimodal embeddings for visual images and text descriptions (Text Quote [9], Image Quote [image1](a)).\n- **Retrieving & Ranking**: After retrieving the top-k categories most similar to the input image, the MLLMs rank these candidate results to make the final prediction (Text Quote [2], Image Quote [image1](b)).\n- **Pre-processing for Detection Datasets**: In object detection tasks, the pipeline includes cropping and blurring to focus MLLMs on relevant objects (Text Quote [4], Image Quote [image3](a)).\n- **Ranking Prompt**: The prompt merges the input image with retrieved category information and guides MLLMs to rank candidates based on similarity (Text Quote [5], Image Quote [image6]).\n\n**Image Evidence**:\n- **Image1**: Illustrates the multimodal retriever and retrieving & ranking process.

However, when re-trained on these adversarial distractors, the model's accuracy recovers to 60.10 F1, indicating that while adversarial training initially reduces performance, retraining can restore it to a similar level as the original setup.\n\n- **Type Filtering**: When the model is trained on adversarial distractors and then evaluated on adversarial distractors filtered by entity type, the accuracy drops significantly to 40.73 F1. However, re-training on these filtered distractors leads to a recovery in accuracy to 58.42 F1. This suggests that adversarial training can mitigate the impact of entity type bias but requires re-training to fully recover performance.\n\n- **Open-domain Challenges**: In the open-domain setting, the model struggles with retrieving relevant paragraphs. For example, using 500 open-domain paragraphs results in a low F1 score of 39.12, but adding two gold paragraphs improves the score to 53.12 F1. This highlights the challenge of retrieval methods in multi-hop questions and the need for better retrieval techniques.\n\n- **Comparison with Single-hop Performance**: The model achieves near chance accuracy on comparison questions, as shown in Table 3, indicating that many questions are solvable with single-hop reasoning. Adversarial training does not significantly improve this, as seen in the F1 scores for multi-hop questions in image1, which are lower than single-hop questions.\n\n- **Algorithm for Question Operations**: Image5 provides a categorization algorithm for question operations, which helps in understanding the types of reasoning required. However, adversarial training does not address the inherent difficulty of these operations, as evidenced by the model's performance on logical and numerical questions.\n\nIn summary, adversarial training can mitigate some biases and improve model robustness, but it does not fully address the challenges of multi-hop reasoning or the limitations of retrieval methods in open-domain settings.

For instance, the text mentions that phrases like \"not really good\" and \"really not good\" convey different sentiments based on word order, which LSTMs can capture through their recurrent structure. Image3 provides an example of how word order affects sentiment, highlighting the contrast between a negative and positive review. Image4 shows that shuffling the training data (removing word-order information) leads to a drop in accuracy for LSTM on the Yelp dataset, indicating that word order is important for sentiment analysis.

Initially, BERT achieved a peak accuracy of 77% on the original ARCT dataset, which was only three points below the average untrained human baseline. However, when the dataset was transformed to eliminate spurious statistical cues, BERT's performance dropped to 53% on the adversarial test set, as shown in image6. This reduction highlights that BERT's initial performance was largely due to exploiting these cues rather than genuine comprehension. Other models, such as BoV and BiLSTM, also saw their performance decline, but not as drastically as BERT, indicating that BERT was more reliant on these cues. The adversarial dataset, by mirroring the distribution of statistical cues over both labels, effectively neutralized the signal that BERT and other models were exploiting, leading to random performance across all models. This transformation underscores the need for robust evaluation methods that account for such statistical artifacts in NLP tasks.\n\n![BERT's performance on the adversarial test set](image6)"}

This diversity in data distribution highlights the complexity of multi-domain dialogue state tracking, where models must handle a large number of (domain, slot) pairs and possible values, as discussed in [1] and [6]. The dataset's complexity is further emphasized by the challenges of multi-turn mapping and the need for knowledge transfer across domains, as mentioned in [3] and [4]. The error analysis in image2 reveals that certain slots, like restaurant-name and attraction-name, have higher error rates due to a large number of possible values, while number-related slots have lower error rates.

As illustrated in image4, MMMU covers a broader range of disciplines and subjects, encompassing 30 different subjects across six major disciplines, compared to other benchmarks that often focus on a narrower set of topics. This breadth is further emphasized by the inclusion of 183 subfields, as shown in image3, which highlights the extensive coverage of diverse subjects and subfields. \n\nIn terms of depth, MMMU requires expert-level reasoning and knowledge application, as detailed in text quote [2], which demands models to handle complex visual inputs and perform nuanced reasoning. This is a significant departure from other benchmarks that typically assess basic perception and reasoning abilities, as noted in text quote [1]. The benchmark's design necessitates models to integrate domain-specific knowledge with visual understanding, as depicted in image8, which illustrates the interconnectedness of perception, knowledge, and reasoning.\n\nThe implications for evaluating large multimodal models (LMMs) are profound. The challenging nature of MMMU, as evidenced by the performance of models like GPT-4V achieving only 55.7% accuracy (text quote [8]), underscores the benchmark's rigorous standards. This suggests that while models may excel in simpler tasks, they still face substantial hurdles in more complex, expert-level scenarios. The need for models to handle diverse image formats and interleaved text-image inputs, as highlighted in text quote [2] and image1, further emphasizes the benchmark's role in pushing the boundaries of multimodal understanding and reasoning capabilities.\n\nIn summary, MMMU's comprehensive scope and demanding requirements make it a valuable tool for assessing the advanced capabilities of LMMs, particularly in areas requiring deep domain knowledge and sophisticated reasoning. ![MMMU Benchmark Comparison](image4)"}

As illustrated in image1, the process begins with the input document, which is then processed through the sentence-level BiLSTM to obtain token representations. These representations are essential for subsequent tasks such as span enumeration and coreference resolution. The BiLSTM captures contextual information within each sentence, enabling the model to understand the local context of each token. This foundational step is vital for the dynamic span graph construction, where spans are selected based on their confidence scores, and relations and coreferences are propagated to refine span representations. The iterative inference and propagation for both relations and coreferences, as shown in image1, rely on these initial token representations to update and enhance the span representations dynamically. This approach allows the model to leverage broader contextual information effectively, improving performance across tasks like entity recognition and relation extraction. The integration of these token representations into the dynamic span graph framework is a key innovation of DYGIE, as highlighted in text quote [11], which emphasizes the model's ability to incorporate global information through gated updates from neighboring relations and coreferences. The sentence-level BiLSTM thus lays the groundwork for the model's multi-task learning framework, enabling it to achieve state-of-the-art results across diverse domains, as evidenced by the performance metrics in image2 and image8.\n\n![Final prediction of entities and relations](image1)"}

Initially, the image is divided into regions using bounding box coordinates (bbox1, bbox2, bbox3), as shown in part (a) of the diagram. This step is crucial because it allows the system to focus on specific areas of the image, which is particularly important when dealing with objects of varying sizes and positions. \n\nFollowing the cropping, each region is resized to a fixed proportion, ensuring consistency in the input size for the encoder. This is essential for maintaining uniformity in the embeddings generated by the visual encoder, which is a critical component of the recognition process. The resized regions are then encoded to extract meaningful features, which are subsequently used to create embeddings.\n\nThe embeddings are then indexed using a k-NN (k-Nearest Neighbors) algorithm, which helps in efficiently retrieving similar images from the memory bank. This retrieval process is vital for the zero-shot recognition task, as it leverages historical data to identify potential matches for the input image. The retrieved results are then ranked by the MLLMs, which combine the retrieved information with their internal knowledge to make the final prediction.\n\nThe pre-processing steps of cropping and blurring, as mentioned in text quote [8], further enhance the recognition by directing the MLLMs' focus to the relevant objects. Blurring non-target areas helps in reducing distractions, allowing the model to concentrate on the objects of interest. This is particularly beneficial in scenarios where the objects of interest are smaller or less prominent in the image.\n\nIn summary, the pre-processing steps of cropping, resizing, and blurring, along with the use of k-NN for retrieval, significantly contribute to the zero-shot recognition system by improving the accuracy and efficiency of the recognition process. By focusing on specific regions and reducing noise, the system can better identify and classify objects, even in complex images with multiple objects of varying scales.\n\n![Pre-process and Embedding & Retrieve](image8)"}

In the original dataset, BERT Large achieves a peak accuracy of 77%, which is three points below the average untrained human baseline. However, this performance is largely due to exploiting spurious statistical cues rather than genuine comprehension. When evaluated on the adversarial dataset, which eliminates these cues, BERT's performance drops to 53%, with both the mean and median accuracy at 50%. This reduction highlights the model's reliance on statistical patterns rather than understanding the underlying arguments. Image5 illustrates this drastic performance drop, showing that BERT's accuracy on the adversarial test set is essentially random. The adversarial dataset, by mirroring the distribution of statistical cues across labels, effectively neutralizes the signal BERT exploits, demonstrating the fragility of its original performance. Thus, BERT's performance on the adversarial dataset underscores the lack of true argument comprehension and the need for more robust evaluation methods. ![BERT's performance on the adversarial test set is essentially random, with mean and median accuracy at 50%](image5).\n\nConclusion: BERT's performance on the adversarial test set is essentially random, with mean and median accuracy at 50%."}

This is illustrated in image2, where the nuclear envelope is shown forming around the daughter chromosomes. Additionally, the nucleolus becomes visible again, as seen in the image, indicating the re-establishment of the nucleus.\n\nCytokinesis follows telophase, where the cell membrane (or in plant cells, a cell plate) divides the cytoplasm into two separate cells. In animal cells, a contracting ring of microfilaments forms at the cell's equator, pinching the cell into two, as depicted in image6. In plant cells, a cell plate forms in the center and grows outward to divide the cell, as shown in image10.

According to [1], Mendel discovered genetic principles using pea plants, and [2] states that offspring resemble parents but show variations due to inherited genes. [4] mentions that parents pass heritable factors (genes) to offspring. In the F1 generation, all plants have purple flowers because the dominant allele (P) masks the recessive allele (p), as shown in image4, where true-breeding parents (PP and pp) produce F1 hybrids (Pp) with purple flowers. When F1 plants self-fertilize, the F2 generation shows a 3:1 phenotypic ratio of purple to white flowers, as depicted in image1, where the genotypic ratio is 1 PP: 2 Pp: 1 pp. The dominant allele (P) is expressed in PP and Pp plants, while the recessive allele (p) is expressed only in pp plants. Image2 illustrates this with dominant (FF or Ff) and recessive (ff) traits, showing how the genotype determines the phenotype. Mendel's work demonstrated that traits are inherited in predictable patterns, with dominant traits appearing in heterozygous individuals and recessive traits only in homozygous recessive individuals. This is visually represented in image7, where the Punnett square shows the combination of alleles leading to the observed ratios. Thus, Mendelian inheritance explains the 3:1 phenotypic and 1:2:1 genotypic ratios in the F2 generation through the segregation and independent assortment of alleles.\n\n![Mendelian inheritance explains the 3:1 phenotypic and 1:2:1 genotypic ratios in the F2 generation through dominant and recessive alleles](image1)\n\n![Dominant and recessive traits determine the phenotype based on genotype](image2)"}

Let's analyze the evidence to understand their impact on SEO:\n\n### Structured Markup Errors\n\n**Evidence from Image 7:**\n- **Structured Markup Errors:** The table in image 7 shows a significant number of errors in structured markup across various data types. For instance, there are 72,441 errors in blog items and 49,222 errors in article items, both marked in red. This indicates a substantial issue with the implementation of schema.org markup.\n- **Impact on SEO:** Structured markup is crucial for search engines to understand the content's context and relevance. Errors in markup can lead to misinterpretation, reducing the page's visibility in search results. For example, if a blog post is incorrectly marked up, search engines may not recognize it as a blog post, affecting its ranking.\n\n**Evidence from Image 8:**\n- **Markup Validation Service:** Image 8 shows the logo of MOZ, a tool often used for checking markup validation. This suggests that structured markup errors are a common area of concern and can be addressed using such tools.\n\n### Meta Description Issues\n\n**Evidence from Image 3:**\n- **Meta Description Analysis:** Image 3 presents a chart showing the time spent downloading pages and lists issues like duplicate meta descriptions, long meta descriptions, and missing title tags. These issues are highlighted in red.\n- **Impact on SEO:** Meta descriptions and title tags are essential for user engagement and search engine rankings. Duplicate or missing meta descriptions can confuse search engines and users, leading to lower click-through rates (CTR) and potentially lower rankings.\n\n### Backlinks and Referring Domains\n\n**Evidence from Images 1 and 4:**\n- **Backlink Growth:** Images 1 and 4 show graphs of backlinks and referring domains over time. Both indicate a steady increase, which is positive for SEO as backlinks are a key ranking factor.\n- **Impact on SEO:** A growing number of backlinks and referring domains can enhance a site's authority, improving its ranking potential. However, the quality of these links is also crucial."}

This principle can be applied to understanding how people interpret changes in data over time. The image of the banana export data (image3) shows a three-dimensional bar chart with color-coded bars representing different years from 1994 to 2005. The visual complexity of this chart can lead to a perception of trends and patterns that are not immediately obvious. The law of good Gestalt suggests that the mind will simplify this complexity by focusing on the most regular and significant changes, such as overall increases or decreases in export volumes.\n\nThe image of the time spent on weekend activities (image5) illustrates a similar principle. The pie charts for 2005 and 2010 show changes in how people allocate their time. The law of good Gestalt would lead viewers to notice the most significant shifts, such as the increase in time spent with family and friends from 35% in 2005 to 21% in 2010, and the decrease in watching films from 20% to 22%. These changes highlight the mind's tendency to prioritize global regularity over spatial relations, simplifying the data into clear trends.\n\nBy applying Gestalt principles, we can infer that the distribution of activities has shifted towards more social and family-oriented engagements, while the complexity of the data might lead to a perception of less change in other areas. This perception aligns with the potential trends in banana exports, where the mind might focus on the most significant changes in export volumes over the same period, simplifying the data into clear trends despite underlying complexities.\n\n![The image of the banana export data (image3) shows a three-dimensional bar chart with color-coded bars representing different years from 1994 to 2005, illustrating the distribution of banana exports across various countries.
