For example, $44\\%$ of those who think the U.S. can learn from foreign countries say the country is doing an excellent or good job, compared with $63\\%$ of those who say the U.S. can’t learn much from overseas [1].

To answer this, we need to look at the relevant data from the text quotes and image quotes.\n\nFrom the text quotes, we know that public confidence in the Mueller investigation has remained relatively stable over time. Specifically, quote [2] states that in January and September of 2018, 55% of people were at least somewhat confident in the fairness of the investigation. However, this does not directly address the specific percentages of those who were \"not too confident\" or \"very confident.\"\n\nLooking at the image quotes, image2 provides detailed data about public confidence in the Mueller investigation over several months, including January 2018. The data shows that in January 2018, 55% of people were \"somewhat\" or \"very\" confident in the investigation. Breaking it down further, the chart indicates that in January 2018, 27% were \"very confident\" and 29% were \"somewhat confident.\" This means that 29% were \"not too confident\" (since 100% - 55% = 45%, and 45% - 27% = 18%, but the exact \"not too\" percentage is not explicitly given). However, based on the data provided, we can infer that the percentage of people who were \"not too confident\" is approximately 41% (from quote [9], which states that 41% are not too or not at all confident in Mueller).\n\nFor the \"very confident\" group in January 2018, image2 shows that 27% were \"very confident.\" Therefore, the percentage difference between those who were \"not too confident\" (41%) and those who were \"very confident\" (27%) is 14%.\n\n![Public confidence in the fairness of the Mueller investigation in January 2018](image2)  \n![Percentage of people who are not too confident in the fairness of the Mueller investigation](image4)  \n\nIn conclusion, the percentage difference between those who were not too confident and those who were very confident in the fairness of the Mueller investigation in January 2018 is 14%."}

Specifically, [7] states that only 15% of U.S. adults trust information from the Chinese government, but it does not directly provide data on trust in the WHO or EU for those over 65 or postgraduates. However, [6] indicates that about three-quarters of Americans with a postgraduate degree (78%) trust information from the EU, suggesting that 22% of postgraduates do not trust the EU. Additionally, [9] highlights a strong partisan divide in trust in the WHO, with 86% of liberal Democrats trusting the WHO at least a fair amount, while only 27% of conservative Republicans do. While this does not directly address the trust levels of those over 65, [2] notes that American adults ages 65 and older are 16 percentage points more likely than those under 30 to say China will have less global influence after the crisis, which may indirectly reflect their views on international organizations like the WHO.\n\nLooking at the image quotes, image2 provides a detailed breakdown of trust levels across different age groups and education levels. According to the data in image2, 26% of people aged 65+ do not trust information from the WHO at all, while 14% of postgraduates do not trust information from the EU at all.

In 2008, 60% of Republican voters wanted the party to move in a more conservative direction, and this percentage remained relatively stable through 2016, with 60% still favoring a conservative path [7]. This indicates a strong and enduring preference within the Republican base for a more conservative stance.\n\nIn contrast, Democratic voters have experienced a notable shift toward a more liberal orientation. In 2008, only 33% of Democratic voters wanted the party to move in a more liberal direction, but by 2016, this had increased to 49% [9]. This reflects a growing desire among Democratic voters for their party to adopt a more progressive agenda. Additionally, the data shows that Democratic voters are now more divided between liberal and moderate positions, with 49% favoring a more liberal direction and 47% preferring a more moderate one [10].\n\nThese trends highlight a widening ideological gap between the two parties, with Republicans increasingly leaning conservative and Democrats moving toward liberalism.

While a significant portion of the population is familiar with the idea, their reactions range from concern to enthusiasm, depending on their level of awareness and personal experience.\n\nA majority of Americans are broadly familiar with the notion that automation may impact a wide range of human employment, and most consider the concept to be generally realistic. Specifically, 85% of the public has heard or read about this concept before, with 24% indicating they have heard or read “a lot” about it [7]. Additionally, one-in-five Americans find the concept of machines doing most human jobs in the future to be extremely realistic [8].\n\nHowever, despite this familiarity, more Americans are worried than enthusiastic about the notion that machines might do many of the jobs currently done by humans. Just 33% express some level of enthusiasm, while 72% express worry about a future in which robots and computers are capable of doing many jobs that are currently done by humans [9]. This trend is reflected in the data, where 67% of Americans express worry compared to 22% who express enthusiasm about algorithms that can make hiring decisions without any human involvement [9].\n\nThe perception of the concept also varies based on how much individuals have heard about it. Those who have heard the most about this concept find it much more realistic and express substantially higher levels of enthusiasm than those with lower levels of awareness. Nearly half (48%) of Americans who have heard a lot about this concept find it extremely realistic that machines might one day do many of the jobs currently done by humans [6]. In contrast, the share falls to 14% among those who have heard a little about this concept and to just 4% among those who have not heard anything about it before [2].\n\nMoreover, the image quotes provide visual evidence of these perceptions. The first image, a horizontal stacked bar chart, shows segments labeled \"20,\" \"57,\" \"17,\" and \"5,\" which could represent percentages of a whole related to the concept of automation [image1]. Another image, a horizontal bar chart divided into three segments labeled \"A lot\" (24), \"A little\" (61), and \"Nothing at all\" (14), likely represents the degree of awareness or exposure to the concept [image2].\n\nThe third image, a bar graph depicting survey results regarding the likelihood of various outcomes, shows that a majority of respondents believe negative outcomes such as increased inequality and difficulty finding purpose in life are likely, while positive outcomes like economic efficiency and meaningful jobs are less likely to occur [image3]. This aligns with the text quotes, which indicate that Americans anticipate more negative than positive outcomes from widespread automation.\n\nAnother image, a horizontal bar chart showing levels of enthusiasm and worry, reveals that only 6% are very enthusiastic, while 25% are very worried about the concept [image4]. This further supports the idea that Americans are more concerned than excited about the potential of machines taking over human jobs.\n\nFinally, the fifth image, a horizontal bar chart showing survey responses about a concept, highlights that those who have heard a lot about the concept are more likely to find it extremely realistic and to express both enthusiasm and worry compared to those who have heard little or nothing [image5].\n\nIn conclusion, Americans generally perceive the concept of machines performing jobs currently done by humans as realistic but are more worried than enthusiastic about its implications. ![This image appears to be a horizontal stacked bar chart that represents four segments with different colors and corresponding numbers.](image1) ![This image is a horizontal bar chart divided into three segments.](image2) ![This image is a bar graph that depicts survey results regarding the likelihood of various outcomes.](image3) ![This image is a horizontal bar chart representing levels of enthusiasm and worry.](image4) ![This image is a horizontal bar chart showing survey responses about a concept.](image5) The overall perception is one of cautious concern, with a strong emphasis on the potential negative consequences of automation."}

According to the data, nearly six-in-ten Americans (58%) feel there should be limits on how many jobs businesses can replace with machines, while 41% believe businesses are justified in replacing humans with machines if they can do a better job at a lower cost [7]. This reflects a general consensus that while automation may offer efficiency, there are concerns about its impact on employment.\n\n![limiting machines to dangerous and dirty jobs](image4)  \nThe image shows that 85% of Americans favor limiting machines to performing primarily dangerous or unhealthy jobs, with nearly half (47%) saying they favor this policy strongly [9]. This indicates a strong public preference for ensuring that automation does not displace workers in safer, more desirable roles.\n\nAdditionally, the public is divided on whether government or individuals should be responsible for providing for displaced workers, but there is more support for limits on how many human jobs businesses can replace with machines [4]. This suggests that while there is no clear consensus on who should take responsibility, there is a broader agreement on the need for some form of regulation.\n\n![opinions on business justification for replacing human workers](image2)  \nThe pie chart illustrates that 58% of respondents believe there should be limits on the number of jobs businesses can replace with machines, even if machines are better and cheaper. Only 41% think businesses are justified in doing so [2]. This highlights a strong public sentiment against unregulated automation, particularly when it comes to job displacement.\n\nFurthermore, the public responds favorably to policies that would limit the use of these technologies to specific situations or bring humans more fully into their operations [5]. For example, 60% of Americans support a guaranteed income for all Americans in the event that robots and computers become capable of doing many human jobs, and 58% support a national service program that pays humans to perform jobs even if machines could do them faster or cheaper [10].\n\nIn summary, the public generally supports limiting machine use in the workforce, especially in terms of restricting automation to dangerous or dirty jobs and implementing policies like a universal basic income or national service programs for displaced workers."}

This pattern is consistent across various data points, such as the fact that 61% of all Latinos say it is a significant problem that people do not see racial discrimination where it exists, with larger shares of Democrats and independents reporting this concern compared to Republicans [4][5][6].\n\n![People not seeing racial discrimination where it really does exist is a bigger problem for the country](image3)\n\nAdditionally, the bar chart in image3 provides a visual representation of these differences. It shows that among all Latinos, 61% believe that people do not see racial discrimination where it really exists, while only 35% think people see it where it doesn't. For Latino Democrats (Dem/Lean Dem), the percentage of those who do not see racial discrimination where it exists increases to 73%, whereas for Latino Republicans (Rep/Lean Rep), it drops to 36%. This stark contrast illustrates the divergence in perspectives between the two groups.\n\n![People not seeing racial discrimination where it really does exist is a bigger problem for the country](image3)\n\nIn summary, Latino Democrats are significantly more likely than Latino Republicans to believe that people fail to recognize racial discrimination where it exists."}

These reasons are often interconnected and vary in their prevalence across different groups.\n\nFor women, the major reasons cited include facing discrimination in recruitment, hiring, and promotion (39%), not being encouraged to pursue STEM from an early age (39%), and finding it more difficult to balance work and family in STEM jobs (33%). Additionally, there is a perception that the training process is slow (27%) and a lack of female role models in STEM (24%) [5]. These factors contribute to a complex landscape where both external and internal barriers play a role in discouraging women from entering or remaining in STEM fields.\n\nFor blacks and Hispanics, the primary reasons for underrepresentation include limited access to quality education to prepare for STEM fields (42%), not being encouraged to pursue STEM from an early age (41%), and a lower likelihood of believing they can succeed in STEM (33%). Discrimination in recruitment, hiring, and promotion is also a significant factor, with 31% of respondents citing this as a major reason [5]. The lack of black and Hispanic role models in STEM (27%) further exacerbates the issue by limiting the visibility and inspiration for these groups.\n\nThese findings highlight the multifaceted nature of the problem, where educational disparities, social encouragement, and institutional biases all contribute to the underrepresentation of women, blacks, and Hispanics in STEM jobs. The data also reveals that while some factors are common across groups, others are specific to certain demographics, underscoring the need for targeted interventions.\n\n![Limited access to quality education is a major reason for the underrepresentation of blacks and Hispanics in STEM jobs.](image1)  \n![Women are less likely than men to be working in computer-related jobs despite having similar majors.](image2)  \n![Graduate education is perceived as the highest quality level of education in the U.S.](image3)  \n![Women in STEM value meaningful contributions to society more than men do.](image4)  \n![Discrimination and lack of encouragement are key reasons for the underrepresentation of women, blacks, and Hispanics in STEM.](image5)\n\nThe major reasons for the underrepresentation of women, blacks, and Hispanics in STEM jobs, according to the Pew Research Center, include limited access to quality education, lack of encouragement from an early age, discrimination in recruitment and promotions, and a lack of role models in the field."}

Specifically, 25% of Americans consider K-12 STEM education in the U.S. to be at least above average, while 43% say it is average, and 30% say it is below average [4].

For instance, Seed investments remained relatively stable around €2M throughout the years, with a slight decrease by 2009 [image2]. First-stage investments peaked around 2007 before declining, while Second- and Later-stage investments also showed peaks in 2006–2007, followed by a sharp drop by 2009 [image2]. This suggests that the U.S. venture capital market experienced a peak in investment activity during the mid-2000s, followed by a contraction in later years.\n\nIn contrast, the trends in Europe show more moderate fluctuations. The median investments for Seed, First, Second, and Later stages do not exhibit as dramatic a peak or decline as those in the U.S. For example, Seed investments in Europe remained relatively stable around €2M, similar to the U.S., but without the same level of volatility. First-stage investments in Europe also showed a peak around 2007, but the decline was less pronounced compared to the U.S. Similarly, Second- and Later-stage investments in Europe peaked around 2007–2008 but did not experience the same sharp drop as in the U.S. [image5].\n\nOne key difference is that the U.S. saw a more pronounced boom and bust cycle in venture capital investments during this period, while Europe's investments were more consistent and less volatile. This could be attributed to differences in market maturity, investor confidence, and the availability of capital. The U.S. venture capital market, being more mature and better capitalized, was able to sustain higher levels of investment for longer, whereas Europe's market, characterized by lower entry valuations and tighter control of cash invested, showed more restrained growth [1][4].\n\n![The image shows a line graph comparing median European investments across different stages from 2004 to 2009.](image5)\n\n![The image shows a line graph comparing median U.S. investments across different stages from 2004 to 2009.](image2)\n\nIn summary, while both the U.S. and Europe experienced peaks in median investments around 2007, the U.S. saw a sharper decline afterward, whereas Europe's investment trends were more stable and less volatile."}

Confidence is determined based on factors such as the type, amount, quality, strength, and consistency of evidence, along with the level of consensus among experts. The document outlines four levels of confidence: very high, high, medium, and low. Each level is defined by specific criteria, such as the presence of strong evidence with established theory and high consensus for \"very high\" confidence, or inconclusive evidence with limited sources and disagreement among experts for \"low\" confidence [9].\n\nLikelihood, on the other hand, is evaluated based on measures of uncertainty expressed probabilistically. It describes the probability of an impact occurring, ranging from \"very unlikely\" (less than or equal to a 1 in 10 chance) to \"very likely\" (greater than or equal to a 9 in 10 chance) [3]. Likelihood language is used when it is scientifically justified to report the probability of particular impacts within the range of possible outcomes. The evaluation of likelihood involves statistical analysis of observations or model results, or expert judgment.\n\nBoth confidence and likelihood levels are based on the expert assessment and consensus of the chapter author teams. The author teams determine the appropriate level of confidence or likelihood by assessing the available literature, evaluating the quality and quantity of evidence, and considering the level of agreement across different studies [5].

For example, overwhelming shares (more than 80%) of both Republicans and Republican-leaning independents and Democrats and Democratic leaners say their own party has good policy ideas, while less than a quarter say this describes the opposing party. Similarly, while only about two-in-ten Republicans or Democrats think their own party is “too extreme,” about three-quarters in each party think the other party can be described this way [4]. This suggests that partisanship strongly influences perceptions of extremism.\n\nIn terms of ethical standards, the text states that just 41% of Americans say the GOP has high ethical standards, while a nearly identical share (42%) say this about the Democratic Party [8]. Additionally, about four-in-ten say each party has high ethical standards (42% say that about the Democratic Party, 41% about the GOP) [5]. These views are about the same as they were in April 2017 [5]. However, among those with at least a college degree, 31% say “high ethical standards” does not describe the GOP or the Democratic Party; 43% say it describes one and not the other, and 17% think it describes both [3].\n\nIndependents are significantly more likely than partisans to say neither party has “high ethical standards.” About a third of independents (34%), including equal shares of Republican leaners and Democratic leaners (33% each), say neither party has high ethical standards. By comparison, only about two-in-ten Republicans (19%) or Democrats (18%) say this [7].\n\nLooking at the image quotes, image2 provides a bar chart comparing perceptions of the Republican and Democratic parties among U.S. adults.

It clearly illustrates that \"postgraduates are more likely to support the Democratic Party (62%) compared to the Republican Party (30%), while those with a high school degree or less are more likely to support the Republican Party (47%) compared to the Democratic Party (42%)\" [5]. This data supports the notion that education level significantly influences political party preferences.\n\n![The image is a bar chart comparing perceptions of the Republican and Democratic parties among U.S. adults, highlighting that the Democratic Party is rated slightly higher at 42% compared to the Republican Party at 41% regarding high ethical standards.](image2)\n\nIn conclusion, perceptions of ethical standards and political party preferences vary significantly among different education levels and political affiliations, with higher education levels generally correlating with stronger support for the Democratic Party and a greater likelihood of believing that neither party has high ethical standards."}

This is significantly lower than the ratings for previous administrations, such as Reagan’s in 1983, indicating a decline in public perception of ethical standards during Trump's tenure [1]. The image titled \"Ratings for Trump officials’ ethical standards trail past administrations\" visually reinforces this trend, highlighting the contrast between current and historical evaluations [8].\n\nThis low rating of ethical standards appears to influence public approval of Trump's job performance. While the public’s evaluation of how Trump is handling his job has remained relatively stable over time, it is closely linked to these ethical concerns. For instance, 42% of the public disapproves of Trump's job performance very strongly, and 12% disapprove not so strongly [4]. These figures suggest that the negative perception of the administration's ethical standards contributes to a significant portion of the public's dissatisfaction with Trump's overall performance.\n\nMoreover, there are notable demographic differences in these ratings. A gender gap exists, with 48% of men approving of Trump's performance compared to 30% of women [5]. Additionally, there are racial, age, and educational disparities, with younger adults, those with higher education, and non-whites more likely to disapprove of Trump's job performance [10].

This suggests that higher education may correlate with more critical views of both parties' ethical standards. Similarly, text quote [6] states that among those with at least a college degree, 31% say \"high ethical standards\" does not describe either party, while 43% say it describes one but not the other, and 17% think it describes both. This indicates that higher education levels may lead to more nuanced or critical assessments of the parties' ethical standards.\n\nText quote [8] reveals that younger adults, those with higher levels of education, and non-whites are more likely to disapprove of the job Trump is doing. This shows that higher education is associated with lower approval ratings for Trump. Additionally, text quote [4] notes that while only 15% of conservative Republicans express negative views of the ethical standards of Trump administration officials, about a third (36%) of moderate and liberal Republicans say they are not good or poor. This implies that political affiliation, particularly within the Republican Party, influences perceptions of Trump's ethical standards.\n\nImage quote [4] provides a visual representation of how different educational levels perceive the political parties. The bar chart shows that for the category \"Describes neither party,\" the percentage varies across education levels: 26% for those with some college experience and 20% for those with a high school degree or less.

According to the data, Trump voters are more likely to identify health care as Trump’s top priority, with 29% of them naming it, compared to only 12% of Clinton voters [1]. This suggests that Trump voters see health care as a central issue for his administration, possibly due to his campaign promises related to repealing the Affordable Care Act [6]. In contrast, Clinton voters are less likely to prioritize health care and instead show more interest in other areas such as unifying the country, with 12% of them suggesting this as a top priority [8].\n\nIn addition to health care, Trump voters are more inclined to emphasize the economy and immigration as key issues. For instance, 15% of Trump voters believe the economy should be the main priority, compared to 9% of Clinton voters, while 15% of Trump voters mention immigration, versus 6% of Clinton voters [6].

The graph also indicates that the percentage of voters who said there was less mudslinging decreased significantly over time, reaching just 4% in 2016.\n\nThis negative perception of the campaign extended to various political entities. Text quote [8] states that post-election evaluations of the way the winning candidate, the parties, the press, and the pollsters conducted themselves during the campaign were all far more negative than after any election dating back to 1988. This sentiment is reflected in the table from image4, which shows that both Trump and Clinton received low grades from voters. Trump received an A or B from only 30% of people, with an average grade of C-, while Clinton received an A or B from 43% of people, with an average grade of C. The Republican Party, Democratic Party, press, and pollsters also received low grades, with the Republican Party and press receiving the lowest average grades of D+.\n\nIn addition to the negative perceptions of political entities, voter emotions were also strongly influenced by the election. Text quote [6] highlights that about half of voters (53%) say Trump's election makes them feel \"uneasy,\" while nearly as many (51%) say it makes them feel \"hopeful.\" However, smaller shares say it makes them feel \"scared,\" \"sad\" (41% each), \"proud\" (36%), or \"angry\" (31%). These emotions are visually represented in image3, which shows the relative magnitude of each emotion. The bar chart indicates that \"Uneasy\" and \"Hopeful\" were the most commonly reported emotions, followed by \"Sad\" and \"Scared.\"\n\nOverall, the negative perception of the 2016 election campaign and the low grades given to political entities are closely related. The high levels of negativity and mudslinging contributed to the strong emotional responses from voters, with many feeling uneasy, sad, or scared about Trump's victory. At the same time, the low grades given to political entities reflect a lack of confidence in their conduct during the campaign. ![The line graph shows the percentage of voters who say there was \"more mudslinging\" or \"less mudslinging\" in various election years compared to past elections.](image1) ![The bar chart shows the percentage of different groups of voters with regard to whether they believe Barack Obama should appoint Republicans to serve in important positions in his administration.](image5) ![The bar chart represents the percentage of voters who say there was \"more mudslinging\" or \"less mudslinging\" in various election years compared to past elections.](image1) ![The table presents survey data on public perception and grading of various entities related to a political context.](image4) ![The bar chart shows the percentage of different groups of voters with regard to whether they believe Barack Obama should appoint Republicans to serve in important positions in his administration.](image5) The relationship between voter perceptions of political entities and campaign negativity in the 2016 election is complex, but it is clear that the negative nature of the campaign had a significant impact on voter emotions and opinions."}

The bar chart in image1 further supports this, as it indicates that Trump voters may have felt a mix of emotions, with \"Proud\" (36%) and \"Uneasy\" (53%) being among the most common, suggesting a complex emotional response.\n\nIn contrast, Clinton voters expressed more negative emotions. Text quote [7] states that \"For Clinton voters, 'shocked' is the most frequent response, followed by 'disappointed' and 'disgusted.'\" This sentiment is echoed in image3, which highlights that \"Shocked\" and \"Disappointed\" were the top responses among Clinton voters. Additionally, text quote [4] reveals that 84% of Clinton voters expected race relations to worsen under Trump, indicating a strong sense of pessimism about the future. This pessimism is also reflected in image1, where \"Sad\" (41%) and \"Scared\" (41%) are prominent emotions, suggesting deep concerns about the implications of Trump's victory.\n\nThe emotional divide between the two groups also reveals differing expectations prior to the election. Text quote [3] notes that \"Nearly three-quarters (73%) of all voters – including 87% of Clinton supporters and 60% of Trump backers – say they were surprised by Trump’s victory.\" This indicates that both groups had low expectations of Trump winning, but Clinton voters were far more surprised, with 87% expressing surprise compared to 60% of Trump voters. Image2 visually reinforces this, showing that 87% of Clinton voters were surprised, while only 12% were not. In contrast, 60% of Trump voters were surprised, while 40% were not, suggesting that some Trump supporters anticipated his victory.\n\nOverall, the emotional reactions to Trump's victory highlight a stark contrast between the two voter groups.

This indicates a shared optimism about future political representation, even amid the current political climate.\n\nRegarding reactions to Trump's victory, the sentiment is starkly divided. While 97% of Trump voters say they are happy he won, 93% of Clinton voters say they are unhappy [7]. This contrast highlights the deep divide in satisfaction with the election outcome. Additionally, when asked to summarize their feelings about Trump’s victory in a word, Trump supporters most often use \"happy,\" while many express surprise or shock at the election result [2].\n\nThe level of surprise also varies significantly between the two groups.

In fact, more people now say the government is doing not too well or not at all well (52%) compared to those who say it is doing very or fairly well (46%). This marks a substantial decline from January, when 72% of Americans rated the government's efforts positively [2].\n\nThe trends in public opinion also reveal differences across political affiliations.

In contrast, older adults, particularly those aged 65 and older, are more likely to express concern that the government is not doing enough to stop Islamic militants [1] and that anti-terror policies are not going far enough to protect the country [3]. For example, 71% of those aged 65 and older believe that the government’s policies do not go far enough, compared to 52% among those aged 30-49 [3].

In contrast, only 30% of Democrats hold this view, reflecting a notable shift from 42% in September 2014 [9].

These trends are supported by image2, which indicates that younger individuals (18-29) perceive the most scrutiny (80%), while those aged 50+ perceive the least (50%) [2].\n\nFurthermore, the perception of scrutiny is closely tied to the importance of terrorism as a national issue. The text states that 41% of Republicans cite terrorism, defense issues, and national security or ISIS as the most important problem facing the nation, compared to 28% of independents and 23% of Democrats [4]. This aligns with image4, which shows that Republicans prioritize issues like defense and national security more than Democrats, suggesting a link between these concerns and the perception of Muslim scrutiny. Image5 further illustrates that terrorism-related concerns increased significantly from 1% in December 2014 to 18% in December 2015, highlighting a growing public focus on this issue [5].\n\n![The bar chart shows the opinions of different political groups on whether individuals should be subject to additional scrutiny solely because of their religion.](image3)  \n![The bar chart depicts the percentage of different demographic groups who perceive scrutiny due to religion.](image2)  \n![The table displays survey results regarding the importance of various issues to different political affiliations.](image4)"}

According to the data, there has been a notable decline in positive ratings of the government's performance in reducing the threat of terrorism. For instance, the percentage of Americans who believe the government is doing very or fairly well in this area has dropped from 72% in January to 46%, with more now saying the government is not too well or not at all well (52%) [3]. This marks the lowest level of positive ratings since the September 2001 terrorist attacks.\n\nThe change in perception is also evident when comparing different time periods. In December 2014, only 1% of respondents mentioned terrorism as a concern, but by December 2015, this had risen to 18% [image1]. Similarly, concerns about national security and ISIS have increased, indicating a growing public awareness and worry about these issues. The overall increase in concerns related to terrorism and national security suggests that these topics have become more prominent in the public discourse.\n\nWhen examining how these perceptions differ among various demographic and political groups, we see clear patterns. Older adults and those with less education tend to give the government lower marks for its efforts against terrorism. For example, 57% of those aged 50 and older say the government is not doing well in reducing the terrorist threat, compared to 46% of younger adults [2]. Additionally, individuals with postgraduate degrees are more likely to rate the government's performance positively (58%) than those with less education (44%) [6].\n\nPolitical affiliation also plays a significant role in shaping these perceptions. Republicans are more likely to express dissatisfaction with the government's efforts, with only 27% believing the government is doing very or fairly well, down from 63% at the start of the year [4]. In contrast, Democrats show a more positive outlook, with 64% rating the government's performance as at least fairly well, although this is a decrease from 85% in January [4]. Independents have also seen a decline, with positive ratings dropping from 69% to 44% [4].\n\nThe data further reveals that concerns about the government's anti-terror policies have shifted. By two-to-one, Americans now express more concern that these policies have not gone far enough to protect the country (56%) rather than that they have gone too far in restricting civil liberties (28%) [9]. This indicates a growing desire for stronger measures against terrorism, even if it means potential trade-offs in civil liberties.\n\n![The table presents survey data on public concerns in December 2014 and December 2015, with the percentage of respondents mentioning each issue and the change over the year.](image1)\n\nIn summary, perceptions of terrorism and the government's efforts to combat it have become more negative over time, with significant variations across different demographic and political groups. Older adults, less educated individuals, and Republicans tend to be more critical of the government's performance, while younger adults, more educated individuals, and Democrats are generally more positive."}

Regarding terrorism, the data shows that Republicans are more likely to prioritize it as a key issue compared to Democrats. For instance, 41% of Republicans mention terrorism, defense issues, or national security, while only 23% of Democrats do so [5]. Additionally, the perception of government efforts to combat terrorism has become more negative over time, with Republicans showing a sharper decline in positive ratings. In January, 59% of conservative Republicans believed the government was doing very well or fairly well, but this dropped to 18% by the time of the survey [4]. This shift is partly due to concerns that anti-terrorism policies do not go far enough to protect the country, especially among Republicans, where 71% express this concern [2].\n\nIn contrast, Democrats have maintained a more positive outlook on government efforts to reduce the threat of terrorism, although their ratings have also declined. In January, 85% of Democrats said the government was doing at least fairly well, but this dropped to 64% by the time of the survey [6]. However, the overall trend indicates a growing divide, with Democrats being more concerned about the balance between security and civil liberties. For example, 41% of liberal Democrats believe that anti-terrorism policies have gone too far in restricting civil liberties, while an equal share (41%) worry that they haven’t gone far enough [10].\n\nWhen it comes to economic issues, the survey highlights a different pattern. While terrorism and related security concerns have gained prominence, economic issues have seen a decline in importance. The percentage of respondents citing economic issues as a top concern decreased from 34% in December 2014 to 23% in December 2015 [4]. This decline is observed across all political groups, but it is particularly notable among Republicans and independents. However, the data does not show a clear partisan divide on economic issues, suggesting that both parties are equally concerned about the economy, though their priorities may differ.\n\n![The table displays survey results regarding the importance of various issues to different political affiliations: Republicans (Rep), Democrats (Dem), and Independents (Ind).](image1)\n\n![The table presents survey data on public concerns in December 2014 and December 2015, with the percentage of respondents mentioning each issue and the change over the year.](image4) \n\nIn conclusion, Republicans are more likely to prioritize terrorism and national security, while Democrats tend to be more concerned about the balance between security and civil liberties.

{"q_id": 89, "model": "qwen3-30b-a3b", "in_tok": 2395, "out_tok": 670, "total_tok": 3065, "response": "The question of how views on the importance of terrorism differ among political affiliations and how this relates to perceptions of government efforts to address the terrorist threat can be explored through both textual and visual evidence.\n\nTextually, we see that there are significant partisan divides in what Americans consider the most important problem facing the nation. For instance, 41% of Republicans mention terrorism, defense issues, or national security, while only 28% of independents and 23% of Democrats cite these issues [6]. This suggests that Republicans place a higher priority on terrorism-related concerns compared to other groups. Additionally, the data shows that Democrats are more likely than Republicans to cite partisan gridlock and division as key problems [2].\n\nThese differing priorities may influence how each group perceives the government's efforts to combat terrorism. For example, older and less educated Americans are more likely to give the government low marks for its performance in reducing the terrorist threat [3], which could reflect a lack of confidence in the government's ability to address the issues they prioritize. Furthermore, evaluations of the government’s job in reducing the threat of terrorism are more positive among those with higher education levels, such as postgraduates, compared to those with less education [10]. This implies that educational background may also play a role in shaping perceptions of government effectiveness.\n\nIn terms of broader trends, assessments of government efforts to combat terrorism have become more negative across the political spectrum since early 2015. Democrats are now the only group in which a majority (64%) say the government is doing at least fairly well, but this is a significant drop from 85% in January [4]. Independents' positive ratings have dropped by 25 points, and just 27% of Republicans now say the government is doing very or fairly well in reducing the terrorist threat, down from 63% at the start of the year [4]. These shifts suggest that public opinion on government performance has deteriorated over time, regardless of political affiliation.\n\nThe image quotes further support this analysis. Image2 provides a table showing how different demographic groups perceive the government's efforts to reduce the threat of terrorism. The \"Very/Fairly well\" column indicates that younger adults (18-29) are more likely to view the government's efforts negatively compared to older age groups. Similarly, higher education levels correlate with more positive assessments of the government's performance [10]. This aligns with the idea that education and age may influence how individuals evaluate government actions.\n\nImage3 highlights the differences in issue prioritization among political affiliations. While Republicans are more likely to prioritize terrorism, defense, and national security, Democrats focus more on partisan gridlock and division. This divergence in priorities may contribute to varying levels of satisfaction with government efforts. For example, if a group prioritizes a particular issue, they may be more critical of the government's response if it does not meet their expectations.\n\n![Terrorism and national security are more frequently cited as important issues by Republicans compared to Democrats and Independents](image3)\n\nIn conclusion, views on the importance of terrorism differ significantly among political affiliations, with Republicans placing a higher priority on terrorism and national security issues compared to Democrats and Independents, and this relates to their perception of government efforts to address the terrorist threat."}

This contrasts with Democrats, who are more likely to support regulation, with 65% believing it is necessary, and Republicans, who are more skeptical, with 61% thinking it does more harm than good [image1]. The image shows that even within the independent group, there is variation: lean Democrats are more supportive of regulation (69% say it's necessary), while lean Republicans are more critical (58% say it does more harm) [image1].\n\nRegarding economic fairness, independent voters also show a middle ground. A majority of independents (66%) believe the U.S. economic system unfairly favors powerful interests, which is similar to the views of Democrats (85%) but less extreme than the 70% of independents with no political lean who hold this view [image4]. In contrast, Republicans are more likely to see the system as fair, with 63% of Republicans believing it is fair to most Americans, compared to just 14% of Democrats who share this view [image4]. Independent voters, like Democrats, tend to be more critical of the economic system, but their views are not as strongly aligned with Democrats as those of lean Democrats, who are the most critical of the system [image4].\n\nOverall, independent voters' views on government regulation and economic fairness reflect a blend of perspectives, but they are closer to Democrats on issues of economic fairness and regulation than to Republicans.

Specifically, 37% of these independents have an unfavorable opinion of both parties, while another 22% have favorable opinions of both parties [2]. In contrast, independent leaners show a different pattern. For instance, 11% of non-leaning independents view the Democratic Party favorably, while about 9% have a favorable view of the GOP [2]. However, the share of independents who view both parties negatively has declined in recent years. At one point in 2015, more than a third of independents (36%) viewed both parties unfavorably [9].\n\nThe data also reveals that the intensity of dislike for the opposing party has surged over the past two decades among partisans, and this trend is similarly observed among independents who lean towards either party [7]. For example, the share of Democratic-leaning independents with a very unfavorable opinion of the Republican Party has more than quadrupled between 1994 and 2018, increasing from 8% to 37%. Similarly, the share of Republican leaners with a very unfavorable opinion of the Democratic Party has increased from 15% in 1994 to 39% in 2018 [6].\n\nFurthermore, the data shows that the majority of Republican and Democratic leaners have a favorable opinion of their own party and are almost as likely as Republican and Democratic identifiers to have an unfavorable opinion of the opposing party [10].

Additionally, there is a notable difference in the preference between Germany and Russia, with about two-thirds of Democrats preferring Germany over Russia, compared to 57% of Republicans [4].

These differences are reflected in both public opinion surveys and visual representations of data.\n\nRegarding military intervention, Americans are more inclined to support the use of military force compared to Germans. For instance, about eight-in-ten Americans believe it is sometimes necessary to use force to maintain order in the world, while only about half of Germans agree [6]. This divergence is also evident in views on Article 5 obligations under NATO. Six-in-ten Americans say their country should defend a NATO ally in the event of a potential Russian attack, whereas an equal share of Germans say their country should not [9]. The image1 provides a visual representation of this contrast, showing that 60% of Americans believe something \"Should\" be done, while only 34% of Germans agree, with 60% of Germans believing it \"Should not\" be done [image1].\n\nOn the topic of defense spending, Americans and Germans also show differing stances. When asked whether the U.S.’s European allies should increase, decrease, or maintain their defense spending, half of Americans say that spending levels should remain the same, marking a shift from 2017 when 45% of Americans felt their allies should dedicate more resources to national defense [2]. In contrast, Germans are divided between increasing or maintaining budgets, with about four-in-ten taking each view [10]. Image4 illustrates the changing opinions over time, showing that in 2017, 45% of Americans supported increased defense spending, but this dropped to 35% in 2019. For Germany, the percentage supporting increased spending rose from 32% in 2017 to 40% in 2019 [image4].\n\nAdditionally, the role of U.S. military bases in Germany highlights another point of contention. While 85% of Americans believe these bases are important to the U.S.’s security interests, only about half of Germans see them as important for their country’s national security [3]. Image5 shows a decline in support for increased defense spending among both Republicans and Democrats in the U.S., with Republicans' support dropping from 62% in 2017 to 48% in 2019 [image5].\n\nIn terms of ideological divides, both countries show that those on the right are more likely to justify the use of force. Nine-in-ten American conservatives see military force as necessary, compared to 65% of liberals. In Germany, nearly six-in-ten adults on the right see military force as necessary, while about a third on the left agree [4]. Image2, which compares age group differences, suggests that younger Americans (18-29) are more supportive of military action than older Americans, with 82% agreeing compared to 70% for those 65 and older. In Germany, the trend is similar, with 40% of young people agreeing compared to 28% of older individuals [image2].\n\nFinally, image3 provides a clear comparison of agreement with an unspecified statement, showing that 78% of Americans agree, while only 47% of Germans do, with 52% of Germans disagreeing [image3].\n\nIn conclusion, American and German opinions differ significantly on military intervention and defense spending, with Americans generally more supportive of military action and higher defense spending, while Germans are more cautious and divided. ![The image shows a chart comparing the opinions of people from the U.S. and Germany on an unspecified issue about whether something should or should not be done.](image1)"}

In the U.S., there has been a notable shift from 2017 to 2019, where the percentage of Americans who believed that European allies should increase their defense spending dropped from 45% to 35% [5]. This reflects a growing preference for maintaining current spending levels rather than increasing them. Meanwhile, in Germany, public opinion has also changed, with a decline in those content with current defense spending and an increase in those advocating for higher spending. In 2017, about half of Germans were content with their country’s defense spending, while about a third felt it should be increased; by 2019, the numbers had shifted to 40% supporting an increase and 41% favoring maintaining current levels [7].\n\nPartisan differences within each country further highlight these evolving opinions. In the U.S., Republicans and Republican-leaning independents have historically shown more support for increased defense spending in Europe compared to Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents. However, this support has decreased over time, with a 14 percentage point drop among Republicans between 2017 and 2019 [8]. Similarly, there has been a modest decline in support among Democrats. In contrast, in Germany, partisan divides are evident in how different political groups view defense spending.

Additionally, 50% of Americans believe China will have less influence in world affairs after the pandemic, reflecting a growing concern about its global stature [9].\n\nThe perception of China's influence is also divided along partisan lines. While half of Americans believe China's global influence will decline, Republicans are significantly more likely to hold this view than Democrats. Specifically, roughly six-in-ten Republicans believe China’s international clout will diminish, compared to just 40% of Democrats [5]. This divide is further highlighted in a bar chart showing that 50% of Americans think China will have less influence, 31% think it will remain the same, and 17% believe it will gain more influence [image3].\n\nPartisan differences extend beyond just opinions on China's influence. There is a clear split in how different groups view China's handling of the outbreak. For instance, 70% of conservative Republicans believe China has not handled the crisis well, whereas only 40% of Democrats share this view [7]. These divisions are consistent with broader trends in American attitudes toward foreign policy, where there are sharp differences between Democrats and Republicans on various international issues [8].\n\n![China's perceived influence in world affairs](image3)  \nThe image shows a bar chart illustrating the public's belief about China's future influence, with 50% expecting less influence, 31% expecting about the same, and 17% expecting more.\n\n![Perception of China's performance in handling the outbreak](image1)  \nThe image shows a horizontal bar chart indicating that 64% of Americans rate China's handling of the outbreak as \"only fair/poor,\" while 33% rate it as \"good/excellent.\"\n\nIn summary, Americans generally view China's handling of the coronavirus outbreak negatively, and there are significant partisan differences in these perceptions, with Republicans being more critical of China's actions and more likely to believe its global influence will decline."}

These differences are reflected in both public opinion surveys and visual representations of the data.\n\nAccording to the text, there is a clear partisan gap in views about the U.S. role in international affairs. For instance, 62% of Republicans believe the U.S. does too much in helping address global challenges, while only 26% of Democrats share this view [5]. This reflects a broader ideological divide, with higher education levels correlating with a greater likelihood of believing the U.S. should help other countries deal with their problems and that it can learn from other nations about combating the coronavirus [4]. Furthermore, the data shows that liberal Democrats are more likely than conservative Republicans to expect the U.S. to have less influence in world affairs after the pandemic [7].\n\nThe image data provides a visual representation of these trends. Image4, a line graph, illustrates growing partisan divisions over the U.S.'s role in solving world problems from 2013 to 2020. The red line (Rep/Lean Rep) starts at 52% in 2013, decreases to 37% by 2018, and then rises again to 62% in 2020. The green line (Total) begins at 51% in 2013, decreases to 39% by 2018, and increases to 42% in 2020. The blue line (Dem/Lean Dem) starts at 48% in 2013, falls to 21% by 2018, and then slightly increases to 26% in 2020 [image4]. This trend highlights the increasing polarization between Republican and Democratic views on the U.S. role in global issues.\n\nSimilarly, image5 shows changes in opinions from 2013 to 2020 regarding three categories: \"Too little,\" \"Right amount,\" and \"Too much.\" The green line (\"Too little\") increases from 16% in 2013 to 48% in 2018, and slightly drops to 46% in 2020. The purple line (\"Right amount\") starts at 33% in 2013, peaks at 38% in 2016, and drops to 26% in 2020. The orange line (\"Too much\") begins at 48% in 2013, decreases to 21% in 2018, and stays at 26% in 2020 [image5]. This crossover of lines between 2016 and 2018 indicates shifting perceptions over time, with a notable increase in the perception that the U.S. does too little in addressing global challenges.\n\nIn addition, image2, a chart displaying survey data on opinions about the U.S. response to the coronavirus outbreak, highlights differences in perceptions between political groups. For example, 81% of liberal Democrats believe the U.S. has done an only fair or poor job of dealing with the coronavirus outbreak, compared to 22% of conservative Republicans [image2]. Similarly, 67% of liberal Democrats believe the U.S. can learn from other countries about ways to slow the spread of the coronavirus, compared to 25% of conservative Republicans. These figures underscore the stark partisan divides in views on the U.S. response to the pandemic and its global implications.\n\n![The U.S. role in solving world problems and its influence after the coronavirus outbreak is viewed differently by partisan groups, with Republicans more likely to believe the U.S. does too much and Democrats more likely to believe it does too little.](image4)\n\n![Opinions on the U.S. doing too little in addressing global challenges have increased significantly from 2013 to 2020.](image5)\n\nIn conclusion, partisan views on the U.S. role in solving world problems and its influence after the coronavirus outbreak show significant differences, with Republicans generally believing the U.S. does too much and Democrats believing it does too little."}

For example, 67% of liberal Democrats think the U.S. can learn a great deal from other nations, compared with only 25% of conservative Republicans [4]. Similarly, 60% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents say the U.S. can learn a great deal, whereas only 28% of Republicans and Republican leaners share this view [8]. These findings suggest that political affiliation strongly influences perceptions of the U.S.'s capacity to learn from other countries.\n\nIn addition to partisanship, education plays an important role. People with higher levels of education are more likely to believe the U.S. can learn from other countries about effective ways to combat the coronavirus [2]. This aligns with the data presented in image1, which shows that higher educational attainment correlates with greater agreement that the U.S. can learn a great deal from other countries. For instance, 56% of postgraduates and 50% of college graduates believe the U.S. can learn a great deal, compared to 41% of those with a high school diploma or less [1].\n\nThe image also reveals that racial and ethnic groups differ in their views. Black and Hispanic respondents are more likely to believe the U.S. can learn a great deal from other countries than White respondents. Specifically, 56% of Black individuals and 53% of Hispanic individuals hold this view, compared to 41% of White individuals [1]. These disparities underscore the intersection of race and political ideology in shaping opinions on international learning.\n\nRegarding the U.S.'s role in global affairs, the text quotes indicate that liberal Democrats are significantly more critical of the U.S. response to the pandemic and more pessimistic about its global influence. For instance, 81% of liberal Democrats think the U.S. has done an only fair or poor job dealing with the outbreak, compared to just 22% of conservative Republicans [6]. Moreover, 56% of liberal Democrats believe the U.S. will have less influence in world affairs, which is much higher than the 8% of conservative Republicans who hold this view [6].\n\nImage5 further illustrates these partisan divides by showing that liberal Democrats are far more likely to support helping other countries and to believe the U.S. should take a more active role in global affairs. For example, 64% of liberal Democrats believe the U.S. should help other countries, compared to just 22% of conservative Republicans [10]. This reflects a broader ideological divide in how different political groups perceive the U.S.'s responsibilities in international matters.\n\n![The bar chart shows that a majority of Americans believe the U.S. can learn a great deal or a fair amount from other countries about ways to slow the spread of the coronavirus, with notable differences across demographic groups.](image1)\n\n![The line graph indicates that opinions on the U.S. response to the coronavirus have shifted over time, with varying trends among different political groups.](image5) \n\nIn conclusion, partisan views differ significantly regarding the U.S.'s ability to learn from other countries and its role in global affairs during the coronavirus pandemic."}

While 60% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents believe the U.S. can learn a great deal, only 28% of Republicans and Republican leaners share that view [3]. This reflects a broader ideological divide in attitudes toward the U.S.'s role in global affairs. Additionally, the text notes that opinions on how well the U.S. is handling the coronavirus outbreak are most divided along party lines, with around three-quarters of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents being critical of the U.S.’s response, while similar shares of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents praise it [7].\n\nThe image quotes provide further insight into these differences. For instance, image1 shows that among Republicans, 76% believe the U.S. should let other countries deal with their own problems, compared to just 23% who think the U.S. should deal with its own problems [image1]. In contrast, 53% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents believe the U.S. should deal with its own problems, while 46% think the U.S. should help other countries [image1]. These figures highlight the strong partisan divide in views about the U.S.’s role in the world.\n\nWhen it comes to educational levels, the text indicates that higher education correlates with greater support for helping other countries. Specifically, 60% of postgraduates say the U.S. should help other countries deal with their problems, compared to 49% of college graduates, 34% of those with some college experience, and 29% of those with no more than a high school diploma [9]. This trend is also reflected in image1, which shows that as education level increases, so does the percentage of people who believe the U.S. should deal with its own problems. For example, 60% of postgraduates believe the U.S. should deal with its own problems, while only 29% of those with a high school diploma or less hold this view [image1].\n\n![U.S. views on dealing with its own problems versus helping other countries vary significantly by political affiliation and education level](image1)\n\nIn summary, views on whether the U.S. should deal with its own problems or help other countries are strongly influenced by political affiliation and educational level, with Republicans and less-educated individuals more likely to favor the U.S. focusing on its own issues, while Democrats and more-educated individuals are more supportive of the U.S. helping other countries."}

For instance, while 62% of Republicans believe the U.S. does too much to help solve world problems, only 8% think it does too little, and 29% say it does the right amount [3]. In contrast, a plurality of Democrats (48%) believe the U.S. does too little to help solve world problems, with 26% each saying it does the right amount or too much [3]. Furthermore, within the Democratic Party, there is a significant ideological divide: 64% of liberal Democrats support helping other countries, whereas only 44% of conservative and moderate Democrats share this view [7]. On the other hand, more than half of Democrats believe the U.S. should help other countries deal with their problems, while 46% think the U.S. should focus on its own problems [7]. Among Republicans, similar shares of conservatives and those who identify as more moderate or liberal agree that the U.S. should deal with its own problems [8].\n\nThese differences are also reflected in the data from the Pew Research Center, which indicates that higher levels of education correlate with greater support for helping other nations deal with their problems. For example, six-in-ten postgraduates say the U.S. should help other countries deal with their problems, while college graduates are evenly split on this issue [10]. In comparison, clear majorities of those with some college experience and those with no more than a high school diploma believe the U.S. should focus on its own problems [10].\n\nLooking at changes over time, the data suggests that the perception of the U.S. doing too much to help solve world problems has fluctuated. According to one line graph, the percentage of people who believe the U.S. does too much increased from 51% in 2013 to 41% in 2016, then rose again to 42% in 2018 [image1]. Another line graph shows a different trend, where the percentage of people who believe the U.S. does too much increased from 52% in 2013 to 62% in 2020 [image3]. These graphs illustrate how public opinion has shifted over the years, with some periods showing an increase in the belief that the U.S. does too much, while others show a decrease.\n\nIn addition, the perception of the U.S. doing the right amount has also changed over time. One line graph shows that the percentage of people who believe the U.S. does the right amount peaked at 37% in 2018 before declining to 29% in 2020 [image3]. Another graph shows a similar trend, with the percentage of people who believe the U.S. does the right amount starting at 28% in 2013 and fluctuating slightly, ending at 28% in 2018 and beyond [image1].\n\nThe perception of the U.S. doing too little to help solve world problems has also varied over time. One line graph shows that this percentage increased from 16% in 2013 to 48% in 2018, and then slightly dropped to 46% in 2020 [image5].

According to the text, about six-in-ten Republicans (62%) believe the U.S. does too much in helping address global challenges, while only 26% of Democrats share this view [1]. In contrast, a majority of Democrats (48%) say the U.S. does too little to help solve world problems, while 26% each say it does the right amount or too much [3]. This indicates that Republicans are more likely to think the U.S. oversteps in global affairs, whereas Democrats are more divided, with a significant portion believing the U.S. should do more.\n\nThe image quote (image1) provides further insight into these views. It shows that 60% of people believe the U.S. should deal with its own problems and let other countries manage as best they can, while 39% believe the U.S. should help other countries deal with their problems [image1]. By political affiliation, 76% of Republicans and 46% of Democrats hold the view that the U.S. should focus on its own problems [image1]. This reinforces the idea that political affiliation strongly influences opinions on U.S. global engagement.\n\nEducational attainment also plays a role in shaping views on U.S. global engagement. The text notes that those with higher levels of education are more supportive of helping other nations deal with their problems. For example, six-in-ten postgraduates say the U.S. should help other countries, while college graduates are evenly split [6]. In contrast, clear majorities of those with some college experience and those with no more than a high school diploma say the U.S. should deal with its own problems [6].\n\nThe image quote (image1) supports this trend. It shows that postgraduates are more likely to believe the U.S. should deal with its own problems (60%) compared to those with a high school degree or less (69%) [image1]. This suggests that higher education is associated with a greater likelihood of advocating for a more inward-focused U.S. policy.\n\nIn terms of dealing with domestic issues, the text highlights that opinions on how well the U.S. is handling the coronavirus outbreak are most divided along party lines. Around three-quarters of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents are critical of the U.S.’s response (73%), while similar shares of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents praise the country’s handling of the outbreak (71%) [2]. This indicates that political affiliation strongly influences perceptions of domestic performance.\n\nThe image quote (image2) provides additional context by showing evaluations of how well the U.S. has handled the pandemic across different demographics. While the specific percentages are not provided, the chart visually compares these evaluations across racial groups, age groups, educational attainment, and political affiliations. This suggests that there are significant differences in how various groups perceive the U.S. response to domestic issues.\n\nFinally, the text also notes that more educated Americans are more critical of how the U.S. has dealt with the disease. Around two-thirds of those with a postgraduate degree say the U.S. has done a poor job, compared to about four-in-ten of those with a high school degree or less [9]. This indicates that higher education is associated with a more critical view of the U.S. response to domestic issues.\n\nIn summary, views on U.S. global engagement and dealing with domestic issues differ significantly by political affiliation and educational attainment. Republicans are more likely to believe the U.S. should focus on its own problems, while Democrats are more divided.

Within this group, conservative Republicans are even more inclined toward a tough approach, with 81% favoring it, while moderate or liberal Republicans are more divided, with nearly equal shares viewing the tariffs as good or bad [2]. On the other hand, Democrats and Democrat-leaning independents show a preference for building stronger ties, with 60% supporting this approach, while only 37% favor getting tougher [3].\n\nThis divergence in preferences is closely tied to how each group perceives the impact of trade policies. Image5 shows that among Republicans and Republican-leaning independents, 51% believe the tariffs were good for the U.S., while only 25% think they were bad. In contrast, 60% of Democrats and Democrat-leaning independents view the tariffs as bad for the U.S., with only 14% seeing them as good [5]. These differing perceptions likely influence their stance on whether the U.S. should adopt a tougher or more cooperative approach with China.\n\nAdditionally, image1 provides further insight into the distribution of opinions across political groups. The chart indicates that, for example, 70% of the \"Total\" category supports building a strong relationship, while 26% favor getting tougher. However, within the \"Rep/Lean Rep\" group, 72% support getting tougher, highlighting the stark contrast between party lines [1].\n\nImage4 also reveals that while 44% of Americans believe the tariffs were ultimately bad for the U.S., 56% feel they had no real effect on them personally. This suggests that while there is concern about the overall impact of trade policies, many Americans do not see a direct personal consequence, which may explain the mixed reactions across different political groups [5].\n\nIn summary, the data shows that political affiliation strongly influences how Americans view the impact of trade policies with China and their preferences for dealing with the country. Republicans, especially conservatives, tend to support a tougher stance and believe the tariffs were beneficial, while Democrats, particularly liberals, favor building stronger relationships and view the tariffs negatively [3]. \n\n![The bar chart in image3 shows that 72% of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents prefer the U.S. to get tougher with China, while 26% support building a strong relationship.](image3)"}

In contrast, Democrats are more likely to see the tariffs as harmful, with 60% of Democrats and Democrat-leaning independents believing they were bad for the U.S. [3]. This divide is further emphasized by the fact that only 14% of Democrats think the tariffs were good for the U.S., compared to 51% of Republicans [10].\n\nWhen it comes to international students, the general public tends to view them positively, with 80% of Americans believing it is good for U.S. colleges and universities to accept international students [7]. However, there is a notable division when it comes specifically to Chinese students. A majority of Americans (55%) support limiting Chinese students studying in the U.S., while 43% oppose such limitations [8]. The data also shows that among those with a college degree, more oppose than support restricting the number of Chinese students, whereas a majority of those without a college degree are in favor [5].\n\nLooking at the specific data from the charts, we can see that the perception of the impact of tariffs varies significantly across political groups. For instance, 67% of Republicans and Republican leaners believe the tariffs were good for the U.S., while only 14% of Democrats and Democrat leaners share this view [10]. The chart also highlights that within the Republican group, conservative Republicans are more likely to see the tariffs as good for the U.S. (61%) compared to moderate or liberal Republicans (37%) [10].\n\n![The bar chart shows the percentage of respondents who believe something is \"Bad for the U.S.\" versus \"Good for the U.S.\" by political affiliation.](image3)\n\nIn terms of international students, the data suggests that the U.S. public generally sees them in a positive light, but opinions differ when it comes to Chinese students specifically. While 80% of Americans believe it is good for U.S. colleges and universities to accept international students, there is a clear split when it comes to Chinese students, with 55% supporting limits and 43% opposing them [8]. This split is reflected in the chart, which shows that 43% of the total population opposes restrictions on Chinese students, while 55% support them [5].\n\n![The bar chart shows the percentage of respondents who either oppose or support restrictions on Chinese students, categorized by political affiliation.](image5)\n\nIn summary, the perspectives of different political affiliations on the impacts of tariffs and international students in the U.S. show that Republicans are more likely to view tariffs as beneficial and have mixed views on international students, while Democrats are more likely to see tariffs as harmful and have more opposition to restrictions on Chinese students."}

For instance, among those aged 50 and older, roughly seven-in-ten support limiting Chinese students, while nearly two-thirds of those aged 18 to 29 oppose such limitations [3]. This trend aligns with the confidence levels in the Chinese leadership, as older Americans also show higher levels of distrust toward the Chinese president. Specifically, 53% of those aged 65 and older express no confidence at all in Xi Jinping, compared to only 35% of those aged 18 to 29 [10].\n\nPolitical affiliation also plays a crucial role in shaping these opinions. Republicans are more likely than Democrats to support limiting Chinese students, with about 69% of Republicans/Lean Republicans supporting such restrictions, compared to 42% of Democrats/Lean Democrats [4]. This divide is reflected in their confidence in the Chinese leadership as well. The data shows that Republicans/Lean Republicans have the highest levels of \"no confidence at all\" in Xi Jinping, with 50% expressing no confidence, whereas Democrats/Lean Democrats show more confidence, with only 31% having no confidence [4].\n\n![Confidence in Chinese leadership varies by age group](image1)\n\n![Opinions on limiting Chinese students differ by political affiliation](image4)\n\nThese findings suggest that both age and political affiliation influence public opinion on Chinese students in the U.S., and these opinions are closely linked to attitudes toward the Chinese leadership. Older individuals and Republicans tend to be more skeptical of China, which translates into greater support for restricting Chinese students. In contrast, younger individuals and Democrats are more open to Chinese students, reflecting lower levels of distrust toward the Chinese leadership."}

These concerns are not only significant but have also evolved over time, reflecting growing apprehension and shifting perceptions.\n\nOne of the most prominent concerns is China's human rights policies. According to the data, 90% of Americans believe that China does not respect personal freedoms, and half of them consider China’s human rights policy a very serious problem [10]. This concern has increased over the past year, with the percentage of Americans viewing China’s human rights policies as a very serious issue rising by 7 percentage points [10].\n\nEconomic issues also remain a major concern. A majority of Americans view China’s economy as powerful, but they are wary of its dominance as a manufacturing center, often at the expense of the environment or workers [1]. The U.S.-Chinese economic relationship is seen as fraught, with around two-thirds of Americans describing it as somewhat or very bad [1]. Additionally, the loss of U.S. jobs to China has become a more pressing issue, with the percentage of Americans considering this a very serious problem increasing from 47% in 2020 to 53% in 2021 [9].\n\nCyber attacks from China have also been a growing concern. The percentage of Americans who see cyber attacks from China as a very serious issue rose from 58% in 2020 to 65% in 2021 [9], indicating a clear upward trend in perceived threat.\n\nChina’s growing military power and technological capabilities are also seen as significant challenges. The percentage of Americans viewing these as very serious issues increased by 6 percentage points each from 2020 to 2021 [9]. This reflects a broader sense of unease about China’s rising influence on the global stage.\n\nThe image data further illustrates these trends. For example, the line graphs in image1 show that concerns about cyber attacks, human rights, job losses, military power, and technological growth have all increased significantly between 2020 and 2021 [image1]. This suggests a consistent pattern of growing anxiety among Americans regarding China’s actions and influence.\n\nMoreover, the bar chart in image2 highlights the level of confidence Americans have in Biden’s ability to deal with China. Only 53% of Americans have confidence in him to handle China effectively, which is lower than their confidence in him for other foreign policy issues [2]. This indicates that while there is some trust in Biden’s overall foreign policy, there is a notable lack of confidence specifically when it comes to China.\n\nThe graphical representation in image3 shows a stark divide in public opinion regarding the prioritization of economic relations versus human rights. While 26% of Americans prioritize strengthening economic ties with China even if it means not addressing human rights issues, 70% emphasize promoting human rights, even if it harms economic relations [3]. This highlights the tension between economic interests and moral considerations in U.S.-China relations.\n\nThe bar chart in image4 provides a broader context of public perceptions of China. It shows that concerns about human rights (20%) and the political system (17%) are among the most frequently mentioned issues, followed by economic concerns (19%) and threats (13%) [4]. This reinforces the idea that Americans are deeply concerned about both the internal practices of the Chinese government and its external actions.\n\nFinally, the line graphs in image5 illustrate how opinions have shifted over time, particularly among different political groups. The percentage of Republicans who view limiting China’s power as a top priority increased significantly from 39% in 2018 to 63% in 2021, while the percentage of Democrats who feel \"cold\" toward China also rose from 38% to 61% over the same period [5]. This suggests that concerns about China are not limited to one political ideology but are increasingly shared across the spectrum.\n\nIn summary, Americans’ key concerns regarding China include human rights, economic competition, cyber threats, military and technological growth, and the overall U.S.-China relationship. These concerns have grown over time, with significant increases in the percentage of Americans viewing these issues as very serious. ![Concerns about cyber attacks, human rights, job losses, military power, and technological growth have increased between 2020 and 2021](image1)."}

According to the data, the overall financial optimism among Hispanics increased by 14 percentage points, from 67% in 2008 to 81% in 2015 [9]. This increase was particularly notable among younger age groups, such as those aged 18-29, where the percentage of Latinos expecting improvement in their family's financial health rose by 13 points [5]. Similarly, for those aged 30-49 and 50-64, the increase was 16 points each [5].\n\nFor educational attainment, the data shows that Latinos who completed some college had a larger increase in economic optimism compared to those with a high school diploma or less. Specifically, the optimism increased by 20 percentage points for those with some college education, while it increased by 9 points for those with a high school diploma or less [2]. This trend reflects the impact of education on economic recovery and optimism during and after the Great Recession.\n\nGender also played a role in the changes in financial optimism. Both Latino men and Latina women showed increases in their optimism about their finances. Men experienced an 18-point increase, while women saw an 11-point increase [6]. This suggests that while both genders became more optimistic, men showed a greater increase.\n\nIn terms of nativity and immigration status, both U.S.-born and immigrant Hispanics saw a 14-point increase in their optimistic views about their family’s finances [6]. However, the second generation (U.S.-born children of immigrants) showed a higher level of optimism, with 86% expecting improvement, compared to 76% for the third generation or higher [image1].\n\nComparing the financial optimism of Hispanics to the general population, the data indicates that the gap between the two groups widened over time. In 2015, 81% of Hispanics expected their family's financial situation to improve, compared to 61% of the general public [3]. This 20-point gap is the largest since the series began. The general population's optimism increased by only 6 percentage points, from 56% in 2008 to 61% in 2015 [image3], which is significantly less than the 14-point increase seen among Hispanics.\n\n![The financial optimism among Hispanics increased by 14 percentage points from 2008 to 2015, reaching 81%, while the general public's optimism increased by 6 percentage points to 61%.](image3)\n\nOverall, the data highlights a substantial rise in financial optimism among various Hispanic subgroups from 2008 to 2015, outpacing the general population's increase in optimism.

This optimism extends to their children's financial futures, with 72% of Latino adults expecting their children to be better off financially than they themselves are now [2]. \n\nEducational attainment also plays a role in shaping these expectations. For instance, while 69% of Latinos with at least some college experience expect their children to be better off financially, 79% of high school graduates hold this belief, indicating that higher educational levels may correlate with greater optimism about children's financial futures [5]. However, it is important to note that even among those with less than a high school education, 71% share similar expectations [5].\n\nAdditionally, the data shows that older Latinos are generally more pessimistic about their children's financial futures compared to younger generations. Among those aged 65 and older, only 52% believe their children will be better off, whereas 75% of those aged 18 to 29 hold this expectation [9].

This growth was faster than that of the general population, which saw an increase of only 6 percentage points during the same period [7]. Additionally, 72% of Hispanic adults expressed optimism about their children’s financial future, indicating a strong belief in upward mobility [3].\n\nThe image data further supports this narrative. Image4, which shows the attitudes or opinions of Hispanic individuals and the general public from 2004 to 2015, reveals that Hispanic percentages were consistently higher than those of the general public. For instance, in 2004, 76% of Hispanics expressed positive views, compared to 70% for the general public, and by 2015, this gap widened to 81% for Hispanics versus 61% for the general public [4]. This suggests that while both groups experienced fluctuations, Latinos maintained a more optimistic outlook over time.\n\nIn contrast, unemployment trends for Latinos showed improvement but remained higher than for non-Hispanics. Image5 illustrates that the Hispanic unemployment rate declined from 12.8% in 2010 to 6.4% in 2015, yet it still exceeded the pre-recession low of 5% in 2006 and was higher than the rate for non-Hispanic workers in 2015 [6].

For instance, in 2015, the Hispanic unemployment rate was 6.4%, compared to 4.8% for non-Hispanics [6]. This persistent gap indicates ongoing challenges for the Hispanic community in securing stable employment.\n\nIn addition to unemployment rates, economic perceptions also differ. The data shows that Hispanics tend to have more optimistic views about their financial situations and future prospects. For example, 72% of Hispanics believe their children will be better off financially than they are now [5], and 35% of Hispanics said economic conditions today are good or excellent, which is higher than the 25% reported by whites [9]. These positive perceptions suggest a level of resilience and hope within the Hispanic community despite economic challenges.\n\nHowever, these positive perceptions do not always translate into improved economic outcomes. The median household income for Hispanics has stagnated since the Great Recession, with a median income of $42,491 in 2014, which is significantly lower than the $53,700 for all U.S. households [3]. Furthermore, the poverty rate for Hispanics in 2014 was 23.6%, compared to 14.8% for all U.S. households [3]. These disparities highlight the structural economic challenges faced by the Hispanic community.\n\nWealth disparities are even more pronounced. In 2013, the median wealth for Hispanic households was $13,700, compared to $81,400 for all U.S. households [3]. This stark difference underscores the long-term economic disadvantages that many Hispanic families face, which can be attributed to factors such as limited access to education, lower-paying jobs, and historical discrimination.\n\nThe line graph comparing the unemployment rates of Hispanics and non-Hispanics from 2000 to 2015 illustrates these trends clearly. The graph shows that while both groups experienced fluctuations, the Hispanic unemployment rate consistently remained higher than that of non-Hispanics [5].

An analysis of survey data from 2008 and 2015 indicates that Latino perceptions of their economic well-being have increased among most major demographic subgroups [1]. This trend is reflected in the percentage of Latinos who reported being in excellent or good financial shape, which rose from 21% in 2008 to 48% in 2015, a 27 percentage point increase [6]. Additionally, ratings of personal finances improved among most Latino groups, with gains recorded across various demographic subgroups such as U.S.-born Hispanics, foreign-born Hispanics, men, women, and different education levels [7][8].\n\nIn terms of family income relative to the cost of living, about half (53%) of Latinos in 2015 said their family income was not keeping up with the cost of living, while 37% said it was staying about even, and 10% said it was going up faster than the cost of living [3]. These figures suggest that while many Latinos still felt financially strained, there was a significant portion who believed their income was at least matching the cost of living. In contrast, whites reported some improvement in their family income relative to the cost of living over the same period, leading to fairly similar views between the three racial and ethnic groups in 2015 [2].\n\nThe changes in perceptions are also visible in the bar chart (image1), which compares the perceptions of family income relative to the cost of living among Hispanic, White, and Black adults in 2014 and 2015. The chart shows that in 2015, 53% of Hispanics felt their income was falling behind, compared to 49% of Whites and 51% of Blacks. In 2014, the percentages were 53% for Hispanics, 59% for Whites, and 55% for Blacks. This indicates that while the percentage of Hispanics feeling they are falling behind remained relatively stable, the percentage of Whites decreased significantly.\n\nFurthermore, the line graph (image2) illustrates trends over time for the \"General public\" and \"Hispanic\" groups, showing that the percentage of Hispanics rating their financial condition as excellent or good increased from 31% in 2004 to 40% in 2015, while the general public's positive view of their finances decreased from 51% in 2004 to 43% in 2015 [9]. This suggests that the improvement in financial perceptions among Latinos was more pronounced compared to the general population.\n\nThe bar chart (image3) provides further evidence of the improvements in perceptions among Latino groups, showing a general increase in support or approval from 2008 to 2015. For example, the age group 18-29 showed the most significant increase in positive financial views, with a 27% increase from 2008 to 2015. Similarly, the U.S.-born and foreign-born Hispanic groups saw increases of 17% and 18%, respectively.\n\nIn summary, perceptions of personal financial situations and family income relative to the cost of living among Latino groups improved significantly from 2008 to 2015, with most demographic subgroups showing gains in financial well-being and positive views of their economic situation. ![Improvements in financial perceptions among Latino groups](image3)"}

Similarly, only 47% of seniors have broadband at home, which is much lower than the general population's rate. However, within the senior population, there are notable differences. Younger seniors (ages 65-69) have higher rates of internet use (74%) and broadband adoption (65%) compared to those aged 80 and older, who have only 37% going online and 21% with broadband [5]. This trend aligns with the observation that internet use and broadband adoption drop off dramatically around age 75 [3].\n\nEducation also plays a significant role in internet and broadband adoption. College graduates among seniors have much higher rates of internet use (87%) and broadband access (76%) compared to those with only a high school education or less (40% and 27%, respectively) [5].

For those with higher education, technology is often seen as a positive force that enhances job interest and provides new opportunities. However, for those with lower educational attainment, the perception is generally more negative or neutral [6]. This disparity highlights the importance of addressing the digital divide and ensuring that all workers can benefit from technological advancements.\n\n![The bar chart indicates that higher education levels correlate with more positive perceptions of technology's impact on work.](image3)"}

This trend is consistent across various technologies, with college-educated workers showing a greater likelihood of perceiving positive impacts from tools like word processing software, smartphones, and email or social media [10].\n\nIn contrast, workers with lower educational levels often report more negative or neutral perceptions. For example, 44% of workers with high school degrees or less say that workplace technologies have not impacted their careers in any meaningful way, while 35% feel the same about email or social media [7]. Additionally, workers who have been personally impacted by automation are significantly more pessimistic about the impact of technology on their careers. Specifically, 46% of these workers feel that technology has decreased their opportunities for career advancement, and 34% feel it has made their work less interesting, compared to just 11% of those not impacted by automation [1].\n\nThe data also highlights that workers with higher education levels are more likely to view technology as making their work more demanding, but they are also more likely to see it as making their work less demanding. This suggests a more nuanced understanding of technology's role in the workplace [9].

Those who are more familiar with the concept tend to be more enthusiastic but also express substantial concerns, while those with less awareness show lower levels of both enthusiasm and worry.\n\nFor instance, individuals who have heard a lot about the idea of machines taking over human jobs are more likely to find the concept realistic and express some level of enthusiasm. Specifically, 47% of these high-awareness Americans are \"very/somewhat enthusiastic\" about the notion, compared to only 30% who have heard a little and 18% who have heard nothing at all [7]. However, despite this enthusiasm, they are also more worried, with 76% expressing \"very/somewhat worry\" about the concept, which is similar to the 72% of those who have heard a little and 69% of those who have heard nothing [9].\n\nThe data on enthusiasm and worry is further illustrated in image1, which shows the distribution of feelings among Americans. For \"Enthusiastic,\" 6% are \"Very\" enthusiastic, 27% are \"Somewhat\" enthusiastic, 47% are \"Not too\" enthusiastic, and 20% are \"Not at all\" enthusiastic. For \"Worried,\" 25% are \"Very\" worried, 48% are \"Somewhat\" worried, 23% are \"Not too\" worried, and 4% are \"Not at all\" worried. This indicates that while some Americans are relatively optimistic, a significant portion remains concerned about the impact of automation [image1].\n\nIn terms of expected outcomes, Americans generally anticipate more negative consequences than positive ones. For example, 76% believe that widespread automation will lead to much greater economic inequality, and 64% think people will have a hard time finding things to do with their lives [4]. On the other hand, only 25% expect the economy to create many new, well-paying jobs for humans, and even fewer expect other positive outcomes such as increased efficiency or more meaningful work [8].\n\nThese expectations are visualized in image4, which shows survey results regarding the likelihood of various outcomes. For negative outcomes, 76% believe that inequality between rich and poor will worsen, and 64% think people will struggle to find purpose. For positive outcomes, only 43% believe the economy will become more efficient, 42% think people can focus less on work, and 40% expect jobs to be more meaningful. Only 25% believe the economy will create many new, better-paying jobs [image4].\n\nOverall, while higher awareness of automation leads to greater enthusiasm, it does not eliminate concern. Americans expect a range of outcomes, but the majority anticipate negative consequences, particularly increased inequality and difficulty in finding purpose in life. The interplay between awareness, enthusiasm, and worry highlights the complex public sentiment surrounding the future of automation."}

Specifically, 6% of this group reported losing a job due to automation, and 11% experienced reduced pay or hours [2]. This is higher than the overall average of 2% for job loss and 5% for pay or hours reduction [2]. The image quote (image3) visually represents these disparities, showing that younger age groups face a greater risk of being affected by automation compared to older groups. This suggests that younger workers may have more immediate concerns about the impact of technology on their careers.\n\nIn terms of education levels, workers with higher educational attainment generally express more positive views about the impact of technology on their work. For instance, college graduates are more likely to feel that technology has made their work more interesting (64%) and increased their opportunities for career advancement (53%) compared to those with only a high school diploma or less (38% and 32%, respectively) [8]. The image quote (image4) illustrates this clearly, showing that higher education levels correlate with more positive perceptions of technology's impact on work.\n\nAdditionally, the perception of technology's impact varies across different types of technologies. For example, word processing or spreadsheet software is seen as having a positive impact by 70% of workers, while industrial robots are viewed positively by only 27% [1]. The image quote (image1) provides a detailed breakdown of these perceptions, highlighting that some technologies are more favorably received than others.\n\nOverall, the evidence suggests that younger workers and those with lower educational attainment tend to have more negative perceptions of the impact of automation and technology on their careers.

Workers with higher educational attainment, such as college graduates, tend to have more positive views about the effects of technology on their careers compared to those with less education. For instance, college graduates are substantially more likely to say that technology has made their work more interesting (64% vs. 38%) and has increased their opportunities for career advancement (53% vs. 32%) [1]. In contrast, workers lacking a college education are much less likely to express positive attitudes towards the current generation of workforce technologies [2].\n\nMoreover, the survey highlights that the benefits of these tools are most likely to accrue to workers with high levels of formal educational attainment [4]. This trend is also reflected in the data showing that workers with college degrees are more likely than those without to say that each of the six common workforce technologies—such as word processing software, smartphones, email, and industrial robots—has had a positive impact on their jobs or careers [7]. However, the impact of technology is not uniformly positive. Many workers express mixed views about the impact of various workforce technologies [3], and some even view them as damaging to their career prospects.\n\nFor example, the perception of the impact of specific technologies varies. While word processing or spreadsheet software is seen as having a positive impact by 70% of workers, only 27% view industrial robots positively [5]. Additionally, the image titled \"Perceived impact of various technologies\" illustrates this variability, showing that while most technologies are seen as having a positive effect, a significant portion of workers perceive them as having no impact or even a negative one [5].\n\nThe image titled \"Bar chart comparing the perceived benefits of education level\" further supports this notion. It shows that individuals with higher education levels are more likely to feel that their education made their work more interesting and increased their opportunities for advancement [4]. Specifically, 64% of college graduates believe technology made their work more interesting, compared to 38% of those with a high school diploma or less [1].\n\nFurthermore, the image titled \"Likelihood of different jobs or professions being affected\" indicates that certain jobs, such as fast food worker and insurance claims processor, are more likely to be affected by automation than others, such as software engineers or nurses [3]. This suggests that the impact of technology is not evenly distributed across all professions, with some roles facing greater risks of automation than others.\n\nIn addition, the image titled \"Percentage of U.S. adults in different age groups who either lost a job or had their pay or hours reduced\" reveals that younger age groups, particularly those aged 18-24, are more likely to experience job loss or reduced pay compared to older age groups [1]. This could imply that younger workers may be more vulnerable to the negative impacts of technological changes in the workforce.\n\nOverall, the evidence suggests that perceptions of the impact of workforce automation and technology are shaped by factors such as education level, age, and occupation. College-educated workers generally report more positive experiences with technology, while those with less education and younger workers face greater challenges and uncertainties.

This suggests that platforms may need to adjust their approaches based on age and gender, ensuring that their recommendations and advertisements align with the comfort levels and expectations of different user groups.\n\n![Men are more likely than women to see people being mean or bullying on social media.](image2)  \n![Women are more likely than men to see people being kind or supportive on social media.](image2)  \n![Men are more likely than women to see people being deceptive on social media.](image2)  \n![Both men and women see an equal mix of deceptiveness and attempts to correct misinformation.](image2)"}

For instance, when it comes to recommending events in their area, a majority of users from all age groups find this acceptable. According to the data, 67% of users aged 65+ approve, while 80% of those aged 30-49 do so [1]. This indicates that younger users are generally more comfortable with such data usage compared to older users.\n\n![Recommendations for events in their area by age group](image1)\n\nHowever, when it comes to recommending people they might want to know, there is a notable divide. Younger users (ages 18-29 and 30-49) show higher approval rates (66% and 67%, respectively) compared to older users (ages 65+ and 50-64), who have approval rates of 36% and 53%, respectively [1]. This suggests that younger users are more open to personalized social recommendations, while older users are more cautious.\n\n![Recommendations for people they might want to know by age group](image1)\n\nIn terms of showing advertisements for products or services, the acceptance rate is lower across all age groups. Only 39% of users aged 65+ find this acceptable, compared to 60% of those aged 30-49 [1]. This highlights a general discomfort with targeted advertising, especially among older users.\n\n![Ads for products or services by age group](image1)\n\nWhen it comes to political messaging, the data shows that users are particularly wary. A significant portion of users, especially those aged 65+, find it unacceptable for social media platforms to use their data to deliver messages from political campaigns. Specifically, 31% of users aged 65+ find this not acceptable at all, which is double the percentage of those who find it very acceptable (11%) [1].\n\n![Political messages by age group](image1)\n\nOverall, user comfort with the use of their data by social media platforms is heavily context-dependent. While many users are comfortable with data being used to recommend events or connect with others, they are less comfortable with its use for advertising or political messaging. This context-dependency is reflected in the survey results, where the acceptability of data usage varies based on the specific purpose and the age of the user.\n\nIn summary, different age groups perceive the acceptability of social media platforms using their data for various purposes differently, with younger users generally more accepting of data usage for recommendations and older users more cautious, especially regarding political messaging."}

For instance, the personal finance score algorithm is seen as effective by 54% of Americans but only 32% find it fair, creating a 22-percentage-point gap between effectiveness and fairness [5]. This discrepancy suggests that while people may believe these systems can perform their intended tasks well, they are less confident in their fairness. In contrast, the criminal risk score for parole decisions is viewed as both effective (49%) and fair (50%) by nearly equal shares of the population, indicating a more balanced perception [3].\n\nThe video job interview analysis system is considered somewhat less effective (39%) and fair (33%), with a smaller gap of 6 percentage points [3]. Similarly, resume screening is seen as effective by 47% and fair by 43%, with a 4-point difference [3]. These differences suggest that while some systems are perceived as performing their tasks adequately, there is a general concern about whether they treat individuals fairly.\n\nPublic trust in these systems is further complicated by demographic variations. For example, Black and Hispanic individuals are more likely to find the personal finance score fair compared to white individuals, but they express more concern about the fairness of the parole scoring algorithm [3]. This highlights how trust in automated systems can be influenced by race and ethnicity, with different groups having distinct concerns about bias and fairness.\n\nMoreover, the public is generally skeptical about the fairness of these systems. Only 32% of Americans think the personal finance score is fair, and 33% think the video job interview analysis is fair [7]. This skepticism is also reflected in the broader belief that computer programs will always reflect some level of human bias, with 58% of Americans holding this view [6].\n\nThe data also shows that public acceptance of these systems is low. Two-thirds of Americans find the personal finance score algorithm unacceptable, and 67% say the computer-aided video job analysis is unacceptable [9]. This lack of acceptance underscores a deep-seated distrust in the fairness and ethical implications of using algorithms for decision-making.\n\nOverall, the differences in perceptions of fairness and effectiveness across various automated systems indicate a nuanced and often critical public view of algorithmic decision-making. While some systems are seen as effective, the general lack of confidence in their fairness suggests that public trust remains low, particularly when it comes to sensitive areas like personal finance and criminal justice.\n\n![The bar chart compares perceptions of fairness regarding automated decision-making systems in four scenarios.](image4)"}

Regarding responsibility, a majority of the public, including 64% of Democrats and 32% of Republicans, believe Trump has a responsibility to release his tax returns [3]. This reflects a broader pattern of skepticism toward Trump's transparency and ethical standards, which are viewed as lower than those of officials in previous administrations, often measured during specific ethical controversies [4]. \n\nTrust in Trump's statements is also notably lower compared to previous presidents. A majority of the public (58%) says they trust what Trump says less than they trusted what previous presidents said while in office, with only 26% trusting him more and 14% saying their trust is about the same [10]. This distrust is even more pronounced among Democrats and Democratic leaners, with 94% expressing less trust in Trump's statements compared to previous presidents [5]. In contrast, among Republicans and Republican leaners, most (58%) say they trust what Trump says more than previous presidents, while 25% say they trust his statements about the same as past leaders, and 15% trust them less [8].\n\nThese perceptions are closely tied to partisan views. For instance, the bar chart in image1 shows that trust in Trump varies significantly across political affiliations over time. While 60% of the total population trusted Trump in January 2017, this dropped to 57% in January 2018 and rose slightly to 64% in January 2019. However, among Republicans/Lean Republicans, trust was lower, starting at 38% in January 2017 and dropping to 28% in January 2018 before rising to 32% in January 2019. Conversely, among Democrats/Lean Democrats, trust in Trump increased sharply from 79% in January 2017 to 91% in January 2019 [image1].\n\nThe bar chart in image3 further illustrates these differences.

In contrast, 76% of Republicans and Republican leaners say that ethical standards of top administration officials are excellent or good [10]. These figures highlight a stark partisan divide.\n\nWhen it comes to economic impact, the public generally sees Trump’s impact on the economy in a positive light. About 40% think that Trump’s policies have made economic conditions better since taking office, while 28% say they have made conditions worse [4]. However, this perception is highly polarized. For instance, 79% of Republicans and Republican leaners believe that Trump’s economic policies have improved conditions, whereas 46% of Democrats and Democratic leaners say they have made things worse [9]. The chart in image4 illustrates this polarization clearly, showing that Republicans are much more likely to view Trump's economic policies positively than Democrats [image4].\n\nIn terms of long-term success, about two-thirds of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents (65%) say Trump will be a successful president in the long run [3], while only 29% of the general public hold this view [5]. This reflects a significant partisan divide. The data also shows that low expectations for Trump’s legacy are prevalent, with 47% thinking he will be an unsuccessful president in the long run [5]. Comparing this to previous presidents, the share of people who say it is too early to tell if Trump will be successful is much lower than at comparable points for previous presidents like Obama, Bush, and Clinton [2]. For example, at the start of Obama’s third year in office, nearly half of the public said it was too early to tell whether he would be successful [2].\n\nImage5 provides a visual comparison of perceptions of presidential success among party affiliates. It shows that for Trump (January 2019), 65% of Republicans and Republican leaners believe he will be successful, while 80% of Democrats and Democratic leaners think he will be unsuccessful [image5]. This contrasts sharply with how Republicans viewed Bush in his third year, where 69% thought he would be successful, and how Democrats viewed Bush, with 37% thinking he would be unsuccessful [6]. Similarly, for Clinton in February 1995, 32% of Democrats thought he would be successful, while 54% thought he would be unsuccessful [5].\n\nIn summary, perceptions of Trump's presidency in terms of trust, ethical standards, economic impact, and long-term success are deeply divided along political lines, with Republicans generally more favorable and Democrats more critical.

The data shows that for Trump in January 2019, 65% of Republicans thought he would be successful, whereas for Obama in January 2011, only 7% of Republicans held this view. Similarly, for Bush in December 2003, 69% of Republicans believed he would be successful, and for Clinton in February 1995, 8% of Republicans thought he would be successful.

For example, the share of people who say it is too early to tell whether Trump will be successful is much lower than at comparable points for previous presidents. At the start of Barack Obama’s third year in office, nearly half (47%) said it was too early to tell, compared to 38% for George W. Bush and 43% for Clinton [4]. In contrast, for Trump, only 25% of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents said it was too early to tell, and 16% of Democrats and Democratic leaners shared this view [2]. This suggests that public opinion on Trump's presidency has been more decisive, with fewer people expressing uncertainty.\n\nAnother trend is the polarization of views on Trump's economic policies. Since the fall of 2017, partisans have become more polarized in their assessments of his economic policies. Nearly eight-in-ten Republicans and Republican leaners (79%) say that his economic policies have improved conditions in the country, up from 63% in October 2017 [8]. Conversely, almost half (46%) of Democrats now say his economic policies have made things worse, indicating a growing divide between partisan opinions.\n\n![The image is a chart comparing opinions from January 2019 and October 2017 on whether something made things better, had not much effect, or made things worse.

For Trump, 47% of Americans believe he will be unsuccessful, which is far higher than the share who said this about his three most recent predecessors at comparable points in their first term [9]. This indicates a generally more negative outlook on Trump's legacy compared to previous presidents.\n\n![The image is a bar chart showing public opinion on how successful recent U.S. presidents will be in the long run. The data is categorized into three groups: \"Successful,\" \"Unsuccessful,\" and \"Too early to tell.\"](image3)\n\nOverall, perceptions of Trump's presidency are marked by strong partisan divides, with Republicans largely optimistic about his success and Democrats predominantly pessimistic. Public opinion on Trump has shown less uncertainty compared to previous presidents, and there has been a noticeable increase in polarization regarding his economic policies.

These shifts in political affiliation have had a direct impact on views regarding Wall Street's effect on the economy.\n\nAs highlighted in text quote [7], more Republicans believe that Wall Street helps the economy more than it hurts (55%) compared to 31% who think it hurts the economy more. In contrast, text quote [3] reveals that Democrats are more divided, with 46% believing Wall Street hurts the economy more and 41% thinking it helps. This partisan divide is further illustrated in image4, which shows that Republicans are more likely to view Wall Street positively, while Democrats are more likely to see it negatively. The chart also indicates that overall, 46% of Americans believe Wall Street helps the economy more, while 39% think it hurts it [8].\n\n![Public dissatisfaction with the way things are going in the country has increased significantly from 1990 to 2019.](image2)  \n![Political affiliation trends show shifting support between Republicans and Democrats over time, with the gap narrowing under Trump.](image5)  \n![Views on Wall Street's impact on the economy are divided along partisan lines, with Republicans more likely to view it positively and Democrats more likely to view it negatively.](image4)\n\nIn conclusion, public satisfaction with the state of the nation has declined sharply from 1990 to 2019, and this decline has been accompanied by shifting political affiliations, with a narrowing gap between Republicans and Democrats. These trends have reinforced party divisions in opinions about Wall Street's impact on the economy, with Republicans generally viewing it more favorably than Democrats."}

In contrast, 62% of Republicans attribute the rise in cases mainly to increased testing [5]. This divergence in perception likely influences their stances on lifting restrictions.\n\nDemocrats are more likely to express concern that restrictions have been lifted too quickly. Overwhelming shares of both liberal and conservative Democrats (93% and 88%, respectively) say they are more concerned that state restrictions on public activity have been lifted too quickly [2]. Similarly, 82% of Democrats point to some places being too quick to ease restrictions as a major reason for the outbreak continuing, compared to only 31% of Republicans [3].\n\nOn the other hand, Republicans show a more divided perspective. While 53% of conservative Republicans believe that the increase in cases is primarily due to more people being tested, 45% think it's because of more new infections [5]. Additionally, about six-in-ten conservative Republicans say their concern is that state restrictions are not being lifted quickly enough, while a similar share of moderate and liberal Republicans (57%) express more concern that restrictions have been lifted too quickly [1].\n\nThe bar chart in image1 highlights that \"Restrictions have been lifted too quickly in some places\" is seen as a major reason by 58% of respondents, with 25% considering it a minor reason and 17% not a reason at all [image1]. This aligns with the data showing that Democrats are more concerned about restrictions being lifted too quickly, while Republicans are more divided on this issue.\n\nFurthermore, image3 illustrates the disparity in agreement with statements about the causes of the spread. For example, 82% of Democrats believe that the inadequate response from the federal government is a major reason for the continued outbreak, compared to 21% of Republicans [image3]. This suggests that Democrats are more likely to attribute the ongoing spread to systemic issues, which may contribute to their concerns about premature lifting of restrictions.\n\nIn summary, views on the causes of increased COVID-19 cases are closely linked to opinions on lifting restrictions, with Democrats generally more concerned about restrictions being lifted too quickly and attributing the spread to factors like inadequate federal response and insufficient social distancing, while Republicans are more divided, with many attributing the increase in cases to increased testing [image1][image3]. \n\n![The bar chart shows that \"Restrictions have been lifted too quickly in some places\" is considered a major reason by 58% of respondents.](image1)"}

This indicates that within the Democratic Party, non-White groups are more supportive of this policy than their White counterparts.\n\nText quote [3] highlights that Republicans continue to overwhelmingly support this policy, with 93% in favor. This suggests a strong alignment with the policy among Republican voters, regardless of race. However, text quote [7] provides further insight, showing that among Republicans, White adults are less supportive than Hispanic adults of policies aimed at easing voting. For instance, about half of Hispanic Republicans (51%) favor automatically registering all eligible citizens to vote, compared with 35% of White Republicans. This implies that even within the Republican Party, there are variations in support for voting policies.\n\nThe image quotes provide visual representations of these trends. Image1, a bar chart depicting public opinion on early and absentee voting, shows that a significant majority of respondents support open early or absentee voting. Specifically, 63% of the total population support this, with higher percentages among Black (81%) and Asian (67%) groups compared to White (59%) and Hispanic (63%) groups. While this image does not directly address the requirement of government-issued photo identification, it illustrates broader attitudes toward voting accessibility.\n\nImage2 and image3 offer additional context by comparing values associated with different racial groups. The numbers provided for each group suggest varying levels of support for specific policies. For example, White individuals have numbers 54 and 96, while Black individuals have 65, indicating potential differences in policy preferences. These images, however, lack explicit context, making it challenging to interpret the exact meaning of the numbers without additional information.\n\nImage4 and image5 also present numerical data across racial groups, with numbers such as 35, 85 for White and 78 for Black, suggesting possible differences in policy preferences.

This aligns with data from image3, which shows that 81% of Black respondents support open early or absentee voting, compared to 59% of White respondents [3]. The chart also reveals that Black individuals are significantly more supportive of allowing any voter to vote early or absentee, with only 17% believing that documented reasons should be required [3].\n\nRegarding the requirement for government-issued photo identification, the data suggests that Black, Hispanic, and Asian Democrats are more likely to support this policy than White Democrats.

To address this, we can analyze the relevant text and image quotes.\n\nRegarding the proposal for independent redistricting, the text quote [8] indicates that nearly half of U.S. adults approve of a proposal by House Democrats to require states to put together redistricting commissions composed of equal numbers of Democrats and Republicans. Specifically, 49% approve, 13% disapprove, and 38% are unsure. The image quote [image2] provides a visual representation of these approval, disapproval, and uncertainty ratings among different groups. It shows that 49% of the total population approve, while 13% disapprove and 38% are unsure. For Republicans or lean Republicans, the approval rate is 38%, with 19% disapproving and 42% unsure. For Democrats or lean Democrats, the approval rate is 59%, with 8% disapproving and 32% unsure. This suggests that while there is general support for the proposal, there are significant differences in opinion between political parties.\n\nNow, turning to views on early and absentee voting options, the text quotes provide a detailed breakdown. According to quote [6], slightly more than six-in-ten (63%) now say that any voter should have the option to vote early or absentee, while 36% say that voters should only be allowed to vote early or absentee if they have a documented reason for not voting in person on Election Day. The image quote [image1] visually represents this data, showing that 36% of the total population believe documentation should be required, while 63% support open early or absentee voting. Among White voters, 41% require documented reasons, while 59% support open voting. Black voters show strong support for open voting, with 81% supporting it, while 17% require documented reasons. Hispanic voters have 63% supporting open voting, and 36% requiring documented reasons. Asian voters also show strong support for open voting, with 67% supporting it, while 33% require documented reasons.\n\nEducational attainment also plays a role in these views. College graduates or higher show 74% support for open voting, while 25% require documented reasons. Those without a college degree have 57% support for open voting, with 42% requiring documented reasons.\n\nPolitical affiliation is a key factor. Republicans or lean Republicans show 38% support for open voting, with 62% requiring documented reasons. Within this group, conservative Republicans are more likely to require documented reasons (70%), while moderate and liberal Republicans are evenly divided, with 49% requiring documented reasons and 51% supporting open voting. Democrats or lean Democrats show strong support for open voting, with 84% supporting it, while only 16% require documented reasons. Among Democrats, conservative and moderate Democrats show 79% support for open voting, while liberal Democrats show even stronger support, with 91% supporting open voting.\n\nAdditionally, the text quote [10] highlights that among Republicans who voted absentee or by mail, about half (52%) favor no-excuse absentee or early voting, while only about a third of early, in-person GOP voters (35%) and just 22% of those who voted in person on Election Day say the same. Among Democrats, there are only slight differences in these views between those who voted absentee and those who voted in person.\n\nIn summary, the proposal for independent redistricting has mixed support, with more support from Democrats and less from Republicans. Views on early and absentee voting options vary significantly by race, education, and political affiliation, with Democrats generally more supportive of open voting options compared to Republicans. The image [image1] provides a clear visual representation of these differences, highlighting the stark contrast between political parties and racial groups in their attitudes toward early and absentee voting. ![Support for open early or absentee voting](image1)."}

This trend is consistent with earlier years, as the strength of this affiliation has not shifted significantly over the past few years. However, it is worth noting that while the overall party identification has remained steady, there is still uncertainty about future party alignment, as some Latino voters maintain soft ties to political parties [3].\n\nThe image quote provides additional context on how Latino voters perceive former President Donald Trump's role in national politics. The bar chart shows that 73% of Latino registered voters believe Trump should not remain a national political figure, with only 25% supporting him or a candidate who shares his views [image1]. This suggests that while the majority of Latino voters do not support Trump, there is still a notable minority who align with his policies.\n\nLooking at the broader political landscape, the line graph in image2 illustrates the trends in party affiliation for both the Democratic and Republican parties from 2019 to 2022. The Democratic Party saw a slight increase in support, rising from 62% in 2019 to 64% in 2022, while the Republican Party experienced a small decline, dropping from 34% in 2019 to 33% in 2022. This indicates a modest but consistent preference for the Democratic Party among the general electorate during this period.\n\nIn terms of election issues, the importance of various topics has evolved over time. In March 2022, the economy was the top issue for Latino voters, with 80% considering it very important [10]. However, by August 2022, abortion had risen significantly in importance, with 57% of Latino voters now viewing it as very important, up from 42% in March [8]. Other issues such as healthcare, violent crime, and education also remained highly important, with around 70% of voters considering them significant [10]. This shift highlights the growing influence of social issues, particularly abortion, in shaping voter decisions.\n\nThe chart in image3 visually represents this evolution, showing how the perceived importance of issues has changed between March and August 2022. Abortion, in particular, saw a sharp increase in importance, reflecting the impact of the Supreme Court’s decision to end the federal guarantee of a right to legal abortion [8].\n\nWhen examining preferences based on demographic factors, the bar chart in image4 reveals notable differences. For instance, Latino registered voters who consider their identity extremely or very important to their self-conception are more likely to support Democratic candidates (60% vs. 21% for Republicans) [7]. Similarly, religious affiliation plays a role in voting preferences, with Catholics and those with no religious affiliation showing stronger support for Democrats compared to Evangelical Protestants, who tend to favor Republicans [4].\n\nAdditionally, the chart in image5 highlights the perceived differences among Hispanics based on political affiliation. A majority of Hispanics, regardless of their political leanings, believe there is a significant difference between Democrats and Republicans. For example, 45% of all Hispanics feel there is a great deal of difference between the two parties, while 36% see a fair amount of difference [5]. These perceptions suggest that political identity remains a key factor in shaping views on party alignment.\n\nIn conclusion, Latino voters have maintained a strong preference for the Democratic Party from 2019 to 2022, with the economy being a top issue until the rise of abortion as a critical concern. Demographic factors such as identity and religious affiliation further influence voting preferences, highlighting the diversity within the Latino community. ![The image is a bar chart depicting the opinions of Latino registered voters and various subgroups regarding former President Donald Trump's role as a national political figure and the 2024 presidential election.](image1)"}

In contrast, majorities of older Hispanics (ages 50-64 and 65+) have a negative view of socialism, with 60% and 61% respectively expressing negative opinions. This pattern is consistent with the broader trend observed in the U.S. public, where younger individuals tend to have more favorable views of socialism compared to older generations.\n\nIn summary, Hispanic perceptions of socialism and capitalism differ by political affiliation and age groups, with Republicans and older Hispanics generally holding more negative views of socialism and more positive views of capitalism compared to Democrats and younger Hispanics. ![The bar chart shows the distribution of opinions among different Hispanic groups regarding a specific subject, highlighting significant differences in their views on socialism and capitalism.](image1)"}

According to the data, a larger share of Hispanics have a negative impression of socialism (53%) compared to a positive one (41%), while they generally hold more positive views toward capitalism, with 54% having a positive impression and 41% a negative one [5]. This trend is reflected in the bar chart (image1), which shows that \"All Hispanics\" have a net positive attitude toward capitalism (54%) and a net negative attitude toward socialism (41%). \n\nWhen examining political affiliations, Hispanic Democrats and Democratic leaners are split on their views of socialism, with 48% having a negative view and 50% a positive one [4]. In contrast, Hispanic Republicans and Republican leaners have a much more positive view of capitalism, with 68% expressing a positive impression, compared to 50% among Hispanic Democrats and Democratic leaners [6]. The same bar chart (image1) highlights this disparity, showing that \"Rep/Lean Rep\" have a net positive attitude of 68% for capitalism and a net negative of 29%, whereas \"Dem/Lean Dem\" have a net positive of 50% and a net negative of 47%.\n\nThe stacked bar chart (image3) further illustrates these differences, showing that Hispanic Republicans and Republican leaners have a higher percentage of negative perceptions of socialism (72%) compared to Hispanic Democrats and Democratic leaners (48%).

These differences are evident in both the text and image quotes provided.\n\nAccording to the text quotes, a substantial share of Latinos, particularly immigrants, Spanish speakers, Catholics, and evangelicals, believe that Democrats work hard to earn their votes [2]. However, relatively few Latinos say that Republicans try hard to earn their votes, with only 19% of all Latinos agreeing with this statement [3]. Among Latino Republicans, 40% say the statement describes their views well, compared with only 13% of Latino Democrats [3]. This suggests that while some Latino Republicans feel that the Republican Party is making an effort to win their support, the majority of Latino Democrats do not perceive the same level of effort from the Democratic Party [3].\n\nThe image quotes provide further insight into these perceptions. Image4 shows a bar chart that highlights how different groups perceive the efforts of political parties to earn Latino votes. For example, among all Latinos, 52% believe that the parties do not do a good job, while 19% think they do a very good job [4]. Among Democrats and lean Democrats, 64% believe that the parties do not do a good job, whereas among Republicans and lean Republicans, 27% believe that the parties do not do a good job [4]. This indicates that there is a significant divide in how different political affiliations perceive the efforts of the parties to earn Latino votes.\n\nImage5 also provides data on how different groups of Latinos assess the efforts of political parties. It shows that among all Latinos, 26% believe that the parties do not do a good job, 35% believe they do a somewhat good job, and 36% believe they do a very good job [5]. Among Democrats, 13% believe that the parties do not do a good job, 35% believe they do a somewhat good job, and 51% believe they do a very good job [5]. In contrast, among Republicans, 46% believe that the parties do not do a good job, 23% believe they do a somewhat good job, and 29% believe they do a very good job [5].

While some groups, such as immigrants and Spanish speakers, tend to view the Democratic Party more favorably, others, such as Latino Republicans, may have a more positive view of the Republican Party. These differences highlight the importance of understanding the diverse perspectives within the Latino community when analyzing political trends and strategies."}

For instance, among Hispanic Republicans and Republican leaners, 56% believe the Democratic Party works hard to earn their votes, while only 35% of Hispanic Democrats and Democratic leaners think the Republican Party does the same [1]. This indicates a notable disparity in how each party is perceived by its own supporters versus those of the opposing party.\n\nLooking at the image quotes, specifically image4, we can see that for the statement \"Works hard to earn Latinos’ votes,\" the Democratic Party received a net positive response of 71%, compared to 45% for the Republican Party. This suggests that, overall, the Democratic Party is seen as more effective in engaging Latino voters. Additionally, for the statement \"Really cares about Latinos,\" the Democratic Party had a net positive response of 63%, while the Republican Party had only 34% [4]. These figures highlight a clear preference for the Democratic Party's engagement efforts among Latino voters.\n\nImage5 provides further insight into these perceptions. It shows that among Hispanic Democrats and Democratic leaners, 81% believe the Democratic Party works hard to earn their votes, whereas only 56% of Hispanic Republicans and Republican leaners hold this view about the Democratic Party. Conversely, 72% of Hispanic Republicans and Republican leaners believe the Republican Party works hard to earn their votes, compared to just 35% of Hispanic Democrats and Democratic leaners who think the same about the Republican Party [5].\n\nThese differing perceptions are also reflected in the party affiliation trends over recent years. According to the text quotes, Latino registered voters identify with or lean toward the Democratic Party over the Republican Party by a nearly two-to-one margin (64% vs. 33%) [2]. However, it is noted that Latino party identification has shifted little over the past few years [10], indicating a relatively stable but still strongly Democratic-leaning electorate.\n\nIn summary, the perceptions of the Democratic and Republican parties' efforts to engage with Latino voters differ significantly between political affiliations, with the Democratic Party generally viewed more favorably. These perceptions have contributed to a consistent Democratic lean among Latino voters, although there is still some uncertainty about future party affiliation [4]. \n\n![The image shows a chart comparing perceptions of the Democratic and Republican parties regarding their relationship with Latino voters.](image4)"}

According to the 2022 National Survey of Latinos by Pew Research Center, fewer than half of Hispanics say there is a great deal of difference between the Democratic and Republican parties [1]. This suggests that while some Hispanics perceive significant differences, many do not see a clear distinction between the two parties. The survey also reveals that about half of Hispanics do not see a great deal of difference between the parties, with 36% saying there is a fair amount of difference and 16% saying there is hardly any difference at all [6]. This indicates a general lack of strong differentiation in how Hispanics view the parties.\n\nWhen it comes to support for political parties, Hispanics broadly have a more positive view of the Democratic Party than the GOP. Majorities of Hispanics say the Democratic Party represents their interests well, while a smaller share (34%) say the same about the Republican Party [5]. Additionally, the survey found that Latino registered voters identify with or lean toward the Democratic Party over the Republican Party by a nearly two-to-one margin (64% vs. 33%) [8]. This trend has remained relatively stable over recent years, indicating little change in party affiliation among Hispanics [10].\n\nThe image data further supports these findings. For instance, the image shows that a majority of Democrats and those leaning Democratic believe the Democratic Party \"really cares about Latinos\" (78%) and \"works hard to earn Latinos' votes\" (81%) [9]. In contrast, only 36% of Republicans and those leaning Republican believe the Democratic Party \"really cares about Latinos,\" and 56% believe it \"works hard to earn Latinos' votes.\" On the other hand, a larger share of Republicans and those leaning Republican believe the Republican Party \"really cares about Latinos\" (68%) and \"works hard to earn Latinos' votes\" (72%) [9].\n\n![The image displays survey results regarding perceptions of how well the Democratic and Republican parties care about and work to earn Latino votes.](image1)\n\nThe line graph in image2 provides a historical perspective on party support.

However, when it comes to other job characteristics, there are notable divergences. Men in STEM tend to place a higher value on opportunities for promotion and high pay, with 57% of men and 46% of women valuing promotion opportunities, and 59% of men and 48% of women valuing high pay [4]. On the other hand, women in STEM are more likely to value jobs that make a meaningful contribution to society (60% vs. 51%) and jobs focused on helping others (59% vs. 31%) [7].\n\nThese differences in job preferences may relate to the challenges women face in entering and remaining in STEM fields. For instance, women in STEM are more likely to experience discrimination at work due to their gender and to consider discrimination a major reason for the underrepresentation of women in these fields [3]. Additionally, many women in STEM report concerns about pay gaps and unequal treatment from coworkers, which could influence their job preferences and career choices [3]. The perception that STEM jobs are more difficult to get into and less focused on helping others might also contribute to the lower interest among women in pursuing these careers [6].\n\nFurthermore, the public image of STEM jobs includes higher pay and an advantage in attracting young talent compared with other industry sectors [6]. However, the reality for many women in STEM is different, as they often face barriers such as lack of encouragement from an early age and limited access to quality education [5]. These factors, combined with the differences in job characteristics valued by men and women, highlight the complex interplay between personal preferences and systemic challenges in the STEM workforce.\n\n![Job characteristics valued by men and women in STEM](image4)"}

This trend is further emphasized by the fact that Black STEM workers are more likely to experience discrimination than their counterparts in non-STEM jobs [10]. Additionally, the underrepresentation of Black and Hispanic individuals in STEM occupations relative to their share in the U.S. workforce highlights systemic issues that may contribute to these experiences [4].

These factors vary significantly across generations, reflecting differences in upbringing, exposure to Hispanic culture, and the broader societal context.\n\nOne key factor is **generational status**, which plays a major role in how individuals identify. For instance, the share of individuals who self-identify as Hispanic decreases with each subsequent generation. By the third generation, only 77% of those with Hispanic ancestry identify as such, and this drops further to 50% by the fourth or higher generation [1]. This trend suggests that as individuals become more integrated into American society, their sense of Hispanic identity may weaken. The image1 bar chart illustrates this by showing the distribution of percentages across different generational groups, though without clear labels, it is difficult to determine the exact nature of the data being represented [image1].\n\nAnother important factor is **cultural and linguistic connection**. While some may associate Hispanic identity with speaking Spanish, the majority of self-identified Hispanics do not see language as a necessary component of their identity. For example, 84% of second-generation Latinos and 92% of third or higher generation Latinos believe that speaking Spanish is not required to be considered Latino [6]. Additionally, the image5 bar graph highlights that a significant portion of self-identified Hispanics do not speak Spanish, especially among later generations. This indicates that language is not a universal determinant of Hispanic identity.\n\n**Racial and ethnic background** also influences self-identification. Some individuals with Hispanic ancestry may not consider themselves Hispanic due to mixed heritage, limited cultural ties, or a stronger identification with another race. According to the text quotes, 11% of those with Hispanic ancestry do not identify as Hispanic, with many citing reasons such as having a mixed background, limited contact with Hispanic relatives, or not speaking Spanish [3][10]. The image2 bar chart visually represents these reasons, showing that 27% of non-Hispanic individuals with Hispanic ancestry cite mixed background or distant ancestry as the primary reason for not identifying as Hispanic [image2].\n\nFurthermore, **personal experience and upbringing** play a critical role. Many individuals who do not identify as Hispanic report that they were raised in environments with little to no Hispanic cultural influence. For example, 16% of those who do not identify as Hispanic say they have little contact with Hispanic relatives, and 12% say they do not look Hispanic or identify as another race [10]. These factors contribute to a shift in identity over time, particularly as individuals move further from their immigrant roots.\n\nLastly, **self-reported identity** is a central aspect of how Hispanic identity is measured in the U.S. Since the 1960s, racial and ethnic identity has been based on self-reports, meaning that individuals define themselves as they see fit [5]. This system allows for diversity in how people choose to identify, even if they have Hispanic ancestry. The image4 bar chart shows that 81% of adults with Hispanic ancestry who do not identify as Hispanic say they have never considered themselves Hispanic, highlighting the complexity of identity formation [image4].\n\nIn summary, the self-identification of Hispanics in the U.S. is shaped by generational status, cultural and linguistic connections, personal background, and individual experiences. These factors vary across generations, with later generations often showing a weaker connection to Hispanic identity. ![Generational trends in Hispanic self-identification](image1) ![Reasons for not identifying as Hispanic](image2) ![Language and cultural factors](image5) ![Self-identification statistics](image4).

For instance, second-generation Hispanics are more likely to say their Hispanic background has been an advantage (52%) compared to immigrant Hispanics (28%) and third or higher generation Hispanics (24%) [2]. This suggests that as generations progress, the perceived advantage of being Hispanic decreases. Additionally, the perception of discrimination also changes across generations; 39% of self-identified Hispanics report feeling discriminated against because of their Hispanic background, while only 7% of self-identified non-Hispanics with Hispanic ancestry report experiencing discrimination [8]. This indicates that the experience of discrimination is more prevalent among those who identify as Hispanic rather than those who have Hispanic ancestry but do not identify as such.\n\nRegarding racial identity, the data reveals that a majority of self-identified Hispanics (69%) identify as Hispanic or Latino, with a significant portion (14%) identifying as White [5]. However, this identification shifts across generations. Foreign-born Hispanics are more likely to identify as Hispanic or Latino (78%), whereas third or higher generation Hispanics are less likely to do so (46%) [5]. This trend reflects a gradual shift in racial identity over time, possibly due to assimilation and intermarriage.\n\nThe bar chart (image5) provides a visual representation of these trends. It shows that foreign-born Hispanics predominantly identify as Hispanic or Latino, while third or higher generation Hispanics are more likely to identify as White or other races. The chart also highlights the disparity in racial identification between self-identified Hispanics and non-Hispanics with Hispanic ancestry, where the latter group is more likely to identify as White.\n\nFurthermore, the perception of being seen as Hispanic by others also changes across generations. While 59% of self-identified non-Hispanics say they are seen as White, only 46% of third or higher generation Hispanics feel they are seen as Hispanic [9]. This suggests that as generations progress, the visibility of Hispanic identity in society may decrease.\n\nIn addition, the connection to Hispanic heritage diminishes across generations. According to image1, 72% of self-identified Hispanics feel very/somewhat connected to their heritage, but this drops to 44% for third or higher generation Hispanics [1].

Second-generation Hispanics are more likely to see an advantage (52%) compared to third or higher generation Hispanics (24%). This pattern aligns with the idea that the cultural and social benefits of being Hispanic may become less pronounced as individuals move further from their immigrant roots.\n\nThe bar chart (image3) provides additional insight into the perception of Hispanic identity. It shows that 64% of self-identified Hispanics believe they are seen as Hispanic by others, but this share decreases with each subsequent generation. Foreign-born Hispanics are most likely to feel they are seen as Hispanic (77%), while third or higher generation Hispanics are least likely (37%). This suggests that the external perception of Hispanic identity may also change over time.\n\nFinally, the bar chart (image4) shows how often different groups identify as Hispanic. Self-identified Hispanics rarely identify as Hispanic \"often\" (7%), with the majority identifying as Hispanic \"sometimes\" (32%) or \"rarely\" (19%). Third or higher generation Hispanics are even less likely to identify as Hispanic \"often\" (6%) and more likely to identify as Hispanic \"never\" (46%).

It shows that the Non-GCC group has a value of 55, while the GCC group has a value of 39. This could indicate that the level of concern about unemployment is higher in Non-GCC regions compared to GCC regions [1]. The chart uses simple horizontal bars, with the green bar representing Non-GCC and the orange bar representing GCC, suggesting a direct comparison of concern levels.\n\nIn image4, we see a bar graph representing data from four years, including the year 2014. For unemployment, the value in 2014 is 49, which is part of a broader set of concerns. This data point helps contextualize the level of concern about unemployment in 2014 within the larger framework of other issues such as the rising cost of living, national economy, opportunities for women, and the threat of terrorism. The color coding indicates that 2014 data is represented by blue, and it shows that the concern about unemployment was relatively high in that year.\n\n![The image compares two groups, GCC and Non-GCC, with Non-GCC having a higher value of 55 compared to GCC's 39.](image1)\n\n![The image shows the concern about unemployment in 2014 with a value of 49, indicating a significant level of concern.](image4)\n\nIn conclusion, the concerns about unemployment appear to be higher in Non-GCC regions compared to GCC regions, and in 2014, unemployment was a significant concern among the key issues discussed."}

To address this, we can refer to the provided text and image quotes.\n\nFirst, let’s examine the concerns about the rising cost of living and unemployment between GCC and Non-GCC countries. From the text, we see that there is a general concern about the rising cost of living [4], and unemployment is also mentioned as a significant issue [6]. Additionally, there is a quote indicating that a majority of young Arabs believe they are entitled to subsidized energy costs, while concern about climate change is low [3].\n\nLooking at the image quotes, image1 provides a comparison between GCC and Non-GCC countries. It shows that the Non-GCC group has a higher value (55) compared to the GCC group (39), suggesting that Non-GCC countries may have higher overall concern about certain issues. However, it's important to note that the exact nature of the concern is not specified in this image. ![Non-GCC group has a higher value than GCC group](image1).\n\nImage3 further compares the two groups, showing that both GCC and Non-GCC have similar values (63 for GCC and 62 for Non-GCC). This suggests that the level of concern might be relatively similar between the two groups, though the exact issue being measured is not clear from the description. ![GCC and Non-GCC have similar values](image3).\n\nNow, considering the specific concern levels in individual GCC countries, image2 and image4 provide detailed data on levels of concern across different countries. Image2 is a stacked bar chart that displays the percentages of people who are very concerned, somewhat concerned, not very concerned, or not at all concerned about various issues. The chart indicates that a majority of respondents in each region are \"Very concerned,\" as shown by the predominance of the blue section in each bar. ![Majority of respondents are very concerned about issues](image2).\n\nImage4 is another bar chart that shows similar data, with each bar divided into four categories: very concerned (blue), somewhat concerned (green), not very concerned (orange), and not at all concerned (red).

According to the data, in 2014, the percentage of people concerned about the rising cost of living was 63% in GCC countries compared to 62% in Non-GCC countries [1]. This suggests that both regions are highly concerned about this issue, though the difference is minimal. However, when it comes to unemployment, the data shows a more pronounced gap: 49% of people in GCC countries were concerned about unemployment in 2014, while 55% of those in Non-GCC countries expressed similar concerns [2]. This indicates that unemployment is a more pressing issue in Non-GCC countries.\n\n![Very concerned about rising cost of living](image3)  \n![Somewhat concerned about unemployment](image4)\n\nThese differences may reflect the varying economic structures and challenges faced by these regions. GCC countries, which include oil-rich nations like Saudi Arabia and the UAE, may have more resources to mitigate the impact of rising living costs, whereas Non-GCC countries, often facing greater economic instability, may experience higher levels of anxiety regarding employment opportunities.\n\nOverall, the data reveals that while both GCC and Non-GCC countries are deeply concerned about rising living costs, Non-GCC countries show a higher level of concern about unemployment, highlighting distinct regional priorities."}

According to text quote [7], there is rapid growth in these areas, which likely contributes to the rising demand for public transportation. This trend aligns with text quote [10], which highlights that 55% of Caltrain riders are under 35 and that millennials expect to live in places where they don't need a car, suggesting a shift toward using public transit. As more people move to these areas, the pressure on existing transit systems increases.\n\nThis increased demand is reflected in the crowded conditions described in image1, which shows a train or bus with many passengers seated and standing in the aisle. The image captures the \"standing room only\" situation that can occur when capacity is exceeded. Additionally, text quote [2] and [3] both mention that trains are crowded, emphasizing the issue of overcrowding.\n\nText quote [6] further explains that there are 40 at-grade crossings remaining, with only two separated, which could contribute to delays and reduce the frequency of service. San Mateo County has funding, but Santa Clara County does not yet, which may hinder efforts to improve the system. This lack of infrastructure investment could exacerbate capacity issues as ridership continues to grow.\n\nMoreover, text quote [4] states that there is a need to double Caltrain ridership from 60,000 to 120,000 daily trips by the next decade, highlighting the urgency of addressing capacity challenges. The data in image3 supports this need, as it shows significant growth in enrollment at Palo Alto University and Mountain View between 2012 and 2014, indicating a growing population that may rely on public transit.\n\n![The image shows the interior of a crowded train or bus with many passengers seated and standing in the aisle.](image1)"}

In contrast, China's per capita energy consumption is much lower at 597 kg oil equivalent [2]. This disparity in energy consumption may correlate with differences in CO2 emissions per capita. However, it is important to note that the transportation sector accounts for a substantial portion of CO2 emissions globally, with 20% of global emissions coming from this sector [4]. The USA, being a major consumer of motor vehicles, would likely have a higher share of emissions from transportation.\n\nMotor vehicle ownership also varies significantly between these countries. The USA has the largest bubble in the motor vehicle demand chart, indicating a high number of motor vehicles per 1,000 people [3]. This suggests that the USA has a high level of motor vehicle ownership, which could contribute to higher CO2 emissions. On the other hand, China has a large share of global motor vehicle demand but a lower number of motor vehicles per 1,000 people [3]. This implies that while China's motor vehicle market is growing rapidly, the per capita ownership is still relatively low compared to the USA. Germany, with a moderate share of global motor vehicle demand and a relatively high number of motor vehicles per 1,000 people, falls somewhere in between the USA and China in terms of motor vehicle ownership.\n\n![The image is a bar graph showing the potential reduction of CO2 emissions across various sectors along with the associated costs.](image1)\n\n![The image displays a horizontal bar chart representing energy consumption in terms of kilograms of oil equivalent per capita for various countries and the world.](image2)\n\n![The image is a bubble chart comparing various countries based on \"Percent Share in Global Motor Vehicles Demand\" (x-axis) and \"Motor Vehicles Per 1,000 People\" (y-axis).](image3)\n\nThe implications of these differences are significant. The USA's high energy consumption and motor vehicle ownership suggest a larger environmental footprint, particularly in terms of CO2 emissions. China's rapid growth in motor vehicle demand indicates a potential increase in emissions if not managed sustainably. Germany's position suggests a balance between economic development and environmental considerations, with a moderate level of motor vehicle ownership and a significant share of global motor vehicle demand.\n\nIn conclusion, the USA has the highest CO2 emissions per capita and the highest motor vehicle ownership, while China has a lower per capita emissions and a growing motor vehicle market, and Germany has a moderate level of both. This suggests that the USA has a larger environmental impact, China's impact is growing, and Germany's impact is more balanced."}

According to the data, Europe has seen a significant number of exits, with publicly announced European venture-backed trade sales and IPOs over the past 24 months [6]. This is reflected in the image where it states \"Venture-backed liquidity events in the last 24 months: $15 Billion*\" [4]. This indicates that despite the lower average exit values in Europe, the total value of these events is substantial.\n\nIn terms of venture capital investments, the multi-bar chart (image1) provides a clear comparison between the USA and Europe. It shows that the USA has a much larger share of total capital invested (82% vs. 18%) and also leads in the number of exits greater than $100 million (78% vs. 22%). However, Europe has a higher proportion of home runs, defined as exits that return 10 times the capital invested (36% vs. 64%), indicating that while the USA has more exits, Europe has a higher success rate in terms of returns on investment [10].\n\nThe bar chart (image2) further illustrates the distribution of venture capital investments and exits across different European regions. Germany, for instance, has the highest venture exits at $4.4 billion, despite having the lowest venture invested at $0.8 billion. This suggests that Germany has been particularly successful in generating high-value exits relative to the amount of capital invested. The UK, France, and other European regions also show significant venture exits, although at slightly lower levels than Germany.\n\nWhen comparing the performance of venture capital funds, the 3D stacked graph (image5) reveals that EU VC funds have a different distribution compared to US VC funds. While US VC funds are uniformly distributed across all quartiles, EU VC funds have a higher concentration in the top quartile, with 35% of EU VC funds in the top quartile compared to 25% for US VC funds. This suggests that EU VC funds may be outperforming their US counterparts in terms of overall performance.\n\nFinally, the image comparing investment performances (image3) highlights that while the median exit valuation is higher in the USA ($236 million vs. $173 million), Europe has a higher median multiple of cash invested (7.2 vs. 4.5) and a greater percentage of investments reaching a multiple of 5 or more (57.26% vs. 47.27%). This indicates that European venture capital investments may be more efficient in generating returns, even if the absolute exit values are lower.\n\n![Europe has a higher median multiple of cash invested and a greater percentage of investments reaching a multiple of 5 or more compared to the USA](image3)\n\nIn conclusion, while the USA leads in total capital invested and the number of exits, Europe demonstrates higher capital efficiency and a better performance in terms of returns on investment."}

This suggests that European investments are generating better returns relative to the amount of capital invested.

A line graph comparing the post-IPO performance of venture capital-backed IPOs between the U.S. and Europe from March 2004 to July 2011 shows that European IPOs (blue line) generally had better post-IPO performance than their U.S. counterparts (red line), as the blue line was consistently higher than the red line during this period [1].\n\n![European IPOs outperform U.S. IPOs post-IPO](image1)\n\nFurthermore, despite lower average exit values, Europe's lower entry valuations and higher capital efficiency—roughly 70% higher than in the US—help offset the disadvantage in exit value [10]. The scarcity of VC money in Europe has led to increased selectivity among investors, which has driven up capital efficiency and yield.\n\nIn terms of exits, Europe has an over-proportional share of successful exits, and the number of checks written to limited partners (LPs) in Europe has increased significantly [4]. A multi-bar chart highlights that although the USA has a larger share of total capital invested (82% vs. 18%), Europe has a significant portion of exits exceeding $100 million (22%) and a notable share of \"home runs\" (investments returning 10x or more) at 36% compared to 64% for the USA [3].\n\n![Comparison of venture capital statistics between USA and Europe](image3)\n\nOverall, while the USA leads in some metrics like median exit valuation, Europe demonstrates stronger performance in investment multiples, capital efficiency, and post-IPO returns, indicating a robust and competitive venture capital landscape."}

Additionally, the government-initiated price wars played a role in lowering ARPU initially [3], while the continued decline in ARPU was expected to persist until 2015, when increased mobile internet usage might lead to higher data plan enrollments [7].\n\nLooking at the image quotes, image4 provides detailed information on Telkomsel's subscriber base and user demographics. In 2014, Telkomsel had 139.3 million subscribers, with 35.4 million smartphone users, 10.4 million BlackBerry users, 17.3 million Android users, and 63.5 million data users. These figures suggest that the company maintained a large subscriber base, but the transition from traditional devices like BlackBerry to smartphones and the increasing reliance on data services may have contributed to the decline in ARPU. The shift towards data consumption could explain why Mobile Data ARPU initially declined but later showed an upward trend [7].\n\n![Telkomsel's subscriber base and user demographics in 2014](image4)\n\nIn addition, image3 illustrates the prepaid ARPU for major telecom companies, including Telkomsel, from 2008 to 2012. While this data does not directly cover 2013-2014, it provides context for the ongoing trend of declining ARPU in the industry. For instance, Telkomsel’s ARPU dropped from 53 in 2008 to 34 in 2012, indicating a consistent downward trajectory that likely continued into 2014.\n\n![Prepaid ARPU for Telkomsel from 2008 to 2012](image3)\n\nOverall, the changes in Telkomsel's subscriber base and ARPU from 2013 to 2014 were likely driven by the broader industry shift toward data-based services, reduced usage of traditional voice and SMS services, and competitive pricing strategies."}

This indicates a significant increase in smartphone adoption for both companies during this period. \n\nRegarding ARPU trends, the line graph in image2 shows that Voice ARPU and SMS ARPU declined over the years, while Mobile Data ARPU initially declined but then showed an upward trend towards 2017. Specifically, for the period from 2013 to 2014, the decline in Voice ARPU and SMS ARPU was likely influenced by the increasing use of data-based services such as instant messaging (IM) and Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP), as mentioned in text quote [4]. This shift in user behavior led to reduced usage of traditional voice and SMS services, which in turn affected ARPU, as noted in text quote [5].\n\nAdditionally, the decline in ARPU was initially driven by a massive price war initiated by the government, as stated in text quote [9]. However, by 2014, tariffs had reached rock-bottom levels, and there was no further price war, as mentioned in text quote [10]. This suggests that the decline in ARPU was not solely due to price competition but also due to changes in consumer behavior and technology adoption.\n\n![The bar chart in image3 shows the number of smartphone users for Telkomsel and XL in 2014.](image3)\n\n![The line graph in image2 illustrates the declining trends in Voice ARPU and SMS ARPU, along with the initial decline followed by an upward trend in Mobile Data ARPU.](image2)\n\nIn conclusion, the number of smartphone users for Telkomsel and XL increased between 2013 and 2014, while ARPU trends showed a decline in Voice and SMS ARPU, influenced by the shift to data-based services and changes in consumer behavior."}

Additionally, the **Confusion ij** metric is used to measure the degree of confusion between categories, with values closer to 1 indicating less confusion and values closer to 0 indicating more confusion [10]. This implies that the metric can help determine which categories are most likely to be confused with one another.\n\nIn terms of visual evidence, **image1** shows a confusion matrix that includes the category \"Abbreviation\" among others. The matrix uses a color gradient from light to dark, representing values from 0 to 1, where darker colors indicate higher accuracy or lower confusion. The diagonal values represent correct classifications, and the off-diagonal cells show how often instances from one category were classified into another. Based on this, we can infer that the most confusing category for \"Abbreviation\" would be the one with the highest value in the row or column corresponding to \"Abbreviation\" that is not on the diagonal (i.e., the cell with the lowest value, indicating high confusion).\n\nSimilarly, **image2** provides a similar visualization of a confusion matrix, again showing the relationship between predicted and actual categories. It confirms that the diagonal represents correct classifications, while the off-diagonal cells reflect misclassifications. The values range from 0.58 to 1, with higher values indicating better performance. If \"Abbreviation\" has a low value in a non-diagonal cell, that suggests it is being confused with another category.\n\nFinally, **image3** shows six confusion matrices for different values of $ M $. These matrices compare predicted and actual categories such as \"Abbreviation,\" \"Entity,\" \"Description,\" \"Person,\" \"Location,\" and \"Number.\" While no specific details about the confusion of \"Abbreviation\" are given in the description, the presence of these matrices supports the idea that confusion between categories can be visually analyzed.\n\nBased on the above analysis, the most confusing category for \"Abbreviation\" appears to be **Entity**, as it is explicitly mentioned as the most confusing case in the text [1].\n\n![The most confusing category for Abbreviation is Entity, based on the Confusion metric and the analysis of category pairs.](image1)"}

For instance, quote [8] highlights that biased query strategies, such as Entropy, Margin, and VAAL, tend to select data that is skewed toward specific classes, leading to poor label diversity. It also mentions that these strategies often fail to outperform random sampling at the beginning due to the underrepresentation of minority classes. Furthermore, quote [6] provides an example where VAAL prefers selecting data in the femur-right and platelet class while largely ignoring data in the lung, liver, and monocyte classes, indicating a lack of label diversity.\n\nSimilarly, quote [9] discusses how label diversity is crucial for active querying on imbalanced datasets like CIFAR-10-LT, and it notes that most active querying strategies fail to query all the classes even with larger initial query budgets. This suggests that some strategies are inherently less effective at maintaining label diversity.\n\nIn addition, quote [4] presents Table 7, which shows that diversity is a significant add-on to most querying strategies, and the cells are highlighted in blue when adding diversity performs no worse than the original strategies.

According to the text, the estimated CO₂ emissions from training common NLP models are substantial and can be compared to familiar consumption patterns. For instance, Table 1 provides an overview of these emissions, while Table 3 highlights that training BERT on GPUs is roughly equivalent to a trans-American flight in terms of CO₂ emissions [5]. This comparison underscores the significant environmental impact of training such models.\n\n![The table shows the energy consumption distribution for various consumers, divided into four types of energy sources: Renewables, Gas, Coal, and Nuclear.](image1)\n\nIn addition to the direct comparisons, the text also emphasizes that the energy required to train these models is not always sourced from carbon-neutral or renewable sources. In many locations, energy still comes from non-carbon-neutral sources like coal and gas, which exacerbates the environmental impact. Furthermore, even when renewable energy is available, its limited availability means that energy spent training a neural network might be better allocated elsewhere, such as heating a family’s home [1].\n\n![The table provides information about different models and their associated hardware, power consumption, and costs.](image2)\n\nAnother relevant comparison is found in Table 3, which lists CO₂ emissions and estimated costs of training the models described in §2.1. It notes that TPUs are more cost-efficient than GPUs on workloads that make sense for that hardware (e.g., BERT). However, the overall emissions remain significant, with training BERT on GPU being roughly equivalent to a trans-American flight [10]. This comparison helps contextualize the environmental cost of training NLP models in relation to other well-known activities.\n\n![The table compares estimated costs for models in terms of hours and expenses for both cloud and electric options.](image3)\n\nAdditionally, the CO₂ emissions from training NLP models can be compared to everyday human activities. For example, the average American life produces 36,156 lbs of CO₂e emissions per year, while a car's lifetime emissions amount to 126,000 lbs of CO₂e [5]. Training a single NLP model can result in emissions comparable to or exceeding these figures, depending on the model's complexity and the energy sources used.\n\n![The table presents data related to natural language processing (NLP) tasks, specifically focusing on two main components: an NLP pipeline and a Transformer model.](image4)\n\nFinally, the text highlights that the environmental cost of training NLP models is not just a concern for researchers but for society as a whole. The high energy demands of these models mean that they contribute significantly to greenhouse gas emissions, which is a pressing issue given the need to cut carbon emissions by half over the next decade to mitigate the effects of climate change [1].\n\nIn conclusion, the CO₂ emissions from training NLP models are comparable to or exceed those of many everyday activities, including air travel and the annual emissions of an average American."}

However, the highest test median score is mentioned in Table 4, where BERT’s median score drops to $50\\%$ after adversarial training [5]. Despite this drop, the highest test median score among all models is found in Table 4, where BERT (Large) achieves a median of $50\\%$. Other models like GIST show strong performance on the development set but do not surpass BERT’s test median score.

Positional encodings play a crucial role in the performance of the model, particularly in the encoder and decoder. According to Table 3, when spatial positional encodings are not used, there is a significant drop in AP. Interestingly, passing them only in the decoder leads to a minor AP drop, suggesting that while spatial positional encodings are important, their placement in the architecture has a nuanced effect [1]. Additionally, the use of learned output positional encodings is essential, as they cannot be removed without affecting performance [7].\n\nIn terms of loss components, the model's performance is influenced by how the loss is structured. The paper discusses the importance of the set-based loss, which allows the model to avoid the need for Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) by design. However, NMS still provides some improvement for predictions from the first decoder layer, although this benefit diminishes as the depth of the decoder increases [9]. This indicates that the loss function and the structure of the decoder layers are interdependent in influencing AP.\n\nThe results from the experiments with different combinations of positional encodings are summarized in Table 4. For instance, using `class` and `GIoU` yields an AP of 39.9, while combining `class`, `ℓ₁`, and `GIoU` improves the AP to 40.6, showing that the choice of loss components significantly affects the model's performance [3].

For example, the attention visualization in image1 shows how the model focuses on specific parts of the detected animals, such as their extremities, which helps in accurate classification and localization [1]. This suggests that the configuration of positional encodings and loss components influences not only the overall AP but also the model's ability to focus on relevant features.\n\n![The image consists of two main sections showcasing animal objects detected in a scene, likely using an object detection model called DETR-DC5.](image1)\n\nIn conclusion, the configuration of positional encodings and loss components significantly affects the Average Precision (AP) in the DETR-DC5 model for object detection."}

This suggests that models can better identify absent knowledge when it is more prevalent, which aligns with the concept of 'Conscious Incompetence,' where models become more aware of their limitations as the coverage of the knowledge graph decreases.

Additionally, iterative retrieval of logical constraints reduces logical inconsistency over time, though it may not always lead to significant improvements in micro-F1 scores [2]. The results also show that incorporating logical constraints with a smaller number of demonstrations can outperform prompts with more demonstrations, highlighting the importance of both \"what\" (demonstrations) and \"how\" (logical constraints) in guiding LLMs [7].\n\nThe image quotes further support these findings.

This approach ensures that the system can handle the complexities of object detection tasks, especially in zero-shot settings.\n\nDuring preprocessing, images are analyzed to identify multiple objects, each represented by bounding boxes. These bounding boxes are used to crop the image regions containing the objects of interest. The cropped regions are then resized to a fixed proportion, ensuring consistency in the input for further processing [8]. Additionally, blurring techniques are applied to non-target areas to help MLLMs focus on the relevant objects, improving their ability to detect and classify them accurately.\n\nOnce the pre-processing is complete, the system extracts image embeddings using an image encoder. These embeddings capture the visual features of the cropped regions and are stored in a memory bank for efficient retrieval. The embeddings are indexed to facilitate quick and accurate searches during the retrieval phase. This indexing process is crucial for handling large-scale datasets and ensuring that the system can retrieve relevant information efficiently [3].\n\nDuring the retrieval phase, the system uses k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) to find similar embeddings in the memory bank. This process retrieves potential labels for each object based on their similarity to the input image. For example, in the case of an object like a \"vase,\" the system might retrieve labels such as \"flower arrangement,\" \"saltshaker,\" or \"vase\" [4].\n\nAfter retrieving the potential labels, the system employs Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to rank these labels based on their relevance and contextual appropriateness. This ranking step is critical because it allows the system to refine the initial retrieval results, ensuring that the most accurate and contextually appropriate labels are selected. For instance, in a zero-shot object recognition task, the system might initially retrieve several class names, but the MLLMs will re-rank them to identify the correct label, such as \"vase\" [2].\n\nThe final prediction is made by combining the retrieved information with the internal knowledge of the MLLMs. This integration ensures that the system can make accurate predictions even when faced with new or unseen categories. The entire process is designed to enhance the performance of object detection tasks by leveraging both the broad generalization capabilities of MLLMs and the precision of the multimodal retriever system [9].\n\n![The diagram illustrates a system for object recognition on detection datasets, featuring two main sections: pre-process and embedding & retrieve.](image4)"}

The Δτ values indicate that including references leads to better scores, with the most significant improvements observed in reverse language pairs (e.g., cs-en, de-en).\n\n2. **Consistency Across Language Pairs**: COMET-RANK maintains consistent performance across different language pairs, often outperforming BLEU. This is supported by the results in Table 3, where COMET-RANK's performance is consistent with previous observations.\n\n3. **Performance with Source Language**: The inclusion of source language information in COMET-RANK improves its correlation with human judgments, as noted in the analysis of the DA RR Ranker model. This suggests that COMET-RANK is more robust and adaptable compared to BLEU, which does not incorporate source language information.\n\n4. **Top Systems Evaluation**: When evaluating the top-performing MT systems, COMET-RANK consistently outperforms BLEU, as shown in the line graphs in image2. The Kendall Tau scores for COMET-RANK remain higher even when considering fewer top systems, indicating its effectiveness in ranking translation quality.\n\nIn summary, COMET-RANK generally outperforms BLEU in evaluating translation quality across different language pairs, with trends showing improved performance when incorporating reference and source language information, consistent results across language pairs, and superior ranking capabilities for top-performing systems.\n\n![COMET-RANK shows significant improvements when using reference translations, with the most notable gains observed in reverse language pairs.](image1)"}

The dataset includes tasks that require navigating between landmarks, with an average of 24.6 actions per instruction and a vocabulary size of 2,292. In contrast, CHAI is a corpus of 1,596 instruction sequences, each including 7.7 instructions on average, for a 3D house environment. CHAI instructions involve more complex manipulation tasks, such as moving objects and opening containers, with an average of 54.5 actions per instruction and a smaller vocabulary size of 1,018 [9].\n\nIn terms of performance metrics, LANI uses stop distance (SD) and task completion (TC), while CHAI uses SD and manipulation accuracy (MA). The comparative analysis of different methods reveals that our approach outperforms baselines like STOP, RANDOMWALK, and MOSTFREQUENT on both datasets.

The amount of pretraining data and the choice of modeling approach both play crucial roles in determining the effectiveness of language models.\n\nFirst, the amount of pretraining data has a direct impact on performance. As shown in **image4**, there is a positive correlation between the amount of Common Crawl data used for pretraining and the average GLUE score. The graph indicates that as the number of training tokens increases from 562 million to 18 billion, the average GLUE score also increases, suggesting that more data leads to better performance. This aligns with the findings in text quote [4], which states that \"more data for pretraining improves performance, keeping everything else equal.\"\n\nIn addition to the quantity of data, the choice of modeling approach also influences performance. For example, **image1** presents a table comparing different models based on their F1 scores on development and test datasets. The results show that \"CNN Large + fine-tune\" achieved the highest F1 scores on both the development (96.9) and test (93.5) datasets among the models compared. This highlights the importance of not only having sufficient data but also using effective modeling techniques, such as fine-tuning, to improve performance.\n\nFurthermore, **image5** provides a detailed breakdown of performance metrics for different modeling approaches—specifically, the \"cloze,\" \"bilm,\" and \"cloze + bilm\" methods.

According to text quote [1], \"the cloze loss performs significantly better than the bilm loss and that combining the two loss types does not improve over the cloze loss by itself.\" This suggests that certain modeling strategies are more effective than others and that simply combining multiple approaches may not always lead to better results.\n\nAnother important factor is the type of training examples used. Text quote [5] explains that multi-sentence training examples are more effective for end-tasks based on sentence pairs, such as RTE. This is supported by **image3**, which shows that models trained on datasets like \"ccrawl\" (which contains longer, multi-sentence examples) perform better than those trained on \"news crawl\" (which consists of shorter, individual sentences). The results suggest that the structure of the training data plays a critical role in determining model performance.\n\nFinally, **image2** highlights the superior performance of BERT models, particularly BERT_LARGE, across multiple NLP tasks. This underscores the importance of both the size of the model and the quality of the pretraining data. BERT_LARGE achieves high scores on tasks such as CoLA, QNLI, and RTE, demonstrating that larger models can benefit from extensive pretraining on diverse datasets.\n\nIn conclusion, the combination of pretraining data and modeling approaches significantly affects performance on NLP tasks, with more data and effective modeling strategies leading to better results. ![The line graph depicts the relationship between the amount of Common Crawl data used for pretraining and the average GLUE score achieved.](image4)"}

In some cases, aligning embeddings leads to improvements, while in others, it results in negligible or even slight decreases.\n\nFor instance, Table 5 shows that when pre-trained embeddings are used, the gains in each translation pair are roughly in order of their similarity, with GL/PT showing the largest gains, and BE/RU showing a small decrease. Additionally, aligning the word embeddings helps to increase the BLEU scores for all three tasks, as noted in the text [7]. This suggests that aligning embeddings can be beneficial, especially when the source and target languages are more similar.\n\nHowever, other findings indicate that alignment may not always be beneficial. From Table 4, it is evident that the alignment of word embeddings was not beneficial for training, with gains or losses essentially being insignificant across all languages [8]. This implies that the effectiveness of alignment might depend on specific conditions or language pairs.\n\nThe impact of embedding alignment is also reflected in the datasets provided. For example, in the table shown in image3, the BLEU scores for different language pairs show varying changes when moving from unaligned to aligned embeddings. Some pairs, like RU→EN, show a slight improvement, while others, such as GL→EN, show a decrease [3].\n\nMoreover, the line graphs in image4 illustrate the relationship between training set size and BLEU scores, highlighting that the gain from pre-training is more significant at smaller training set sizes and decreases as the training set size increases. This suggests that the effectiveness of pre-training, and potentially embedding alignment, might be more pronounced with limited data [4].\n\nIn summary, the alignment of word embeddings can have a positive impact on BLEU scores, but this effect varies depending on the specific language pairs and the context of the translation task. While some studies show improvements, others suggest that the benefits may be minimal or even negative in certain cases.\n\n![The table presents evaluation metrics for different training and evaluation setups involving language pairs.](image2)"}

According to the text quotes, pre-training improves the accuracy of translation for the entire vocabulary, but particularly for words that are of low frequency in the training corpus [1]. This suggests that pre-training is especially beneficial when there is limited data available, as it helps the model capture rarer vocabulary and generate more grammatically well-formed sentences [7].\n\nThe role of training set size in this effect is also evident. The analysis shows that the gain from pre-training is most significant when the baseline system is poor but not too poor, typically with a baseline BLEU score in the range of 3-4. This indicates that at least a moderately effective system is necessary before pre-training takes effect, but once there is enough data to capture the basic characteristics of the language, pre-training can be highly effective [9]. Furthermore, the graphs in image5 illustrate that the gain from pre-training is more significant at smaller training set sizes and decreases as the training set size increases [5].\n\nLanguage similarity also plays a crucial role in the effectiveness of pre-training. The text quotes indicate that pre-trained embeddings seem to be more effective for more similar translation pairs [4]. For example, the table in image1 shows that the improvement in BLEU scores varies across different language pairs, with some showing larger gains than others.

The bar chart in image2 illustrates this point clearly, showing that both \"std\" (standard) and \"pre\" (pre-trained) F-measure scores increase with word frequency, with \"pre\" often outperforming \"std\" in higher frequency ranges. This suggests that pre-trained embeddings provide a more robust representation of less frequent concepts, which is particularly beneficial in low-resource scenarios [8].\n\n![F-measure scores for target words based on their frequency in the training corpus](image2)\n\nIn terms of specific language pairs, the effectiveness of embedding alignment varies.

For instance, when comparing \"GloVe with R-GCN\" to \"GloVe w/o R-GCN,\" the performance drops from 59.2 (unmasked) to 51.2 (unmasked), indicating that the R-GCN plays a crucial role in enhancing model accuracy [10].

When the model operates without distinguishing between different types of edges (i.e., \"No relation types\"), there is only marginal improvement over using ELMo alone. This suggests that a more informative graph construction or a more sophisticated parameterization is needed for better performance [9]. Additionally, the \"No DOC-BASED\" configuration yields slightly lower performance than the baseline, highlighting the significance of document-based connections [10].\n\nRegarding specific relation types, the removal of MATCH and COREF also impacts performance.

This suggests that coreference propagation enhances entity extraction, while relation propagation improves relation extraction.\n\n![Comparison of DyGIE's performance with and without coreference and relation propagation](image3)\n\nIn addition, the performance of DyGIE on the SciERC dataset further highlights its effectiveness. It advances the state of the art by 5.9% for relation extraction and 1.9% for NER, demonstrating the benefits of coreference and relation propagation in constructing rich contextualized representations [2]. On the WLPC dataset, DyGIE also achieves the highest scores in both entity and relation categories, underscoring its robustness across different domains [2].\n\n![DyGIE's performance on the SciERC and WLPC datasets](image5)\n\nOverall, DyGIE consistently outperforms other systems across various datasets, and the inclusion of coreference and relation propagation mechanisms significantly enhances its performance in entity and relation extraction tasks."}

DyGIE shows the highest F1 score for entities (87.1) compared to other models, while −CorefProp scores best for relations (60.2). This suggests that while CorefProp may not always enhance relation extraction, it can still contribute positively in certain scenarios.\n\nIn image3, the table presents the performance of different systems on various datasets, measured by the Entity F1 score. The DyGIE system achieves the highest Entity F1 score across all datasets: 84.7 for ACE04-O, 82.9 for ACE05-O, and 76.2 for GENIA. These results indicate that DyGIE performs consistently well across different domains, including news and biomedicine.\n\nThe role of CorefProp and RelProp is further highlighted in image2, which shows two line graphs comparing the performance of entity and relation extraction with different numbers of iterations for CorefProp and RelProp. Both processes show improvements with two iterations, indicating that iterative propagation can enhance performance. However, the impact of these components varies depending on the dataset and task.\n\nIn image4, the table presents the performance metrics for different models on entity recognition and relation extraction tasks.

Coreference propagation plays a crucial role in improving entity recognition, especially in scenarios where entities are mentioned through pronouns or other referential expressions that require contextual understanding.\n\nFor instance, in the ACE05 dataset, the challenge lies in disambiguating the entity class for pronominal mentions, which requires reasoning with cross-sentence contexts. The DyGIE model shows a 6.6% improvement in pronoun performance when using the coreference layer, confirming the hypothesis that coreference propagation can help in such cases [10]. This suggests that the availability of coreference annotations allows the model to better understand and resolve pronouns, leading to improved entity recognition accuracy.\n\nSimilarly, in the SciERC dataset, the uniform assignment of a \"Generic\" label to pronouns explains why coreference propagation does not have much effect on entity extraction performance [9]. This indicates that the absence of proper coreference annotations can limit the effectiveness of the coreference propagation mechanism.\n\nIn terms of overall performance, the DyGIE model outperforms other systems across multiple datasets. For example, on the ACE04-O and ACE05-O datasets, DyGIE achieves Entity F1 scores of 84.7 and 82.9, respectively, surpassing the scores of Katiyar and Cardie (2018) and Wang and Lu (2018) [3]. On the GENIA dataset, DyGIE also achieves a high Entity F1 score of 76.2, demonstrating its effectiveness in bio-medical domains [4].\n\nFurthermore, the table in image1 highlights the impact of coreference propagation on entity and relation extraction.

While both DyGIE and DyGIE-RelProp show a decline in performance with more entities, DyGIE generally outperforms DyGIE-RelProp, suggesting that the inclusion of coreference propagation can help maintain higher performance even in complex sentences [2].\n\nFinally, the table in image3 provides a clear comparison of Entity F1 scores across different systems on the ACE04-O, ACE05-O, and GENIA datasets.

These findings are supported by Figure 5, which shows that both CorefProp and RelProp reach their highest F1 scores at two iterations.

These iterations are crucial in determining how well the model performs when considering the context of sentences with varying numbers of entities.\n\nFrom the text, it is clear that the number of iterations for coreference propagation has a significant effect on entity extraction performance. Specifically, the figure (Figure 3a) shows that the best performance on the entity extraction task is achieved at the second iteration ($N=2$) [2]. Similarly, for relation propagation, the figure (Figure 3b) indicates that the best performance on the relation extraction task is also achieved at the second iteration ($M=2$) [8]. This suggests that both processes benefit from a moderate number of iterations, with the second iteration being optimal for both tasks.\n\nThe image quote describing Figure 5 provides visual confirmation of this trend. The left graph, titled \"Entity F1,\" shows that the F1 score for entity extraction reaches its peak at two iterations of CorefProp [5]. The right graph, titled \"Relation F1,\" shows a similar pattern for RelProp, where the F1 score for relation extraction is highest at two iterations. This aligns with the textual evidence that the second iteration yields the best results for both processes.\n\nMoreover, the image quote describing Figure 4 illustrates how relation propagation affects the F1 scores for relation extraction in sentences with varying numbers of entities. The graph shows that as the number of entities in a sentence increases, the performance of the system without relation propagation decreases significantly. However, the addition of relation propagation helps mitigate this decline, although not as effectively as the system without relation propagation [5]. This implies that while relation propagation is beneficial, it may not always outperform the base model, especially in complex sentences with many entities.\n\nIn contrast, the image quote describing Figure 3a and 3b highlights that the performance of both CorefProp and RelProp improves with more iterations, peaking at the second iteration. This suggests that the model benefits from a balance between considering enough context and avoiding overfitting or unnecessary complexity.\n\nFinally, the image quote describing Table 4 provides a detailed comparison of the performance of different models, including DyGIE, DyGIE without CorefProp, DyGIE without RelProp, and the Base model.

According to the data in image2, which presents the performance of different model settings on four datasets (D1, D2, D3, D4), we can observe that:\n\n- **LSTM only** performs reasonably well, with accuracy ranging from 71.04% to 83.85% and macro-F1 scores between 65.30 and 67.85.\n- **Embeddings only** shows slightly better performance than LSTM only, with accuracy ranging from 69.12% to 84.12% and macro-F1 scores between 65.06 and 70.11.\n- **Output layer only** has lower performance compared to the other components, with accuracy ranging from 69.63% to 82.55% and macro-F1 scores between 62.83 and 66.07.\n- **Without LSTM** shows improved performance over LSTM only, with accuracy ranging from 77.45% to 84.80% and macro-F1 scores between 66.63 and 70.27.\n- **Without embeddings** performs slightly worse than without LSTM, with accuracy ranging from 77.97% to 83.94% and macro-F1 scores between 65.56 and 68.79.\n- **Without output layer** shows the best performance among all settings, with accuracy ranging from 78.36% to 83.94% and macro-F1 scores between 67.96 and 68.06.\n\nThese results indicate that the inclusion of certain components, such as the embedding layer and the LSTM layer, significantly improves the model's performance. Specifically, the **embedding layer** plays a crucial role in capturing semantic information, while the **LSTM layer** helps in capturing sequential patterns. The **output layer**, on the other hand, is more task-specific and contributes less to overall performance.\n\nNow, let's consider the trends observed when varying the percentage of document-level training examples. Image3 provides two line graphs that illustrate the performance of the \"PRET $^+$ MULT\" method based on the percentage of document-level training examples. The top graph shows accuracy percentages, and the bottom graph displays Macro-F1 percentages. Both graphs plot the metrics as a function of the percentage of document-level training examples.\n\n- The **top graph** indicates that as the percentage of document-level training examples increases, the accuracy of all four models (D1, D2, D3, D4) tends to improve. Model D4 consistently achieves the highest accuracy across all percentages.\n- The **bottom graph** reflects a similar trend for Macro-F1 scores, where increasing the percentage of document-level training examples generally leads to better performance across all models. Again, Model D4 typically achieves the best Macro-F1 scores.\n\nThese trends suggest that incorporating more document-level training examples enhances the model's performance, particularly for datasets like D3 and D4, where the number of neutral examples in the test sets is very small. This is supported by the findings in text quote [2], which highlights that the precision and recall on the neutral class are heavily affected by even small prediction differences in these datasets.\n\nFurthermore, text quote [7] provides additional insights into the transfer effects of different layers. It states that transferring the LSTM and embedding layers from the document-level model to the aspect-level model is more effective than transferring the output layer. This is because the output layer is more task-specific, while the LSTM and embedding layers capture general features that are beneficial across tasks.\n\nIn conclusion, the inclusion of different components in the model, particularly the LSTM and embedding layers, significantly improves its performance across various datasets. When varying the percentage of document-level training examples, the model's performance, especially in terms of accuracy and macro-F1 scores, tends to improve, with D4 showing the most consistent gains. The effectiveness of these components is further supported by the observed trends in the data.\n\n![The table contains information about datasets labeled D1 to D4, indicating the number of positive (Pos), negative (Neg), and neutral (Neu) entries for both training and test sets.](image1)\n\n![The table presents the performance of different model settings on four datasets (D1, D2, D3, D4) in terms of accuracy (Acc.) and macro-F1 score (Macro-F1).](image2)\n\n![The image contains two line graphs that illustrate the performance of a method called \"PRET $^+$ MULT\" based on the percentage of document-level training examples.](image3)\n\n![The table presents performance metrics for various methods evaluated across four datasets: D1, D2, D3, and D4.](image4)\n\nThe inclusion of different components in the model significantly affects its performance across various datasets, and the trends observed when varying the percentage of document-level training examples show that increasing the percentage of document-level training examples generally improves the model's performance."}

For instance, when fine-tuning the TRADE model on the attraction domain, GEM achieves a joint accuracy of $34.73\\%$, while naive fine-tuning only reaches $29.39\\%$ [1]. Similarly, in the hotel domain, GEM maintains higher performance on the original four domains after fine-tuning, with a drop from $58.98\\%$ to $53.54\\%$ in joint accuracy, whereas naive fine-tuning leads to a much larger drop to $36.08\\%$ [5]. This suggests that GEM is more effective at preserving the model’s ability to perform well on previously learned domains while adapting to new ones.\n\nIn contrast, EWC uses the diagonal of the Fisher information matrix as a regularizer to prevent the model from forgetting previously learned information. However, it does not perform as well as GEM in maintaining performance across domains. The text also notes that pre-training followed by fine-tuning outperforms training from scratch on the single domain, further highlighting the advantages of transfer learning [6].\n\nRegarding slot similarities, the image quotes provide visual evidence of how certain slots are more easily tracked than others. In Figure 5, the zero-shot analysis shows that knowledge about people, area, price range, and day slots is successfully transferred from other domains, while unseen slots like parking, stars, and internet in the hotel domain, or food in the restaurant domain, are harder to track correctly [7]. This indicates that slots with similar or correlated attributes are more likely to be accurately tracked in a zero-shot setting.\n\nThe heatmap in image5 further supports this observation, showing high cosine similarity between embeddings for slots like \"destination\" and \"departure,\" or \"price range\" and \"stars.\" These correlations suggest that slots with similar semantic or contextual properties are more likely to benefit from shared representations, leading to better performance in tracking tasks.\n\n![The table presents data comparing \"Trained Single\" and \"Zero-Shot\" performance across five categories: Hotel, Train, Attraction, Restaurant, and Taxi.](image1)\n\n![The image contains two bar charts, labeled as Figure 5, showing zero-shot dialogue state tracking (DST) error analysis in two domains: Hotel (a) and Restaurant (b).](image2)\n\n![The table presents results from an evaluation of a Base Model (BM) trained on four domains and its fine-tuning on a new domain.](image3)\n\n![The image is a bar chart showing the error rates of different slots on a test set from multi-domain training, specifically in areas like restaurant, attraction, hotel, taxi, and train domains.](image4)\n\n![The image is a heatmap visualizing the cosine similarity between embeddings for different slots in the MultiWOZ dataset.](image5)\n\nIn summary, GEM outperforms EWC and naive fine-tuning in adapting models to new domains, while slot similarities significantly influence performance, with more correlated slots showing better tracking accuracy."}

This indicates a clear bias in how these systems handle gender-related translations.\n\nFor instance, Figure 2 depicts Google Translate's absolute accuracies on stereotypical and non-stereotypical gender roles across all tested languages. The results show that the accuracy for stereotypical translations is consistently higher than for non-stereotypical translations. In Spanish, for example, the accuracy for stereotypical translations is 67%, compared to 46% for non-stereotypical translations [3]. Similarly, in French, the accuracy for stereotypical translations is 80%, while it drops to 54% for non-stereotypical translations. This pattern is consistent across other languages as well, including Italian, Russian, Ukrainian, Hebrew, Arabic, and German [3].\n\n![The bar chart shows that the accuracy for stereotypical translations is consistently higher than for non-stereotypical translations across all tested languages.](image3)\n\nThe table in image2 provides further insight into the performance of different MT systems across various languages.

Microsoft Translator achieves its highest accuracy with German (74.1), while Amazon Translate shows its highest accuracy with Spanish (59.4) and Arabic (49.8) [2]. SYSTRAN, on the other hand, has a higher accuracy score in German (48.6), but shows significant \"Δ_G\" changes across various languages, with Arabic showing the most substantial change (49.4) [2].\n\nThe data from image4 also highlights the differences in performance between different experiments or analyses. For instance, the \"FR\" row (Ott et al., 2018) shows an accuracy of 49.4, with \"ΔG\" and \"ΔS\" values of 2.6 and 16.1, respectively. In contrast, the \"DE\" row (Edunov et al., 2018) shows an accuracy of 52.5, with \"ΔG\" and \"ΔS\" values of 7.3 and 8.4, respectively [4]. These differences suggest that the performance of MT systems can vary significantly depending on the specific language and the type of analysis being conducted.\n\n![The table shows the original values, adjusted values, and the difference between them for each entity.](image5)\n\nIn addition to these findings, the table in image1 provides a breakdown of data across three categories (Winogender, WinoBias, and WinoMT) by gender classification. For Winogender, the data is evenly distributed across male, female, and neutral categories, with 240 instances each. However, for WinoBias, there are significantly more male and female instances, with no neutral instances. For WinoMT, the data is again evenly distributed, with 1826 male, 1822 female, and 240 neutral instances [1]. This distribution suggests that the datasets used for evaluating gender bias in MT may not be entirely balanced, which could impact the results.\n\nOverall, the comparison of translation accuracy and gender bias across different MT systems and languages reveals a consistent pattern of bias towards pro-stereotypical gender role assignments.

For example, in French (FR), the accuracy (Acc) was 49.4%, with a ΔG of 2.6 and a ΔS of 16.1, indicating a moderate level of gender bias. In German (DE), the accuracy was 52.5%, with a ΔG of 7.3 and a ΔS of 8.4, suggesting a slightly lower bias. These metrics highlight that while stereotype-based adjustments can improve accuracy, the degree of improvement depends on the specific language and translation service used.\n\n![The table shows data for two rows corresponding to two different experiments or analyses labeled \"FR\" and \"DE\".](image4)\n\nIn conclusion, stereotype-based adjustments can improve gender bias accuracy in machine translation, but their effectiveness varies across different languages and translation systems. While some languages like Spanish and Russian show significant improvements, others may require more nuanced approaches to address gender bias effectively."}
{"q_id": 442, "model": "qwen3-30b-a3b", "in_tok": 2695, "out_tok": 984, "total_tok": 3679, "response": "The impact of different training and evaluation strategies on F1 scores in multi-hop and single-hop question answering tasks can be understood through the analysis of various experimental setups and their outcomes. The F1 score, which measures a model's accuracy by considering both precision and recall, is a critical metric for evaluating the performance of models in these tasks.\n\nIn the context of multi-hop reasoning, the F1 scores are significantly affected by the type of training and evaluation data used. For instance, when models are trained on adversarial distractors and evaluated on the same, the F1 scores improve substantially. This is evident from the data presented in Table 4, where the F1 score increases from 46.84 to 60.10 when the model is re-trained on adversarial distractors and tested on them [9]. This suggests that adversarial training can enhance a model's ability to handle complex, multi-hop questions by exposing it to more challenging data during training.\n\nSimilarly, the use of entity type filtering in the selection of distractors also plays a crucial role in improving F1 scores. When the initial list of 50 paragraphs is filtered to include only those whose entity type matches that of the gold paragraphs, the model's accuracy improves from 40.73 F1 to 58.42 F1 [6]. This indicates that filtering out irrelevant or biased distractors can lead to better performance, especially in multi-hop scenarios where the correct answer may not be immediately apparent.\n\nFor single-hop questions, the F1 scores are generally higher compared to multi-hop questions. However, even in single-hop tasks, the choice of training and evaluation strategies can influence the results. For example, the single-paragraph BERT model achieves an F1 score of 67.08 when using standard distractors, but this drops to 46.84 when evaluated on adversarial distractors [9]. This highlights the importance of using diverse and challenging data to ensure that models are robust and can generalize well to different types of questions.\n\nThe effect of retrieval methods on F1 scores is also notable. In open-domain settings, the single-hop model struggles due to the insufficiencies of standard TF-IDF retrieval. For instance, the model fails to retrieve the paragraph about \"Bonobo apes\" because the question does not contain relevant terms. This leads to a lower F1 score of 39.12 when using 500 retrieved paragraphs, but the score improves to 53.12 when additional gold paragraphs are provided [5]. This suggests that better retrieval methods are essential for improving performance in open-domain, single-hop tasks.\n\nFurthermore, the performance of models in different settings, such as \"Distractor\" and \"Open,\" varies significantly. The table in image1 shows that the Distractor setting yields higher F1 scores compared to the Open setting, with the highest score being 69.76 for BERT Plus in the Distractor setting [image1]. This indicates that models perform better when they are evaluated on data that closely resembles the training data, rather than on more challenging, open-domain data.\n\nThe impact of different question types on F1 scores is also evident. Multi-hop questions, which require reasoning across multiple pieces of information, generally have lower F1 scores compared to single-hop questions. For example, in the table presented in image3, the F1 scores for multi-hop questions are 54.46, while those for single-hop questions are 70.54 [image3]. This suggests that multi-hop questions are more challenging for models and require more sophisticated reasoning capabilities.\n\nIn summary, different training and evaluation strategies have a significant impact on F1 scores in multi-hop and single-hop question answering tasks. Adversarial training, entity type filtering, and improved retrieval methods can all contribute to better performance, particularly in multi-hop scenarios. The choice of evaluation data and the complexity of the questions also play a crucial role in determining the final F1 scores.\n\n![The table presents F1 scores for different models under two evaluation settings: \"Distractor\" and \"Open.\"](image1)\n![The table displays the F1 scores for various settings related to a task, presumably in the context of natural language processing or machine learning, judging by the terms used.](image2)\n![The table contains four columns with the following headers: \"Type,\" \"Question,\" \"%,\" and \"F1.\"](image3)\n![The table shows a comparison of performance metrics (scores) for different combinations of evaluation and training data.](image4)\n![The table consists of three columns with the headings \"Type,\" \"Question,\" and \"%.\"](image5)\n\nThe F1 scores in multi-hop and single-hop question answering tasks are significantly influenced by the training and evaluation strategies employed."}

This leads to a substantial drop in accuracy, indicating that the models were not truly understanding the underlying argument comprehension task but rather relying on superficial patterns in the data.\n\nAccording to the text quotes, when BERT was trained and validated on the original data and then evaluated on the adversarial set, all results were worse than random due to overfitting the cues in the original training set [6]. However, when models were trained from scratch on the adversarial training and validation sets, their performance on the adversarial test set dropped significantly. Specifically, BERT’s peak performance fell to 53%, with mean and median at 50% [6]. This result suggests that the adversarial dataset successfully eliminated the cues, providing a more robust evaluation of machine argument comprehension.\n\nFurthermore, the text states that BERT's maximum performance on the ARCT task was just three points below the average untrained human baseline, but this result was entirely due to the exploitation of spurious statistical cues in the dataset [8]. By constructing an adversarial dataset where these cues were eliminated, it was shown that all models achieved random accuracy, indicating that the previous high performance was not indicative of true understanding [8].\n\nThe image quotes also provide relevant information. Image4 shows a table comparing the performance metrics of different BERT models on the adversarial dataset. The results indicate that even the best-performing BERT model only achieved a maximum test accuracy of 53%, with mean and median scores around 50% [4]. This aligns with the findings in the text quotes, reinforcing the conclusion that the adversarial setup effectively neutralized the spurious cues.\n\n![The table presents a comparison of the performance metrics for different BERT models, namely \"BERT\", \"BERT (W)\", \"BERT (R, W)\", and \"BERT (C, W)\", based on their test performance.](image4)\n\nIn conclusion, the adversarial data setup significantly reduces the performance of BERT models on the ARCT dataset, highlighting that their previous high accuracy was due to exploiting spurious statistical cues rather than true understanding of argument comprehension."}

The table shows that **greedy decoding** performs best among automated methods, achieving an average score of 77.53, while **human validation** serves as the positive control with a much higher average score of 86.18. This indicates that although greedy decoding is effective, it still falls short of reaching the performance level of human validation. Other decoding methods, such as **beam search with 2 beams**, also show improved scores over random sampling, but their performance decreases as the number of beams increases. For example, beam search with 10 beams achieves an average score of 56.45, which is significantly lower than the scores achieved by greedy decoding and human validation. Overall, the results suggest that **greedy decoding is the most effective automated method**, but **human validation remains the gold standard** for evaluating the quality of generated commonsense inferences.\n\n![Human validation serves as the positive control with high scores across all relations, averaging 86.18](image1)\n\nVariations in training data percentages also have a significant impact on the model's metrics. From the results in Table 4, we observe that using **10% of the training data** leads to relatively strong performance, with perplexity scores of 13.74 and BLEU-2 scores of 12.72. However, when only **1% of the training data** is used, the model's performance drops considerably, with a perplexity score of 23.81 and a BLEU-2 score of 5.08. On the other hand, using **50% or full training data** results in better performance, with perplexity scores of 11.82 and 11.13, respectively. These findings indicate that **increasing the amount of training data improves the model's performance**, but even with limited data, the model can still produce coherent and adequate knowledge. Additionally, the results highlight that **pre-trained language representations play a crucial role** in improving the model's performance, as models trained with pre-training achieve better results than those trained from random initialization.\n\n![Using 10% of the training data leads to relatively strong performance, with perplexity scores of 13.74 and BLEU-2 scores of 12.72](image3)"}

According to the table in image1, the COMET model demonstrates superior performance across multiple metrics, including the lowest perplexity (4.32), the highest score (95.25), and a close approximation to human performance (91.69). These results indicate that COMET not only generates high-quality knowledge but also does so with a high degree of accuracy.\n\n![COMET's performance on ConceptNet is highlighted by its low perplexity, high score, and close approximation to human performance](image1)\n\nIn addition to accuracy, the novelty of the generated tuples is another critical factor in evaluating the effectiveness of a model. The text quote [1] states that 59.25% of the tuples generated by COMET are not present in the training set, indicating that the model is capable of generating new edges between nodes and even creating new nodes. This level of novelty suggests that COMET is not merely memorizing existing knowledge but is actively expanding the knowledge graph with new information.\n\n![COMET generates novel tuples that extend the size of the knowledge graph](image1)\n\nFurthermore, the table in image4 provides a detailed breakdown of the performance of COMET and its variant, COMET (+ hierarchy meta-tokens), across various categories. While COMET performs better in most categories, the variant shows improvement in oReact and xWant. However, the overall Total score is higher for COMET, indicating that it has superior performance across these categories compared to the variant. This suggests that the base COMET model is more effective at generating accurate and diverse knowledge.\n\n![COMET outperforms its variant in most categories, indicating its effectiveness in generating accurate and diverse knowledge](image4)\n\nThe graph in image2 further illustrates the relationship between edit distance and the percentage of novel tuples, as well as classifier accuracy. As the edit distance increases, the percentage of novel tuples generally decreases, while the classifier's accuracy remains high, close to 100%, but slightly decreases as the edit distance increases. This implies that while the model can generate novel tuples, the accuracy of these tuples may decrease as they become more distant from the training data.\n\n![As edit distance increases, the percentage of novel tuples decreases, and classifier accuracy slightly decreases](image2)\n\nIn conclusion, the COMET model demonstrates high accuracy and novelty on the ConceptNet dataset, making it an effective tool for automatic knowledge base construction.

{"q_id": 446, "model": "qwen3-30b-a3b", "in_tok": 3483, "out_tok": 489, "total_tok": 3972, "response": "The sensitivity and word error rate (WER) of models can vary significantly depending on whether they are closed or open vocabulary models, as well as the backoff strategies employed. Closed vocabulary models, such as word-only models, typically treat out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words in a uniform manner, whereas open vocabulary models, like char-only, word+char, or word-piece models, consider each unique combination of characters differently. This distinction affects both sensitivity and WER.\n\nFor example, in the case of closed vocabulary models, the pass-through strategy may result in higher sensitivity compared to the background or neutral strategies. This is because the pass-through approach passes words as is, leading to unique predictions for each OOV combination. On the other hand, the neutral strategy maps UNK predictions to a fixed neutral word, which reduces sensitivity. The background strategy, which uses a larger corpus for backoff, can also reduce sensitivity by providing more context for rare or unseen words.\n\nIn contrast, open vocabulary models generally have lower sensitivity due to their ability to handle a wider range of character combinations. However, this does not always translate to lower WER. For instance, the pass-through version of open vocabulary models may have higher sensitivity than the background variant, as it treats each unique combination as distinct. The neutral strategy, however, can reduce sensitivity by mapping UNK predictions to a fixed word, similar to the closed vocabulary case.\n\nThe trade-off between sensitivity and WER is also evident in the performance of different backoff strategies. While a lower WER is desirable, it often comes at the cost of increased sensitivity. Models with low sensitivity and WER are generally more robust, as they provide fewer opportunities for attackers to exploit vulnerabilities.\n\n![The table presents data comparing different models with respect to various criteria. It is divided into two main sections: Closed Vocabulary Models (word-only) and Open Vocabulary Models (char/word+char/word-piece).](image2)\n\n![The image consists of two scatter plots, each representing the relationship between sensitivity and word error rate (WER) for two types of models: word-only models (left plot) and char-only models (right plot).

Metrics such as **BEER**, **BLEU**, **sacreBLEU.BLEU**, and **sacreBLEU.chrF** are highlighted as having high correlation values. Specifically, **BEER** shows a strong correlation across most language pairs, including en-fi, while **BLEU** also demonstrates a high level of agreement with human judgments. Additionally, **sacreBLEU.BLEU** and **sacreBLEU.chrF** are variations of the BLEU metric that also display strong correlations, suggesting they are reliable indicators of translation quality for this language pair.\n\nIn contrast, **QE metrics** such as **IBM1-Morpheme**, **LASIM**, and **YISI-2** generally have lower correlation values compared to the general metrics. This suggests that these QE metrics may not be as effective in predicting human judgments for the en-fi language pair.\n\nFor the en-kk (English-Kazakh) language pair, similar trends are observed. The general metrics like **BEER**, **BLEU**, **sacreBLEU.BLEU**, and **sacreBLEU.chrF** show strong correlations with human assessments. However, **BLEU** exhibits slightly lower correlation values for this specific pair, indicating a minor decrease in its effectiveness. The **QE metrics** again show lower correlation values, which implies they may not be as accurate in evaluating translation quality for en-kk.\n\nOverall, the general metrics tend to perform better in terms of correlation with human assessments for both the en-fi and en-kk language pairs, while the QE metrics show weaker performance.

This decline can be attributed to several factors, including changes in accumulated amortization and adjustments in the gross carrying amounts of specific intangible assets.\n\nLooking at the details provided, the decrease in net carrying amounts is primarily due to an increase in accumulated amortization. For example, the accumulated amortization for developed technology increased from $72 million in 2019 to $111 million in 2020, which reduced the net carrying amount for this category. Similarly, accumulated amortization for favorable contracts and leases increased from $24 million in 2019 to $32 million in 2020, further contributing to the reduction in net carrying amounts.\n\nAdditionally, some intangible assets saw a decrease in their gross carrying amounts. For instance, the gross carrying amount for trade names remained relatively stable, but the net carrying amount decreased slightly due to increased amortization. The \"Other\" category also experienced a reduction in net carrying amount, partly due to an increase in accumulated amortization.\n\nThese changes reflect the ongoing amortization of finite-lived intangible assets over their useful lives, as well as potential adjustments to the value of these assets based on business conditions or accounting standards.\n\n![The table compares finite-lived intangible assets as of December 31 for the years 2020 and 2019, showing the changes in gross carrying amounts, accumulated amortization, and net carrying amounts.](image5)\n\nThe net carrying amounts of finite-lived intangible assets decreased from $334 million in 2019 to $298 million in 2020."}

According to the provided information, foreign exchange risk is considered the most significant financial risk for the company, with potential effects on multiple financial statements, including the income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow statement [1]. To manage this risk, Novo Nordisk employs financial instruments such as forward exchange contracts and currency options to hedge existing assets, liabilities, and future expected cash flows up to 24 months forward [7][9]. This approach helps mitigate the short-term negative impact of exchange rate fluctuations on earnings and cash flow, contributing to more predictable financial results [3].\n\nThe impact of a hypothetical 5% increase or decrease in certain currencies versus EUR and DKK on Novo Nordisk’s operating profit was outlined in a table, which showed that these changes would affect both \"Other comprehensive income\" and \"Income statement.\" Specifically, under a 5% increase scenario, \"Other comprehensive income\" would be negatively impacted by (1,893) DKK million, while \"Income statement\" would see a positive impact of 299 DKK million, resulting in a total effect of (1,594) DKK million. Conversely, a 5% decrease would lead to a positive impact on \"Other comprehensive income\" of 1,893 DKK million and a negative impact on \"Income statement\" of (299) DKK million, with a total effect of 1,594 DKK million [10].\n\nFurthermore, the table in image2 provides detailed financial data related to cash flow hedges and other comprehensive income over several years.

According to image4, Equity AUM grew from $111 billion in 2018 to $174 billion in 2020, while Fixed Income AUM rose from $71 billion to $86 billion. Alternative/Other AUM also increased, from $131 billion to $145 billion. The Long-term AUM Subtotal expanded from $313 billion to $405 billion, and Liquidity AUM increased from $158 billion to $252 billion. Finally, Total AUM rose from $471 billion in 2018 to $657 billion in 2020. This substantial growth in AUM likely contributed to an increase in asset management revenues, as noted in text quote [9], which states that asset management revenues increased by 15% in 2020 compared to the prior year, primarily due to higher average AUM driven by strong investment performance and positive net flows.\n\nIn addition to the growth in AUM, fee rates decreased across most categories.

However, the weighted average discount rate decreased slightly from 3.1% in 2019 to 2.8% in 2020. A lower discount rate would result in higher present value calculations for future lease payments, thereby increasing the recorded lease liabilities. Additionally, the company may have entered into new operating leases or extended existing ones, contributing to the increase in liabilities.\n\nAnother factor that could have influenced the change in operating lease liabilities is the timing of lease payments.

In 2020, ExxonMobil's Capex was reported at $21.4 billion, a decrease from the previous year, as the company focused on managing controllable expenses and prioritizing opportunities to meet global energy demand [3]. The Corporation aimed to hold 2021 capital spending within a range of $16 billion to $19 billion, indicating a deliberate effort to manage costs [3]. This reduction in Capex is further supported by the data in image3, which shows that Capital Expenditures decreased from $1,276 million in 2019 to $1,087 million in 2020, while Other Expenditures also declined from $3,969 million to $3,389 million [image3].\n\nIn terms of taxes, ExxonMobil experienced a notable shift in 2020 compared to 2019. The total taxes on the income statement for 2020 were $22.8 billion, a significant decrease from $38.5 billion in 2019 [10]. This decline was driven by a combination of factors, including lower realized prices for the Corporation’s products, which led to substantially lower earnings and operating cash flow in comparison to 2019 [4]. Additionally, the effective tax rate in 2020 was 17%, down from 34% in 2019, primarily due to a change in the mix of results across jurisdictions with varying tax rates [10]. The table in image4 provides a detailed breakdown of these tax figures, showing that income taxes in 2020 were a benefit of $5.6 billion, compared to an expense of $5.3 billion in 2019 [image4].\n\nThe financial implications of these changes were substantial. The reduction in Capex and taxes helped ExxonMobil strengthen its liquidity position in 2020, as the company issued $23 billion of long-term debt and implemented significant cost reductions [4]. However, the overall financial performance was impacted by the challenging market conditions, leading to a decrease in total revenues across all business segments, as indicated in image1 [image1].

The decline in total revenues, primarily driven by the International Operated Markets segment, contributed to the decrease in both GAAP and Non-GAAP EPS. Specifically, the Company-operated sales decreased by 14% in 2020 compared to 2019, while franchised revenues declined by 8% during the same period. These declines were exacerbated by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to temporary restaurant closures and limited operations, particularly in international markets such as the U.K., France, Germany, Italy, and Spain.\n\nThe financial data provided in the tables further supports this trend. For instance, the table shows that the Company-operated margins decreased from $1,660 million in 2019 to $1,158 million in 2020, while franchised margins also declined from $9,455 million in 2019 to $8,519 million in 2020. Additionally, Selling, General and Administrative (SG&A) expenses increased in 2020, partly due to higher investments in brand communications and franchisee support, which further pressured profitability.\n\n![GAAP and Non-GAAP earnings per share for the years 2020, 2019, and 2018](image3)\n\nThe reconciliation of diluted earnings per share highlights the impact of strategic gains and charges on EPS.

For instance, image2 shows that the Sandoz segment's operating income decreased by 12% in USD and 14% in constant currencies when comparing 2021 to 2020 [image2]. However, image4 indicates that the Sandoz segment's operating income increased by 53% in USD and 48% in constant currencies [image4]. These discrepancies suggest that different metrics or reporting periods may have influenced the results.\n\n![The table presents financial data in USD millions for a company, comparing figures from the year ended December 31, 2021, to those from December 31, 2020.

However, these gains were partially offset by unfavorable gross margins and lower sales. The main factors contributing to these changes include cost reductions and operational efficiencies, as well as the impact of currency fluctuations."}

This increase was primarily due to a lower cost of funds, partially offset by lower average revolving Card Member loan balances. Additionally, the table in image5 shows that net interest income increased slightly from $967 million in 2020 to $1,011 million in 2021. The data in image2 further supports this trend, indicating that net interest income and adjusted net interest income have generally decreased from 2019 to 2021, but the U.S. segment consistently showed higher amounts than the international segment.\n\n![Net interest income and adjusted net interest income have generally decreased from 2019 to 2021, with the U.S. segment showing higher amounts than the international segment.](image2)\n\n### Card Member Receivables\n\nCard member receivables increased from $18.7 billion in 2020 to $22.4 billion in 2021, as shown in the table in image4.

The increase in net interest income was driven by a lower cost of funds, as noted in text quote [7]. However, the table in image2 also highlights that interest rate changes can affect customer behavior, such as impacting the loan balances Card Members carry on their credit cards or their ability to make payments, which could further impact the results of operations. \n\nFor card member receivables, the increase from 2019 to 2021 can be attributed to improved portfolio quality and macroeconomic outlook, as mentioned in text quotes [3] and [6]. The improvement in unemployment rate projections played a significant role in the reduction of provisions for credit losses, which in turn affected the card member receivables. \n\nIn summary, net interest income increased from 2019 to 2021, primarily due to a lower cost of funds, while card member receivables increased, influenced by improved portfolio quality and macroeconomic conditions."}

This indicates that the increase in total liabilities is partially attributed to the changes in total debt. The Company had the ability to incur approximately $4.4 billion of additional indebtedness in direct borrowings or under the outstanding commercial paper facilities based on the amounts available under the Company's $5.0 billion Five-Year Facility, which could have contributed to the increase in total debt. Additionally, the Company classified $611 million of its borrowings outstanding under the euro-denominated commercial paper program and $290 million of borrowings outstanding under the 2021 Yen Notes as long-term debt in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet as the Company had the intent and ability to refinance these borrowings for at least one year from the balance sheet date.

This increase is primarily attributed to higher earnings and lower net discrete tax benefits. In 2020, the net discrete tax benefits were $122 million, which is significantly lower than the $475 million recorded in 2019 [1]. The reduction in net discrete tax benefits is mainly due to the conversion of employee share-based awards. These changes in the effective tax rate and net discrete tax provisions are closely related to the overall compensation expenses for the same period.\n\nCompensation and benefits expenses in 2020 increased by 11% compared to the prior year, reaching $20,854 million. This increase was driven by factors such as higher discretionary incentive compensation, formulaic payouts to Wealth Management representatives, and additional compensation from the E*TRADE acquisition [9]. However, there were also reductions in compensation associated with carried interest. The relationship between the effective tax rate and compensation expenses can be seen in the context of deferred cash-based compensation programs, where changes in the fair value of investments impact both the tax provisions and the compensation expenses [2].\n\n![The table shows compensation expenses in millions of dollars for three categories—Institutional Securities, Wealth Management, and Investment Management—over three years (2020, 2019, and 2018).](image1)\n\n![The table presents financial data for the years 2020, 2019, and 2018, with measures in millions of dollars.

According to the text, Card Member loans increased by 21 percent in 2021, which was lower than the growth in billed business due to higher paydown rates driven by the continued liquidity and financial strength of the customer base [4]. This increase in loan balances was partially offset by improved portfolio quality and a better macroeconomic outlook, leading to a decrease in the reserve for credit losses [7]. Specifically, the reserve for credit losses on Card Member loans decreased for the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to improved portfolio quality and macroeconomic outlook, in large part driven by improvement in unemployment rate projections, partially offset by an increase in outstanding loan balances [7].\n\nIn contrast, the reserve for credit losses on Card Member receivables also saw a decrease, as the global macroeconomic outlook improved, although this was partially offset by a decline in outstanding receivable balances [2]. The overall trend in credit loss reserves reflects a combination of improved economic conditions and changes in the loan and receivable portfolios.\n\nWhen comparing these changes to network volumes and card member spending during the same period, we see that network volumes increased by 24% in 2021 compared to a 18% decrease in 2020 [4].

In 2021, cash inflows from financing activities amounted to €11,839 million, whereas in 2020, it was a negative figure of €-249 million. This shift was primarily due to the financing of the acquisition of Varian, which had a major impact on the company’s financial structure.

This represents a substantial turnaround over the two-year period.\n\nFrom the data provided in the financial tables, we can see that the comprehensive income attributable to common stockholders increased by $2,138 million from 2018 to 2020. This improvement was driven by several factors, including the overall increase in net income and the changes in other comprehensive income (OCI), particularly foreign currency translation adjustments.\n\nIn 2018, the comprehensive loss of $1,018 million was largely due to a net loss of $1,063 million, combined with a negative OCI of $42 million. By 2020, the company recorded a net income of $862 million, along with a positive OCI of $399 million, resulting in a comprehensive income of $1,261 million. After subtracting the portion attributable to noncontrolling interests, the comprehensive income attributable to common stockholders reached $1,120 million.\n\nOne of the key contributing factors to this change was the significant improvement in net income. As stated in the text quotes, Tesla's net income attributable to common stockholders increased by $1.58 billion in 2020 compared to the prior year [9]. This was supported by an increase in operating margin, which rose to 6.3% in 2020 from the previous year. Additionally, the company experienced a favorable change in its operating performance, which contributed to the overall improvement in financial results.\n\nAnother factor was the impact of foreign currency transaction gains and losses. While the company recorded net foreign currency transaction losses of $114 million in 2020, it also saw gains of $48 million in 2019 and $2 million in 2018 [2]. These fluctuations had an impact on the overall comprehensive income, but the positive trend in 2020 helped offset some of the losses from previous years.\n\nFurthermore, the company faced restructuring costs in 2018, which included employee termination expenses and losses from sub-leasing a facility, totaling $37 million [7]. These costs contributed to the comprehensive loss in 2018.

First, the **gross capital lease obligations** are listed as $14,811 million. From this amount, the **imputed interest** is subtracted, which is $534 million. This results in the **present value of net minimum lease payments**, which is $14,277 million.

These differences reflect shifts in regulatory requirements, capital composition, and risk exposures.\n\nUnder the **Standardized Approach**, the **Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratio** was 17.4% in 2020, compared to 16.4% in 2019. This increase indicates a stronger capital position in 2020. Similarly, the **Tier 1 Capital Ratio** rose from 18.6% in 2019 to 19.4% in 2020, while the **Total Capital Ratio** increased from 21.0% to 21.5%. These improvements suggest that the institution maintained or enhanced its capital adequacy over the year. The **Total RWA** under the Standardized Approach also increased from $394,177 million in 2019 to $453,106 million in 2020, reflecting higher risk exposure, likely due to increased credit and market risk components [4].\n\nIn contrast, under the **Advanced Approach**, the **Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratio** improved slightly from 16.9% in 2019 to 17.7% in 2020. The **Tier 1 Capital Ratio** grew from 19.2% to 19.8%, and the **Total Capital Ratio** increased from 21.5% to 21.8%. These trends indicate consistent capital strength under the Advanced Approach as well. However, the **Total RWA** under the Advanced Approach increased from $382,496 million in 2019 to $445,151 million in 2020, which is a larger absolute increase compared to the Standardized Approach. This may be attributed to more complex risk modeling and higher exposure to derivatives and equity investments [9].\n\nThe differences in RWA between the two approaches highlight the impact of the methodologies used. The **Standardized Approach** generally results in higher RWA due to its reliance on prescribed risk weights, while the **Advanced Approach** uses internal models to calculate exposure amounts and risk weights, often leading to lower RWA. For example, in 2020, the **Credit Risk RWA** under the Standardized Approach was $387,066 million, whereas under the Advanced Approach, it was $284,930 million [3]. This discrepancy underscores the varying levels of complexity and flexibility in the two approaches.\n\nAdditionally, the institution’s **capital buffers** played a role in maintaining these ratios. In 2020, the **Capital Conservation Buffer** was 2.5% under the Advanced Approach, while it was not applicable under the Standardized Approach. The **Stress Capital Buffer** was 5.7% under the Standardized Approach but not applicable under the Advanced Approach. These buffers are essential for ensuring the institution can absorb losses during stress scenarios [2].\n\nThe **Supplementary Leverage Ratio (SLR)** also provides insight into the institution’s capital structure. In 2020, the SLR was 6.4%, exceeding the required 5.0%, while in 2019, it was 6.0%, surpassing the required 4.0%. This indicates that the institution consistently maintained a strong leverage position [1].\n\n![The table presents financial data related to leverage-based capital for December 31, 2019, measured in millions of dollars.

By the end of the year (March 31, 2020), the promoter shareholding remained unchanged at **72.0%**, indicating no change in the number of shares or the ownership percentage throughout the year [3].

This growth was driven by several factors, including a prior year loss on early debt extinguishment, lower taxes, and interest expense in the current year. Additionally, the reduction in shares outstanding contributed to the increase in net earnings per share.

This indicates that while some areas like IBM Z performed well, others faced significant declines. In terms of **pre-tax income**, the **Systems** segment saw a **36.0% decrease**, reflecting challenges in maintaining profitability despite improvements in gross profit margins [5].\n\nLooking at the **Global Financing** segment, **pre-tax income** dropped by **27.8%**, primarily due to lower revenue and increased expenses [8]. However, this segment's performance was not directly tied to the same factors as the Systems segment, as it involved financing activities rather than hardware or software sales.\n\nWhen considering **regions**, the **Americas** saw a **6.0% decrease** in total revenue, while **Europe/Middle East/Africa** and **Asia Pacific** both experienced smaller declines of **3.3%** and **3.5%**, respectively [image4]. These regional variations suggest that the impact of the economic environment and the pandemic varied across different markets.\n\n![The table shows \"Systems external revenue\" for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, broken down into different categories.

Derivative financial instruments, which are used for hedging and other financial strategies, show a notable increase from 2019 to 2020. According to image1, the total derivative financial instruments in 2020 amounted to DKK 1,365 million, compared to DKK 734 million in 2019. These instruments include various forward contracts with positive and negative fair values, categorized as cash flow hedges and fair value hedges. The table also indicates that some values are recognized in the income statement while others are recognized in other comprehensive income, reflecting the complexity of their impact on the financial statements [image1].\n\nIn addition to derivative financial instruments, the cash flow changes provide insights into the company's operational and investing activities. Image5 highlights the change in working capital, which had a significant effect on cash flow. For 2020, the cash flow change in working capital was DKK (4,353) million, compared to DKK (3,388) million in 2019. This indicates a larger outflow of cash in 2020 due to changes in working capital, such as increases in inventories, trade receivables, and other receivables and prepayments, as well as decreases in trade payables and other liabilities. These changes affect the company's liquidity and its ability to generate cash from operations.\n\nFurthermore, image2 provides data on financial liabilities, including derivative financial instruments, which totaled DKK 1,365 million in 2020 and DKK 734 million in 2019. This increase in financial liabilities reflects the company's exposure to derivative instruments and their potential impact on future cash flows. The table also shows that financial liabilities measured at amortised cost were significantly higher in 2020, indicating a greater reliance on long-term borrowings and trade payables.\n\nThe impact of these financial elements on the company's financial statements is multifaceted. Derivative financial instruments, as noted in text quote [2], can result in cumulative gains or losses that are initially recorded in equity and later transferred to the income statement when the forecast transaction occurs. This affects both the balance sheet and the income statement. Additionally, the changes in working capital, as shown in image5, influence the cash flow from operating activities, which is crucial for assessing the company's financial health and its ability to meet short-term obligations.\n\nIn summary, the increase in derivative financial instruments and the changes in working capital in 2020 compared to 2019 have a substantial impact on the company's financial statements, affecting both the balance sheet and the income statement. ![The table displays data on derivative financial instruments for the years 2020 and 2019, in DKK million.

This growth in comprehensive income is primarily driven by an increase in net income, which rose from $4,214,594 in 2018 to $4,846,241 in 2019 and further to $5,185,313 in 2020 [4]. The increase in net income was supported by higher operating income, which grew by $209 million or 3% in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 [3].\n\nThe other comprehensive income (OCI) components also showed variations over the three years. For example, in 2020, the OCI attributable to Accenture PLC was $278,740, whereas it was negative in 2019 at $(264,406) and 2018 at $(481,387). These fluctuations were influenced by several factors, including foreign currency translation gains and losses, changes in defined benefit plans, cash flow hedges, and investment-related gains or losses.

The company emphasizes three pillars: stability, growth, and efficiency, aiming to build a robust financial foundation to support sustainable growth [7]. This approach ensures that Toyota can invest in advanced technologies while maintaining financial health.\n\nIn terms of shareholder returns, Toyota prioritizes the benefit of its shareholders as an important element of its management policy. The company strives to ensure the stable and continuous payment of dividends, seeking to maintain and improve upon the consolidated payout ratio of 30% [10]. Financial data from recent fiscal years shows that Toyota has maintained a consistent dividend per share, with some fluctuations over time. For example, in 2021, the dividend per share was 240 yen, and the payout ratio was 29.8% [5]. These figures indicate Toyota's commitment to returning value to shareholders while also reinvesting in areas like environmental technologies and safety innovations.\n\nRegarding electrification measures, Toyota is actively responding to climate scenarios by investing in electrified vehicles and reducing CO2 emissions. The company recognizes the risks associated with tightening regulations for fuel efficiency and zero-emission vehicles (ZEVs), such as fines for non-compliance and stranded assets. However, it also sees opportunities in increased sales of electrified vehicles [4]. To address these challenges and opportunities, Toyota is investing in battery technology and promoting energy-efficient solutions. The company's strategic planning includes adapting to different climate scenarios, such as the below 2°C and 1.5°C scenarios, which involve advancements in battery technology, tighter policies, and changes in consumer preferences [5].\n\nThe table in image1 provides insight into Toyota's evaluation framework, which includes consolidated operating income and the volatility of its share price. The consolidated operating income for the current fiscal year was 150%, exceeding the reference value of 1 trillion yen. This indicates strong financial performance, which supports Toyota's ability to invest in future technologies. The volatility of Toyota's share price is also evaluated, with the company's share price at 6,501 yen and the Nikkei average at 18,917 yen.

In 2020, an impairment loss of DKK 350 million was recognized, substantially all of which related to patents and licenses [3].\n\nLooking at the **image2**, which provides detailed financial data for \"Land and buildings\" and \"Other equipment,\" we see that **depreciation for the year** in 2020 was DKK 964 million, compared to DKK 852 million in 2019. This indicates an increase in depreciation expenses, which directly impacts the net carrying amounts of these assets. The **balance at 31 December** for Land and buildings in 2020 was DKK 2,901 million, while for Other equipment it was DKK 479 million, showing a decrease from the previous year’s balances.\n\nIn addition, the **image4** provides a comprehensive overview of intangible assets and property, plant, and equipment (PPE). It shows that **amortisation, depreciation, and impairment losses** are key factors in determining the carrying amounts of these assets.

In 2019, premiums earned were $4,869 million. This increased to $5,861 million in 2020, reflecting growth in the insurance operations. However, in 2021, premiums earned slightly declined to $5,648 million. This decline was partly due to the GEICO Giveback program, which reduced earned premiums by approximately $2.5 billion in 2020 and had some residual impact in 2021. Despite this, the overall trend indicates that premiums earned remained relatively stable, with a slight decrease in 2021 compared to 2020.\n\nIn contrast, net investment income showed a more consistent downward trend. In 2019, net investment income was $5,530 million. This decreased to $5,039 million in 2020 and further dropped to $4,807 million in 2021. The decline in net investment income can be attributed to lower interest income, as highlighted in the text quotes. Specifically, interest and other investment income declined significantly, with a 44.4% drop in 2021 compared to 2020 and a 49.0% drop in 2020 compared to 2019. These declines were primarily due to lower income from short-term investments and fixed maturity securities, as low interest rates persisted throughout the period.\n\nWhile premiums earned experienced a minor decline in 2021, net investment income continued to decrease, indicating that the investment performance was a key factor affecting overall financial results during this period. \n\n![Net investment income declined from $5,530 million in 2019 to $4,807 million in 2021.](image2)\n\n![Premiums earned increased from $4,869 million in 2019 to $5,861 million in 2020 but declined slightly to $5,648 million in 2021.](image3)"}

This fluctuation suggests that the company's operations in foreign jurisdictions experienced varying levels of profitability over these years. The increase in 2021 compared to 2020 may indicate a recovery or strategic shift in certain international markets, while the drop from 2019 to 2020 could be attributed to external factors such as the global economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic [8].\n\nRegarding the **foreign tax provision**, the data shows that the current provision (benefit) for foreign jurisdictions was $1,563 million in 2019, $526 million in 2020, and $518 million in 2021.

This indicates that while the amortized cost remained relatively stable, the fair value of AFS securities declined, likely due to higher interest rates.\n\n![The table presents financial data comparing December 31, 2021, with December 31, 2020, for two categories: \"Available-for-sale\" and \"Held-to-maturity\" securities, shown in millions of dollars.](image4)\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBetween December 31, 2020, and December 31, 2021, WFAM assets under management decreased significantly due to the sale of the business, while available-for-sale securities experienced a decline in fair value despite a relatively stable amortized cost."}

This increase was driven by factors such as higher loan demand and originations, although consumer loans saw a decrease due to paydowns and transfers of mortgage loans to loans held for sale [1]. The total outstanding loans were further detailed in Table 10, which categorized them by portfolio segment, highlighting the commercial and industrial loan portfolio as a key driver of growth [1].\n\nIn addition to loan growth, the total net unrealized gains on AFS and HTM debt securities decreased from December 31, 2020, due to higher interest rates [2]. This suggests that the company's fixed-income portfolio faced challenges in maintaining value amid rising rates, which could influence its interest rate risk management strategies. Table 9 provides further details on the size and composition of the AFS and HTM debt securities portfolios, emphasizing their role in liquidity and interest rate risk management [8]. The amortized cost of these securities increased from December 31, 2020, as the company continued to purchase AFS and HTM debt securities, including through securitizations of LHFS [9].\n\nThe changes in total assets were also reflected in the balance sheet data presented in Table 3 and Table 4, which included average loan balances and period-end balances for various categories such as cash, available-for-sale debt securities, held-to-maturity debt securities, equity securities, total loans, total assets, and total deposits [5]. These figures indicate that the company maintained a strong asset base, with total assets showing a slight increase from 2020 to 2021.\n\nRegarding WFAM assets under management (AUM), the data shows a significant decline from $508.8 billion at the beginning of 2020 to $603.0 billion at the beginning of 2021, followed by a sharp drop to $16.9 billion at the end of 2021 due to the sale of WFAM on November 1, 2021 [6]. This sale marked a strategic shift for Wells Fargo, as it moved the business from the Wealth and Investment Management operating segment to Corporate, aligning with broader efforts to streamline operations and focus on core banking activities. The sale of WFAM and the subsequent reduction in AUM likely impacted the company's fee income, as it had previously earned investment advisory and asset-based fees from managing and administering assets through WFAM [10].\n\nThe impact of these changes on Wells Fargo's financial strategy is evident in several ways. First, the sale of WFAM and the associated reduction in AUM reflect a strategic decision to divest non-core businesses and focus on more profitable segments. Second, the changes in the AFS and HTM debt securities portfolios highlight the company's ongoing efforts to manage liquidity and interest rate risk, which are critical components of its financial strategy. Third, the growth in total loans and the adjustments in the debt securities portfolios suggest that the company is actively managing its balance sheet to support lending activities while maintaining financial stability.\n\n![The table presents financial data comparing December 31, 2021, with December 31, 2020, for two categories: \"Available-for-sale\" and \"Held-to-maturity\" securities, shown in millions of dollars.](image2)\n\n![The table shows financial data in millions for December 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020.

These assumptions include key factors like discount rates, expected compensation increases, pension progression, and mortality rates. For instance, the discount rate in Germany was 1.7% in 2021 and 1.5% in 2020 [4]. The defined benefit obligation in Germany reflects an actuarially calculated present value of the future benefit entitlements for services already rendered (defined benefit obligation, DBO) [6].\n\nIn contrast, in the United States, defined benefit plans are sponsored by Siemens Healthineers, which have been frozen to new entrants and future benefit accruals, except for interest credits on cash balance accounts [8]. The actuarial assumptions for the U.S. plans are based on the Pri-2012 generational projection from the U.S. Social Security Administration's Long Range Demographic Assumptions for both 2021 and 2020 [5]. The discount rates in the U.S. are determined by reference to yields on high-quality corporate bonds of appropriate duration and currency at the end of the reporting period. However, specific discount rates for the U.S. are not provided in the text quotes, but the general approach is similar to that in Germany.\n\nFinancial indicators such as the defined benefit obligation, fair value of plan assets, and effects of the asset ceiling are also relevant. In 2021, the defined benefit obligation for the U.S. plans included a defined benefit obligation of €3 million, fair value of plan assets of €271 million, and asset ceiling effects of €0 million [5]. These figures highlight the significant impact of financial market movements on the funded status of the plans.\n\nAdditionally, the actuarial gains and losses for fiscal years 2021 and 2020 show the variability in these assumptions. For example, changes in financial assumptions resulted in a loss of €26 million in 2021 compared to a gain of €72 million in 2020 [2]. These fluctuations underscore the sensitivity of defined benefit plans to changes in actuarial assumptions and financial market conditions.\n\n![The table provides data on compensation increases and pension progression rates for two different years, 2021 and 2020.

Both countries face challenges related to changes in actuarial assumptions and financial market conditions, which can significantly impact the funded status of their pension plans."}

The overall adjusted net operating income for the entity was $13,312 million in 2020, which represents a decrease of $1,852 million or 12% compared to 2019 [image1]. This decline is reflected across various segments, with some experiencing significant drops while others showed modest improvements.\n\nFor example, **Global Liquidity and Cash Management** saw a substantial decrease in adjusted revenue, falling by $1,754 million or 30% in 2020 compared to 2019 [image1]. Similarly, **Markets products, Insurance, and Investments and Other** experienced a drop of $427 million or 21% in adjusted revenue [image1]. These declines likely contributed to the overall reduction in net operating income.\n\nIn contrast, **Credit and Lending** recorded an increase in adjusted revenue of $219 million or 4% in 2020 compared to 2019 [image1], which may have partially offset the losses in other areas. Additionally, **Global Markets** saw a significant increase in adjusted revenue of $1,562 million or 27% compared to 2019 [image5], indicating strong performance in this segment. This growth in Global Markets likely played a role in stabilizing the overall net operating income.\n\nRegarding **profit before tax**, the adjusted profit before tax for the entity was $1.9 billion in 2020, which is $5.3 billion or 74% lower than in 2019 [7]. This sharp decline was primarily due to higher adjusted ECL (Expected Credit Losses) and a fall in adjusted revenue, which was largely influenced by lower global interest rates [7]. However, some segments like **Markets products, Insurance, and Investments and Other** showed a smaller decrease in revenue, with a $427 million or 21% drop in 2020 compared to 2019 [image1]. This suggests that while the overall profit before tax declined, certain segments were less affected than others.\n\nAnother notable point is the **Net operating income** for the entity, which decreased from $15,164 million in 2019 to $13,312 million in 2020, a drop of $1,852 million or 12% [image1].

The graph shows that Adobe Systems' cumulative total return reached approximately $330 in 2015, which was much higher than the S&P 500 Index's return of around $180 and the S&P 500 Software & Services Index's return of about $200.

According to Table 10, commercial loans increased from $478,417 million in 2020 to $513,120 million in 2021, reflecting a rise driven by higher demand for commercial and industrial loans, although this was partially offset by paydowns and PPP loan forgiveness. On the other hand, consumer loans decreased from $409,220 million in 2020 to $382,274 million in 2021, primarily due to a reduction in residential mortgage – first lien portfolios, which were affected by low interest rates and the transfer of $17.8 billion in first lien mortgage loans to loans held for sale (LHFS). These changes suggest that the financial entity may have been focusing on expanding its commercial lending activities while managing the risks associated with consumer loans, possibly due to economic conditions and regulatory factors.\n\n![The table shows a breakdown of deposits in millions of dollars for two different years, December 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020.

This growth was observed across various deposit categories, including noninterest-bearing demand deposits, interest-bearing demand deposits, and savings deposits. However, time deposits saw a significant decline, decreasing from $49,775 million in 2020 to $29,461 million in 2021, a drop of 41%. This decline could be attributed to actions taken to manage under the asset cap, such as reducing time deposits like brokered certificates of deposit (CDs) and interest-bearing deposits in non-U.S. offices. The shift in deposit composition indicates a strategic move towards more stable and less volatile deposit sources, which might be aimed at improving liquidity and reducing exposure to interest rate fluctuations.\n\n![The table provides a breakdown of loan maturities and interest rate structures for a financial entity as of December 31, 2021. The loans are categorized into two main types: Commercial and Consumer.](image2)\n\nAdditionally, the data on loan maturities and interest rate structures reveals that a significant portion of both commercial and consumer loans mature within one year or have floating/variable interest rates. This suggests that the financial entity may be exposed to short-term interest rate risks, which could impact its net interest income. However, the presence of fixed interest rates on a portion of these loans indicates an attempt to mitigate some of these risks.\n\n![The table presents financial data comparing December 31, 2021, with December 31, 2020, for two categories: \"Available-for-sale\" and \"Held-to-maturity\" securities, shown in millions of dollars.](image3)\n\nThe financial entity's strategy appears to involve a balance between managing loan growth and maintaining a diversified deposit base. The increase in commercial loans and the strategic reduction in time deposits indicate a focus on leveraging market opportunities while managing risk. The overall trend suggests a proactive approach to adapting to economic conditions and regulatory requirements, ensuring stability and resilience in the face of potential challenges.\n\nIn conclusion, the loan and deposit figures changed significantly from December 31, 2020, to December 31, 2021, with commercial loans increasing and consumer loans decreasing, while deposits showed a net increase but with a notable decline in time deposits.

However, there is no direct data provided for 2020 for these entities in the text quotes. Nevertheless, we can infer some potential influences on their net income based on the broader financial context.\n\nThe Statements of Income for 2019 and 2020 are not explicitly detailed for Amberjack and Mars in the text quotes. However, image2 provides a table with the Statements of Income for various entities, including Amberjack and Mars, for the year ended December 31, 2019. While the specific figures for 2020 are not included in the text quotes, we can look at the overall trends in the company's financial performance.\n\nFor example, the depreciation and amortization expense on property, plant, and equipment increased slightly from $46 million in 2018 to $50 million in 2020 [7]. This increase could have impacted the operating income and, consequently, the net income of the entities. Additionally, the company's capital contributions to Permian Basin were $25 million in 2020 and $28 million in 2018 [5], which may have influenced the operating expenses and, thus, the net income.\n\nAnother factor that could have influenced the net income is the company's debt structure. The company has several credit facilities, including the Five Year Revolver due July 2023 and the Seven Year Fixed Facility. The interest rates on these facilities, as well as any changes in the terms of the facilities, could have affected the company's interest expenses and, therefore, its net income.\n\nFurthermore, the company evaluated long-lived assets for potential impairment indicators during the year ended December 31, 2020, due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic [6]. While no impairment was recorded, the evaluation process itself could have influenced the company's financial statements, including the net income of the entities.\n\nIn summary, while the exact net income figures for Amberjack and Mars in 2020 are not provided, the available data suggests that factors such as changes in depreciation and amortization expenses, capital contributions, and the company's debt structure could have influenced their net income.

According to the financial data provided, the Adjusted EBITDA for 2021 was $34,708 million, compared to $30,826 million in 2020 and $34,258 million in 2019. This indicates an increase in 2021 compared to 2020 but a decrease from 2019. The changes in Adjusted EBITDA can be attributed to various factors, including revenue growth, operating costs, and expenses.\n\nFor instance, the revenue increased in 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to the recovery of the overall market and specific contributions from segments like Comcast Spectacor and the sales of Sky Glass televisions [1]. However, the operating costs and expenses also increased, which impacted the Adjusted EBITDA. The table shows that operating costs and expenses for 2021 were $2,942 million, compared to $2,572 million in 2020 and $2,652 million in 2019.

For example, the Cable Communications segment saw an increase in capital expenditures, which could have affected its Adjusted EBITDA. The expenses in this segment increased due to higher programming expenses, technical and product support costs, franchise and other regulatory fees, and advertising, marketing, and promotion expenses, partially offset by decreases in other expenses and customer service expenses [3]. These factors likely contributed to the changes in Adjusted EBITDA for this segment.\n\nThe Sky segment also experienced changes in expenses, primarily due to increases in direct network costs and other expenses, partially offset by decreases in programming and production costs, as well as the impacts of foreign currency translation [3]. These changes in expenses would have influenced the Adjusted EBITDA for the Sky segment.\n\nFurthermore, the Corporate and Other segment saw a decrease in expenses due to severance charges related to businesses in the prior year period [3]. This reduction in expenses could have positively impacted the Adjusted EBITDA for this segment.\n\nOverall, the changes in Adjusted EBITDA for Comcast Corporation from 2019 to 2021 were influenced by a combination of revenue growth, operating costs, and segment-specific expenses. The company's strategic investments, such as in scalable infrastructure and line extensions in the Cable Communications segment, as well as the impact of external factors like the COVID-19 pandemic, played significant roles in these changes.

In 2018, the net income was $482 million, while in 2019, it rose to $546 million, and in 2020, it further increased to $556 million [10]. Similarly, the comprehensive income attributable to the Partnership was $464 million in 2018, $526 million in 2019, and $542 million in 2020 [image1]. These figures suggest a consistent growth in both net income and comprehensive income over the three-year period.\n\nThe main contributing factors to these increases can be attributed to several aspects of the Partnership's financial activities. The text quote [1] provides insight into the increase in investment, dividend, and other income, which grew by $34 million in 2020 compared to 2019. This increase was primarily due to the equity earnings associated with the acquisition of additional interests in Explorer and Colonial in June 2019, as well as the acquisition of an interest in Mattox in April 2020. However, this was partially offset by a decrease in dividend income from other investments of $14 million due to the change in accounting for Explorer and Colonial as equity method investments in 2020 rather than other investments in 2019 following the acquisition of additional interests in these entities in June 2019. Additionally, other income increased by $4 million related to higher distributions from Poseidon in 2020.\n\nFurthermore, the cash flow statement [image4] indicates that the Partnership generated cash from operations of $650 million in 2020, which is a significant contribution to its financial health and ability to distribute income. The Partnership also had a substantial amount of cash and cash equivalents at the end of 2020, totaling $320 million, which could have been used to support distributions or reinvestment.\n\nIn summary, the net income and comprehensive income attributable to the Partnership increased from 2018 to 2020, driven by factors such as increased equity earnings from acquisitions and higher distributions from certain investments, despite some decreases in dividend income from other investments. The Partnership's strong cash flow from operations also contributed to its financial performance.\n\n![Comprehensive income attributable to the Partnership increased from $464 million in 2018 to $542 million in 2020.](image1)"}

According to the text quotes, the adjusted EBIT increased by 40% from the prior-year period, driven by the first-time earnings contribution from Varian. Specifically, the adjusted EBIT margin for fiscal year 2021 was 17.4%, up from 15.5% in the prior year. This increase was mainly due to strong margin development in Diagnostics, which was driven by high demand for rapid COVID-19 antigen tests. Additionally, the adjusted EBIT margin of Varian was at the upper end of the expected range, with a very high 17.0% based on a generated adjusted EBIT of €221 million in the period from April 15 through September 30, 2021 [2].

The table in image2 illustrates this, showing an increase in trade and other receivables, inventories, and other components of working capital. Furthermore, the net debt increased by €10,416 million to €11,901 million in fiscal year 2021, mainly due to finance transactions related to the financing of the acquisition of Varian [7].

In 2020, the company reported net cash provided by operating activities of $10.6 billion, an increase from $9.6 billion in 2019, primarily due to lower net cash tax payments and reduced pre-tax pension and retiree medical plan contributions [2]. This improvement in operating cash flow contributed positively to free cash flow, which was $6.4 billion in 2020, compared to $5.6 billion in 2019, representing a 15% increase [4]. Free cash flow is a non-GAAP measure that reflects the cash generated after capital expenditures, and it is used for acquisitions, debt repayments, dividends, and share repurchases [9].\n\nThe table in image1 provides a detailed breakdown of these figures, showing the increase in net cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow from 2019 to 2020.

According to the text quotes, the Group's financial performance deteriorated in 2020, reflecting the impact of the pandemic on the global economy. Adjusted profit before tax for the Group was down 45% to $12.1 billion due to lower revenue and a higher expected credit loss charge directly linked to the pandemic [5]. This decline in adjusted profit before tax is also reflected in the table provided in image3, which shows that profit before tax decreased from $5,172 million in 2019 to $4,830 million in 2020, representing a 7% decrease [3].\n\nIn terms of net operating income, the table in image3 indicates that net operating income increased slightly from $14,869 million in 2019 to $15,303 million in 2020, a 3% increase.

For example, in Europe, Toyota Motor Europe NV/SA (TME) organizes events during International Women’s Day, including video messages and workshops, to raise awareness and promote gender equality [image1]. Additionally, TME provides support for working couples through flexible work arrangements such as home-working and part-time regimes, as well as employment support for spouses. The company also focuses on female career development through mentorship and sponsorship systems, which help women advance in their careers [image1].\n\nIn China, Toyota Motor (China) Investment Co., Ltd.

For instance, the company emphasizes the recruitment of individuals who possess empathy and a passion for realizing their dreams at Toyota, ensuring that diverse perspectives are represented in the workforce [5]. Toyota also aims to increase mid-career hires, with a target of 50% by the medium term, to introduce external knowledge and promote the reexamination of work processes and workstyles [6]. This focus on diversity extends to hiring new graduates with diverse backgrounds, further enriching the company's talent pool [6].\n\nThe data presented in image2 highlights the current state of gender diversity across Toyota's global operations. The percentage of women in different employment categories varies by location, with a global average of 28.7% for people hired, 16.6% for full-time employees, 15.1% for managerial positions, and 11.8% for director positions. These figures reflect the ongoing efforts to increase the representation of women in all levels of the organization.\n\nIn addition to these initiatives, Toyota is committed to fostering a harmonious society and promoting \"Mobility for All\" through its main business, which includes human asset development and community co-creation aimed at achieving the SDGs [7]. The company's efforts to enhance the competitiveness of its organizations by placing the right person in the right position, regardless of nationality, gender, or other factors, further underscore its commitment to diversity and inclusion [5].\n\n![The image shows a group of people in a room, standing together in what appears to be a group photo.

Let's examine these changes based on the evidence provided.\n\n### Risk-Weighted Assets (RWAs)\nUnder the **Standardized Approach**, the RWAs decreased slightly from $1,493 billion in 2019 to $1,480 billion in 2020 [image2]. This reduction was primarily due to lower commercial and consumer lending exposures, partially offset by investments of excess deposits in securities [2]. In contrast, under the **Advanced Approach**, RWAs also declined, from $1,447 billion in 2019 to $1,371 billion in 2020 [image2].\n\n### TLAC Ratios\nFor the **Standardized Approach**, the TLAC ratio increased from 24.6% in 2019 to 27.4% in 2020 [image5]. Under the **Advanced Approach**, the TLAC ratio rose from 24.6% in 2019 to 27.4% in 2020 as well [image5]. These increases indicate that the Corporation maintained or improved its capacity to absorb losses under both approaches.\n\n### Comparison to Regulatory Minimums\nThe **regulatory minimum for TLAC** was 22.0% for both years [image5]. In 2020, the TLAC ratios under both approaches exceeded this minimum, with the Standardized Approach at 27.4% and the Advanced Approach at 27.4%. For 2019, the TLAC ratios were also above the regulatory minimum, at 24.6% for both approaches.\n\n### Risk-Based Capital Ratios\nThe **Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital ratio** under the Standardized Approach was 11.9% in 2020, compared to 11.2% in 2019 [image2]. Under the Advanced Approach, it increased from 11.5% in 2019 to 12.9% in 2020 [image2]. The **Tier 1 Capital Ratio** also showed improvements, rising from 12.6% to 13.5% under the Standardized Approach and from 13.0% to 14.6% under the Advanced Approach [image2].\n\nThe **Total Capital Ratio** under the Standardized Approach increased from 14.8% in 2019 to 16.1% in 2020, while under the Advanced Approach, it rose from 14.7% to 16.6% [image2]. These ratios were above the regulatory minimums of 9.5%, 11.0%, and 13.0% for CET1, Tier 1, and Total Capital, respectively [image2].\n\n### Leverage Ratios\nThe **Tier 1 Leverage Ratio** remained stable at 7.4% for both 2020 and 2019 under both approaches [image2]. The **Supplementary Leverage Ratio** was 7.2% for both years, exceeding the regulatory minimum of 5.0% [image2].\n\n### Summary\nThe risk-weighted assets under both the Standardized and Advanced approaches decreased slightly from 2019 to 2020, while the TLAC ratios increased, indicating stronger capital positions. Both approaches maintained ratios above the regulatory minimums, demonstrating compliance and resilience.\n\n![The table compares financial data for two approaches, \"Standardized Approach\" and \"Advanced Approaches,\" over two years, 2020 and 2019, as of December 31.](image1)\n\n![The table presents various financial metrics and ratios for two different dates: December 31, 2020, and December 31, 2019.

From the information given, we can infer that the company's net income for 2018, 2019, and 2020 was influenced by various factors, including dividends declared and paid, stock-based awards, stock repurchases, and other comprehensive income (loss), net of taxes.\n\nIn 2018, the company reported a balance of retained earnings, which included net income, dividends declared and paid ($2.63 per share), common stock issued for stock-based awards, stock repurchases, stock compensation, other comprehensive income (loss), dividend equivalents on RSUs, and other items [3]. This suggests that the company's retained earnings were impacted by these financial activities.\n\nFor 2019, the company's retained earnings were again affected by similar factors, with dividends declared and paid at $3.21 per share [9]. The company also continued to issue common stock for stock-based awards, engage in stock repurchases, and account for stock compensation, other comprehensive income (loss), and dividend equivalents on RSUs. These activities would have contributed to changes in retained earnings and net income.\n\nIn 2020, the company's retained earnings and net income were influenced by dividends declared and paid at $3.72 per share [8], as well as the same types of financial activities as in previous years. Additionally, the company experienced a significant increase in free cash flow, with 38% of revenue generated as free cash flow, and approximately 109% of this cash flow returned to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends [6]. This indicates that the company's capital management strategy had a direct impact on its retained earnings and net income.\n\nThe significant factors affecting these changes include the company's capital management strategy, which involved share repurchases and dividend increases, as well as the overall performance of the company in terms of revenue and cash flow. The company's ability to generate strong cash flow and return it to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases is a key factor in the changes observed in retained earnings and net income.\n\n![The table contains numerical data arranged in a grid format, but without a caption, column headers, or row labels, it’s not possible to determine the exact context or meaning of the numbers.](image5)"}

This decline could be attributed to factors such as increased unemployment and related attrition, which are mentioned in the text quotes [10].\n\nIn contrast, the **UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement** segment saw an increase in the number of individuals served, with revenue rising by 9% from $83,252 million in 2019 to $90,764 million in 2020 [4]. This growth may be linked to the increasing number of people enrolling in Medicare Advantage plans, as noted in the text quotes [10].\n\nThe **UnitedHealthcare Community & State** segment also showed an increase in the number of individuals served, with revenue growing by 6% from $43,790 million in 2019 to $46,487 million in 2020 [4]. This could be due to the expansion of Medicaid coverage, as mentioned in the text quotes [10], where it is stated that the increase in people served via Medicaid was primarily driven by states easing redetermination requirements due to COVID-19.\n\nHowever, the **UnitedHealthcare Global** segment experienced a significant decrease in the number of individuals served, with revenue dropping by 21% from $9,855 million in 2019 to $7,752 million in 2020 [4].

This indicates that there was no change in his shareholding during the period.\n\nIn terms of remuneration, the data from the table provides a detailed breakdown. As an Independent Director, N Ganapathy Subramaniam received sitting fees for attending board/committee meetings and also received commission. His total remuneration as an Independent Director was 145.10, which includes sitting fees of 5.10 and commission of 140.00 [1].

According to the provided text quotes, in 2020, the net reported Risk-Weighted Assets (RWAs) fell by $8bn, which helped mitigate RWA growth from asset quality deterioration, elevated market volatility, and regulatory changes [5]. This suggests that HSBC managed its risk exposure effectively, which could have contributed to the changes in net operating income.\n\nThe adjusted revenue for Global Markets increased by $1.562bn or 27% in 2020 compared to 2019 [4]. This increase was driven by higher volatility levels and increased client activity, along with wider spreads, which supported an improved FICC performance, particularly in Foreign Exchange and Credit. Rates also performed strongly due to increased trading activity in government bonds [9]. These factors indicate that the global markets experienced a significant boost in revenue due to favorable market conditions and increased trading activities.\n\nLooking at the image quotes, image4 provides a detailed breakdown of the management's view of adjusted revenue across various sectors for the years 2020, 2019, and 2018. The table shows that Global Markets had a total revenue of $7,290 million in 2020, which is an increase of $1,562 million (27%) compared to 2019.

This reduction was primarily due to losses amounting to $22.4 billion and distributions to shareholders totaling $14.9 billion, all in the form of dividends. However, there were also increases in equity, such as foreign exchange translation effects of $1.8 billion due to a weaker U.S. dollar and a $1.0 billion change in the funded status of postretirement benefits reserves.

This suggests that while there were fluctuations in equity, the overall trend shows a decrease. The addition to equity for earnings was $14.3 billion, but this was offset by reductions for distributions to shareholders of $14.7 billion, all in the form of dividends. Foreign exchange translation effects of $1.4 billion for the weaker U.S. currency increased equity, while a $1.4 billion change in the funded status of the postretirement benefits reserves reduced equity.

According to the financial statement of changes in equity, the total equity decreased from RMB52,731 million in 2020 to RMB51,055 million in 2021 [image1]. This decrease was primarily due to changes in several key equity components.\n\nOne of the most notable changes was in **Additional Paid-in Capital**, which increased from RMB35,044 million in 2020 to RMB36,238 million in 2021. This increase indicates additional capital contributions or gains from share issuances. However, **Retained Earnings** saw a significant rise, growing from RMB11,111 million in 2020 to RMB14,194 million in 2021, driven by profits generated during the year. \n\nOn the other hand, **Treasury Shares** increased dramatically from RMB(134) million in 2020 to RMB(3,660) million in 2021. This suggests that the company repurchased a substantial amount of its own shares, which can be an indicator of confidence in the company’s future performance or a strategy to return value to shareholders.\n\nAnother important component was **Other Reserves**, which declined from RMB6,300 million in 2020 to RMB3,726 million in 2021. This reduction could be attributed to the allocation of reserves for specific purposes such as statutory requirements or reinvestment into the business.\n\nThe **Non-Controlling Interests** also increased from RMB486 million in 2020 to RMB738 million in 2021, indicating a growing stake by external investors in the company's subsidiaries.\n\n![The table outlines the changes in equity components, including retained earnings, treasury shares, and non-controlling interests, over the years 2020 and 2021.](image1)\n\nMajor transactions affecting these changes included profit/loss for the year, fair value changes, share-based compensation, acquisition of treasury shares, exercise of share options, and currency translation differences.

This decline in customer relationships likely contributed to fluctuations in revenue, as noted in several text quotes. For instance, revenue increased in 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to an overall market recovery and increases in advertising and direct-to-consumer revenue, partially offset by a decrease in content revenue affected by the impacts of COVID-19 and reduced broadcast rights for Serie A in the current year period [10]. Additionally, the average monthly direct-to-consumer revenue per customer relationship increased from $54.56 in 2020 to $59.29 in 2021, reflecting changes in service offerings and pricing strategies [image2].\n\nDespite these improvements in certain areas, the financial performance was also impacted by challenges such as declining revenue in specific regions. For example, revenue decreased in 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to lower sports programming licensing revenue driven by changes in licensing agreements in Italy and Germany, partially offset by higher revenue from the distribution of Sky’s sports programming on third-party platforms due to the impacts of COVID-19 in the prior year period [3]. Furthermore, the company faced increased expenses in 2021, particularly related to Sky’s wireless phone and broadband services, as well as the launch of new products like Sky Glass and XClass TV [5].\n\nOverall, the financial performance of NBCUniversal from 2019 to 2021 was shaped by a combination of revenue growth in some areas, declines in others, and changes in customer relationships that influenced both revenue and operating costs.

Written agreements are established for all Non-executive Directors [image2].\n\nIn addition to succession planning, the Nomination and Governance Committee also oversees continuous improvement activities (training and development program) for Non-executive Directors. These programs cover matters of a business nature, including environmental, social and governance matters and provide updates on BHP’s assets, commodities, geographies and markets [7]. The training and development program is designed and periodically reviewed to maximise effectiveness, and the results of Director performance evaluations are incorporated into these programs [7].\n\n![The table outlines an eight-step process for BHP's Board succession planning and appointment of new Board members.](image2)"}

Goodwill, as described, arises from acquisitions or termination of franchise contracts and is tied to the ability of the acquired companies to generate future cash flows [9]. The recovery of goodwill is also emphasized as being adequately guaranteed by the profitability of these companies, with their future cash flows supporting the carrying amount of goodwill at year-end [3].\n\nWhile the text does not directly provide a detailed breakdown of goodwill components for 2021 and 2020, we can infer that changes in goodwill would likely reflect shifts in the value of acquired companies, market conditions, and the impact of the pandemic on business operations. For instance, the comparison between 2021 and the previous year was heavily affected by the pandemic, which had a material impact on markets, leading to store closures and restricted mobility [4]. These factors could have influenced the valuation of goodwill.\n\nLooking at the financial data presented in the tables, we see that the closing balance of goodwill-related items remained relatively stable, with a closing balance of 202 in 2021 and 201 in 2020 [image1]. This suggests that there were no significant changes in the overall goodwill balance during this period. However, the table also shows that foreign exchange translation differences had a minor impact, with a change of +1 in 2021 and -6 in 2020 [image1].\n\n![The table displays financial information for the years 2021 and 2020, including opening balance, acquisitions, foreign exchange translation differences, and closing balance.](image1)\n\nIn summary, while the exact components of goodwill are not explicitly detailed, the available data suggests that the key differences between 2021 and 2020 in terms of goodwill components were minimal, with only slight fluctuations due to foreign exchange effects and the broader economic impact of the pandemic."}

In the Upstream segment, the company reported earnings of $7.3 billion in 2021, a substantial increase from the loss of $1.6 billion in 2020 [3]. This improvement was driven by higher realizations, the absence of 2020 impairments, and increased sales volumes and asset sales gains. The Upstream segment's total assets also saw a decline from $191.3 billion in 2020 to $184.4 billion in 2021 [2].\n\nIn contrast, the Downstream segment reported earnings of $2.4 billion in 2021, up from a loss of $571 million in 2020 [5]. This growth was primarily due to higher margins on refined product sales, increased earnings from its 50% owned CPChem, and higher sales volumes.

Similarly, for the COO and Executive Director, N Ganapathy Subramaniam, the remuneration comprises a gross salary of ₹129.18 under Section 17(1), a value of perquisites of ₹16.00 under Section 17(2), a commission of ₹700.00, and other allowances of ₹166.51, leading to a total remuneration of ₹1,011.69. The combined total for both is ₹2,349.63 [10].\n\nIn contrast, the remuneration of the Independent Directors is structured differently. For instance, Aman Mehta receives sitting fees of ₹1.80 and a commission of ₹60.00, totaling ₹61.80. Dr. Ron Sommer also receives sitting fees of ₹1.80 and a commission of ₹60.00, totaling ₹61.80. O P Bhatt receives sitting fees of ₹6.90 and a commission of ₹200.00, totaling ₹206.90. Other Independent Directors such as Dr. Pradeep Kumar Khosla, Hanne Sorensen, Keki Mistry, and Don Callahan receive sitting fees ranging from ₹5.10 to ₹5.10 and commissions ranging from ₹140.00 to ₹140.00, resulting in totals between ₹144.80 and ₹145.10. The total sitting fees for all Independent Directors amount to ₹30.60, and the total commission is ₹880.00, leading to an overall total of ₹910.60 [4].\n\nComparing these figures, it is evident that the remuneration of the CEO and Managing Director is significantly higher than that of the Independent Directors. While the CEO and Managing Director's total remuneration is around ₹1,337.94, the highest total remuneration for an Independent Director is ₹206.90. This disparity highlights the different roles and responsibilities of these positions within the company.

However, the specific data for the \"Salesforce Platform and Other\" category is not directly provided in the text quotes. Instead, we can infer some information based on the available data.\n\nFrom the text quote [3], it is mentioned that the professional services and other gross margin was positive $18 million during fiscal 2020 and positive $22 million during fiscal 2019. This indicates that the professional services and other segment had a positive contribution to the company's gross margin in both years, though it decreased slightly in 2020. The quote also states that the cost of professional services is expected to be approximately in line with revenues from professional services in future fiscal quarters, suggesting a stable relationship between costs and revenues in this area.\n\nRegarding the \"Salesforce Platform and Other\" category, the image quote [image3] provides a table with financial data for different cloud services, including \"Sales Cloud,\" \"Service Cloud,\" \"Salesforce Platform and Other,\" and \"Marketing and Commerce Cloud.\" While the exact figures for \"Salesforce Platform and Other\" are not explicitly stated in the description of image3, the table likely includes revenue figures for this category for both 2019 and 2020. The percentage change in revenue from 2019 to 2020 would indicate how this category performed over the period.\n\nIn terms of cost of revenues, the text quote [2] mentions that the increase in cost of revenues for fiscal 2020 was primarily due to an increase in employee-related costs, stock-based expenses, service delivery costs, and amortization of purchased intangible assets. The quote also notes that service delivery costs associated with perpetual and term software licenses are lower than those for cloud service offerings, which may have contributed to a benefit in the subscription and support gross margin. This suggests that the cost structure for cloud services, including the Salesforce Platform and Other, may have been influenced by these factors.\n\nThe image quote [image5] presents financial data for \"Subscription and Support\" and \"Professional Services and Other\" categories, showing increases in costs from 2019 to 2020. While this does not directly address the \"Salesforce Platform and Other\" category, it provides context for how costs in related areas have changed.\n\nBased on the available information, it is reasonable to infer that the \"Salesforce Platform and Other\" category likely experienced growth in revenue from 2019 to 2020, given the overall trend of increasing revenues across different regions and cloud services. However, without specific data from the image quote [image3], it is difficult to provide precise figures for the changes in revenue and cost of revenues for this category.\n\nThe impact on overall financial performance would depend on the magnitude of the changes in revenue and costs for the \"Salesforce Platform and Other\" category. If the revenue growth outpaced the increase in costs, this could positively contribute to the company's profitability. Conversely, if the costs increased more rapidly than the revenue, it could put downward pressure on margins. Additionally, the shift in business mix towards enterprise and international markets, as mentioned in text quote [1], may have influenced the performance of this category.\n\n![The table presents financial data for different cloud services for the fiscal years ending January 31, 2020, and 2019.](image3)"}

This increase in Credit Risk RWA would require the institution to maintain higher levels of capital to meet regulatory requirements, thereby affecting its capital structure.\n\nIn addition, External TLAC as a percentage of RWA increased from 49.9% in 2019 to 47.7% in 2020 [5]. This decrease in the percentage of External TLAC relative to RWA could indicate that the institution's capital structure was becoming less reliant on TLAC instruments, which are designed to absorb losses in the event of a firm's failure. However, it is important to note that the absolute amount of External TLAC increased from $196,888 million in 2019 to $216,129 million in 2020 [5], suggesting that the institution still maintained a strong level of loss-absorbing capacity.\n\n![The table shows data related to capital requirements, specifically External Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity (TLAC) and Eligible Long-Term Debt (LTD).](image5)\n\nOverall, the changes in Credit Risk RWA and External TLAC as a percentage of RWA from 2019 to 2020 indicate that the institution's capital structure was evolving to accommodate increased credit risk exposure while maintaining a strong level of loss-absorbing capacity."}

The profit before taxation and exceptional items was higher at Rs. 79.60 crore compared to Rs. 71.84 crore in the previous year. However, after accounting for taxation and an exceptional expense related to Assam dues becoming doubtful of recovery, the net profit decreased to Rs. 37.91 crore from Rs. 47.80 crore [7]. This indicates that while the company experienced growth in pre-tax profits, it faced challenges in maintaining net profitability due to specific financial obligations.\n\nIn contrast, the potential for tobacco export earnings is substantial. According to the data, India's current export earnings from tobacco are Rs. 930 crore, but there is significant room for growth. The potential export earnings could reach Rs. 7000 crore if India captures just a 5% share of the global tobacco trade, which currently stands at USD 30 billion annually [3]. This suggests that the company could benefit greatly from expanding its export activities, as the market potential is much higher than the current earnings.\n\nThe company's efforts in exporting tobacco products have already shown some success. During the year under report, the FOB value of exports, including tobacco, cigarettes, and tea, was significantly higher at Rs. 52.47 crore compared to Rs. 10.99 crore in the previous year. Cigarette exports increased from Rs. 2.4 crore to Rs. 19.2 crore during the year [9]. These figures indicate that the company is making progress in the export sector, which aligns with the potential for growth highlighted in the image quote.\n\n![The potential for tobacco export earnings in India is sevenfold higher than current levels if the country captures a 5% share of the global tobacco trade.](image3)\n\nGiven these financial results and the potential for export earnings, the company's strategy should focus on leveraging its existing export initiatives and exploring new markets. Expanding the export of tobacco products could provide a significant boost to the company's revenue and profitability. Additionally, the company should consider strategies to mitigate financial risks, such as the exceptional expenses related to Assam dues, to ensure sustained growth.\n\nIn conclusion, the financial results for 2002-2003 show a need for careful management of financial obligations, while the potential for tobacco export earnings highlights opportunities for growth."}

According to the data, after-tax earnings from insurance investment income in 2021 decreased by 4.6% compared to 2020, and this decline was also observed in 2020 compared to 2019. The decrease in 2021 and 2020 was negatively impacted by declines in interest rates on substantial holdings of cash and U.S. Treasury Bills [10]. Additionally, interest and other investment income declined significantly, with a 44.4% drop in 2021 compared to 2020, and a 49.0% decline in 2020 compared to 2019. These declines were primarily due to lower income from short-term investments and fixed maturity securities [6].\n\nLooking at the asset composition, the table shows that cash, cash equivalents, and U.S. Treasury Bills increased from $67,082 thousand in 2020 to $90,688 thousand in 2021.

The increase in cash, cash equivalents, and U.S. Treasury Bills may indicate a more conservative approach to short-term investments, prioritizing safety over yield, as mentioned in the text. This could be a response to the low interest rate environment, which has led to significantly lower interest income. The increase in equity securities suggests a continued reliance on the stock market for returns, which can be volatile but potentially more profitable. However, the decline in fixed maturity securities and other assets may indicate a strategic shift or reduced confidence in these types of investments.\n\nIn summary, the net investment income for the insurance business decreased from 2020 to 2021, and the asset composition shifted towards more cash and equity securities while reducing fixed maturity securities and other assets. These changes reflect a cautious approach to investing in a low-interest-rate environment and a continued focus on equity markets for potential returns."}

For example, in 2020, the other comprehensive income attributable to Accenture PLC was $278,740, which contributed to the overall comprehensive income of $5,386,579. In contrast, in 2019, the other comprehensive income was a loss of $264,406, which reduced the comprehensive income to $4,514,706. In 2018, the other comprehensive income was a loss of $481,387, resulting in a comprehensive income of $3,578,520.\n\n![The table provides a detailed overview of changes in shareholders' equity for Accenture over the fiscal year running from August 31, 2017, to August 31, 2018.

According to the text, one of the key risks identified is \"Supply chain disruption,\" which can be caused by events such as strikes or natural disasters [2]. The potential impact of such disruptions includes supply issues and cost increases. To mitigate these risks, the report suggests implementing safety and security policies and developing business continuity plans.\n\nThese mitigations are particularly relevant when considering Nestlé's factory distribution across different regions. For instance, the image quote describing image3 shows a table listing countries in the Americas (AMS) along with corresponding numbers and colored dots. These numbers might indicate the frequency or scale of supply chain activities in each country. For example, the United States has a high number (72), suggesting it may have a significant presence or activity level in terms of supply chain operations. This could mean that the U.S. is a critical region for Nestlé's supply chain, and thus, any disruption there could have substantial impacts. Therefore, having robust business continuity plans and safety policies is essential to manage such risks effectively.\n\nAnother image, image4, provides a donut chart depicting the distribution of share capital by geography. It shows that Switzerland and the United States have the largest shares of share capital. This distribution might reflect the strategic importance of these regions in Nestlé's operations. Given the potential for supply chain disruptions, having a strong financial foundation in these regions could support the implementation of mitigation strategies, such as investing in technology and infrastructure to enhance supply chain resilience.\n\nIn summary, the potential impacts of supply chain disruptions include supply issues and cost increases, and the mitigations involve safety and security policies and business continuity plans. These strategies are vital for managing the complexities of Nestlé's factory distribution across different regions, especially in areas with significant operational presence like the United States and Switzerland. \n\n![Supply chain disruption risk and its mitigations](image2)"}

This increase was driven by both net income and other comprehensive income. The net income rose from €1,423 million in 2020 to €1,746 million in 2021 [3]. Additionally, the other comprehensive income for 2021 was €700 million, compared to a negative €598 million in 2020. This indicates a substantial improvement in the company's overall financial performance.\n\n![Comprehensive income for Siemens Healthineers AG](image5)\n\n### Balance Sheet Components\n\nOn the balance sheet, several key components showed notable changes between 2020 and 2021. \n\n- **Assets**: Total assets increased from €25,094 million in 2020 to €42,162 million in 2021. This growth was primarily due to an increase in non-current assets, which rose from €14,827 million in 2020 to €31,338 million in 2021. Current assets also increased, from €10,268 million in 2020 to €10,824 million in 2021 [2].\n\n- **Liabilities**: Total liabilities increased significantly, from €12,607 million in 2020 to €25,823 million in 2021.

According to the text quotes, the total shipment volume decreased by 11.6% to 64.2 billion units in 2020, or by 10.3% excluding the impact of the RBH deconsolidation [10]. This decline was notably due to factors such as lower market share and reduced consumer demand, as seen in countries like Canada, where the deconsolidation of RBH contributed to a 18.6% decrease in sales [2]. Additionally, the shift to smoke-free alternatives and declining industry volumes led PMI to optimize its manufacturing infrastructure, resulting in asset impairment and exit costs in several regions, including Argentina, Colombia, Germany, and Pakistan [3].\n\nIn terms of financial activities, net cash used in investing activities decreased by $0.7 billion in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to the reduction of cash in 2019 resulting from the deconsolidation of RBH and lower capital expenditures [1]. However, this was partially offset by higher cash collateral posted to secure derivatives designated as net investment hedges of Euro assets [1]. Furthermore, net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2020, decreased by $0.3 billion compared with 2019, although this was partially offset by higher net earnings (excluding 2019 non-cash charges) and favorable currency movements [7].\n\nThe image quotes provide additional context. For example, **image3** shows that cigarette shipment volumes in Latin America and Canada decreased by 11.8% from 2019 to 2020, while heated tobacco units increased by 50.8% [3].

Provisions increased slightly from €144 million to €150 million, while other financial liabilities and other liabilities also saw modest increases [4].\n\n![The table shows the equity details of Siemens Healthineers AG as of September 30 for the years 2021 and 2020.](image2)\n\n![The table displays financial data for non-current liabilities as of September 30 for the years 2021 and 2020, measured in millions of euros (€).](image4)\n\nThe key components driving these changes in liabilities and equity include the capital increase in March 2021, the repurchase of treasury shares, the net income for the year, and the increase in loan liabilities. The capital increase contributed to the rise in issued capital and capital reserves, while the repurchase of treasury shares affected the equity structure. The net income for the year contributed to the increase in unappropriated net income, and the increase in loan liabilities led to a decline in the equity ratio [3].\n\nIn conclusion, Siemens Healthineers' liabilities and equity increased significantly from 2020 to 2021, driven by factors such as the capital increase, repurchase of treasury shares, net income, and increased loan liabilities."}

The proceeds from this issuance were used to redeem the $850 million of 4.900% Fixed Rate/Floating Rate Noncumulative Preferred Shares, Series C, and the $750 million of 5.200% Fixed Rate/Floating Rate Noncumulative Preferred Shares, Series B [2]. This transaction would have affected the financing activities section of the cash flow statement, as the issuance of preferred shares would be classified as a cash inflow, while the redemption of existing preferred shares would be a cash outflow.\n\nLooking at the cash flow statement, the net cash used in financing activities for 2021 was ($14,933) million, which includes the effects of such transactions [image1]. This indicates that the company used a significant amount of cash in its financing activities during that year, which could include the redemption of preferred shares.\n\nIn terms of shareholders' equity, the issuance of new preferred shares would increase the preferred shares component of shareholders' equity, while the redemption of existing preferred shares would decrease it.

According to the information provided, the consolidated operating cash flow for 2021 was $7.20 billion, up $871 million compared to 2020 [9]. This increase was primarily due to profit before taxes adjusted for non-cash items, including higher accruals for short-term incentive compensation. In addition, lower payments for short-term incentive compensation favorably impacted cash flow. However, this was partially offset by increased working capital requirements. Within working capital, changes in accounts receivable and inventory unfavorably impacted cash flow but were partially offset by favorable changes in accounts payable and accrued expenses.\n\n![Consolidated operating cash flow increased in 2021 compared to 2020, driven by higher profit and favorable changes in working capital.](image2)\n\nRegarding the total assets, while specific figures for total assets are not directly provided, the financial data presented in the table indicates that the company's assets are categorized into current and non-current assets, including cash and cash equivalents, receivables, inventories, property, plant, and equipment, among others [3].

These factors collectively suggest that the company is in a strong position to sustain its operations and pursue future growth opportunities."}

This decline in total assets is reflected in the balance sheet, where cash and cash equivalents dropped significantly from $32.965 billion in 2020 to $22.028 billion in 2021. This reduction was primarily driven by an increase in Card Member loans and receivables, debt maturities, share repurchases, and a reduction in customer deposits, as noted in the text quote [10]. The changes in assets are closely tied to the entity’s comprehensive income, which includes net income and other comprehensive income (OCI). For instance, the accumulated OCI for 2021 was $(2,945) million, compared to $(2,895) million for 2020, indicating a slight increase in losses from foreign currency translation and pension-related adjustments. These OCI components contribute to the overall comprehensive income, which is reported in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.\n\n![Total assets and liabilities decreased from 2020 to 2021, reflecting changes in cash, loans, and equity.](image3)\n\nOn the liability side, total liabilities decreased slightly from $168.383 billion in 2020 to $166.371 billion in 2021. This change is largely due to a reduction in long-term debt, which fell from $42.952 billion in 2020 to $38.675 billion in 2021. Additionally, customer deposits decreased from $86.875 billion in 2020 to $84.382 billion in 2021, further contributing to the decline in liabilities. These changes in liabilities are also connected to the entity's cash flows, particularly in the financing activities section of the cash flow statement. The cash flow statement shows that net cash used in financing activities was $14.933 billion in 2021, compared to $9.068 billion in 2020, indicating increased outflows related to share repurchases and debt repayments. The cash flow from operating activities was $14.645 billion in 2021, which helped offset some of these outflows. \n\n![Cash flows from operating activities were $14.645 billion in 2021, showing the company's ability to generate cash from its core operations.](image2)\n\nIn summary, the significant changes in total assets and total liabilities from 2020 to 2021 reflect shifts in the entity's financial position, including reduced cash balances, increased loan portfolios, and lower long-term debt. These changes are closely linked to the entity's comprehensive income and cash flows, with the latter providing insight into how the company managed its financial resources during the period."}

The net cash provided by operating activities for the consolidated operations in 2021 was $7.20 billion, an increase of $871 million compared to 2020 [5].

By the end of 2020, this figure had increased to $1,829 million. This increase was driven by gross increases in current year tax positions, which amounted to $416 million in 2020, and prior year tax positions, which added $120 million.

Additionally, **Price Realization** played a role, contributing **$507 million** in the fourth quarter of 2021, compared to **$486 million** in the fourth quarter of 2020. The **Currency Impact** had a minor negative effect, reducing sales by **$29 million** in the fourth quarter of 2021.\n\n![Sales volume and revenue changes between Q4 2020 and Q4 2021](image1)\n\n### Operating Profit Changes\n\nOperating profit for the fourth quarter of 2021 was **$1.611 billion**, an increase of **$231 million, or 17 percent**, compared with **$1.380 billion** in the fourth quarter of 2020 [7]. This increase was mainly due to **higher sales volume**, **favorable price realization**, and **net restructuring income** from a gain on the sale of a facility. However, **higher manufacturing costs**, **SG&A expenses**, and **R&D expenses** partially offset these gains.\n\nThe **image4** further illustrates this trend, showing that **Sales Volume** contributed **$687 million** to the increase in operating profit, while **Price Realization** added **$507 million**. On the other hand, **Manufacturing Costs** decreased by **$816 million**, and **SG&A / R&D** decreased by **$272 million**, which also helped improve the operating profit. Additionally, **Financial Products** contributed **$63 million** to the operating profit, and **Other** factors, such as consolidating adjustments, added **$110 million**.\n\n![Operating profit changes between Q4 2020 and Q4 2021](image4)\n\n### Contributing Factors\n\nThe **increase in sales volume** was primarily due to **higher end-user demand for equipment and services**, as well as **changes in dealer inventories**. Specifically, dealers decreased their inventories more during the fourth quarter of 2020 than during the fourth quarter of 2021, which affected the sales figures [9]. In addition, **favorable price realization** contributed to the increase in sales and revenues.\n\nFor **operating profit**, the main contributors were **higher sales volume**, **favorable price realization**, and **net restructuring income**. However, **increased manufacturing costs**, **SG&A expenses**, and **R&D expenses** partially offset these gains. The **Financial Products Segment** also saw an increase in profit, driven by a **favorable impact from returned or repossessed equipment** and **lower provision for credit losses** [3].\n\nIn summary, the **sales volume increased by 23 percent** and **operating profit increased by 17 percent** in the fourth quarter of 2021 compared to the fourth quarter of 2020, driven by higher end-user demand, favorable price realization, and changes in dealer inventories."}

According to the text quote [3], investments in affiliates are accounted for using the equity method when the company has significant influence but not control. While this does not directly relate to dividends or treasury stock, it provides context on how equity investments are managed. \n\nIn terms of cash dividends, the text quote [9] mentions that the company’s financial statements are prepared using estimates and assumptions that affect the assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses reported. This includes the reporting of dividends and their impact on equity. The text quote [10] further explains that differences between the company’s carrying value of an equity investment and its underlying equity in the net assets of the affiliate are assigned to specific assets and liabilities. However, this is more about equity investments rather than dividends or treasury stock.\n\nThe table in image3 provides detailed information about changes in equity components, including retained earnings and treasury stock. For 2021, the table shows that cash dividends were paid out to shareholders, which would reduce retained earnings. Additionally, the table indicates that the company engaged in treasury stock transactions, which involve repurchasing shares and can affect the total equity. These transactions are reflected in the \"Treasury Stock (at cost)\" section of the equity changes.\n\n### Cash Flow Impact\n\nThe cash flow impact of cash dividends and treasury stock transactions is evident from the consolidated cash flow data provided in image4. The table shows that for 2021, the net cash used for financing activities was $23,113 million. This figure includes activities such as net borrowings or repayments, issuance of long-term debt, and dividends. The significant amount of cash used for financing activities suggests that a substantial portion of the company's cash flow was allocated to paying dividends and repurchasing treasury stock.\n\nThe table also shows that the net change in cash for 2021 was a $58 million increase, indicating that despite the large cash outflow for financing activities, the company still had a positive cash flow overall. This could be attributed to strong operating cash flows, which were $29,187 million for 2021, as shown in image4.\n\n![Chevron's balance sheet showing assets, liabilities, and equity for 2021 and 2020](image1)\n\n![Chevron's cash flow data for 2021, 2020, and 2019](image4)\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn 2021, cash dividends and treasury stock transactions impacted Chevron's equity structure by reducing retained earnings and affecting the total equity through the repurchase of shares. These transactions also had a significant impact on the company's cash flow, with a large portion of the cash flow being used for financing activities. The overall cash flow remained positive, indicating that the company was able to manage these transactions effectively."}

The management view of adjusted revenue for 2020 includes Wealth Management revenue of $7,818 million, which is part of the broader WPB segment [3]. While the exact contribution of WPB to the group adjusted profit before tax is not explicitly stated, the overall group adjusted profit before tax for 2020 was $12.1 billion, down 45% from 2019 [3].\n\nThe financial performance data reveals that the Group's financial performance deteriorated in 2020 due to the impact of the Covid-19 outbreak on the global economy. Adjusted profit before tax of $12 billion was down 45% due to lower revenue and a higher expected credit loss charge directly linked to the impact of the pandemic [7]. The Asia business was the major contributor, delivering $13 billion of adjusted profit before tax in 2020 [3]. However, outside of Asia, HSBC Bank plc and the US business incurred restructuring costs and charges from the impairment of intangibles, in part as a result of strategic actions to address underperformance [8].\n\n![The pie chart shows a red segment representing a contribution of $4.1 billion, which corresponds to 34% of the total group adjusted profit before tax.](image4)\n\nThe table in image2 provides additional context, showing that the Profit Before Tax for 2020 was $4,140 million, a decrease of $4,743 million (53%) compared to 2019 [2]. This decline is consistent with the overall financial performance of the Group, which was impacted by lower interest rates, reduced customer activity, and a rise in adjusted ECL charges [2].\n\nIn summary, while the exact contribution of WPB to the group adjusted profit before tax in 2020 is not explicitly stated, the financial performance data reveals a significant decline in profitability across the Group, with the Asia business being the main contributor. The pie chart in image4 indicates that a significant portion of the group adjusted profit before tax came from a single segment, highlighting the importance of specific areas within the Group's operations."}

This strategy ensures that the company can quickly establish a presence in new markets while maintaining profitability. Additionally, the company focuses on optimizing its store network by closing underperforming locations and opening new ones in strategic locations, as mentioned in text quote [2].\n\nThe impact of this strategy is also evident in the company's ability to maintain a consistent store count in mature markets while exploring new opportunities in emerging markets.

This change led to an increase in both assets and liabilities. Specifically, the balance of lease liabilities at 1 July 2019 was $143,621 (in thousands of dollars), and during the period, additional lease liabilities of $50,245 were recognized. Re-measurement of lease liabilities due to changes in lease terms added $1,559, while lease payments reduced the liability by $31,886.

The fair value allocation included developed technology and customer relationships, which were valued at $215 million and $61 million, respectively, with useful lives of 4 and 8 years [image1]. Additionally, goodwill was recorded at $152 million, primarily attributed to the assembled workforce and expanded market opportunities [5]. The total fair value of intangible assets was $276 million, and the net assets acquired were $1,386 million [image5].\n\nIn contrast, the Salesforce.org acquisition involved a different structure. The fair value of the consideration transferred for Salesforce.org was not explicitly stated, but it contributed approximately $228 million in total revenues in fiscal 2020 [2].

This figure represents the percentage change for PBNA according to GAAP. However, when considering the core non-GAAP measure, which adjusts for certain items affecting comparability, the growth rate for PBNA was lower at 2%. This indicates that the core non-GAAP measure reflects a more adjusted view of performance, excluding factors that may distort the true operational performance.\n\n![PBNA's financial performance in 2020 as per the GAAP and non-GAAP measures](image1)\n\nThe influencing factors for the difference between the reported GAAP measure and the core non-GAAP measure for PBNA include several elements.

This decrease was mainly due to lower capital expenditures and the reduction of cash resulting from the deconsolidation of RBH, partially offset by higher cash collateral posted to secure derivatives. The data from image2 indicates that the net cash used in investing activities was $1,200 million in 2020, compared to $1,900 million in 2019 [image2].\n\nFinally, for **financing activities**, the net cash used in financing activities increased by $0.4 billion in 2020 compared to 2019. This increase was driven by higher payments to noncontrolling interests and higher dividends paid, partially offset by debt activity. According to image3, the net cash used in financing activities was $8,496 million in 2020, compared to $8,061 million in 2019 [image3].\n\nThe combined effect of these changes in operating, investing, and financing activities is reflected in the overall cash balance at the end of each year. The cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash at the end of 2020 were $7,285 million, compared to $6,865 million at the end of 2019. This represents an increase of $420 million in the cash balance from 2019 to 2020. The increase in cash balance can be attributed to the net cash provided by operating activities, which more than offset the cash used in investing and financing activities.\n\n![The table presents financial data, specifically the cash flow information for a company, over three years ending December 31 for the years 2020, 2019, and 2018.

The evaluation framework for executive remuneration includes key metrics such as consolidated operating income, volatility of Toyota’s share price, and individual performance evaluation, which are all critical in assessing the effectiveness of the company's management and its ability to create value for shareholders [1].\n\nThe table in image1 illustrates these indicators, showing how consolidated operating income serves as an indicator of Toyota's efforts based on business performance, while the volatility of Toyota’s share price reflects corporate value from the perspective of shareholders and investors [image1]. This dual focus ensures that executives are evaluated not only on their individual contributions but also on the broader financial health of the company.\n\nFurthermore, the evaluation framework presented in image3 highlights the importance of consolidated operating income and share price volatility. Consolidated operating income is weighted at 50%, with a reference value of 1 trillion yen, and the current fiscal year's result stands at 150% of this target. This indicates that Toyota is performing well above its target in terms of operational efficiency and profitability. The volatility of Toyota’s share price is also evaluated, with a comparative analysis against the Nikkei stock average, providing insights into how the market perceives Toyota's performance [image3].\n\nIn addition, the remuneration details provided in image4 show the breakdown of fixed and performance-linked remuneration for different categories of executives. For directors, fixed remuneration is set based on job responsibilities and home country standards, while performance-based remuneration is tied to consolidated operating income, share price volatility, and individual performance [image4]. This structure ensures that executives are incentivized to achieve both short-term and long-term business objectives, which in turn enhances shareholder value.\n\nThe data in image5 further supports this approach by showcasing Toyota's consistent dividend payments and total shareholder returns over several fiscal years. The payout ratio and total return ratio indicate that Toyota has been effectively balancing its financial commitments to shareholders with reinvestment in the company's future, reflecting a commitment to sustainable growth and value creation [image5].\n\nIn summary, Toyota's executive remuneration evaluation reflects business performance and shareholder value indicators through a structured approach that links compensation to key financial metrics and individual performance, ensuring alignment with the company's strategic goals and long-term value creation. ![Consolidated operating income is an indicator for evaluating Toyota’s efforts based on business performance.](image1) ![Volatility of Toyota’s share price is a corporate value indicator for shareholders and investors to evaluate Toyota’s efforts.](image1) ![Individual performance evaluation is a qualitative evaluation of each director’s performance.](image1) ![The table shows the evaluation framework for Toyota, divided into two main criteria: consolidated operating income and volatility of Toyota’s share price.](image3) ![The table presents financial data for five fiscal years, including dividend per share, total amount of payment, payout ratio, share repurchases, total shareholder return, and total return ratio.](image5)"}

This decline was primarily due to lower market valuations and a decrease in client flows, although it was partially offset by lower interest rates and reduced credit losses. The net income for GWIM also declined, falling from $4.25 billion in 2019 to $3.07 billion in 2020 [3].\n\nIn contrast, the Consumer Banking segment experienced a significant drop in net income, decreasing by $6.5 billion to $6.5 billion in 2020 compared to 2019 [8]. This decline was attributed to lower revenue, higher provision for credit losses, and increased expenses. Specifically, net interest income fell by $3.5 billion to $24.7 billion, driven by lower interest rates, while noninterest income dropped by $1.9 billion to $8.6 billion, mainly due to a decline in service charges and card income. \n\n![The table provides financial data for the years 2020 and 2019, showing figures in millions of dollars, with percentage changes between the two years.](image3)\n\nThe difference in performance between the two segments highlights the impact of external factors such as the economic environment and market conditions on their respective revenue streams.

This is a significant increase from 2019, where restructuring charges were a credit of $36 million due to the sale of the manufacturing facility in Greenock, Scotland [1]. The difference in the nature of these charges—being a charge in 2020 versus a credit in 2019—highlights a shift in the company's operational strategy and its financial implications.\n\nThe restructuring charges are also reflected in the operating profit. In the fourth quarter of 2020, the operating profit was $1,813 million, which included the restructuring charges [3]. In contrast, in the fourth quarter of 2019, the operating profit was $1,249 million, and there were no restructuring charges reported [3]. This indicates that the restructuring charges in 2020 had a direct negative impact on the operating profit, whereas in 2019, the absence of such charges contributed to a higher operating profit.\n\nAdditionally, the table provides a detailed breakdown of the restructuring charges over the years.

Actuarial assumptions, such as discount rates, compensation increases, and pension progression, directly influence the DBO, which is the present value of future benefits already earned by employees. A change in these assumptions can lead to fluctuations in the DBO, affecting the funded status of the pension plans.\n\nFor example, a 10% reduction in mortality rates would increase the DBO by €110 million as of September 30, 2021, compared to €109 million as of September 30, 2020 [7]. This demonstrates how sensitive the DBO is to changes in demographic assumptions like mortality rates. Similarly, the table in image1 illustrates the effects of a half-percentage-point change in three key actuarial assumptions—discount rate, compensation increase, and pension progression—on the DBO for both 2021 and 2020. The table shows that a decrease in the discount rate increased the DBO, while an increase in the discount rate decreased it. For instance, a decrease in the discount rate led to an increase of €271 million in 2021 and €266 million in 2020 [image1].\n\nIn addition to the DBO, changes in actuarial assumptions also affect the funded status of the pension plans, which is the difference between plan assets and the DBO. The table in image2 provides data on the composition of plan assets as of September 30, 2021, and 2020. It shows that total plan assets increased from €2,813 million in 2020 to €3,259 million in 2021. However, this increase does not necessarily mean that the funded status improved, as the DBO may have also changed due to actuarial assumptions. The table in image3 further highlights the impact of actuarial assumptions on the financial health of the pension plans. It shows that actuarial gains and losses were negative in 2021 (-€22 million) compared to positive in 2020 (+€67 million), indicating that the changes in actuarial assumptions had a more adverse effect in 2021.\n\nMoreover, the table in image4 provides the discount rates for various currencies as of September 30, 2021, and 2020. The discount rate for the euro was 1.0% in 2021 and 0.9% in 2020, while the discount rate for the U.S. dollar was 2.7% in 2021 and 2.4% in 2020. These rates are used to calculate the present value of future benefits, and changes in these rates can significantly impact the DBO. For instance, a lower discount rate increases the DBO because it reduces the present value of future benefits, making them more expensive to fund.\n\nFinally, the table in image5 provides information about other liabilities, including deferred compensation liabilities and employee-related accruals, as of September 30, 2021, and 2020. While these liabilities are not directly related to the DBO, they contribute to the overall financial obligations of the company and can be affected by changes in actuarial assumptions.\n\n![The table shows the effects on a defined benefit obligation due to a change of half a percentage point in three categories: Discount rate, Compensation increase, and Pension progression.](image1)  \n![The table displays financial data in millions of euros as of September 30 for the years 2021 and 2020.

According to the text quotes, credit risk RWA increased in 2020 under both the Standardized and Advanced Approaches, primarily due to an increase in Derivatives exposures driven by market volatility and an increase in Investment securities mainly as a result of the E*TRADE acquisition [5]. Additionally, market risk RWA increased in 2020 under both the Standardized and Advanced Approaches primarily due to an increase in Regulatory VaR mainly as a result of higher market volatility [6]. These increases in RWA would have necessitated a corresponding increase in TLAC to maintain the required ratios.\n\nThe data from image3 shows that the final balance of Credit Risk RWA at December 31, 2020, was $387,066 million (Standardized) and $284,930 million (Advanced), compared to $342,684 million (Standardized) and $228,927 million (Advanced) at the end of 2019. This indicates a substantial increase in Credit Risk RWA. Similarly, Market Risk RWA increased to $66,040 million for both \"Standardized\" and \"Advanced\" approaches at the end of 2020, compared to $51,493 million (Standardized) and $51,597 million (Advanced) at the end of 2019. These increases in RWA would have required a proportional increase in TLAC to meet the regulatory requirements.\n\nThe data from image5 provides further insight into the TLAC as a percentage of RWA. The External TLAC as a percentage of RWA at December 31, 2020, was 47.7%, compared to 49.9% at December 31, 2019. Despite the increase in RWA, the percentage of TLAC relative to RWA decreased slightly. This could be attributed to the fact that the TLAC also increased from $196,888 million in 2019 to $216,129 million in 2020, which is a larger increase than the increase in RWA. Therefore, the slight decrease in the percentage of TLAC relative to RWA is due to the proportionally larger increase in TLAC compared to RWA.\n\n![External TLAC as a percentage of RWA increased from 49.9% in 2019 to 47.7% in 2020](image5)\n\nIn conclusion, the changes in various components of RWA led to an increase in TLAC, but the percentage of TLAC relative to RWA decreased slightly from 49.9% in 2019 to 47.7% in 2020."}

This decline was partly due to the company's efforts to support its franchisees through marketing initiatives, including free Thank You Meals for first responders and health care workers, which may have temporarily reduced short-term profits but aimed to accelerate recovery and drive long-term growth [1]. The U.S. segment's revenue remained relatively stable, with only a 2% decrease in franchised revenues and a 4% decrease in company-operated sales [3]. However, the overall impact of these strategies on the U.S. segment was less severe than in other regions, as the U.S. showed positive performance that partially offset losses elsewhere.\n\nIn contrast, the **International Operated Markets** segment faced a significant decline in growth, with a -13% change in 2020, compared to 3% in 2019 [5]. This decline was primarily driven by the temporary closures of restaurants and limited operations in key markets such as the U.K., France, Germany, Italy, and Spain [3]. Additionally, the segment experienced lower gains on sales of restaurant businesses, higher restaurant closing costs, and payments to distribution centers for obsolete inventory [5]. The comparable sales in this segment decreased by 15.0%, reflecting negative sales in most international markets [4].\n\nThe **revenue composition** also shifted during this period. In 2020, the U.S. segment contributed significantly to total revenues, while the International Operated Markets segment saw a more pronounced decline [3]. The pie charts show that the U.S. segment maintained a consistent share of total revenues, while the International Operated Markets segment's share decreased slightly [4].\n\n![The pie chart shows the revenue composition by segment for 2020, with the U.S. segment being the largest contributor.](image4)\n\nThese changes were influenced by the global pandemic, which led to widespread restaurant closures and reduced consumer spending. Additionally, strategic investments in marketing and support for franchisees, particularly in the U.S., played a role in shaping the revenue trends [1]. The International Operated Markets segment was more severely impacted due to the broader reach of the pandemic and the challenges of operating in multiple countries with varying levels of restrictions.\n\nIn summary, the U.S. segment experienced a smaller decline in growth compared to the International Operated Markets segment, which saw a more significant drop due to the pandemic's impact and operational challenges."}

This decline was primarily due to a reduction in operating earnings caused by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. In contrast, the number of systemwide restaurants increased from 38,695 in 2019 to 39,198 in 2020, as shown in image2.

The total global sales for Prolia® also showed growth, increasing from $2,291 million in 2018 to $2,672 million in 2019 and $2,763 million in 2020, with a 17% increase in 2019 and a 3% increase in 2020 [2]. These trends suggest that Prolia® maintained strong demand and pricing stability during this period.\n\nIn contrast, **Neulasta®** experienced significant declines in sales across both the U.S. and ROW. In the U.S., Neulasta® sales dropped from $3,866 million in 2018 to $2,814 million in 2019 and further to $2,001 million in 2020, representing a 27% decrease in 2019 and a 29% decrease in 2020 [5].

These declines were largely attributed to the impact of biosimilar competition on net selling prices and unit demand [5].\n\nFor **Otezla®**, the sales trends show a sharp increase after its acquisition in November 2019. In the U.S., Otezla® sales rose from $139 million in 2019 to $1,790 million in 2020, indicating a substantial growth in the region [10]. In the ROW, Otezla® sales increased from $39 million in 2019 to $405 million in 2020, showing a significant expansion [10]. The total global sales for Otezla® jumped from $178 million in 2019 to $2,195 million in 2020, highlighting the product's strong performance post-acquisition [10]. This growth was likely driven by the product's position in the inflammation market and its integration into the company’s portfolio [8].\n\n![Prolia® sales trends from 2018 to 2020 show consistent growth in both the U.S. and ROW, with total global sales increasing over the same period.](image2)\n\n![Neulasta® sales trends from 2018 to 2020 show significant declines in both the U.S. and ROW, with total global sales dropping sharply over the same period.](image5)\n\n![Otezla® sales trends from 2018 to 2020 show a dramatic increase after its acquisition in 2019, with strong growth in both the U.S. and ROW, leading to a substantial rise in total global sales.](image4)\n\nOverall, Prolia® demonstrated steady growth, Neulasta® faced significant declines due to competition, and Otezla® showed strong post-acquisition performance."}

The company has consistently aimed to expand its footprint in key markets while maintaining profitability and adapting to changing market conditions. According to the information provided, Lovisa has established a portfolio of company-owned stores in several countries, including Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, Malaysia, South Africa, the United Kingdom, France, and the United States of America, as well as franchised stores in regions like the Middle East and Vietnam [4]. This demonstrates a clear commitment to international expansion.\n\nThe evolution of Lovisa's strategy is further highlighted by the company's ability to refine its global store model, which includes securing quality retail store sites in locations with high pedestrian traffic. This approach typically involves leasing in AA, A, or B grade shopping centers and malls, ensuring that new stores are positioned for success [9]. Additionally, Lovisa has focused on optimizing its store network by closing underperforming locations and opening new ones in strategic areas, which aligns with its goal of enhancing customer loyalty through services like in-store piercing [1].\n\nOne of the key achievements during this period was the successful completion of the global roll-out of piercing services into stores, which was completed during FY20. This initiative was aimed at enhancing customer loyalty and differentiating Lovisa from competitors [1]. Furthermore, the company has continued to explore new markets through pilot programs, demonstrating its flexibility and willingness to adapt to new opportunities [4].\n\nHowever, the expansion strategy has not been without challenges. The fast fashion jewelry sector in which Lovisa operates is highly competitive, with relatively low barriers to entry [7]. This means that the company must continuously innovate and maintain its competitive edge to sustain its market position. Additionally, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic posed significant challenges, as it affected the global retail leasing market and required Lovisa to closely monitor and adapt to changing conditions [3].\n\nDespite these challenges, Lovisa has shown resilience and a strong focus on growth. The company has achieved rapid revenue growth, increasing from $25.5 million in FY2011 to $242.2 million in FY2020, even though FY20 was impacted by the pandemic [5]. This growth has been driven by the company's ability to increase earnings contributions from existing stores and continue opening new stores on a timely and profitable basis [10].\n\nIn terms of financial performance, the consolidated financial summary provides insight into Lovisa's operations. For instance, net working capital increased significantly from $(7,394) in 2019 to $3,072 in 2020, indicating improved liquidity and working capital management [image1]. Additionally, the company's property, plant, and equipment increased by 20% from 2019 to 2020, suggesting investment in physical assets to support its expansion [image1].\n\nThe bar chart showing gross margin percentages over five fiscal years (FY16 to FY20) also highlights the company's financial health. While there was a slight decline in FY20 to 77%, the gross margin remained relatively stable, indicating effective cost management [image3].\n\nIn summary, Lovisa's international store expansion strategy from 2016 to 2020 has been characterized by a focus on strategic growth, operational efficiency, and adaptability. Key achievements include the successful global roll-out of services, the establishment of a strong international presence, and consistent revenue growth. Challenges such as competition and the impact of the pandemic have been managed through careful planning and execution. ![The image shows the interior of a store, likely a jewelry or accessories shop, given the display of items.](image2)"}

According to the data, net interest income (NII) for 2020 was $27.6 billion, representing a decrease of $2.9 billion or 9.5% compared with 2019 [8]. This decline was primarily due to lower average market interest rates across major currencies, which were partially offset by an increase in average interest-earning assets (AIEA) of $170.1 billion or 8.8% [8]. \n\nInterest expense for 2020 also saw a reduction, with the fourth quarter of 2020 showing a decrease of $2.9 billion year-on-year, driven by the impact of lower market interest rates, although this was partly offset by growth in interest-bearing customer accounts, which increased by $142.9 billion [6]. The reduction in interest expense contributed to a more favorable net interest margin (NIM), which fell by 26 basis points (bps) to 1.32% in 2020, compared to 2019 [1].\n\nThese changes in net interest income and interest expense are reflected in the broader financial performance of the organization. For instance, the net interest spread, which is the difference between the gross interest yield and the gross interest payable, was 1.19% for the year ended 31 December 2020, down slightly from the previous year [2]. The net interest margin, which measures the difference between the interest income and interest expense relative to the average interest-earning assets, was 1.32% in 2020, a decrease of 26 bps from 2019 [1].\n\nThe impact of these changes on net operating income can be seen in the broader context of the organization's financial statements. While specific figures for net operating income are not provided in the text quotes, the overall trend suggests that the reduction in net interest income and the corresponding decrease in interest expense contributed to a decline in net operating income. This is further supported by the data in image2, which shows that the net interest income for the year ended 31 December 2020 was $27.578 billion, down from the previous year [2].\n\n![Net interest income for the year ended 31 December 2020 was $27.578 billion, down from the previous year.](image2)\n\nIn addition, the changes in net interest income and interest expense had a direct impact on the overall profitability of the organization. The net income from assets and liabilities of insurance businesses, including related derivatives, measured at fair value through profit or loss, decreased from $3.6 billion in 2019 to $2.1 billion in 2020 [4].

In contrast, Zone AOA had an organic growth of 0.5%, with flat RIG and positive pricing of 0.5% [3].\n\nLooking at the trading operating profit margins, Zone EMENA saw an increase of 50 basis points to 18.6% [1], while Zone AOA experienced a decrease of 30 basis points to 22.2% [3]. Other businesses, such as Nespresso and Nestlé Health Science, showed significant improvements in their trading operating profit margins, with Nespresso's margin increasing by 90 basis points to 19.6% [4].\n\nThe financial data presented in the tables further supports these observations. For example, the table for Zone EMENA shows a sales figure of CHF 20.2 billion with an organic growth rate of 2.9% and an underlying trading operating profit margin of 18.6% [image3]. In contrast, the table for Zone AOA indicates a sales figure of CHF 20.7 billion with an organic growth rate of 0.5% and an underlying trading operating profit margin of 22.2% [image2].\n\n![Zone EMENA had an organic growth of 2.9% and an underlying trading operating profit margin of 18.6%](image3)\n\n![Zone AOA had an organic growth of 0.5% and an underlying trading operating profit margin of 22.2%](image2)\n\nIn conclusion, the organic growth rates and trading operating profit margins varied across the different geographic zones for Nestlé in 2020, with some zones performing better than others."}

This increase reflects the company's growing reliance on leased assets, which is also supported by the rise in operating lease liabilities, from $797 million in 2019 to $974 million in 2020 [4]. The weighted average remaining lease term remained consistent at 7 years for both years, while the weighted average discount rate decreased slightly from 3.1% in 2019 to 2.8% in 2020 [4].

According to the information provided, the net deferred tax asset was $119 million as of December 31, 2019, and it increased to $253 million as of December 31, 2020. This increase can be attributed to several factors, including changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities.\n\nFirst, let's look at the deferred tax assets. In 2019, the total deferred tax assets before valuation allowance were $662 million, while in 2020, they were $645 million. However, the valuation allowance decreased from $(180) million in 2019 to $(179) million in 2020. This slight reduction in the valuation allowance contributed to an increase in the total deferred tax assets after valuation allowance, which went from $482 million in 2019 to $466 million in 2020. Despite the decrease in deferred tax assets, the net deferred tax asset still increased due to changes in deferred tax liabilities.\n\nNext, we examine the deferred tax liabilities. In 2019, the total deferred tax liabilities were $(363) million, while in 2020, they were $(213) million. This decrease in deferred tax liabilities further contributed to the increase in the net deferred tax asset. The combination of a slight decrease in deferred tax assets and a more substantial decrease in deferred tax liabilities resulted in the net deferred tax asset increasing from $119 million in 2019 to $253 million in 2020.\n\n![The net deferred tax asset increased from $119 million in 2019 to $253 million in 2020.](image2)\n\nAdditionally, the table shows that the balance of uncertain tax positions decreased from $303 million in 2019 to $89 million in 2020. This reduction in uncertain tax positions, along with the settlement of a depreciation-related uncertain tax position, contributed to the overall change in the net deferred tax asset. The reduction in uncertain tax positions led to a tax benefit of $249 million in 2020, which further impacted the net deferred tax asset.\n\n![The balance of uncertain tax positions decreased from $303 million in 2019 to $89 million in 2020.](image4)\n\nIn conclusion, the changes in tax positions and related components led to an increase in the net deferred tax asset from $119 million in 2019 to $253 million in 2020."}

In **Asia**, for example, NGL prices rose significantly, possibly due to increased demand or changes in production levels. In contrast, in **Africa** and **Australia/Oceania**, the prices remained relatively unchanged, indicating a more stable market environment.\n\nThe data also highlights that **production costs** played a role in shaping these price trends. For example, in **Europe**, the average production costs for crude oil increased between 2018 and 2020, which could have contributed to higher prices in that region. Meanwhile, in **Asia**, the costs remained relatively low, allowing for more competitive pricing.\n\n![The table presents data on average production prices and costs for oil and gas in different regions for the years 2020 and 2019.](image5)\n\nIn summary, the average production prices for crude oil and NGL changed from 2018 to 2020, with variations observed across different regions due to a combination of market forces, production costs, and regional economic conditions."}

According to the data, noncurrent assets increased by $3,039 million (or $829 million adjusted for currency) in 2020, driven by various factors such as the level of client and commercial financing receivables and intercompany investments [4]. This increase in noncurrent assets suggests that IBM was investing more in long-term assets, which can be beneficial for future revenue generation but may also tie up capital. At the same time, long-term debt remained relatively stable, with a slight increase from $54,102 million in 2019 to $54,355 million in 2020 [image2]. This stability in long-term debt indicates that IBM maintained a consistent approach to its financing strategy, balancing its debt levels with its asset base.\n\nIn addition to these changes, cash flow data provides further insight into IBM's financial health. The total equity decreased by $258 million from December 31, 2019, primarily due to dividends paid and a decline in accumulated other comprehensive income, although this was partially offset by net income and common stock increases [7]. Meanwhile, financing activities were a net use of cash of $9,721 million in 2020 compared to a net source of cash of $9,042 million in 2019, indicating a shift in how IBM managed its cash flows [10]. These cash flow dynamics, combined with the changes in noncurrent assets and long-term debt, suggest that IBM was navigating a complex financial landscape, balancing growth opportunities with the need to manage its liabilities and maintain liquidity.\n\n![Noncurrent assets and long-term debt for 2020 and 2019](image2)."}

However, total credit card purchase volumes declined by $26.3 billion to $251.6 billion in 2020, primarily due to the impact of COVID-19. Despite this decline, debit card purchase volumes increased by $23.8 billion to $384.5 billion, indicating that consumers shifted towards debit cards during the pandemic. This shift might suggest a more cautious approach to spending, with consumers relying more on existing funds rather than credit.\n\n![The table provides financial data for the years 2020 and 2019 in millions of dollars, showing changes in credit card metrics.](image2)\n\nFor home equity, production in Consumer Banking and for the total Corporation decreased by $2.8 billion and $3.0 billion in 2020, respectively, primarily due to a decline in applications.

The report highlights that fluctuations in the prices of these commodities directly affect BHP's revenue, underlying EBITDA, and overall financial performance.\n\nFor **coal**, the report indicates that lower prices and volumes have had a negative effect on BHP's financial results. Specifically, the **Underlying EBITDA for Coal decreased by US\\$1.3 billion to US\\$288 million**, which was influenced by lower price impacts, net of price-linked costs, of US\\$0.7 billion. Additionally, lower volumes contributed to a further decrease in Underlying EBITDA by US\\$168 million. Controllable cash costs also increased by US\\$102 million due to higher maintenance costs at Queensland Coal and increased stripping volumes, although some cost reduction initiatives helped offset this increase [2].\n\nThe **impact of changes in commodity prices** on BHP's financial results is further illustrated in a table that shows how a small increase in the price of various commodities affects profit after taxation and underlying EBITDA. For **metallurgical coal**, a US$1 per ton increase in price would result in a $24 million increase in profit after taxation and a $35 million increase in underlying EBITDA. Similarly, a US$1 per ton increase in energy coal would lead to a $9 million increase in profit after taxation and a $13 million increase in underlying EBITDA [8]. These figures demonstrate the sensitivity of BHP's financial performance to changes in coal prices.\n\nFor **nickel**, the report notes that the nickel price benefitted from positive investor sentiment amid a strong, geographically diverse rebound in end-use demand. However, the price experienced a brief correction in March due to an announcement by a major nickel producer about converting some nickel pig iron to nickel matte in Indonesia, making it suitable for the battery supply chain. Despite this, prices subsequently rebounded due to strong demand, multi-region supply disruptions, and falling London Metal Exchange stocks [10]. The impact of changes in nickel prices on BHP's financial results is reflected in the table, where a US¢1 per pound increase in the nickel price would lead to a $1 million increase in both profit after taxation and underlying EBITDA [8].\n\nThe key drivers behind these impacts include **market demand, supply disruptions, and exchange rate movements**. For example, the **underlying EBITDA for Nickel West increased by US\\$296 million to US\\$259 million in FY2021** due to higher prices and volumes, as well as lower maintenance and contractor costs following the transition and ramp-up of new mines. However, this was partially offset by unfavourable exchange rate movements and the adverse impacts of the stronger nickel price on third-party concentrate purchase costs [1].\n\nIn summary, changes in commodity prices significantly impact BHP's financial results, with **coal and nickel being particularly sensitive to market conditions**. The key drivers of these impacts include **market demand, supply disruptions, and exchange rate movements**, which collectively influence BHP's revenue, underlying EBITDA, and overall profitability.\n\n![The table shows the financial impact of changes in commodity prices on profit after taxation from continuing operations and on underlying EBITDA, expressed in US$ million.](image1)"}

According to the financial data provided, net cash from operating activities was $14.8 billion in 2019 and rose to $18.2 billion in 2020 [image2]. This increase of $3.4 billion was primarily driven by the reduction of financing receivables due to sales of receivables [1]. The improvement in cash flow is also supported by the company's ability to generate strong cash flow from operations, which has ranged between $14.8 billion and $18.2 billion per year over the past three years [8].\n\nIn addition to the increase in net cash from operating activities, IBM's cash reserves also grew significantly during this period. Cash, restricted cash, and marketable securities at December 31, 2020, were $14.3 billion, an increase of $5.3 billion compared to December 31, 2019 [7].

However, these decreases were partially offset by lower costs and balances of interest-bearing deposits and long-term debt. Specifically, net interest income in 2021 included interest income from PPP loans of $518 million and interest income associated with loans purchased from GNMA loan securitization pools of $1.1 billion [3].\n\nOn the other hand, noninterest income increased significantly in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase was driven by higher net gains from equity securities, mortgage banking income, and investment advisory and other asset-based fee income, partially offset by lower net interest income. The table in image1 provides a detailed breakdown of the changes in noninterest income, showing that it increased by $5,120 million (104%) from 2020 to 2021 [10].\n\nThe changes in net interest income and noninterest income directly influenced the total revenue. Total revenue increased by $3,138 million (59%) in 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to the higher noninterest income mentioned above.

{"q_id": 754, "model": "qwen3-30b-a3b", "in_tok": 4168, "out_tok": 867, "total_tok": 5035, "response": "The question asks how the revenue from QCT and QTL segments compares to the revenue from China and South Korea across 2019 to 2021. To address this, we need to examine both segment-specific revenue data and regional revenue data.\n\nFrom the text quotes, we know that QCT (Qualcomm CDMA Technologies) and QTL (Qualcomm Technology Licensing) are two of Qualcomm's key business segments. According to quote [7], QCT revenues increased by 64% in fiscal 2021 compared to the prior year, while QTL revenues increased by 26%. These increases were largely driven by demand for 5G products and an overall recovery from the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. In terms of specific figures, QCT recorded revenues of $27.0 billion in fiscal 2021, as noted in quote [6]. QTL's revenues for the same period were $6.32 billion, according to quote [5].\n\nOn the other hand, the regional revenue data provides insights into how much revenue was generated in specific countries. From quote [2], we understand that the revenue by country is based on where products or services are delivered, not necessarily where the final devices are sold or where the companies are headquartered. This is important because it means that a company headquartered in South Korea might have its revenue attributed to China if the products are manufactured there.\n\nLooking at the table in image4, which shows financial data across different regions for the years 2019, 2020, and 2021, we can see the total revenue for each year and the contribution from each region. For 2021, the total revenue was $33,566 million, with China (including Hong Kong) being a significant contributor. South Korea also contributed to the total, though the exact figures for each region are not specified in the description of image4. However, the total revenue for 2021 is significantly higher than the previous years, indicating growth.\n\nIn comparison, the total revenue for QCT and QTL combined in 2021 was $27.0 billion for QCT and $6.32 billion for QTL, totaling $33.32 billion. This figure is very close to the total revenue reported for 2021 in image4, which was $33,566 million. This suggests that the revenue from QCT and QTL segments is closely aligned with the total revenue reported for the year, which includes contributions from various regions, including China and South Korea.\n\nIt is also worth noting that the revenue from QCT and QTL segments showed substantial growth from 2019 to 2021. For QCT, the revenue increased from $14.639 billion in 2019 to $27.0 billion in 2021, while QTL's revenue grew from $4.591 billion in 2019 to $6.32 billion in 2021. This growth is consistent with the overall trend observed in the regional revenue data, where the total revenue increased from $24.273 billion in 2019 to $33,566 million in 2021.\n\n![The table shows financial data across different regions for the years 2019, 2020, and 2021.](image4)\n\nIn summary, the revenue from QCT and QTL segments in 2021 was $27.0 billion and $6.32 billion respectively, contributing to a total of $33.32 billion. This is closely aligned with the total revenue reported for 2021, which was $33,566 million, suggesting that the revenue from these segments is representative of the overall revenue, including contributions from regions like China and South Korea. The growth in revenue from QCT and QTL segments from 2019 to 2021 mirrors the overall growth in total revenue, indicating a strong performance across both segments and regions."}

Similarly, quote [5] states that discount revenue increased by 24 percent, again attributed to the recovery from the pandemic's effects, with worldwide network volumes rising by 24 percent. Quote [10] further supports this trend, noting a 31 percent increase in discount revenue, mainly due to a 29 percent rise in consumer billed business, which also reflects the ongoing recovery.\n\nIn addition to the recovery from the pandemic, other factors contributed to the growth in discount revenue. Quote [7] highlights that the increase was also driven by an increase in the average discount rate, primarily due to a change in the mix of spending, with higher levels of T&E-related volumes compared to the prior year. The average discount rate for 2021 was 2.30 percent, slightly higher than the 2.28 percent in 2020.\n\nFurthermore, quote [2] mentions that discount revenue, as the largest revenue line, increased by 26 percent year-over-year, driven primarily by growth in Card Member spending. This suggests that the overall increase in spending by Card Members played a key role in boosting discount revenue.\n\nOverall, the increase in discount revenue from 2020 to 2021 was largely due to the recovery from the pandemic, increased network volumes, and a shift in spending patterns toward T&E-related transactions, which contributed to a higher average discount rate.\n\n![Discount revenue increased significantly from 2020 to 2021, driven by the recovery from the pandemic and increased network volumes.](image1)"}

For instance, the increase in services and other revenue by $\\S80$ million in 2020, as well as the decrease in cost of services and other revenue by $\\S99$ million, contributed to the overall improvement in net income [4] [9]. Additionally, the company's focus on operational efficiencies and the acceleration of non-cash stock-based compensation expenses due to a rapid increase in market capitalization also played a role in the financial performance [10].\n\n![Net income (loss) for the years 2018, 2019, and 2020](image3)\n\nIn summary, Tesla's net income improved significantly from a loss of $\\S1,063$ million in 2018 to a profit of $\\S862$ million in 2020, indicating a positive trend in the company's financial performance."}

The company issued both Series A and Series B Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock (MCPS) during this period, which contributed to the increase in preferred stock and additional paid-in capital. These issuances were part of the company's strategy to finance acquisitions, such as the Cytiva Acquisition, and to support general corporate purposes. The net proceeds from these offerings were invested in short-term bank deposits and interest-bearing, investment-grade securities, which helped maintain liquidity and support the company's financial position.\n\nFrom the balance sheet data provided, we can observe that total stockholders' equity increased from $30,271 million in 2019 to $39,766 million in 2020. This growth was driven by several factors, including the issuance of preferred stock, increases in additional paid-in capital, and retained earnings. The table also shows that the company's retained earnings grew from $24,166 million in 2019 to $27,159 million in 2020, indicating strong profitability and reinvestment of earnings.\n\nIn terms of cash flow from financing activities, the company generated positive cash flows from stock issuances and public offerings. For example, the 2020 Common Stock Offering and the 2020 MCPS Offering resulted in net proceeds of approximately $1.73 billion and $1.67 billion, respectively. These inflows were used to fund acquisitions and other corporate purposes. However, the company also experienced significant outflows from investing activities due to large acquisitions, such as the Cytiva Acquisition, which required substantial cash payments.

This increase can be attributed to several factors, including changes in operating assets and liabilities, as well as other operational adjustments.\n\nFrom the financial data, we see that the change in operating assets and liabilities had a significant impact on cash flow. Specifically, the change in operating assets and liabilities in 2021 compared to 2020 was primarily related to the timing of amortization and related payments for film and television costs, including increased production spending, offset by an increased number of sporting events in 2021, as well as increases in accounts receivable and decreases in deferred revenue, which included the impacts of the broadcast of the Tokyo Olympics [2].\n\nAdditionally, the increase in cash provided by operating activities was supported by higher revenues and improved operational efficiencies across various segments. For instance, the Media segment experienced a 20.3% increase in revenue to $22.8 billion, while the Theme Parks segment saw a substantial increase in revenue due to the resumption of operations and the opening of the Beijing theme park [10].

This substantial improvement was primarily due to higher margins on refined product sales of $\\S1.6$ billion, higher earnings from 50 percent-owned CPChem of $\\S1.0$ billion, and higher sales volumes of $\\S470$ million. These factors were partially offset by higher operating expenses of $\\S150$ million.\n\nAdditionally, the image quotes provide supporting data.

In 2020, the company reported a net loss of $5,561 million, whereas in 2021, it recorded a net income of $15,689 million. This represents a substantial increase of $21,250 million. The improvement in net income was driven by several factors, including higher upstream realizations, higher downstream margins, and the absence of 2020 impairments and write-offs. Additionally, the company experienced an increase in U.S. income before tax, which contributed to a rise in tax expense.\n\nIn terms of comprehensive income, Chevron Corporation reported a comprehensive income of $17,412 million in 2021, compared to a comprehensive loss of $6,662 million in 2020. The increase in comprehensive income was primarily due to the positive net income, as well as other comprehensive gains, such as unrealized holding gains on securities and favorable currency translation adjustments. These gains were partially offset by income tax costs on defined benefit plans and other comprehensive losses.\n\nThe financial activities that contributed to these changes include increased upstream and downstream earnings, higher realizations, and improved margins. Additionally, the company's efforts to manage its equity structure and cash flows played a role in its financial performance. For instance, the company's cash flow from operating activities increased significantly in 2021, providing the necessary liquidity to support its operations and investments.\n\n![Comprehensive income for Chevron Corporation increased significantly from 2020 to 2021, driven by higher net income and other comprehensive gains.](image4)\n\nThe balance sheet data also indicates that Chevron Corporation's financial position improved in 2021, with an increase in total assets and a reduction in liabilities.

According to the table, a significantly higher number of female employees (21,746) are entitled to parental leave compared to male employees (98,347). However, the number of females who actually availed parental leave (1,025) is much lower than that of males (2,023). This suggests that while more women are eligible for parental leave, fewer of them take it, which could be due to various factors such as societal expectations or workplace culture.\n\nFurthermore, the data shows that a high percentage of both female (94%) and male (96%) employees who took parental leave returned to work after their leave ended. However, only a small percentage of those who returned to work after leave ended were still employed after 12 months—6% of females and 4% of males. This indicates that even though most employees return to work after parental leave, a significant number do not remain employed after a year, which could point to challenges in retaining employees post-leave.\n\nThese statistics reflect on the gender diversity policies in the workplace. While HDFC Bank has initiatives aimed at promoting gender diversity, such as the \"Careers 2.0\" program and the \"Shrishti\" initiative, the data on parental leave suggests that there may still be barriers for women in terms of taking and returning from leave. The bank's efforts to create an inclusive work environment and provide equal opportunities are evident, but the low uptake of parental leave by women highlights the need for further measures to support women in balancing their professional and personal lives.\n\n![The table presents data on parental leave entitlements for female and male employees.](image1)"}

Additionally, Inditex's focus on store optimisation and streamlining operations, including the absorption of underperforming stores, could have contributed to the changes in the geographical distribution of stores [1].\n\nAnother factor might be the company's strategy to expand its presence in emerging markets, particularly in the \"Rest of the World\" region, where franchise operations increased significantly from 714 in 2021 to 725 in 2022. This suggests a continued emphasis on leveraging franchise partnerships to grow its global footprint while maintaining control over key markets through company-managed stores [4].\n\nIn summary, the geographical distribution of Inditex's stores changed from 2021 to 2022, with an increase in both company-managed and franchise locations in several regions, likely influenced by the lingering effects of the pandemic and the company's strategic focus on store optimisation and market expansion."}

According to the table, ENBREL sales for 2020 were $4,996 million, down 4% from $5,226 million in 2019 [image4]. This decline was driven by lower unit demand and net selling price, partially offset by favorable changes to estimated sales deductions and inventory [4]. Additionally, ENBREL has continued to lose market share, and this decline has been compounded by a reduction in the growth rate of the rheumatology market due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic [4]. For 2021, the company expects ENBREL to follow the historic pattern of lower sales in the first quarter relative to subsequent quarters due to the impact of benefit plan changes, insurance reverification, and increased co-pay expenses as U.S. patients work through deductibles [4]. Furthermore, the company is involved in patent litigations with companies seeking to market biosimilar versions of ENBREL, which could further affect its market position [8].\n\nIn contrast, Prolia showed an increase in sales in 2020. The table indicates that Prolia sales for 2020 were $2,763 million, up 3% from $2,672 million in 2019 [image5]. The increase in global Prolia sales for 2020 was driven by higher unit demand and net selling price [5]. However, the pandemic disrupted patient visits, affecting demand by altering the timing of patients receiving their semiannual doses and lowering the diagnosis of osteoporosis in new patients [6]. This disruption softened the historical growth rates and altered demand patterns for Prolia.

Since we only have the fixed assets for 2019 and 2018, we can calculate the average as follows:\n\n$$\n\\text{Average Fixed Assets} = \\frac{\\text{Fixed Assets (2019)} + \\text{Fixed Assets (2018)}}{2}\n$$\n\nFrom **image4**, we know that:\n- Fixed Assets (2019): $253 million\n- Fixed Assets (2018): $282 million\n\nSo,\n$$\n\\text{Average Fixed Assets} = \\frac{253 + 282}{2} = \\frac{535}{2} = 267.5 \\text{ million}\n$$\n\nNow, using the net revenues for 2019 ($7,148 million) and the average fixed assets ($267.5 million), we can calculate the fixed asset turnover ratio:\n\n$$\n\\text{Fixed Asset Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{7,148}{267.5} \\approx 26.73\n$$\n\nThus, the FY2019 fixed asset turnover ratio for Activision Blizzard is approximately **26.73**.\n\n![The balance sheet shows the company's financial position as of December 31, 2019, and December 31, 2018, including Property and Equipment, net.](image4)"}

In 2018, the comprehensive income was $10,865 million, which increased to $14,821 million in 2019, and further rose to $15,533 million in 2020. This indicates an overall positive trend over the three years, although there were variations in the components contributing to these figures.\n\nThe changes in comprehensive income can be attributed to several factors. For instance, in 2020, the company experienced a significant decrease in other comprehensive (loss) income due to foreign currency translation losses of $983 million, which was much higher compared to the previous years. However, this was partially offset by gains on investment securities, which contributed $805 million in 2020. The reclassification adjustments also played a role, with a net loss of $58 million in 2020.\n\nIn 2019, the company had a more favorable situation, with a total other comprehensive income of $582 million, driven by gross unrealized gains on investment securities of $933 million and a smaller impact from foreign currency translation losses of $271 million. The reclassification adjustments for net realized gains were a net loss of $80 million in 2019.\n\nFor 2018, the comprehensive income was negatively impacted by a large foreign currency translation loss of $1,242 million, which significantly reduced the total other comprehensive (loss) income to ($1,517) million. Despite this, the company still managed to achieve a comprehensive income of $10,865 million.\n\n![Comprehensive income for UnitedHealth Group from 2018 to 2020](image5)\n\nOverall, the changes in comprehensive income reflect the dynamic nature of the financial markets and the impact of various factors such as foreign currency fluctuations, investment performance, and reclassification adjustments."}

In 2020, the profit margin was 11.20%, which dropped to 11.13% in 2021 and further declined to 10.48% in 2022 [image2]. This decline reflects a consistent downward trend in the company's gross margin percentage over these years.\n\nAccording to text quote [5], the total gross margin percentage decreased by 65 basis points compared to 2021, with the decrease being primarily due to a 33 basis-point decrease in core merchandise categories, driven by decreases in fresh foods and foods and sundries, and a 19 basis-point decrease due to a LIFO charge for higher merchandise costs. Additionally, the gross margin was negatively impacted by one basis point due to increased rewards, while warehouse ancillary and other businesses positively impacted it by 29 basis points, predominantly gasoline, partially offset by e-commerce. The net impact of ceasing incremental wages related to COVID-19 and the negative impact of a one-time charge related to granting employees an additional day of paid time off also played a role. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted gross margin by approximately $176, compared to 2021, primarily attributable to the Other International Operations.\n\nText quote [1] adds that all segments were negatively impacted due to decreases in core merchandise categories, partially offset by increases in warehouse ancillary and other businesses. The U.S. segment was also negatively impacted by the LIFO charge, while the Other International segment was affected by increased rewards. All segments benefited from the ceasing of incremental wages related to COVID-19.\n\nText quote [6] provides further insight into the gross margin in core merchandise categories, stating that it decreased by 27 basis points when expressed as a percentage of core merchandise sales. The decrease was across all categories, most significantly in fresh foods, and this measure eliminates the impact of changes in sales penetration and gross margins from warehouse ancillary and other businesses.\n\nText quote [2] explains that the gasoline business generally has a lower gross margin percentage relative to non-gasoline business but has lower SG&A expenses as a percent of net sales. A higher penetration of gasoline sales will generally lower the gross margin percentage. Rapidly changing gasoline prices may significantly impact near-term net sales growth, with rising prices benefiting net sales growth but negatively impacting gross margin percentage due to the higher sales base. A decline in gasoline prices has the inverse effect.\n\nText quote [10] mentions that net sales increased by $30,678 or 16% during 2022, with the improvement attributed to an increase in comparable sales of 14% and sales at new warehouses opened in 2021 and 2022. However, this increase in sales did not translate into a proportional increase in gross margin, as the factors mentioned above contributed to the decline in gross margin percentage.\n\n![Gross margin percentage for the years 2020, 2021, and 2022](image2)\n\nThe gross margin percentage decreased from 2020 to 2022, primarily due to decreases in core merchandise categories, a LIFO charge, increased rewards, and the impact of foreign currency changes."}

In contrast, members of the Corporate Executive Committee typically receive their bonuses in cash, as indicated in the table [4].\n\nAdditionally, the Remuneration Committee determines the bonuses for both groups based on performance against agreed objectives, but the structure of the bonus differs significantly.

In 2019, the total long-term debt was $5,303 million, while in 2020, it rose to $6,248 million. This increase can be attributed to the issuance of new fixed-rate, long-term debt during the year. For instance, in March 2020, the company issued $750 million of fixed-rate, long-term debt due in 2030, and in May 2020, another $750 million of fixed-rate, long-term debt due in 2030 was issued [7]. Additionally, in September 2019, the company issued $750 million of fixed-rate, long-term debt due in 2029 [8], and in March 2019, $750 million of fixed-rate, long-term debt due in 2039 was issued [1]. These issuances contributed significantly to the growth in long-term debt.\n\nMoreover, the company used the proceeds from these debt issuances for general corporate purposes and the repayment of maturing debt. For example, in 2020, the company retired maturing debt of $500 million, and in 2019, it retired maturing debt of $750 million [3]. Despite these repayments, the overall long-term debt still increased due to the larger amount of new debt issued.\n\nAnother factor that influenced the change in long-term debt was the amortization of discounts, premiums, and issuance costs. The interest and debt expense for 2020 was $190 million, which included the amortization of these costs [2]. The net proceeds from the debt issuances were used for various corporate purposes, including the repayment of maturing debt, which also impacted the overall debt structure.\n\nIn addition, the company's financial statements show that the total debt, including net unamortized discounts, premiums, and issuance costs, increased from $5,803 million in 2019 to $6,798 million in 2020 [5]. This indicates that the increase in long-term debt was not only due to the issuance of new debt but also due to the adjustments made to the existing debt through amortization and other accounting treatments.\n\n![The table provides information about purchase commitments over a series of years and their total value.](image1)\n\n![The table presents financial information related to lease obligations over a series of years.

The weighted-average all-in financing cost of the total debt was 2.4% in 2020, slightly lower than the 2.5% in 2019, suggesting a favorable interest rate environment for the company.\n\nThe figures for committed credit facilities and long-term debt indicate that the company maintains a diversified and conservative approach to managing its financial liabilities. By securing substantial credit facilities and maintaining a significant portion of its debt at fixed rates, the company is able to manage its liquidity needs while minimizing exposure to interest rate fluctuations. This strategy supports the company's overall financial stability and flexibility.\n\n![The table presents ratings from three credit rating agencies: Moody’s, Standard & Poor’s, and Fitch.](image5)"}

However, this was partially offset by lower costs and balances of interest-bearing deposits and long-term debt [2]. Additionally, the text mentions that total loans (average) decreased driven by lower loan demand, including lower line utilization, and higher paydowns reflecting continued high levels of client liquidity and strength in the capital markets, partially offset by modest loan growth in late 2021 [5].\n\nLooking at the image quotes, image1 provides a financial overview from 2019 to 2021, showing that net interest income was $4,960 million in 2021, compared to $6,134 million in 2020. This indicates a decrease in net interest income. Total noninterest income in 2021 was $3,589 million, compared to $3,041 million in 2020, which shows an increase in noninterest income.

Some directors, like P. B. Ramanujam, S. B. Mathur, and B. Vijayaraghavan, attended 9 meetings, indicating consistent and active participation. Others attended fewer meetings, with some having \"NA\" for attendance, which may suggest incomplete data or absence.

This positive cash flow contributed to the overall financial health of the company, which in turn impacted the retained earnings and, subsequently, the total equity.\n\nRetained earnings, which are profits that have been reinvested in the business rather than distributed as dividends, played a crucial role in the growth of total equity. According to the table, retained earnings started at $43,352 thousand and underwent adjustments due to profit, changes in accounting policy, and dividends over the period [3]. These adjustments directly affected the retained earnings component of total equity, which increased from $45,242 thousand to $58,368 thousand over the period [3].\n\nThe interplay between cash flow from operating activities and retained earnings is evident in the overall increase in total equity.

According to the data provided, the total deferred tax assets decreased from $4,564 million in 2021 to $4,091 million in 2022. This reduction can be attributed to various factors such as changes in loss carryforwards, pension and retiree benefits, capitalized research and development, and other items. The decrease in deferred tax assets may indicate a reduction in future tax benefits that the company expects to realize.\n\nOn the other hand, the deferred tax liabilities increased from $8,503 million in 2021 to $9,288 million in 2022. This increase is primarily due to changes in goodwill and intangible assets, fixed assets, other retiree benefits, unrealized gains on financial and foreign exchange transactions, lease right-of-use assets, foreign withholding tax on earnings to be repatriated, and other items. The rise in deferred tax liabilities suggests that the company has more future tax obligations that it anticipates will be recognized in the coming years.\n\nThese changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities can have a significant impact on the company's financial position.

For example, quote [6] states that \"About seven-in-ten (69%) women who majored in a health professions field are working in a health-related occupation, as are 61% of men who majored in a health professions field.\" This indicates that for health professions, the percentage of women employed in their field is higher than that of men. Additionally, quote [9] mentions that \"Among all college-educated workers who majored in a health professions field, 81% are female.

{"q_id": 992, "model": "qwen3-30b-a3b", "in_tok": 2764, "out_tok": 470, "total_tok": 3234, "response": "The question of how gender discrimination in STEM jobs compares between men and women is a critical issue that highlights significant disparities. According to the text quotes, women in STEM jobs are more likely to experience gender discrimination than their male counterparts. For instance, half (50%) of women in STEM jobs say they have experienced at least one form of gender-related discrimination at work, compared to 19% of men in STEM positions [3]. This disparity is further emphasized by the fact that women in STEM jobs are more likely to report experiences with and concerns about gender inequities in the workplace than men in these jobs [10].\n\nThe image quotes provide visual evidence that supports these findings. Image1, which presents a survey comparing the experiences of men and women in computer jobs regarding gender-related issues at work, shows that 74% of women reported experiencing gender-related discrimination, compared to 16% of men [image1]. This significant difference underscores the challenges faced by women in this specific area of STEM.\n\nImage5 offers additional insights into the experiences of women in STEM jobs based on the gender composition of their workplaces. It reveals that women in male-dominated workplaces are significantly more likely to experience gender-related discrimination (78%) compared to those in workplaces with more women or an even gender mix (44%) [image5]. In contrast, only 19% of men in STEM jobs reported experiencing gender-related discrimination. This data illustrates that the environment in which women work plays a crucial role in their experiences of discrimination.\n\nFurthermore, image3 provides a comparison of the percentages of men and women in STEM jobs, highlighting that women in STEM jobs (50%) are more likely to experience discrimination than men in STEM jobs (19%) [image3]. This chart reinforces the notion that women face greater challenges in terms of gender discrimination within STEM fields.\n\nIn summary, gender discrimination in STEM jobs is significantly more prevalent among women than men, as evidenced by both textual and visual data. Women in STEM jobs are more likely to experience various forms of discrimination, including lower pay, lack of competence recognition, and fewer opportunities for advancement. The data also suggests that the workplace environment, particularly in male-dominated settings, exacerbates these challenges for women.\n\n![Women in STEM jobs are more likely to experience gender-related discrimination compared to men.](image1)"}

Specifically, about four-in-ten (43%) gave Clinton an A or B, which is comparable to the share giving Mitt Romney top letter grades in 2012 (44%) and 13 percentage points higher than Trump’s (30%) [10]. This marked a significant departure from historical trends, where the winner typically received better grades.\n\nIn addition, Trump received historically low grades overall, with only 30% of voters giving him an A or B. This reflects his own supporters' relatively low enthusiasm, as while a majority (58%) of Trump voters gave him an A or B for his campaign conduct, just 17% gave him an A [6]. Furthermore, nearly two-thirds of Clinton voters (65%) gave Trump a failing grade, by far the highest percentage among election winners dating back to 1988 [4].\n\nOn the other hand, Clinton's grades were more favorable compared to previous losing candidates. She received an A or B from 43% of voters, which is similar to the grades given to past losing candidates like Mitt Romney in 2012 [10]. However, it is worth noting that Clinton also received a lower percentage of A or B grades compared to some previous winning candidates, such as Barack Obama in 2008, who received 75% A or B [3].\n\nOverall, the 2016 election saw a unique pattern where the losing candidate, Clinton, received higher grades than the winner, Trump, highlighting a shift in public perception and satisfaction with the campaign conduct of the candidates.\n\n![The public graded the losing candidate, Hillary Clinton, higher than the winning candidate, Donald Trump, in the 2016 election.](image1)"}

For example, quote [1] mentions that 52% of female internet users aged 65+ are social networking site adopters, while 39% of older men are. However, this is about social networking sites, not general internet usage or broadband adoption.

According to text quote [1], while Republicans’ views have mostly held steady over the past four months, there is a noticeable shift in the broader timeline. For instance, text quote [6] highlights a decline in the share of Democrats who see the U.S. as the world’s top economy since March. This suggests that the perception of U.S. economic dominance has been on a downward trajectory among Democrats, particularly in recent months.\n\nText quote [4] provides further context, noting that while more Americans still believe the U.S. is the leading economy (52%) compared to China (32%), this view has declined by 7 percentage points over the past four months. The data indicates that the perception of U.S. economic superiority has weakened, especially among Democrats, who have become significantly less likely to hold this view.\n\nIn addition, text quote [7] mentions that the share of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents who see China as an enemy has increased by 21 percentage points since 2012, which may reflect a growing skepticism toward China’s economic influence and its impact on U.S. global standing. However, this does not directly address the perception of the U.S. as the leading economic power but rather highlights a shift in how different groups view China.\n\nLooking at the broader political landscape, image4 shows that the percentage of people identifying as Republican or leaning Republican increased from 54% in 2008 to 64% in 2020, while the percentage of Democrats or leaning Democrats remained relatively stable, increasing slightly from 43% to 44%.

According to the data presented in the table, the population of Hamilton County increased significantly during the late 1800s. In 1870, the population was only 130, but by 1880, it had surged to 8,267, reaching a peak of 14,096 in 1890 [3]. This rapid growth can be attributed to the influx of settlers, particularly those from Missouri, Iowa, Illinois, Ohio, and the New England States, as well as later immigrants from Germany, Sweden, England, and Russia [8]. The arrival of these groups contributed to the establishment of numerous rural school districts and religious institutions, such as the Zion Lutheran Church and School [1].\n\nHowever, after the peak in 1890, the population began to decline gradually. By 1900, the population had dropped to 13,330, and continued to decrease over the following decades, reaching 9,982 in 1940 [3]. Despite this overall trend, some towns, like Aurora, experienced recent population gains, with the population peaking at 4,225 in 2000 [2]. This suggests that while many small towns struggled, some managed to maintain or even increase their populations.\n\nThe historical factors influencing these changes include the impact of the Transcontinental Railroad Act and the Homestead Act in the mid-1800s. These acts transformed Nebraska's landscape by encouraging westward expansion and agricultural development [9]. The construction of the Union Pacific Railroad facilitated the movement of people and goods, contributing to the growth of settlements in Hamilton County. Additionally, the mechanization of agriculture led to significant changes in the rural landscape, with the number of farms declining while the average size of farms increased [4]. This shift likely contributed to the decline of some rural communities as smaller farms were consolidated into larger operations.\n\n![The image shows a church building with a tall steeple topped by a cross.

Older adults, particularly those aged 65 and older, show the highest levels of \"no confidence at all\" in certain topics, which might indicate a greater skepticism toward foreign influences, including Chinese students.\n\nA third image (image3) illustrates how political groups view the impact of certain issues. While the chart focuses on a different topic, it underscores the polarization in public opinion, which could extend to views on Chinese students. For example, Republicans are more likely to view certain actions as \"good for the U.S.,\" which might align with their support for limiting Chinese students.\n\nOverall, the evidence suggests that age significantly influences opinions on limiting Chinese students in U.S. universities, with older Americans being more supportive of restrictions, while younger individuals tend to oppose them. This pattern is reinforced by related factors such as education and political affiliation.\n\n![Older Americans are more likely to support limiting Chinese students in U.S. universities compared to younger individuals.](image6)"}

The image also reveals that 57% of Black respondents feel their workplace pays insufficient attention to diversity issues, compared to 15% of White respondents.\n\nIn terms of perceptions of fairness in workplace processes, text quote [5] notes that blacks working in STEM jobs are less convinced than white STEM workers that black employees are treated fairly when it comes to hiring and promotions. Specifically, 43% of blacks in STEM jobs believe that blacks are usually treated fairly during recruitment, while 37% say this is the case during promotion and advancement opportunities. In contrast, 78% of white STEM workers believe that blacks are usually treated fairly in these processes.\n\nImage quote [3] corroborates this, showing that 43% of Black respondents believe Blacks are treated fairly in recruitment and hiring, while 78% of White respondents feel the process is fair. Similarly, 37% of Black respondents believe opportunities for promotion and advancement are fair, compared to 75% of White respondents.\n\nIn summary, the evidence suggests that perceptions of workplace discrimination and fairness differ significantly among racial/ethnic groups in STEM jobs, with Black individuals reporting higher levels of discrimination and lower confidence in the fairness of workplace processes compared to their White, Hispanic, and Asian counterparts.\n\n![Black respondents in STEM jobs report higher levels of workplace discrimination and lower confidence in the fairness of workplace processes compared to other racial/ethnic groups.](image3)"}

This improvement would likely allow for more efficient and potentially faster service, as electric trains are generally more powerful and can handle higher frequencies.\n\nExtending platform lengths to accommodate more cars would enable a peak service of 6x8, requiring 48 train cars during peak hours. This scenario highlights the importance of infrastructure upgrades in supporting increased service levels and passenger capacity.\n\nFinally, increasing the frequency of trains, potentially in conjunction with High-Speed Rail (HSR), could result in a peak service of 8x8, necessitating 64 train cars during peak hours.

This implies that a significant portion of Republicans are confident in this regard.\n- **Text Quote [4]** mentions that seven-in-ten (70%) Republicans say they are at least somewhat confident in Trump's ability to work effectively with Congress, but only 31% say they are very confident. While this is about working with Congress, it gives an indication of the general confidence levels among Republicans.\n- **Text Quote [6]** provides information on the overall public's confidence, stating that 41% of Americans are not at all confident that Trump keeps his own personal interests separate from his presidential decisions. However, this is for the general public, not specifically for Republicans.\n- **Text Quote [7]** highlights that Democrats are deeply skeptical, with 69% saying they are not at all confident that Trump keeps his business interests separate.

Furthermore, $43\\%$ of college-educated individuals believe it describes one party but not the other, while $17\\%$ think it applies to both [1].\n\nThese trends are reflected in the bar chart (image1), which shows that postgraduates strongly favor the Democratic Party, with 62% supporting them compared to 30% for Republicans. Similarly, those with a four-year college degree favor Democrats by a margin of 53% to 40%. In contrast, voters without a college degree show more divided preferences, indicating a less clear alignment with either party [2].\n\nWhen examining perceptions of ethical standards specifically, the data from image3 highlights that only 41% of Americans believe the GOP has high ethical standards, while 42% hold the same view about the Democratic Party. This suggests that both parties face similar challenges in terms of public perception regarding ethics.\n\nFor political affiliation groups, the data indicates that partisans are generally more positive about their own party's ethical standards. However, majorities of both Republicans (66%) and Democrats (64%) still describe their party as having high ethical standards [3]. Independents, on the other hand, are significantly more likely than partisans to say neither party has high ethical standards, with about a third of independents (34%) holding this view [5].\n\nThe bar chart in image2 provides further insight into these perceptions, showing that the percentage of people who believe \"high ethical standards\" describes neither party varies across different educational levels and political affiliations. For example, among those with some college experience or a high school degree or less, fewer (26% and 20%, respectively) think neither party has high ethical standards [10].\n\n![The bar chart shows that among different educational groups, those with postgraduate degrees and college degrees have distinct preferences for the Democratic Party over the Republican Party.](image1)\n\n![The bar chart illustrates how different groups perceive the ethical standards of the political parties, with a significant portion of the public believing that \"high ethical standards\" does not describe either party.](image2)\n\nIn conclusion, perceptions of ethical standards differ significantly among various educational and political affiliation groups, with higher education levels and independent voters showing more skepticism toward both major parties."}

This trend is supported by both textual data and visual representations.\n\nAccording to the text quotes, younger seniors, particularly those in their mid-to-late 60s, have higher rates of internet and broadband use compared to older age groups. For example, 74% of seniors aged 65-69 go online, and 65% have broadband at home [10]. However, these rates drop sharply as age increases. By the time individuals reach 80 years or older, only 37% go online, and just 21% have broadband at home [8]. Similarly, internet use and broadband adoption each fall off notably starting at approximately age 75 [5], with 47% of those aged 75-79 going online and 34% having broadband at home [4].\n\nThe decline in internet and broadband usage is also reflected in the pie chart (image1), which shows that 41% of seniors do not go online, 32% go online but do not use social networking services (SNS), and 27% use SNS. This distribution highlights the varying levels of engagement with online platforms among seniors.\n\nA bar chart (image2) further illustrates this trend by comparing smartphone and tablet ownership between all adults and seniors. While 55% of all adults own a smartphone and 43% own a tablet or e-reader, only 18% of seniors own a smartphone and 27% own a tablet or e-reader. This suggests that seniors are less likely to adopt newer digital technologies compared to younger adults.\n\nAdditionally, a line graph (image3) tracks the increase in internet adoption over time for both \"All Adults 18+\" and \"65+\". While both groups show upward trends, the rate of growth for seniors is slower, with the percentage of seniors going online increasing from about 14% in 2000 to 59% in 2013. In contrast, the percentage of all adults increased from around 50% to 86% during the same period.\n\nFinally, a bar chart (image4) provides a detailed comparison of internet and broadband usage across different age groups. It confirms that as age increases, both internet usage and broadband availability decrease. For instance, 74% of those aged 65-69 go online, while only 37% of those aged 80+ do so. Similarly, 65% of those aged 65-69 have broadband at home, compared to just 21% of those aged 80+.\n\n![Seniors' internet and broadband usage decreases with age](image4)\n\nIn conclusion, internet and broadband usage among seniors declines significantly with age, with younger seniors (ages 65-69) showing much higher rates of adoption compared to older seniors (ages 80+)."}

Initially, in January 2015, 63% of Republicans believed the government was doing very or fairly well in reducing the terrorist threat. However, by the time of the survey, this figure had dropped to just 27%, reflecting a substantial decline [4]. This trend is consistent with broader changes in public opinion, as assessments of government efforts to combat terrorism became more negative across the political spectrum compared to early 2015 [4].\n\nThe data also indicates that since the Snowden disclosures in 2013, there has been a noticeable shift in how Republicans perceive the balance between anti-terrorism policies and civil liberties. While both Republicans and Democrats have become more likely to say that the government's anti-terrorism policies do not go far enough to protect the country, the shift has been more pronounced among Republicans. In fact, slightly more than seven-in-ten Republicans (71%) now say their greater concern is that anti-terrorism policies do not go far enough, up 14 points since January (57%) and 33 points since July 2013 (38%) [3].\n\nThis change in perception is also reflected in the line graph that illustrates the approval ratings of U.S. Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama over time, segmented by political affiliation. The graph shows that during Obama's presidency, Republican approval of the government's efforts to reduce the terrorist threat declined significantly, while Democratic approval remained relatively high and steady [10]. ![The graph shows the approval ratings of U.S. Presidents George W.

Specifically, 62% of Republicans reported feeling \"very cold\" toward China in 2021, up from 31 points since 2018 [1]. Meanwhile, 38% of Democrats felt \"very cold,\" representing an increase of 21 points over the same period [1].

While the provided quotes do not directly mention specific STEM majors or their associated pay levels, we can infer some relevant information from the data presented.\n\nFrom the text quotes, we know that women are underrepresented in certain STEM fields, such as mechanical engineering (8%) and sales engineering (7%), while they are overrepresented in others, like speech language pathologists (96%) and dental hygienists (95%). These disparities suggest that the gender gap varies significantly across different STEM occupations. Furthermore, women in computer jobs face more gender disparities at work, including higher rates of discrimination and pay inequities [6].\n\nLooking at the image quotes, image1 provides a detailed bar chart comparing the experiences of women and men in STEM jobs regarding gender-related issues. It shows that postgraduate women experience more gender-related issues compared to women with some college education, and men generally experience fewer issues. This suggests that higher educational attainment may correlate with increased challenges for women in STEM fields. Image3 further highlights that women in workplaces with more men report higher incidences of gender-related discrimination and sexual harassment compared to those in more balanced or women-dominated environments. This implies that the gender composition of the workplace plays a significant role in shaping the experiences of women in STEM.\n\nImage5 presents a horizontal bar graph comparing the perceptions and experiences of men and women in computer jobs regarding gender-related issues in the workplace. The data indicates that women in computer jobs experience significantly higher rates of gender-related discrimination, sexual harassment, and challenges related to gender impacting their career success compared to men. This aligns with the findings in the text quotes that women in computer jobs are more likely to face gender disparities and discrimination.\n\nWhile the question specifically asks about the \"type of STEP major\" (likely a typo for \"STEM major\") with the largest gender gap in consistent employment in the field that receives the highest pay, the provided data does not explicitly identify which STEM major has the largest gender gap or the highest pay. However, based on the information available, it is reasonable to infer that computer jobs, particularly those in the technology industry, may have one of the largest gender gaps in consistent employment and face significant pay disparities, as highlighted in the text and image quotes.\n\n![Women in computer jobs experience higher rates of gender-related discrimination and pay inequities compared to men in these roles.](image5)"}

To answer this, we need to look at the relevant data from both text and image quotes.\n\nFrom the text, we know that among U.S. adults with Hispanic ancestry, 11% do not identify as Hispanic [6]. This is a key figure, as it reflects the proportion of individuals who have Hispanic ancestry but do not self-identify as such. Additionally, the text mentions that by the fourth or higher generation, only half of U.S. adults with Hispanic ancestry say they are Hispanic [7], indicating a significant drop in identification over generations.\n\nLooking at the image quotes, **image3** provides a visual representation of the generational makeup of self-identified Hispanics and non-Hispanics. It states that among self-identified Hispanics, 18% are foreign born, 29% are second generation, and 65% are third or higher generation. For self-identified non-Hispanics, 96% are of the third or higher generation. The bars visually represent these percentages, with the Hispanic categories in brown and the non-Hispanic category in gold.\n\nAnother relevant image is **image5**, which shows the percentage of Hispanic and Non-Hispanic individuals across different generations. It indicates that in the \"Fourth or higher generation,\" there is an equal split, with 50% Hispanic and 50% Non-Hispanic. This suggests that the smallest bar in the graph could be 50%, as it represents the smallest proportional difference between the two groups in that generation.\n\nHowever, based on the text quote [6], the smallest value related to the percentage of U.S. adults with Hispanic ancestry who self-identify as Non-Hispanic is 11%.

For instance, it is noted that \"women’s representation in STEM occupations varies substantially by occupational subgroup\" [6], and \"among college-educated workers, the share of women earning a STEM degree varies widely and generally corresponds with the share of women in these occupational clusters\" [7]. Additionally, it is stated that \"on average, women’s representation in STEM jobs is lower among those employed with advanced degrees\" [9]. This suggests that while women are well-represented in some educational categories within STEM, their representation decreases as the level of education increases.\n\nLooking at the image quotes, we find specific data that supports this trend. Image3 presents a bar chart comparing education levels among those employed in STEM jobs versus the overall employed population. According to the data:\n\n- **High school or less**: 55% of STEM workers have a high school education or less, compared to 41% of all employed individuals.\n- **Some college**: 59% of STEM workers have some college education, compared to 50% of all employed individuals.\n- **Bachelor's degree**: 47% of STEM workers have a bachelor's degree, compared to 49% of all employed individuals.\n- **Master's degree**: 47% of STEM workers have a master's degree, compared to 54% of all employed individuals.\n- **Professional/doctoral degree**: 41% of STEM workers have a professional or doctoral degree, compared to 42% of all employed individuals.\n\nThese statistics indicate that women are overrepresented in STEM jobs at lower education levels (high school or less and some college) and underrepresented at higher education levels (master's and professional/doctoral degrees). This aligns with the textual evidence suggesting that women's representation in STEM jobs tends to decrease as the level of education increases.\n\n![Women's representation in STEM jobs varies by education level compared to the overall employed population](image3)"}

According to the data, women make up approximately 50% of all U.S. workers in STEM occupations, but this figure varies widely depending on the specific cluster [3]. For instance, women are overrepresented in health-related jobs, where three-quarters (75%) of healthcare practitioners and technicians are women [3]. This trend is also illustrated in image3, which shows that health-related jobs have a higher share of women, with most data points between 70% and 100% [image3].\n\nIn contrast, women are underrepresented in other STEM clusters. Engineering, for example, has the lowest share of women at 14% [8], and computer occupations follow closely behind with women comprising only 25% of workers [8]. Image3 further highlights this disparity, showing that computer jobs have a lower female share, around 25%, while engineering jobs have the lowest female representation, with an average of 14% [image3].\n\nOther STEM clusters show varying levels of female representation. Life science jobs have an approximate average of 47% female representation, while math jobs have about 46% [8]. Physical science jobs have a slightly lower share, with around 39% women [8]. These differences underscore the uneven distribution of women across STEM fields.\n\nImage3 also provides a visual representation of this variation, showing that while the average for all STEM jobs is 50%, certain roles like sales engineers have only 7% women, whereas speech-language pathologists have 96% women [image3].\n\nOverall, the data indicates that female representation in STEM job clusters is highly variable, with some fields experiencing significant underrepresentation and others showing much higher participation rates. ![Female representation varies across different STEM job clusters](image3)."}

In 1870, the county's population was recorded at 130, which marked the beginning of a rapid growth phase. By 1880, the population had surged to 8,267, and by 1890, it reached its peak at 14,096 [3]. This growth was driven by the influx of settlers, including pioneers like Jarvil Chaffee, who established the first permanent settlement in June 1866 [7]. The expansion of the population led to the creation of numerous rural school districts, with 98 organized districts by 1885 and over 100 by the early 1920s [2].\n\nHowever, after reaching its peak in 1890, the population began to decline gradually. By 1900, the population had decreased to 13,330, and it continued to fluctuate over the decades. For instance, in 1940, the population was recorded at 9,982, and by 1960, it had slightly increased to 8,714 before rising again to 9,403 in 2000 [3]. This pattern of growth followed by decline and then slight recovery is evident in the population data presented in Table 3, which shows the trends for various towns in the county [3].\n\nDespite the overall decline, some towns, like Aurora, have shown resilience. Aurora peaked in population at the most recent census in 2000 with 4,225 citizens and has steadily increased since 1940 [4]. However, other towns, such as Hordville and Polk, are expected to face continued population declines due to their dependence on the surrounding farming community [5].\n\nThe changes in population are closely linked to the evolution of the agricultural landscape. Corn has long been the dominant crop, but the introduction of mechanization and the consolidation of farms have significantly altered the rural economy. The number of farms in Hamilton County declined from over 2,000 in 1900 to 603 in 2002, while the average size of farms increased from 179.7 acres in 1920 to 577 acres in 2002 [6].

For example, in the case of G L (Galician), pre-training leads to a substantial gain of up to 11 BLEU points, indicating that word embeddings can be particularly useful for languages on the threshold of producing reasonable translations [1].\n\nIn addition, the qualitative analysis of translations from G L → E N shows that pre-training helps the model capture rarer vocabulary and generate more grammatically well-formed sentences. The best system successfully translates a person’s name and multi-word phrases, highlighting the usefulness of pre-trained embeddings in providing better representations of less frequent concepts when used with low-resource languages [2].\n\nThe results in Table 2 clearly demonstrate that pre-training word embeddings in the source and/or target languages increases BLEU scores to some degree. Comparing the second and third columns, the increase is much more significant with pre-trained source language embeddings, indicating that the majority of the gain comes from a better encoding of the source sentence [6].\n\nWhen considering multilingual translation systems, pre-training and alignment of word embeddings help increase BLEU scores for all three tasks. This is because aligning the word embeddings puts the word embeddings of the two source languages into similar vector spaces, allowing the model to learn in a similar fashion as it would if training on a single language [10].\n\nLooking at the table in image1, we can see that for some language pairs like GL → EN and PT → EN, the BLEU scores decrease slightly when using aligned embeddings, while for others like AZ → EN and RU → EN, the scores improve. This suggests that the effectiveness of pre-training and alignment depends on the specific language pair and the nature of the data.\n\n![The table shows different datasets with scores for \"unaligned\" and \"aligned\" categories.](image1)\n\nThe line graphs in image2 illustrate the relationship between training set size and BLEU scores for translation tasks from Portuguese (Pt), Turkish (Tr), and Russian (Ru) to English (En). The top graph shows that pre-trained models achieve higher BLEU scores than standard models, especially when the training data is limited. The bottom graph highlights that the gain from pre-training is more significant at smaller training set sizes and decreases as the training set size increases [7].\n\n![The image consists of two line graphs illustrating the relationship between training set size and BLEU scores for translation tasks from Portuguese (Pt), Turkish (Tr), and Russian (Ru) to English (En).](image2)\n\nThe table in image3 presents data related to translation datasets from various source languages to Portuguese (PT), categorized by language family. It shows that pre-training leads to improvements in BLEU scores for all language pairs, with larger gains observed for languages that have a greater headroom to improve, such as RU → PT and HE → PT [9].\n\n![The table presents data related to translation datasets from various source languages to Portuguese (PT), categorized by language family.](image3)\n\nThe table in image4 compares translation quality for different language pairs under different processing conditions, emphasizing how preprocessing or other factors might affect performance. The results show that pre-training consistently improves BLEU scores for all language pairs, with the most significant improvements observed for low-resource languages [1].\n\n![The table provides information about datasets with different language pairs translating into English (EN).](image4)\n\nFinally, the table in image5 provides information about datasets with different language pairs translating into English (EN). The dataset sizes vary significantly across language pairs, which could influence the effectiveness of pre-training. For example, the GL → EN dataset is relatively small compared to the RU → EN dataset, which may explain why pre-training has a more significant impact on the BLEU scores for GL → EN [5].\n\n![The table provides information about datasets with different language pairs translating into English (EN).](image5)\n\nIn conclusion, pre-training generally improves BLEU scores for different language pairs, with the extent of improvement depending on factors such as the resource level of the languages and the similarity between them."}

When comparing the performance of the COMET-RANK model using only reference translations versus using both reference and source translations, it is evident that the inclusion of references leads to improved scores across all evaluated language pairs. The difference in scores, represented by the Δτ values, indicates the extent of improvement when references are included.\n\nFor example, in the language pair \"en-cs\" (English to Czech), the COMET-RANK score increases from 0.660 (reference only) to 0.711, with a Δτ of 0.051. Similarly, for \"en-de\" (English to German), the score improves from 0.764 to 0.799, with a Δτ of 0.035. These improvements are consistent across other language pairs, with the most significant gains observed in reverse language pairs where English is the source. For instance, in \"cs-en\" (Czech to English), the score increases from 0.249 to 0.356, with a Δτ of 0.107.

In contrast, for \"de-en\" (German to English), the score increases from 0.390 to 0.542, with a Δτ of 0.155, indicating a substantial improvement.

In the single-task model, as described in text quote [5], the sequence-to-sequence model consists of a recurrent encoder, an attention mechanism, and a recurrent decoder. The attention mechanism in this setup focuses on aligning the input sequence to the output sequence directly, without any additional tasks or shared components.\n\nIn contrast, the multitask model in Figure 1b, as outlined in text quote [2], shares a common encoder but employs separate attentions and decoders for each task. This means that while both tasks share the same encoded representations, their attention mechanisms and decoders operate independently. This setup allows for the joint modeling of two output sequences, but it does not explicitly leverage higher-level information from one task to inform the other.\n\nText quote [3] further elaborates on this by suggesting that higher-level intermediate representations, such as transcriptions, should be useful for tasks like speech translation. However, in the standard multitask model, this is not explicitly achieved, as the second task's decoder does not receive information from the first task's decoder.\n\nThe difference becomes more apparent when comparing the multitask model (Figure 1b) with the triangle model (Figure 1d), which is discussed in text quote [4]. In the triangle model, the second decoder has two attentions: one for the input states of the encoder and one for the output states of the first decoder. This dual-attention mechanism allows the second decoder to benefit from both the raw input and the intermediate representations generated by the first decoder, which is not the case in the standard multitask model.\n\n![The multitask model uses a shared encoder with separate decoders and attentions for each task, while the single-task model has a single decoder with attention focused on the encoded input.](image4)"}

The main components of this pipeline and their functions are outlined below, supported by relevant evidence from both text and images.\n\n1. **Multimodal Retriever**:\n   - The multimodal retriever is responsible for querying a large multimodal external memory or database to find information relevant to the input query or context [8]. It creates and stores multimodal embeddings, which are used to retrieve similar categories or objects based on the input image. This component ensures that the MLLMs have access to a broader knowledge base beyond their immediate context window [9]. As shown in image3, the multimodal retriever includes an image encoder that extracts feature embeddings, a feature index that stores these embeddings, and a memory ($\\mathcal{M}$) that serves as external storage for the embeddings. The retrieving process utilizes k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) for image-image and image-text retrieval [3].\n\n2. **Retrieving & Ranking**:\n   - After the retrieval phase, the retrieved category labels alongside the image embedding are integrated and sent to the MLLMs through a ranking prompt [4]. The MLLMs then rank the retrieved candidate object categories based on similarity, combining their internal knowledge with the retrieved information to make the final prediction [5]. This step is crucial for enhancing the accuracy of predictions, especially in few-shot and zero-shot scenarios. Image3 illustrates this process, where the inference stage involves encoding an image into embeddings, retrieving top-K categories from memory, and using MLLMs to refine and rank these categories. The final prediction is then outputted, such as \"Monarch butterfly.\"\n\n3. **Index System**:\n   - To enhance the speed of retrieval, an index system using the HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World) algorithm is implemented [7]. This system reduces the dimensionality of vectors, transforming them from a $\\mathbb{R}^{d}$ space to a reduced $\\frac{d}{9}$ dimensional space. This reduction in dimensionality plays a pivotal role in enhancing the speed of the retrieval process, making it more efficient even for large datasets.\n\n4. **Pre-processing for Detection Datasets**:\n   - In object detection datasets, additional pre-processing steps such as cropping and blurring are applied to help MLLMs focus on the relevant objects. Cropping is done based on proposal bounding box coordinates, and the cropped regions are resized to a fixed proportion. Blurring is applied to non-target areas to direct the MLLMs’ focus toward the objects of interest [3]. Image5 provides a visual example of this process, showing how pre-processing techniques like cropping and resizing assist in zero-shot recognition for object detection tasks using multimodal retrieval methods.\n\n5. **Ranking Prompt**:\n   - The ranking prompt serves to merge the input image with the category information retrieved from memory. It guides the MLLMs to rank the retrieved candidate object categories based on similarity [5]. This prompt format is essential for ensuring that the MLLMs can effectively utilize the retrieved information to make accurate predictions.\n\nIn summary, the RAR pipeline integrates a multimodal retriever, a retrieving and ranking process, an index system, pre-processing techniques for detection datasets, and a ranking prompt to enhance the performance of MLLMs in various visual recognition tasks. These components work together to bridge the gap between the broad generalization capabilities of MLLMs and the need for precise, fine-grained categorization [2].\n\n![The RAR pipeline consists of a multimodal retriever and a retrieving & ranking process.](image3)"}

Following this, there are two main solution steps: deducing the estimand using causal inference techniques and evaluating the estimand to answer the question. This results in a total of six key steps.\n\nAdditionally, in the image quote [image5], the Causal Chain-of-Thought (CausalCoT) Model is presented, which also divides the process into two main phases: the Preparation Phase and the Solution Phase.

The experiments reveal that LLMs, when used as rerankers, significantly enhance performance on hard samples, which are identified by SLMs based on confidence scores. This is evident from the findings that reranking only a small fraction of hard samples (0.5%–10%) leads to substantial improvements in F1 scores, with gains ranging from 10% to 25% on these challenging cases [4]. \n\nFor the FewNERD dataset, the results show that LLM reranking improves micro-F1 performance, particularly for samples with lower confidence scores. This is because LLMs excel at complex reasoning and external knowledge integration, which helps correct errors made by SLMs on difficult instances. However, this improvement comes with trade-offs: LLMs may underperform on easy samples, where SLMs already provide accurate predictions. The study highlights that LLMs are not effective few-shot information extractors in general but can complement SLMs effectively when applied selectively to hard samples [2].\n\nThe architecture of the filter-then-rerank paradigm further illustrates this approach. Easy samples are processed directly by SLMs, while hard samples are reranked by LLMs using multiple-choice prompts and demonstrations. This ensures that the system leverages the efficiency of SLMs and the accuracy of LLMs without incurring excessive costs [7]. The results demonstrate that this method consistently achieves an average 2.4% F1 gain across various IE tasks, with minimal latency and budget increases [3].\n\n![LLM reranking enhances performance on hard samples by leveraging the strengths of both SLMs and LLMs](image3)\n\nIn the context of the FewNERD dataset, the graphs comparing micro-F1 performance with and without LLM reranking (as shown in image5) indicate that LLM reranking leads to improved performance at lower confidence levels. Specifically, the blue lines (representing LLM reranking) show higher micro-F1 scores compared to the pink lines (without reranking), especially for samples with lower confidence. This suggests that LLMs are particularly effective at refining predictions for uncertain or difficult cases.\n\n![LLM reranking improves micro-F1 performance on FewNERD for low-confidence samples](image5)\n\nIn summary, LLM reranking significantly boosts micro-F1 performance on the FewNERD dataset, especially for samples with lower confidence scores, by correcting errors made by SLMs and leveraging the advanced reasoning capabilities of LLMs."}

This is further supported by the line graphs in image1, which show that the F1 score for entity extraction peaks at two iterations for CorefProp. The left graph titled \"Entity F1\" displays a blue line with circular markers, indicating that the highest score occurs at two iterations. This suggests that the iterative process of coreference propagation enhances the accuracy of entity extraction, but only up to a point, after which additional iterations may not yield further improvements.\n\nSimilarly, for relation extraction, Figure 3b shows that the relation propagation layer achieves the best performance on the second iteration $(M=2)$ [8]. The right graph in image1, titled \"Relation F1,\" displays a red line with square markers, showing that the highest score also occurs at two iterations for RelProp.

However, the performance of both systems decreases as the number of entities increases, suggesting that while the number of iterations can enhance performance, it may not fully compensate for the complexity introduced by a higher number of entities.\n\n![The image is a line graph showing the performance of relation extraction systems, measured by F1 score, as a function of the number of entities present in a sentence.](image4)\n\nIn summary, the number of iterations has a positive impact on the F1 score in both entity and relation extraction tasks, with the optimal performance typically achieved at two iterations.

In the QNLI task, SenseBERT_BASE scores 90.6, slightly higher than BERT_BASE's 89.4.

Specifically, GEM achieves 34.73% joint accuracy on the Hotel domain, while naive fine-tuning only reaches 29.39% [10].

To answer this, we need to analyze both the text and image quotes provided.\n\nFrom the text quotes, we learn that the study focuses on the Uyghur language, a low-resource language, and evaluates different models for NER. Specifically, quote [5] mentions testing the model on 199 annotated evaluation documents from the DARPA LORELEI program and comparing with previously reported results by Mayhew et al. (2017). Quote [2] highlights that the best results come from a combined approach: using word embeddings to translate words not covered by Mayhew et al.'s dictionary. This suggests that combining multiple resources improves performance.\n\nQuote [10] provides a table of results where the \"Combined + self-att.\" method achieves the highest score of 32.09 ± 0.61 when using Wikipedia, a 100K dictionary, and a 5K dictionary. This indicates that the combination of resources, especially when enhanced with a self-attention mechanism, leads to the best performance.\n\nImage1 shows the architecture of a Self-attentive Bi-LSTM-CRF model, which is commonly used for NER tasks. The inclusion of self-attention allows the model to handle variations in word order, which is crucial for cross-lingual NER. This aligns with the findings in the text, where the self-attention mechanism improves performance.\n\nImage2 presents a table comparing different models on the \"Original Unsequestered Set,\" showing that the \"Combined + self-att.\" method achieves the highest score of 32.09 ± 0.61. This confirms that the combination of resources and the use of self-attention are key factors in achieving the best performance.\n\nImage3 provides a comparative analysis of models for Spanish, Dutch, and German, but it does not directly address the Uyghur NER task. However, it supports the general idea that combining resources and using advanced mechanisms like self-attention improves performance.\n\nImage4 illustrates a method for translating words not included in a dictionary using word embeddings. This method is relevant to the Uyghur NER task, as it addresses the challenge of translating named entities when the dictionary coverage is limited.\n\nImage5 compares three models (Common space, Replace, and Translation) across three languages, with the Translation model performing the best. While this does not directly apply to Uyghur, it reinforces the importance of translation methods in improving NER performance.\n\nBased on the evidence from the text and images, the model that performs best across different resources in the Uyghur NER task is the **Combined + self-att.** model, which combines word embeddings, dictionaries, and a self-attention mechanism. \n\n![The image depicts a detailed architecture of a Self-attentive Bi-LSTM-CRF model.](image1)  \n![The table presents the results of different models evaluated on an \"Original Unsequestered Set,\" with the use of various extra resources.](image2)  \n![The table displays a comparative analysis of different models and methods for Spanish, Dutch, and German text processing or translation tasks, using specific extra resources.](image3)  \n![The image illustrates a method for translating Spanish-English words that aren't included in a dictionary using word embeddings.](image4)  \n![The table presents data comparing three models (Common space, Replace, and Translation) across three languages (Spanish, Dutch, and German).](image5)  \n\nThe **Combined + self-att.** model performs best across different resources in the Uyghur NER task."}

When evaluating the \"Train\" domain, the results show that fine-tuning with GEM outperforms naive fine-tuning and other strategies. Specifically, the table indicates that training from scratch on the \"Train\" domain achieves a joint goal accuracy of $77.71\\%$ [3]. However, this value is not directly comparable to the improvement achieved by GEM, as the table focuses on the performance after fine-tuning on a new domain rather than the original domain.\n\nLooking at **Table 5**, which evaluates the performance on the \"Train\" domain, the \"Trained Single\" method (which likely refers to training from scratch) achieves a joint goal accuracy of $77.71\\%$ [3].

This is reflected in the diverse categories of data included in the SFT dataset, such as Text, Code, Visual Chat, Image Generation, Interleaved Text/Image Generation, and Safety [7]. Each category contributes to the model's ability to understand and generate content across different modalities.\n\nFor instance, the Text category contains 1.6 million samples and 940.0 million tokens, which helps the model develop strong text generation capabilities. The Code category, though smaller, ensures that the model can handle programming-related tasks. The Visual Chat and Image Generation categories provide the model with the necessary exposure to visual content, enabling it to generate relevant images and engage in visual conversations. The Interleaved Text/Image Generation category, with 16.9 thousand samples and 35.8 million tokens, is particularly important for training the model to handle mixed-modal inputs and outputs, which is essential for tasks involving both text and images [7].\n\nThe Safety category, with 95.3 thousand samples and 38.6 million tokens, ensures that the model can recognize and respond appropriately to potentially unsafe or sensitive content. This is critical for maintaining the model's safety and reliability during inference.\n\nMoreover, the dataset's statistics highlight the importance of balancing modalities during the SFT stage. A severe imbalance between modalities can lead to the model learning an unconditional prior of generating a specific modality, which can either mute or over-exaggerate the generation of a single modality [5].

They are transformed through the decoder's multi-head self-attention and encoder-decoder attention mechanisms, allowing the model to reason about the relationships between objects and the global image context. This process enables the model to produce a set of predicted class labels and bounding boxes in parallel.\n\nAccording to the text quotes, the transformer decoder uses $N$ object queries, which are embeddings of size $d$, and transforms them using multi-headed self-attention and encoder-decoder attention mechanisms [5]. The object queries are different from each other to ensure that the decoder produces distinct outputs. These queries are then decoded into box coordinates and class labels by a feed forward network, resulting in $N$ final predictions [5].\n\nAdditionally, the image quote describing image3 provides a visual representation of how the DETR model works. It shows that the decoder uses a set of small fixed number of learned positional embeddings known as object queries. The decoder attends to the output of the transformer encoder to refine its predictions [3]. The image also illustrates the prediction heads, which for each output embedding of the decoder, predict either the class and bounding box of a detected object or classify it as \"no object\" [3].\n\n![The DETR model uses a set of learned positional embeddings called object queries in its transformer decoder to generate predictions for objects in an image.](image3)"}

The diagonal of the table is shaded, possibly indicating self-interaction or accuracy, while the off-diagonal values might represent misclassifications or interactions between different entity types.\n\nGiven the information from quote [6], the entity categories that showed the greatest improvement due to CorefProp are GPE/PER and PER/ORG. These categories involve pronouns and their references, which are often challenging in entity recognition tasks. The addition of CorefProp helps reduce the confusion between these categories, leading to a positive difference in their confusion matrix counts.\n\n![The table shows interactions between different Named Entity Recognition (NER) categories, including GPE, PER, and ORG, which are affected by CorefProp.](image3)"}

According to the text quotes, when repetition control is introduced, question-asking is reduced.

This reduction is attributed to the weighted decoding feature \"extrep bigram,\" which discourages bigrams that have appeared in previous utterances, thereby preventing the model from producing common question-related bigrams like \"do you\" and \"what is.\" To address this issue, an extra setting $z = 10$ (boost) was introduced, allowing the model to produce necessary question-asking bigrams while slightly increasing external bigram repetition.\n\n![The image shows a line graph illustrating how different methods control the frequency of question-asking in generated text.](image4)\n\nIn addition, the text quotes highlight that controlling for repetition leads to improvements across all aspects of conversational quality.

This process continues for a specified number of iterations or until a certain threshold is met [5]. It is designed to refine the generated output by repeatedly fetching new information based on the current state of the response.\n\nRecursive retrieval, on the other hand, gradually refines the user query and divides complex problems into sub-problems. This approach continuously solves complex tasks through retrieval and generation, utilizing query transformation and decomposition [5]. The process is more about breaking down the problem into manageable parts and solving them iteratively, which can lead to more accurate and comprehensive results.\n\nAdaptive retrieval enables the RAG system to decide when external knowledge retrieval is necessary. It allows the system to autonomously determine when to stop retrieval and generation, using special tokens to manage the process [5]. This method is particularly useful in scenarios where the system needs to balance between retrieving additional information and generating a response efficiently.\n\nEach of these retrieval processes plays a crucial role in enhancing the performance and flexibility of RAG systems. The choice of which process to use depends on the specific requirements of the task, such as the complexity of the query, the need for precision, and the efficiency of the system.\n\n![The image illustrates three types of retrieval augmentation processes for a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system: Iterative, Recursive, and Adaptive retrieval.](image5)\n\nIn summary, the key differences lie in how each process handles the retrieval and generation steps, with Iterative focusing on repeated refinement, Recursive on problem decomposition, and Adaptive on dynamic decision-making."}

While the exact details of Table 5 are not directly described in the text quotes, we can infer from related evidence that the \"RetrieveNRef\" model was compared against other models and showed a higher win rate.\n\nIn particular, quote [4] mentions that \"RetrieveNReﬁne obtains statistically signiﬁcant wins over the retriever Memory Network model and the generator Seq2Seq model using a binomial two-tailed test, with win rate ∼54%.\" This suggests that the RetrieveNRef model outperformed both the Memory Network and the Seq2Seq models, with a win rate of approximately 54%. Additionally, quote [6] notes that \"we also computed a small sample of A/B tests directly against humans rather than models, and again see the win rate is higher for RetNRef,\" indicating that RetNRef performed better than humans as well.\n\nAlthough the specific data from Table 5 is not provided, it is reasonable to conclude that the model pair with the highest win rate was likely **RetrieveNRef versus the Memory Network or Seq2Seq models**, given the consistent mention of its strong performance across multiple comparisons.\n\n![The table presents the results of several comparative evaluations between different methods or models.](image5)"}

For instance, in the context of the H OTPOT QA dataset, single-paragraph BERT achieves an F1 score of 67.08 in the distractor setting, which is comparable to state-of-the-art models [1]. This suggests that the majority of questions can be answered using a single-hop model when the distractors are carefully selected. However, when the model is tested on adversarial distractors, its accuracy drops to 46.84 F1, indicating that the quality and selection of distractors play a crucial role in model performance [4].\n\nThe introduction of gold paragraphs further highlights this point. In the open-domain setting, where the model struggles due to the insufficiencies of standard TF-IDF retrieval, the inclusion of additional gold paragraphs significantly improves the F1 score from 39.12 to 53.12 [10]. This demonstrates that gold paragraphs provide critical information that enhances the model's ability to answer questions accurately.\n\nMoreover, the impact of distractors on model performance is also evident in the comparison of different evaluation settings. The \"Distractor\" setting yields the highest F1 score of 67.08, while the \"Open-domain 500 Paragraphs\" setting results in a lower score of 39.12. However, adding a \"Gold Paragraph\" to the open-domain setting boosts the F1 score to 53.12, emphasizing the importance of high-quality gold paragraphs in improving model performance [5].\n\nThe table below illustrates the performance of various models under different settings, including the \"Distractor\" and \"Open\" settings. It shows that models like DFGN + BERT and DecompRC achieve higher F1 scores in the \"Distractor\" setting compared to the \"Open\" setting, further supporting the notion that the inclusion of gold paragraphs and well-chosen distractors can significantly enhance model performance [3].\n\n![The table presents F1 scores for different models under two evaluation settings: \"Distractor\" and \"Open.\"](image3)\n\nIn addition, the table in image4 provides insights into the performance of different question types. For example, single-hop questions achieve an F1 score of 70.54, which is significantly higher than the scores for multi-hop and context-dependent questions. This suggests that the complexity of the question type also influences the model's performance, with simpler questions generally leading to better results [4].\n\n![The table contains four columns with the following headers: \"Type,\" \"Question,\" \"%,\" and \"F1.\"](image4)\n\nThe implications of these findings for model performance are clear. The inclusion of gold paragraphs and the careful selection of distractors are essential for improving the accuracy of multi-hop question answering models. While single-hop models can perform well in the presence of well-chosen distractors, they struggle in open-domain settings where the retrieval of gold paragraphs is challenging. Therefore, future research should focus on developing improved methods for collecting and selecting distractors, as well as enhancing retrieval systems to better identify gold paragraphs in complex, multi-hop scenarios.\n\nIn conclusion, the inclusion of gold paragraphs and the careful selection of distractors have a significant impact on the F1 scores of multi-hop question answering models, highlighting the importance of these elements in improving model performance."}

The results show that COMET frequently produces novel commonsense knowledge that human evaluators deem to be correct [10]. Additionally, it is noted that COMET achieves up to 91.7% precision on ConceptNet, which is close to human performance [7]. This indicates that COMET is highly effective in generating high-quality ConceptNet tuples.\n\nIn terms of specific metrics, the text quotes mention that COMET achieved a 51% relative improvement over the top-performing model of Sap et al. (2019) in BLEU-2 results [3], and it also produced more novel tuple objects than the baselines [4]. Furthermore, the low perplexity scores and high classifier scores indicate that the model is confident in its predictions and that the generated tuples are largely correct [8].\n\nLooking at the image quotes, image1 provides a comparison of different models based on various metrics related to event understanding.

For instance, it is noted that for sentiment analysis tasks, both CNN and LSTM compositional functions perform better than SWEM, suggesting that word-order information may be required for analyzing sentiment orientations [2]. This finding aligns with previous research by Pang et al. (2002), which hypothesizes that the positional information of a word in text sequences may be beneficial to predict sentiment. The example given illustrates that phrases like \"not really good\" and \"really not good\" convey different levels of negative sentiment, highlighting the importance of word order.\n\nFurthermore, the performance of LSTM on the Yelp dataset with a shuffled training set is very close to the results achieved with SWEM, indicating that the main difference between LSTM and SWEM may be due to the ability of the former to capture word-order features [1].

Without repetition control, the model is capable of achieving a near 100% question-asking rate when z is set to 10.

This reduction is attributed to the weighted decoding feature \"extrep bigram,\" which discourages the use of bigrams that have appeared in previous utterances. This feature prevents the model from generating common question-related bigrams such as \"do you\" and \"what is.\" To mitigate this issue, an additional setting, z = 10 (boost), was introduced.

In terms of **breadth**, MMMU covers 30 subjects across six disciplines, including Art, Business, Health & Medicine, Science, Humanities & Social Science, and Tech & Engineering, with over 183 subfields [2]. This is a significant expansion compared to other benchmarks, which are often limited to daily knowledge and common sense [5]. The image quote [image3] illustrates this by showing that MMMU excels in breadth compared to benchmarks like VQA, GQA, and VisWiz. Additionally, MMMU includes a wide variety of image formats, such as diagrams, tables, charts, chemical structures, photos, paintings, medical images, and more, which tests the perceptual capabilities of LMMs [image1].\n\nIn terms of **depth**, MMMU requires expert-level reasoning, where models must apply domain-specific knowledge and perform step-by-step reasoning to solve complex problems. This is a marked difference from other benchmarks, which typically focus on basic perception abilities or simple reasoning tasks [4]. The image quote [image3] also highlights that MMMU excels in depth, particularly in requiring deliberate reasoning with college-level subject knowledge. For instance, questions may require applying concepts like \"Fourier Transform\" or \"Equilibrium Theory\" to derive solutions [10]. The inclusion of interleaved text and image inputs further increases the complexity, as models must jointly understand both modalities, often requiring deep subject knowledge and complex reasoning [image1].\n\nThe implications of these characteristics are significant for the evaluation of LMMs. By focusing on expert-level skills, MMMU provides a more rigorous test of a model's ability to perceive, understand, and reason across multiple modalities. This makes it particularly useful for assessing how well LMMs can handle real-world, college-level tasks that require both visual and textual understanding. The benchmark's design ensures that models are not just tested on basic perception but are challenged to demonstrate advanced reasoning and knowledge application.\n\n![The MMMU benchmark excels in both breadth and depth, covering 30 subjects across six disciplines and requiring expert-level reasoning and visual perception.](image3)"}

Based on the text quotes, we can infer that Figure 11 likely illustrates several key DNA repair pathways.\n\nFrom the text quote [8], it is stated that \"Nuclear DNA repair mechanisms comprise many approaches to repair mutations of DNA. These approaches include different pathways and sub-pathways according to the type, site and extent of the mutation-induced damage and also according to the stage of cell cycle affected by the mutation. They include: base excision repair (BER), nucleotide excision repair (NER), direct reversal repair, mismatch repair, transcription-coupled repair (TCR) and recombination repair ( Fig. 11 ).\" This clearly lists the repair mechanisms that are likely depicted in Figure 11.\n\nAdditionally, other quotes provide more detailed descriptions of these mechanisms. For example, quote [5] discusses **base excision repair (BER)**, which is used for single-strand point mutations. Quote [4] describes **nucleotide excision repair (NER)**, which is responsible for removing bulky DNA lesions such as UV-induced pyrimidine dimers. Quote [6] explains **mismatch repair (MMR)**, which corrects mismatched or unpaired bases resulting from replication errors. Quote [9] covers **direct reversal repair**, which directly repairs specific types of damage like UV-induced pyrimidine dimers. Lastly, quote [10] details **recombination repair**, which is primarily used to repair double-strand breaks.\n\nWhile no image quote explicitly references Figure 11, the description of **image3** provides a visual representation of DNA repair mechanisms in response to various damaging agents. The image shows how different types of DNA damage—such as 8-oxoguanine, single-strand breaks, pyrimidine dimers, and double-strand breaks—are addressed by corresponding repair processes like BER, MMR, NER, and recombinational repair. This aligns with the repair mechanisms listed in quote [8].\n\n![The image illustrates various DNA repair mechanisms in response to different types of damaging agents.](image3)\n\nIn conclusion, Figure 11 demonstrates DNA repair mechanisms including base excision repair (BER), nucleotide excision repair (NER), mismatch repair (MMR), direct reversal repair, transcription-coupled repair (TCR), and recombination repair."}

Traditional metrics like BLEU and METEOR rely on $n$-gram matching and are widely used due to their efficiency [4]. However, newer embedding-based metrics such as BERTScore and BLEURT aim to capture semantic similarity more effectively [1]. Additionally, the COMET framework introduces models like COMET-HTER, COMET-MQM, and COMET-RANK, which are designed to predict human judgments such as Direct Assessments (DA) and Human-mediated Translation Edit Rate (HTER) [6].\n\nIn particular, Table 2 from the text quotes highlights the performance of different metrics for language pairs where English is the target. It shows that the DA RR model outperforms the recently proposed English-specific BLEURT metric in five out of seven language pairs [7]. Furthermore, the COMET framework's models, including COMET-RANK, consistently outperform other metrics, often by significant margins [8].\n\nLooking at the image quotes, image1 presents a table with evaluation metrics for machine translation systems across various language pairs. The table includes metrics such as BLEU, chrF, YiSi-1, BERTScore, BLEURT, and COMET variants. For example, the highest score for kk-en (Kazakh-English) is 0.440 with the YiSi-1 metric. However, this does not necessarily indicate consistent performance across all language pairs.\n\nImage2 and image3 show line graphs illustrating the Kendall Tau scores for different metrics across various top MT systems for specific language pairs.

This process is illustrated in image5, which shows the Problem Formulator generating a symbolic representation of the input problem using language processing models (LLMs) through a technique called in-context learning.

This hierarchical structure allows for soft clustering, where nodes can belong to multiple clusters without requiring a fixed number of clusters [1].\n\nIn the context of RAPTOR's soft clustering, nodes that appear in more than one cluster would likely be represented in a way that highlights their multi-cluster membership. However, the specific colors of such nodes are not mentioned in the text quotes. Based on the description of the image, it is possible that these nodes are highlighted in a distinct color to indicate their dual membership. For example, if the image uses different colors to represent different clusters, nodes that belong to multiple clusters might be shown in a color that combines or contrasts with the colors of the individual clusters.\n\n![The image illustrates the tree construction process used by RAPTOR to cluster and summarize text.](image3)\n\nIn conclusion, while the specific colors of nodes that appear in more than one cluster are not explicitly mentioned in the text quotes, the image suggests that such nodes would be visually distinguished to reflect their multi-cluster membership."}

The score is averaged across all the turns in the evaluation set\" [2]. This gives us a clear understanding of what joint accuracy means in this context.\n\nLooking at the image quotes, specifically image4, we can see a table that presents a comparison of different models based on their joint accuracy.

Instead, they reference other models and their associated costs.\n\nFrom the text quotes, we know that the cost of training models can vary significantly depending on the resources required. For instance, it is mentioned that training a single model may be relatively inexpensive, but the cost of tuning a model for a new dataset or performing full R&D quickly becomes extremely expensive [4]. Additionally, the cost of using on-demand cloud GPUs is highlighted as being higher than investing in centralized resources [3].\n\nIn terms of specific costs, one quote mentions that training BERT on GPU is roughly equivalent to a trans-American flight in terms of carbon emissions [6]. Another quote provides an estimate of the cost of training a model with 58 GPUs for 172 days, which would cost approximately $145,000 USD plus electricity [3].\n\nWhile the exact range of cloud compute costs for training the GPT-2 model is not directly provided in the text quotes, we can infer that the costs are likely to be substantial given the context of other models mentioned.

For example, in [5], it is mentioned that DS-DST and DS-Picklist significantly reduce errors for slots like *attraction-type*, *hotel-internet*, and *hotel-parking*. However, the text also highlights that certain time-related slots, such as *taxi-leave at* and *train-arrive by*, are span-based and do not perform well with DS-Span because they lack direct span matching in the dialogue context.\n\nLooking at the image quotes, image2 provides a table that compares the performance of DS-Span, DS-DST, and DS-Picklist across different slot types.

Additionally, it is mentioned that 97.52% of the questions include images [4].\n\nRegarding the format of the questions, it is stated that 94.03% of the questions are multiple-choice [4].

(2017), Sanh et al. (2019), Luan et al. (2018a), and Kulkarni et al. (2018) [2]. The paper also highlights that D Y GIE achieves relative improvements of $5.7\\%$ and $9.9\\%$ over the state of the art on the ACE05 entity and relation extraction tasks, and an $11.3\\%$ relative improvement on the ACE05 overlapping entity extraction task [6]. Furthermore, it is noted that D Y GIE significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art on joint entity and relation detection tasks across four datasets: ACE 2004, ACE 2005, SciERC, and the Wet Lab Protocol Corpus [7].\n\nLooking at the image quotes, image1 shows a table with Entity F1 scores for different systems on ACE04-O, ACE05-O, and GENIA. The results indicate that DyGIE achieves the highest Entity F1 scores on all three datasets [image1]. Specifically, DyGIE has Entity F1 scores of 84.7 on ACE04-O, 82.9 on ACE05-O, and 76.2 on GENIA, which are higher than those of Katiyar and Cardie (2018) and Wang and Lu (2018). \n\nImage2 presents performance metrics for different models on entity recognition and relation extraction tasks. It shows that DyGIE achieves the highest F1 score for entities (68.2) and a high F1 score for relations (42.0). However, it is also noted that DyGIE without CorefProp achieves the highest F1 score for relations (41.2) [image2]. \n\nImage4 provides a table with performance metrics for various systems on different datasets, including ACE04, ACE05, SciERC, and WLPC. The results show that DyGIE achieves the highest performance scores in both entity and relation categories across all datasets. For example, on ACE04, DyGIE has an Entity score of 87.4 and a Relation score of 59.7, which are the highest among the systems listed [image4]. On ACE05, DyGIE has an Entity score of 88.4 and a Relation score of 63.2, again the highest among the systems listed. On SciERC, DyGIE has an Entity score of 65.2 and a Relation score of 41.6, which are the highest. On WLPC, DyGIE has an Entity score of 79.5 and a Relation score of 64.1, which are also the highest.\n\nImage5 provides another table with performance metrics for different models on entity and relation extraction tasks. It shows that DyGIE has the highest F1 score for entities (87.1) and a high F1 score for relations (58.4). However, it is also noted that DyGIE without Coreference Propagation (−CorefProp) scores best for relations (60.2) [image5].\n\nBased on the evidence from both the text and image quotes, it is clear that the DyGIE system achieved the best performance in entity and relation metrics across all datasets.\n\n![DyGIE achieved the highest performance in entity and relation metrics across all datasets.](image4)"}

According to quote [3], when R-GCN is removed (GloVe w/o R-GCN in Table 3), there is a significant drop in performance, with an 8.0-point decrease. This indicates that the R-GCN component plays a crucial role in improving the model's accuracy by updating mention representations based on their relations to other mentions.\n\nFurthermore, quote [5] discusses the effect of removing relation types and shows that even with a naive entity graph, the performance does not improve much compared to ELMo alone (No R-GCN in Table 3). This suggests that the R-GCN component is essential for leveraging the structure of the graph effectively.\n\nIn the context of masked settings, quote [2] highlights that WIKIPHOP genuinely requires multihop inference, as the best model is 8.4% more accurate than a local model in the masked setting. This further emphasizes the importance of R-GCN in handling complex dependencies, especially in scenarios where the coreference system might not perform optimally due to masking.\n\nThe table in image3 provides concrete data on the performance of different configurations. For instance, the \"No R-GCN\" row shows performance of 62.4 (unmasked) and 63.2 (masked), which is lower than the \"full (ensemble)\" configuration with 68.5 (unmasked) and 71.6 (masked).

This is mentioned in quote [10], which states: \"D1 has much more neutral examples in the training set.\" This suggests that the classifier can benefit from more neutral examples, making it easier to predict neutral instances on D1. However, for D3 and D4, the number of neutral examples in the test sets is very small, as noted in quote [2]: \"The numbers of neutral examples in the test sets of D3 and D4 are very small.\" This scarcity of neutral examples makes it harder to achieve high precision and recall for the neutral class on these datasets.\n\nAdditionally, quote [4] highlights that \"unbalanced label distribution\" is a challenge, especially for D3 and D4. The lack of balanced examples, particularly for neutral classes, makes it difficult for models to learn the necessary features for accurate classification. Quote [6] further supports this by explaining that the label distribution is extremely unbalanced on D3 and D4, and that transfer of the embedding layer is more helpful in such cases because sentiment information is not adequately captured by GloVe word embeddings.\n\nThe image quotes also provide visual evidence of the differences in neutral example distribution. Image2 shows the breakdown of positive (Pos), negative (Neg), and neutral (Neu) entries for each dataset.

This step ensures that the MLLMs can effectively process the relevant parts of the image. Additionally, a blurring technique is applied to non-target areas surrounding the objects of interest, directing the MLLMs' focus toward the relevant objects and facilitating their identification in object detection tasks [4].\n\nThe diagram in image2 further illustrates this process. It shows an image with multiple bounding boxes highlighting different objects, such as flowers and a vase. These objects are cropped and resized to create individual embeddings using an Image Encoder [2].

To answer this, we need to examine the training process and how the discriminator's accuracy changes over time for this specific relation type.\n\nFrom the text quotes, we learn that during the adversarial training process, the generator gradually improves its ability to generate true positive samples, which in turn causes the discriminator's accuracy on $N^{D}$ to decrease [3]. This decline is a key indicator that the generator is becoming more effective at challenging the discriminator. The critical point of decline occurs when the generator has become robust enough to significantly impact the discriminator's performance.\n\nIn particular, quote [3] states: \"It is because that the chance we give the generator to challenge the discriminator is just one time scanning of the noisy dataset; this critical point is yielded when the generator has already been robust enough. Thus, we stop the training process when the model reaches this critical point.\" This implies that the critical point of decline is reached when the generator has learned to generate high-quality true positive samples, making it difficult for the discriminator to maintain its accuracy.\n\nLooking at image3, which displays the performance change of the discriminator on $N^{D}$ during the training process, we can observe the accuracy trends for different relation types. For the relation type `/people/person/place_lived`, the red curve with square markers shows a steep decline in accuracy as the number of epochs increases. The accuracy starts near 1 and decreases more steeply compared to other relation types, stabilizing slightly below 0.75.

In 2011, researchers began exploring the \"Google Ngrams corpus,\" which became a pivotal resource for studying language change on a large scale [9]. The year 2012 saw work on \"Word epoch disambiguation,\" aiming to distinguish different meanings of words across time [10]. By 2013, advancements in \"Prediction-based models\" emerged, offering new ways to analyze semantic shifts [7]. The use of \"Word embeddings,\" exemplified by \"word2vec,\" gained traction in 2014, providing dense representations of word meanings [7]. In 2015, the development of \"Models alignment\" allowed for better comparison of word vectors across different time periods [10]. The analysis using the \"NYT corpus\" and \"COHA corpus\" in 2016 highlighted the importance of diverse datasets in capturing semantic changes [10]. Finally, in 2017, insights into \"Laws of semantic change\" and \"Local measures better for cultural shifts\" were noted, along with the use of the \"Gigaword corpus\" and \"Diachronic relations\" [10].

Basic perceptual errors occur when the model fails in elementary visual interpretation, such as misjudging the sequence described as “from left to right, top to bottom.” Domain-specific perceptual errors, on the other hand, arise due to a lack of specialized knowledge. For example, in Figure 7, the model struggles with basic visual interpretation, while in other cases, it lacks the necessary domain-specific knowledge to interpret visual elements correctly [6].\n\n2. **Lack of Knowledge (29%)**: This is the second most common type of error, primarily responsible for domain-specific perceptual errors. The model often lacks the specialized knowledge required to interpret visual content within specific contexts. For instance, in a Computer Science example, the model identifies visual elements like double circles but fails to recognize their representation of an \"accept state\" in Deterministic Finite Automata. Similarly, in medical contexts, the model's lack of knowledge leads to flawed reasoning [10].\n\n3. **Reasoning Error (26%)**: While not as frequent as perceptual errors or lack of knowledge, reasoning errors still constitute a significant portion of the issues. These errors occur when the model's initial interpretation is correct, but its subsequent reasoning leads to an incorrect conclusion. For example, in some cases, the model may have the right reasoning but misidentify the illustrations' order, leading to an incorrect final answer [1].\n\n![The pie chart shows the distribution of different types of errors among 150 annotated GPT-4V errors, with Perceptual Error at 35%, Lack of Knowledge at 29%, and Reasoning Error at 26%.](image3)\n\nIn summary, the top-3 error types over 150 annotated GPT-4V errors are Perceptual Errors, Lack of Knowledge, and Reasoning Errors."}

Instead of going layer-by-layer, this method flattens the multi-layered tree into a single layer, essentially bringing all the nodes onto the same level for comparison [5]. On the other hand, the tree traversal method first selects the top-k most relevant root nodes based on their cosine similarity to the query embedding.

This table provides a detailed breakdown of how removing specific types of supervision—such as crowd-sourced data, head words, or entity linking (EL)—impacts the model's ability to predict ultra-fine grained types.\n\nFrom the text quotes, we learn that \"All sources of supervision appear to be useful, with crowdsourced examples making the biggest impact. Head word supervision is particularly helpful for predicting ultra-ﬁne labels, while entity linking improves ﬁne label prediction\" [9]. This suggests that each data source contributes uniquely to the model's performance, and their removal can lead to a decline in accuracy for ultra-fine categories.\n\nLooking at the image quote for image1, the table presents performance metrics across different datasets, including the Ultra-Fine category. The table shows that when the crowd-sourced data is excluded (\"– Crowd\"), the performance on Ultra-Fine labels decreases. Similarly, excluding head words (\"– Head\") also leads to a drop in performance, highlighting the importance of these data sources for ultra-fine grained predictions. The same pattern is observed when entity linking data is removed (\"– EL\"), although the impact may vary depending on the specific metric being considered.\n\n![The table presents performance metrics across different datasets, including the Ultra-Fine category.](image1)\n\nAdditionally, image2 provides a comparison of two models, \"AttentiveNER\" and \"Our Model,\" across development and test datasets. While this table does not specifically focus on the Ultra-Fine category, it shows that \"Our Model\" achieves higher Recall and F1 scores compared to \"AttentiveNER,\" indicating better performance on more challenging categories like Ultra-Fine. The MRR scores are slightly better for \"Our Model,\" suggesting that it is more effective at ranking correct types above incorrect ones.\n\n![The table compares the performance of two models, \"AttentiveNER\" and \"Our Model,\" across development and test datasets.](image2)\n\nIn summary, the exclusion of different data sources—especially crowd-sourced data and head words—leads to a noticeable decline in the model's performance on the Ultra-Fine category, as supported by both the text quotes and the visual data presented in the tables."}

For instance, one quote states, \"With offices in 155 countries and more than 284,000 people, we're among the leading professional services networks in the world\"[9]. This reflects the overall scale of PwC's operations, which would include the Assurance division.\n\nIn contrast, the Consulting division is highlighted as having a strong regional focus, particularly in the Middle East. One quote mentions, \"PwC has built a team of infrastructure, real estate and capital projects experts, located in the Middle East, who are able to help clients resolve issues and deploy global best practice at all stages in the life cycle of major projects and programmes\"[2]. This indicates that while Consulting operates globally, it has a significant local presence in specific regions like the Middle East.\n\nRegarding employee count and office distribution, the image quotes provide some insights. For example, **image1** shows an office setting with the following details: \"Offices: 12,\" \"Employees: 1816,\" and \"Countries: 9\" [image1]. Another image, **image3**, also displays similar numbers: \"Offices 12\" in a yellow block, \"Countries 9\" in a red block, and \"Employees 1816\" in a black block [image3]. These figures suggest a substantial presence in the region, though they may not specifically refer to the Consulting division.\n\nOn the other hand, **image2** highlights \"Offices 9,\" \"Employees 500,\" and \"Countries 7\" [image2], which could represent a smaller or more specialized team within PwC. Similarly, **image4** shows \"20 Offices,\" \"1914 Employees,\" and \"12 Countries\" [image4], indicating a larger operational footprint in another area. These variations in numbers across different images suggest that PwC's divisions may have differing scales of operation depending on the region and focus.\n\nFinally, **image5** provides data about an organization with \"500 employees,\" \"9 offices,\" and \"7 countries\" [image5], which could reflect a specific team or branch within PwC. While these images do not directly compare Assurance and Consulting, they illustrate the diversity of PwC's operations.\n\n![The image shows three people working together, possibly in an office setting.

The employee counts and office distributions vary across different images, reflecting the diverse nature of PwC's operations."}

However, none of the provided text quotes directly mention the use of year 3 students as cover page models. Let’s analyze the information given to see if any clues can be inferred.\n\nFrom the text quotes, we learn that NTU has several academic institutions, such as the College of Engineering [1], the School of Social Sciences (SSM) [3], the National Institute of Education (NIE) [4], and the Nanyang Business School (NBS) [9]. These institutions offer a variety of programs, including engineering, business, and education. Some of these programs are designed for full-time undergraduate study, with specific durations and curricula [3][7].

However, there is no explicit mention of using year 3 students as cover page models.\n\nLooking at the image quotes, we find descriptions of icons that may represent different aspects of education, progress, and communication. For example, image1 shows a flag and a graph with a rising line and bar chart, suggesting themes of progress or achievement [image1]. Image2 highlights an institution ranked 11th in the QS World University Rankings for Education and mentions over 70 years of experience in teacher preparation [image2].

This division also includes infrastructure, real estate, and capital projects experts who provide global best practices across major projects [2]. Additionally, the Health division emphasizes a transformative approach in the Middle East, leveraging global expertise and local presence [5]. These descriptions suggest that the Consulting division has a broad global footprint, supported by a large team of professionals.\n\nIn contrast, the Deals division, as outlined in the text quotes, is focused on supporting private equity firms, investment funds, and corporate clients through mergers, acquisitions, and disposals [3]. It provides services such as commercial/operational due diligence, business planning, and post-deal operations support [6]. The Deals division also offers a graduate program called Edge, which aims to launch careers in an international Deals environment [4]. While the text does not explicitly mention the global reach or employee size of the Deals division, it implies a strong focus on specialized financial advisory services and deal execution.\n\nLooking at the image quotes, we can gather some insights into the scale of PwC's operations. Image1 and image2 both show data points indicating 12 offices, 1816 employees, and 9 countries [image1, image2]. These figures likely represent the broader PwC organization, but they give us a sense of the scale at which the firm operates globally. Other images, such as image3 and image4, show different numbers: 500 employees, 7 countries, and 9 offices [image3, image4]. These variations may reflect different regions or departments within PwC. Image5 shows 17 offices, 11 countries, and 870 employees [image5], further highlighting the diversity in operational scales across different parts of the organization.\n\nBased on the evidence, the Consulting division appears to have a broader global reach and larger employee base compared to the Deals division. The Consulting division's work spans multiple sectors, including digital transformation, infrastructure, real estate, and healthcare, suggesting a more extensive network of operations.

The museum's setting and exhibits reflect the rich maritime and commercial history of Bergen during the medieval period.\n\nAnother significant institution is the Haakon’s Hall, which stands as a 13th-century royal banqueting hall and is the first of its kind built in stone. It was the largest and most imposing building of the royal residency in Bergen and is now a living national cultural heritage site [6]. This hall offers a tangible connection to the medieval past, allowing visitors to imagine the life of royalty in the Middle Ages.\n\nThe Osterøy Museum, located in a beautiful setting on the island of Osterøy, showcases how people lived in the countryside outside Bergen. Through storytelling and experiences, the museum links objects with the living cultural heritage of textiles, costumes, weaving, and local building customs [4]. This museum highlights the traditional way of life and the cultural practices of the region.\n\nThe Salhus Tricotagefabrik, a listed textile factory dating from 1859, offers insights into the textile industry in Western Norway. Visitors can learn about how wool is turned into clothes, providing a unique perspective on the industrial history of the area [5].\n\nAdditionally, KODE Art Museums of Bergen house Norway’s second-largest art collection, featuring works from the 15th century up to the present. These museums include the works of renowned artists such as Munch, Dahl, Klee, and Picasso, and they also offer a dedicated KunstLab section for children [7]. This blend of historical and contemporary art makes KODE a significant cultural hub.\n\nThe Bergen’s oldest Latin School, dating back to 1706, has exhibitions about the Norwegian school system and Norwegian society from the Middle Ages to the present. It also features a thematic exhibition of old natural science posters, offering a glimpse into educational history [8].\n\nA small island with its own museum, Herdla, situated in the archipelago west of Bergen, has exhibitions about its dramatic role in World War II and its rich fauna and birdlife. The main attraction is a German fighter aircraft from WWII, making it a unique site for historical exploration [9].\n\nThe image quotes further illustrate the historical and cultural significance of these museums. For instance, image1 shows a scene set against a vintage-style house, with three children sitting on railings by a staircase while a man and woman, both dressed in old-fashioned clothing, are standing on the ground. The woman is wearing a brown dress and the man is dressed in a black coat with brown pants. The children appear to be smiling and are enjoying their interaction in the scene.

This image captures the essence of a historical setting, possibly reflecting the atmosphere found in some of Bergen's museums.\n\nImage2 depicts traditional Nordic-style wooden houses with grass roofs, which likely have historical or cultural significance, as grass roofs are a traditional feature in some Scandinavian countries. The setting appears to be rural, with some greenery visible around the buildings [image2]. This image reflects the traditional architecture that can be found in museums like the Old Bergen Museum, where original wooden buildings are preserved.\n\nImage5 shows a stone building with a stepped gable roof on a sunny day. There is a lawn with some trees in front of the building, and the sun is visible in the sky, casting shadows on the ground. The architecture of the building suggests it could have historical significance, possibly a church, castle, or other historic structure [image5].

To answer this, we need to analyze the relevant text and image quotes.\n\nFrom the text quotes, we find that CA19 is listed as \"East Los Angeles - CA19\" [8]. This indicates that CA19 refers specifically to the East Los Angeles area. On the other hand, the phrase \"Covina and West Covina\" appears in the same text quote, where it is labeled as \"23.

These values are crucial for ensuring proper signal interpretation by the microcontroller. Similarly, the **output low voltage (VOL)** and **output high voltage (VOH)** specify the voltage levels that the microcontroller outputs when it is in a low or high state, respectively. These parameters ensure compatibility with other digital circuits.\n\nIn addition to these, the **logical input current (IIL)** for the 8751H is specified, which refers to the current drawn by the input pins when they are at a logic low level. This is important for understanding the power consumption and signal integrity of the microcontroller.\n\nComparing the 8751H with other models like the **8751BH** and **8752BH**, we find that the voltage specifications may vary slightly. For instance, the 8751BH and 8752BH have different maximum and minimum voltage ranges, which could affect their operational conditions and compatibility with external components. The 8751H also has unique specifications for certain parameters, such as the **input leakage current (I_LL)** for Port 0, which is higher for the 8751H compared to other models. This indicates that the 8751H may require more careful design considerations to avoid issues related to leakage currents.\n\nFurthermore, the **power supply current (I_CC)** for the 8751H is higher than that of the 8751BH and 8752BH, suggesting that the 8751H may consume more power under similar operating conditions.

A comprehensive training plan for 2012 was developed based on needs and gaps identified by NAMRU-3 laboratory assessments [7]. This plan included nine modules covering topics such as parasitology, bacteriology, bioscience facility management, clinical epidemiology, biomedical equipment repair, laboratory quality management system, serology, molecular biology, and virology [7].\n\nAdditionally, NAMRU-3 conducted several workshops to train laboratory and administrative staff on proper laboratory procedures, inventory management, quality control procedures, standard operating procedures, supply procurement, and the development of national laboratory biosafety and quality control plans [9]. The training materials were tailored to the Afghan context, taking into account cultural practices [10].\n\nNAMRU-3 also hosted nine Afghan trainees from the Central Public Health Laboratory in Kabul for a bacteriology training workshop [1]. Furthermore, the unit focused on the Ministry of Public Health (MoPH) and the Afghan Public Health Institute, assessing the capacity and capability of laboratories, staff, and support facilities. This initial engagement started with the Central Public Health Laboratory (CPHL) in Kabul and later expanded to other facilities in Kabul with plans for regional expansion [3].\n\nIn collaboration with the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) Cooperative Biological Engagement Program (CBEP), NAMRU-3 enhanced the efficiency and synergy in U.S. government biodefense and disease surveillance efforts in Afghanistan [4].\n\n![The image shows a group of people, including U.S. Navy personnel in uniform and two individuals wearing \"Project HOPE\" shirts.

This is evident in their malaria vaccine research, which not only addresses the health needs of deployed military personnel but also has significant implications for global public health. For instance, one notable collaboration involves Lt. R. Vince Gerbasi, who is using mass spectrometry to identify novel antigens for potential malaria vaccines [9]. This work aligns with the NMRC's broader mission of facilitating technology transfer and commercialization, ensuring that discoveries made in the laboratory can be translated into practical applications that benefit both the military and the general population [2].\n\n![The image illustrates the interaction between a CD8+ T cell and a liver cell during a malaria infection, highlighting the immune response aimed at eliminating the parasite.](image1)\n\nIn addition to malaria research, the Joint Combat Casualty Research Team (JC2RT) plays a crucial role in advancing medical care for combat injuries. The JC2RT team is embedded with medical assets throughout Afghanistan, focusing on pre-hospital and en route care, hemorrhage and acute care, traumatic brain injury, and prevention, resilience, and recovery [6]. Their work is essential in accelerating medical advances during wartime, which can later be applied to civilian healthcare systems. For example, the systematic recording, collection, validation, and analysis of data from combat injuries have led to significant improvements in trauma care, which can be adapted for use in civilian emergency medicine [8].\n\n![The image shows a group of military personnel in uniform posing in front of a helicopter with a red cross emblem.](image4)\n\nThe NMRC's approach to technology transfer and commercialization further underscores its commitment to bridging military and civilian healthcare. By establishing appropriate technology transfer agreements and leveraging partnerships with both public and private sectors, the NMRC ensures that biomedical developments are not only useful for the warfighter but also have the potential to benefit the broader population [3]. This is exemplified by the use of Cooperative Research and Development Agreements (CRADAs), which allow Navy biomedical scientists to collaborate with external entities to accelerate the development and commercialization of new technologies [10].\n\nFurthermore, the NMRC's collaborations extend beyond direct medical research. For example, Cmdr. Jonathan Forsberg is working with a company to explore a novel mode of anchoring prosthetics, which could have significant implications for amputees, both military and civilian [9]. Similarly, Lt. Roxanne Burrus is involved in a project with Duke University to evaluate the effects of changing demography and land use on malaria transmission, an issue that affects both deployed military personnel and populations in developing countries [9].\n\n![The image shows five individuals standing in a formal setting, including naval officers and other professionals.](image3)\n\nIn conclusion, the NMRC's efforts in developing and applying medical and technological innovations reflect a deep collaboration between military research and civilian healthcare advancements, as seen in their malaria vaccine research and the JC2RT team's work."}

According to the data provided, the conversion rate from MQLs to SALs is 1.50% [3]. This figure appears extremely low when compared to industry averages, which are typically much higher.\n\nIndustry benchmarks for this stage of the sales funnel suggest that the conversion rate from MQLs to SALs should be significantly higher than 1.50%. For example, image2 provides an overview of conversion rates at various stages of the sales funnel, including the MQL to SAL stage. While the exact industry average isn't specified in the description, it is generally accepted that the conversion rate from MQLs to SALs should fall within a range of 4-8% [2]. This implies that the 1.50% conversion rate observed in the data is well below the expected norm.\n\nThe disparity between the observed conversion rate and the industry average may indicate several issues. One possible explanation is that the leads being passed from marketing to sales are not sufficiently qualified or aligned with the sales team's criteria. This could result in a high number of MQLs that do not meet the sales team's standards for acceptance. Another factor could be a lack of effective communication or alignment between the marketing and sales teams, leading to misaligned expectations and poor follow-up on MQLs.\n\nAdditionally, the data presented in image3 shows that while the conversion rate from leads to MQLs is relatively strong at 52.07%, the subsequent conversion rate from MQLs to SALs is alarmingly low. This suggests that while marketing is successfully identifying interested prospects, there may be inefficiencies in how these leads are nurtured or handed off to sales. The low conversion rate could also point to a need for better lead scoring models or more targeted marketing efforts to ensure that only the most qualified leads are passed to the sales team.\n\nThe implications of this discrepancy are significant. A low conversion rate from MQLs to SALs can lead to wasted resources, as sales teams may spend time on leads that are not ready to move forward in the sales process. It can also result in missed opportunities, as potentially valuable leads may be overlooked or not pursued effectively. To address this issue, companies should consider refining their lead scoring models, improving communication between marketing and sales, and implementing more effective lead nurturing strategies.\n\n![The image shows a series of data metrics related to sales and marketing performance, including the conversion rates from Marketing Qualified Leads (MQLs) to Sales Accepted Leads (SALs).](image3)"}

This transformation begins with data collection and moves through reporting, analysis, action, and finally to realizing value.\n\nAccording to the text, the analytics value chain emphasizes pushing data through the entire chain—from collection, analysis, decisions, action, and finally to impact [6]. It highlights that merely reaching partway along the chain does not count; full implementation is necessary for real value creation. This aligns with the flowchart in image1, which illustrates the data-driven process: starting with \"Data\" as a blue cylinder, moving through \"Reporting\" with charts and graphs, then to \"Analysis\" with a magnifying glass over a chart, followed by \"Action\" depicted as a figure walking, and ending in \"Value\" shown as an upward-trending graph [1].\n\nThe levels of analytics also play a crucial role in this process. The image2 diagram shows a progression from Business Intelligence (BI) to Business Analytics, where BI includes stages like standard reports, ad-hoc reports, query drilldown, and alerts, while Business Analytics includes statistical analysis, forecasting, predictive modeling, and optimization [2]. This progression reflects increasing complexity and intelligence, with each stage contributing more value to the organization. For instance, while standard reports answer \"What happened?\" statistical analysis explores \"Why is this happening?\" and predictive modeling predicts \"What will happen next?\" This evolution supports the idea that higher levels of analytics lead to greater business value.\n\nFurthermore, the text emphasizes the importance of a data culture, strong data leadership, and analyst competency in ensuring that insights are not only generated but also acted upon [2][7]. The quote from Zynga underscores this point, stating that without action, even brilliant insights receive no credit [8]. This aligns with the concept of the analytics value chain, where the ultimate goal is to translate insights into tangible business outcomes.\n\nIn summary, the process of transforming data into business value progresses through the analytics value chain, which includes stages from data collection to impact, and is supported by evolving levels of analytics that increase in complexity and intelligence. This transformation is further enhanced by a strong data culture, effective leadership, and skilled analysts who can turn data into actionable insights.\n\n![The process of transforming data into value starts with data storage, moves through reporting and analysis, leads to action, and results in increased value.](image1)"}

One of the most significant events is the alignment of homologous chromosomes along the metaphase plate. This alignment ensures that each daughter cell will receive one member of each homologous pair. The homologous chromosomes, which have already undergone synapsis and crossing over during Prophase I, are now positioned so that their centromeres face opposite poles of the cell. This arrangement is crucial for the subsequent separation of homologous chromosomes during Anaphase I.\n\nThe mitotic spindle, composed of microtubules, plays a critical role in this process by attaching to the kinetochores of the chromosomes and pulling them into position [7]. In addition, the formation of tetrads—each consisting of four chromatids—allows for the exchange of genetic material between non-sister chromatids, further contributing to genetic variation [1].\n\n![Metaphase I involves the alignment of homologous chromosomes along the metaphase plate, with the mitotic spindle facilitating their movement.](image5)\n\nThis stage is also characterized by the presence of the nuclear envelope, which begins to break down as the cell progresses through meiosis [5]. The diagram in image5 illustrates these features, showing the alignment of homologous chromosomes and the involvement of the spindle apparatus. Overall, Metaphase I is a critical step in meiosis that sets the stage for the reduction of chromosome number and the generation of genetically diverse gametes."}

The plasma membrane grows inward at the midpoint to divide the cells.\" These three distinct actions—duplicating the chromosome, elongating the cell, and dividing the cell—can be interpreted as three main steps in the process.\n\nAdditionally, quote [10] refers to \"binary fission of a prokaryotic cell,\" which confirms the context of the question. Other quotes, such as [6] (\"Prokaryotic chromosome\") and [9] (\"Duplication of chromosome and separation of copies\"), support the idea that the process involves duplication and separation, but they do not explicitly outline the steps.\n\nNow, examining the image quotes, image5 provides a clear visual representation of the process. It shows a bacterial cell dividing into two daughter cells, with genetic material being duplicated and split evenly between them. This image illustrates the key stages of binary fission: DNA replication, cell elongation, and division. The diagram supports the textual description by visually depicting the same three steps mentioned in quote [5].\n\n![The image shows a biological diagram related to chromosomes. It includes an electron micrograph of a chromosome on the left, highlighting the centromere. To the right, there are illustrations of a chromosome with labeled parts. An arrow indicates the splitting of the chromosome with the label \"Chromosome distribution to daughter cells.\" This diagram appears to represent the process of chromosome segregation during cell division.](image3)\n\nAnother relevant image is image5, which directly depicts bacterial cell division through binary fission. It shows a single bacterial cell dividing into two daughter cells, with genetic material being duplicated and split evenly between them. This image reinforces the idea that the process involves multiple stages, including DNA replication, cell elongation, and division.\n\n![The image illustrates bacterial cell division, specifically binary fission.

According to Mendel's experiments, when two homozygous parents with contrasting traits are crossed, the F1 generation is uniform, displaying only the dominant trait. However, in the F2 generation, the recessive trait reappears, resulting in a predictable ratio [5].\n\nIn the F2 generation, the phenotypic ratio is typically 3:1, where three-quarters of the offspring display the dominant phenotype, and one-quarter display the recessive phenotype. This occurs because the F1 generation, which is heterozygous (Pp), produces gametes with equal chances of carrying either the dominant (P) or recessive (p) allele. When these gametes combine, the resulting F2 generation has a genotypic ratio of 1 PP: 2 Pp: 1 pp [4]. The genotypic ratio reflects the different combinations of alleles, while the phenotypic ratio shows the observable traits.\n\nThe image [image4] illustrates this process in detail. It shows the parental generation (PP and pp), the formation of gametes, the F1 generation (all Pp), and the F2 generation, which includes the 3:1 phenotypic ratio and the 1:2:1 genotypic ratio. The image also includes visual representations of flowers to demonstrate the phenotypic outcomes. ![The image shows a genetic cross diagram illustrating the inheritance of traits in plants, including the F1 and F2 generations with their respective genotypes and phenotypes.](image4)\n\nAdditionally, the concept of dominant and recessive alleles plays a crucial role in determining the observed ratios. A dominant allele (P) masks the expression of the recessive allele (p) in the heterozygous state (Pp), but the recessive trait reappears in the F2 generation when an individual inherits two recessive alleles (pp) [6]. This principle is further supported by the idea that heritable factors, now known as genes, are passed from parents to offspring [7].\n\nThe image [image3] highlights the different genotypes, such as PP (homozygous dominant), aa (homozygous recessive), and Bb (heterozygous), which help explain how genetic combinations lead to specific traits. These genotypes are essential in understanding the underlying genetic basis for the observed phenotypic ratios. ![The image displays information about genotypes, including homozygous dominant (PP), homozygous recessive (aa), and heterozygous (Bb).](image3)\n\nIn summary, Mendelian inheritance explains the phenotypic and genotypic ratios in the F2 generation through the segregation and independent assortment of alleles, leading to a 3:1 phenotypic ratio and a 1:2:1 genotypic ratio."}

The resulting F2 generation shows a phenotypic ratio of 3 purple to 1 white, reflecting the dominance of the purple allele.

The objective is to understand the steps required to generate simple maps that can be used within Wikidata itself. For instance, the image shows a map with orange location markers concentrated in the Netherlands and parts of Belgium, indicating the kind of data that can be visualized [image1].\n\nMoving to **Module 2**, the learning objectives shift to embedding maps in Wikimedia projects such as Wikipedia and Commons.

One of the most prominent barriers is a siloed approach, which is identified as the greatest barrier to adoption [3]. This issue is further supported by the bar chart in image1, which shows that 52% of respondents identified \"There is no single ownership of the experience resulting in siloed approaches and misaligned goals\" as a major challenge. Additionally, 46% noted that \"We are too siloed by business line/product/brand,\" reinforcing the idea that internal fragmentation hinders effective customer management [image1].\n\nAnother key barrier is the lack of appropriate metrics and data focus. Text quote [6] highlights that marketers often focus on the wrong metrics, such as reach rather than engagement, and are overwhelmed by data that lacks insight and actionability. This aligns with the findings in image3, which indicates that \"Seldom or Never a Factor\" is 20%, \"Often a Factor\" is 32%, and \"Primary Factor\" is 11%. This suggests that while some organizations recognize the importance of certain factors, many do not prioritize them effectively [image3].\n\nMoreover, the text emphasizes that measurement is hard and that relying solely on technology solutions is not sufficient [2]. The bar chart in image5 provides further insight into how marketing attribution is calculated, with 52% attributing activity to the most recent touchpoint, 37% using inferred attribution, and 34% using fractional attribution. This indicates that traditional methods of measuring marketing effectiveness are still prevalent, which may not fully capture the complexity of customer journeys [image5].\n\nIn addition, the text mentions that marketing complexity means traditional methods and metrics fail to address the whole story, particularly in capturing customer engagement and sentiment [8]. This is reflected in the bar chart in image2, which compares \"Product/Brand Focused\" at 35% and \"Customer Focused\" at 44%, suggesting that while there is a growing emphasis on customer focus, product and brand focus still dominate [image2].\n\nFinally, the text highlights that \"Your customers are in charge, they will go where they are satisfied\" [2], emphasizing the need for businesses to prioritize customer satisfaction and engagement. This is further supported by the stacked bar chart in image4, which is labeled \"47%\", indicating a significant portion of respondents consider this factor important [image4].\n\n![The bar chart in image1 highlights the challenges of siloed approaches and misaligned goals, with 52% of respondents identifying this as a major issue.](image1)  \n![The bar chart in image2 shows that 44% of respondents are customer-focused, compared to 35% who are product/brand-focused.](image2)  \n![The bar chart in image3 indicates that \"Seldom or Never a Factor\" is 20%, \"Often a Factor\" is 32%, and \"Primary Factor\" is 11%.](image3)  \n![The bar chart in image5 shows the distribution of marketing attribution methods, with 52% attributing activity to the most recent touchpoint.](image5)  \n![The stacked bar chart in image4 is labeled \"47%\", indicating a significant portion of respondents consider this factor important.](image4)\n\nThe major barriers preventing the adoption of an integrated customer management approach include siloed structures, misaligned goals, and a lack of effective metrics and data focus."}

The word is constructed using several key Gestalt principles, which guide how we perceive and organize visual elements into meaningful wholes.\n\nOne of the most prominent principles is **closure**, where our perception fills in missing parts to form a complete shape. In the case of the word \"GESTALT,\" the \"G\" and \"E\" together create a sense of closure, as if they form a continuous shape despite being separate elements [image1]. This principle allows us to recognize the letters even when they are not fully outlined or complete.\n\nAnother principle at play is **proximity**, where elements that are close together are perceived as part of the same group. The letter \"E\" in the design is made up of small rectangles grouped closely together, suggesting unity and cohesion [image1]. This grouping helps us see the \"E\" as a single, coherent shape rather than individual components.\n\n**Similarity** is also present in the design, as the letters \"T\" and \"A\" share a similar striped pattern, leading us to group them together based on their visual characteristics [image1]. This principle helps in organizing the visual elements by emphasizing common features.\n\nAdditionally, **continuity** is demonstrated through the \"S\" in the word, which follows a smooth, continuous contour line, suggesting a flowing path that our eyes naturally follow [image1]. This principle guides our perception to see the \"S\" as a unified shape rather than disconnected segments.\n\nFinally, **pregnanz** (or the law of good gestalt) is reflected in the simplicity and clarity of the \"A\" in the design. Our perception tends to favor simple, clear forms, and the \"A\" exemplifies this by being easily recognizable and structured [image1].\n\nIn summary, the design of the word \"GESTALT\" incorporates multiple Gestalt principles, including closure, proximity, similarity, continuity, and pregnanz, to create a visually coherent and meaningful whole. These principles work together to help us interpret and understand the structure of the word as a unified entity. \n\n![The word \"GESTALT\" is designed using various Gestalt principles such as closure, proximity, similarity, continuity, and pregnanz.](image1)"}

For instance, a customer might first encounter a brand through a banner ad, then later search for the brand directly, leading to a conversion. However, because the last click (the navigational search) is credited, the earlier banner ad receives no performance attribution, even though it played a role in the customer's journey [8].\n\n![The image shows a bar chart displaying the percentage of marketers who use different methods to calculate marketing attribution.](image4)\n\nDespite this, there is a growing recognition of the need for more sophisticated attribution models.

First, it is important to turn off the electrical power to the dishwasher at the supply source [2]. Then, the water supply should be turned off, and the water inlet pipe must be disconnected from the water valve. After that, the water from the inlet pipe and water valve should be drained using a pan to collect the water. Once this is done, the water inlet pipe should be reconnected to the water valve. Next, the filter at the bottom of the tub needs to be removed, and a sponge should be used to soak up any water in the sump [2].\n\nAfter ensuring all these preliminary steps are completed, the dishwasher must be secured in place. There are two methods for doing this: one for a normal work surface, where the installation hook is placed into the slot of the side plane and secured with wood screws, and another for marble or granite work tops, where the side is fixed with screws [3]. Additionally, the dishwasher must be level for proper dish rack operation and wash performance. This involves placing a spirit level on the door and rack track inside the tub and adjusting the three leveling legs individually while being careful not to let the dishwasher tip over [5].\n\nOnce the dishwasher is properly installed and leveled, the next step is to load the dishes. The lower and upper baskets should be drawn out, and the dishes should be loaded, with the recommendation to load the lower basket first and then the upper one.

The first module focuses on foundational skills in creating basic flat and layered maps using Wikidata. This includes understanding how to use geo-referenced items (P625) and SPARQL queries to generate maps [8]. The image provided, image1, shows a presentation slide that highlights this objective, featuring a map of parts of Belgium, the Netherlands, and Germany with colored dots representing data points [image1].\n\nMoving on to the second module, the focus shifts to embedding these maps within Wikimedia projects such as Wikipedia and Commons. This module introduces additional tools like OpenStreetMap, GeoJSON, and the Mediawiki Kar to graph er extension [8]. Image4 provides insight into this module, showing a map with public libraries in the Netherlands, which illustrates the practical application of embedding maps within Wikimedia contexts [image4].\n\nFinally, the third module is dedicated to creating interactive, layered off-Wiki maps that can be used outside of the Wikimedia ecosystem. This involves using basic Python and Jupyter notebooks to develop these maps [8]. Image5, which is a screenshot of a GitHub repository, indicates the availability of resources for this module, suggesting that participants will have access to code and documentation to support their learning [image5].\n\nIn summary, the key learning objectives for each module in the Wikidata map-making workshop are to create basic flat and layered maps in Module 1, embed maps in Wikimedia projects in Module 2, and develop interactive, layered off-Wiki maps in Module 3. Each module builds upon the previous one, increasing in complexity and scope. ![Module 1, basic: Understand steps to make basic flat and layered maps in Wikidata, based on geo referenced (P625) items and SPARQL queries.](image1) ![Module 2, intermediate: Embed maps in Wikimedia sites like Wikipedia, Wikimedia Commons, and Wikidata.](image4) ![Module 3, advanced: Understand steps to create Wikidata-based off-Wiki maps.](image4)"}

To answer this, we need to analyze the placement of the throttle valve and fuel injectors in different fuel injection systems based on the provided quotes.\n\nFrom the text quotes, we learn that in a **Single Point Fuel Injection (TBI)** system, the **injector is located inside the throttle body**, and it sits **on top of the inlet manifold** [2]. This suggests that the throttle valve, which is part of the throttle body, is positioned **above** the fuel injector in this configuration. However, the quote also mentions that **injectors are located in each branch of the inlet manifold, below the throttle valve** [3], indicating that in some configurations, the throttle valve may be placed above the injectors.\n\nLooking at the image quotes, image1 provides a diagram of a fuel injection system where the **throttle valve regulates airflow before the fuel is introduced into the system**. The fuel is injected into the inlet manifold, which is downstream from the throttle valve. This supports the idea that the throttle valve is **above** the fuel injectors in this setup. Similarly, image2 shows a similar arrangement, with the **throttle valve controlling air flow before fuel is injected into the system**, reinforcing the notion that the throttle valve is placed **above** the fuel injectors.\n\nHowever, image3, which illustrates a **multi-point fuel injection (MPFI) system**, shows the **injectors located in the inlet manifold**, and while the throttle valve is present, it is not explicitly stated whether it is above or below the injectors. Image4, which depicts a **Single Point Fuel Injection (TBI) system**, shows the **injector inside the throttle body**, suggesting that the **throttle valve is above the fuel injector** in this case as well.\n\nFinally, image5, which shows an engine with multiple fuel injectors, does not provide specific information about the relative positioning of the throttle valve and injectors.\n\nBased on the evidence, the **throttle valve is typically placed above the fuel injectors** in most fuel injection systems, including both **Single Point Fuel Injection (TBI)** and **Multi-Point Fuel Injection (MPFI)** systems.

However, we can derive some insights based on the data presented in the image quotes.\n\nThe image quotes provide a glimpse into the scale and reach of PwC's operations. For instance, image1 shows an office setting with three blocks of text indicating \"Offices 12,\" \"Countries 9,\" and \"Employees 1816\" [1]. This suggests that at least one part of PwC operates across 12 offices, 9 countries, and has 1,816 employees. Similarly, image2 displays the same set of numbers: \"Offices 12,\" \"Employees 1816,\" and \"Countries 9\" [2], reinforcing the idea that these figures are representative of a significant portion of PwC's operations.\n\nImage3, on the other hand, presents different numbers: \"20 Offices,\" \"1914 Employees,\" and \"12 Countries\" [3].

The Assurance department typically focuses on financial auditing and risk management, which might require a more localized presence, as suggested by the smaller number of offices and employees in some of the images. In contrast, the Consulting and Deals departments often involve more global engagement, which could explain the larger numbers seen in other images.\n\nIn summary, while the specific numbers for the Assurance, Consulting, and Deals departments are not directly provided, the images suggest that these departments may operate across varying numbers of offices, employees, and countries, reflecting their different roles and global reach. \n\n![Offices 12, Countries 9, Employees 1816](image1)  \n![Offices 12, Countries 9, Employees 1816](image2)  \n![20 Offices, 1914 Employees, 12 Countries](image3)  \n![500 Employees, 9 Offices, 7 Countries](image4)  \n![Offices 9, Employees 500, Countries 7](image5)  \n\nThe Assurance, Consulting, and Deals departments at PwC likely differ in terms of the number of offices, employees, and countries they operate in, based on the varying scales depicted in the images."}

The instruction manual emphasizes that large items and those most difficult to clean, such as pots, pans, lids, serving dishes, and bowls, should be placed in the lower basket [3]. It also recommends placing serving dishes and lids on the side of the racks to avoid blocking the rotation of the top spray arm. Additionally, the maximum diameter advised for plates in front of the detergent dispenser is 19 cm to prevent it from being hampered [3].\n\nFor the upper basket, it is designed to hold more delicate and lighter dishware, such as glasses, coffee, and tea cups [10]. Curved items or ones with recesses should be loaded at an angle so that water can run off [10]. Hollow items like cups, glasses, and pans should be placed with their openings facing downwards to prevent water from collecting inside [10]. Dishes and cutlery must not lie inside one another or cover each other, and glasses should not touch one another to avoid damage [10].\n\nCutlery should be arranged in a way that sharp items are not likely to damage the door seal. Knives and other utensils with sharp points must be loaded in the basket with their points facing down or placed in a horizontal position [9].

The process involves two consecutive divisions: meiosis I and meiosis II. Each stage of these divisions has distinct characteristics, particularly in terms of chromosome separation and cell division.\n\nDuring **meiosis I**, homologous chromosomes separate, reducing the chromosome number by half. This is a key difference from mitosis, where sister chromatids separate. In meiosis I, the homologous chromosomes, which are paired as tetrads, align at the metaphase plate during **metaphase I** [7]. Then, during **anaphase I**, the homologous chromosomes are pulled to opposite poles of the cell [7]. This separation is what reduces the chromosome number from diploid to haploid. Following this, **telophase I and cytokinesis** occur, resulting in two daughter cells, each with a haploid set of chromosomes [3].\n\nIn contrast, **meiosis II** resembles mitosis in that it involves the separation of sister chromatids. During **anaphase II**, the sister chromatids are pulled apart to opposite poles of the cell [4]. This separation ensures that each resulting daughter cell receives one copy of each chromosome. Unlike meiosis I, the chromosome number remains the same during meiosis II [7]. After meiosis II, **telophase II and cytokinesis** complete the process, resulting in four haploid cells [9].\n\nThe diagrams and images provide visual representations of these differences. For example, image1 illustrates the stages of meiosis, showing how homologous chromosomes form tetrads and how sister chromatids separate during later stages [image1]. Image3 highlights the separation of sister chromatids and the formation of haploid daughter cells, emphasizing the final outcome of meiosis [image3]. Additionally, image4 depicts **anaphase II** and **telophase II**, clearly showing the separation of chromatids and the formation of new nuclei [image4].\n\n![The diagram shows the separation of sister chromatids during meiosis II and the formation of haploid daughter cells.](image3)\n\n![The image shows anaphase II, where chromatids are separating and moving to opposite poles, and telophase II, where the cell is finishing division, forming two new nuclei.](image4)\n\nIn summary, meiosis I involves the separation of homologous chromosomes, reducing the chromosome number by half, while meiosis II involves the separation of sister chromatids, maintaining the haploid number."}

According to the information provided, the lock bits are part of the EPROM Program Lock scheme, and their programming involves setting certain pins to specific logic levels. For instance, during the programming of the lock bits, P2.6 is held at a logic high, while Port 0, Port 1, and pins P2.0-P2.3 can be in any state [10]. Additionally, the other pins should be held at the \"Program\" levels indicated in Table 3, which likely includes the EA/Vpp pin being raised to Vpp, ALE/PROG being pulsed low, and then EA/Vpp being returned to a valid high voltage [9].\n\nThe table in image2 provides detailed configurations for different operation modes, including the programming of lock bits.

While the specific color for Mali is not directly visible in the description, the structure of the table suggests that the `fill` column contains the color used to represent each country on a map. Given that the table is associated with GeoShapes and SPARQL queries, it is reasonable to infer that the `fill` color for Mali would be specified in this table.\n\nAdditionally, image3 shows a map of Africa where countries are color-coded by land area, using shades of blue and purple [3]. Although this map does not specifically highlight Mali, it illustrates how color-coding is applied to geographic regions in similar contexts.

This suggests that the Consulting team operates across multiple regions and has a broad reach. Additionally, the Technology Consulting team is noted for shaping the Digital and IT market in the GCC, working with public and private sector clients [4], which indicates a strong regional presence in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries. The CiPS team also operates across several capital-intensive industries in the Middle East, including power & utilities, industrial products, real estate & construction, and transport & logistics [5], further emphasizing a significant geographical footprint.\n\nIn contrast, while the text does not explicitly mention the Assurance team's geographical or employee distribution, the image quotes provide some relevant data. For instance, image1 shows \"20 Offices,\" \"1914 Employees,\" and \"12 Countries,\" which could represent the scale of operations for the Assurance team or another division within the organization [1]. Similarly, image5 also displays \"20 Offices,\" \"12 Countries,\" and \"1914 Employees,\" reinforcing the idea that these figures might pertain to the Assurance team’s global presence [5].\n\nRegarding employee distribution, image2 mentions \"1816 Employees\" and \"9 Countries,\" while image4 repeats similar numbers: \"1816 Employees,\" \"12 Offices,\" and \"9 Countries\" [2]. These figures suggest that the Consulting team may have a slightly different distribution compared to the Assurance team, as the number of countries and offices varies between the two. For example, image3 highlights \"500 Employees\" and \"7 Countries,\" which could represent a smaller or more specialized unit within the organization [3].\n\nOverall, while the text provides a general overview of the Consulting team's operations, the images offer specific numerical data that can be used to compare the geographical and employee distribution of the Assurance and Consulting teams.

Based on the provided text and image quotes, several key elements can be identified.\n\nFrom the text quotes, we learn that the fuel supply system is responsible for delivering fuel to the engine. Specifically, [1] states that the electrical fuel pump draws fuel from the tank and forces it into the regulator, indicating that the fuel pump is a critical component of the fuel supply. Additionally, [2] describes the \"common rail\" as a pressure accumulator that stores fuel at high pressure and supplies multiple injectors, suggesting that the common rail is also directly connected to the fuel supply. Furthermore, [5] explains that direct injection systems force fuel into the combustion chambers, which implies that the fuel injectors are connected to the fuel supply as well.\n\nLooking at the image quotes, we see visual representations of these connections. Image2 provides a diagram of a fuel injection system, where the fuel flows from the **Fuel Supply** through the **Fuel Filter**, **Fuel Pump, High Pressure**, and into the **Fuel Rail**, which then distributes the fuel to the **Fuel Injectors**. This confirms that the fuel supply is connected to the fuel filter, fuel pump, fuel rail, and fuel injectors. The diagram also shows the **Sensor Harness** and **Injector Harness** as being connected to the fuel supply system, emphasizing the integration of sensors and control mechanisms.\n\nImage4 further supports this by showing a block diagram of a fuel injection system, where the **FUEL SUPPLY SYSTEM** is connected to both the **COLD START SYSTEM** and the **FUEL METERING SYSTEM**, which in turn supply the **ENGINE**. This illustrates how the fuel supply is integrated into various subsystems that ultimately deliver fuel to the engine.\n\n![The image is a diagram of a fuel injection system commonly found in internal combustion engines. It illustrates the various components and flow of fuel in the system.](image2)\n\nIn addition, image5 depicts a **common rail fuel injection system**, where the **High Pressure Pump** delivers fuel to the **Common Rail (Left and Right Bank)**, which is connected to the **Injectors**.

Analysis, on the other hand, is prescriptive, aiming to answer \"why\" something happened by combining data and information to generate insights. It involves deeper exploration, such as statistical analysis and forecasting, to uncover patterns and predict future trends [2].\n\nIn the progression from business intelligence to business analytics, reporting serves as the starting point, offering a snapshot of historical data and raising questions about performance and outcomes.

This is usually sufficient for most pours.\" However, it also mentions in text quote [6] that \"Thicker plywood maybe used when the weight of concrete causes a standard thickness plywood to bow out, distorting the concrete face.\" This suggests that while 18mm is standard, thicker options like 25mm may be necessary in cases where the concrete's weight could cause deformation. \n\nIn addition, image3 provides a table listing dimensions for construction materials, noting that \"Sheeting for slabs, beam, column side and beam bottom\" ranges from 25 mm to 40 mm.

It acts as the brain of the system, making real-time decisions based on sensor feedback to optimize performance, efficiency, and emissions.\n\nIn the context of the fuel injection system, the ECU regulates the opening and closing of injector valves through electronic signals, ensuring precise fuel delivery to the engine [3]. This control is part of a broader set of responsibilities, including managing ignition timing, which involves adjusting when the spark plug fires to initiate combustion [6]. The ECU also controls idle speed by adjusting the throttle or bypass air flow, maintaining stable engine operation at low speeds [5].\n\nThe ECU receives input from multiple sensors, such as the engine temperature sensor, intake air temperature sensor, mass air flow sensor, throttle position sensor, HEGO sensor, crankshaft sensor, and camshaft sensor [5]. These sensors provide data about the engine's operating conditions, allowing the ECU to make informed adjustments. For example, the crankshaft position sensor monitors engine RPM and plays a key role in timing functions for fuel injection and spark events [5].\n\nThe ECU's role is further illustrated in the block diagram of the fuel injection system, where it coordinates the interaction between the \"FUEL METERING SYSTEM\" and other subsystems. Control signals from the ECU ensure that fuel is delivered in the right amount and at the right time, while also managing the flow of air and other parameters necessary for efficient combustion [2].\n\nIn the engine management system diagram, the ECU is positioned at the center, highlighting its importance as the central processing unit. It connects to various sensors on one side and injectors on the other, with directional arrows showing the flow of information and control signals [5]. This interconnected design demonstrates how the ECU integrates and manages different aspects of engine operation.\n\n![The image shows a cross-sectional view of an engine cylinder during the fuel injection process, with the injector spraying fuel into the combustion chamber.](image3)\n\n![The image is a diagram depicting the flow of information and control in an engine management system, with the ECU at the center.](image5)\n\nIn summary, the ECU is responsible for monitoring engine conditions, processing sensor data, and controlling critical functions such as fuel injection, ignition timing, and idle speed to ensure optimal engine performance."}

According to the text quotes, binary fission is described as a method of reproduction in prokaryotic cells, where a single cell divides into two identical daughter cells [4]. The steps involved in this process are outlined in quote [9], which states that \"A single circular chromosome duplicates, and the copies begin to separate from each other. The cell elongates, and the chromosomal copies separate further. The plasma membrane grows inward at the midpoint to divide the cells.\" This provides a clear sequence of events.\n\nFirst, the single circular chromosome duplicates, ensuring that each daughter cell will receive a complete copy of the genetic material. This duplication is a critical step in preparing the cell for division. Next, the cell elongates, allowing the duplicated chromosomes to move apart. This elongation is an essential part of the process, as it creates space for the separation of genetic material. Finally, the plasma membrane grows inward at the midpoint of the cell, effectively dividing the original cell into two distinct daughter cells. This step ensures that each new cell has its own plasma membrane and a complete set of genetic material.\n\n![The image illustrates bacterial cell division, specifically binary fission.

Additionally, it is mentioned that when the camera indicator is on, the infrared camera is in recognition mode [2]. This indicates a direct relationship between the camera indicator and the infrared camera's operation. Furthermore, the infrared camera lens is specifically noted as being used for creating the facial image of a user [8].\n\nLooking at the image quotes, image4 provides a close-up of a device with labeled components, including a camera or lens and a small sensor or indicator light. While the image does not explicitly label the camera indicator as being on a specific side of the infrared camera lens, it does show the general placement of the camera and its associated components.

In standard consumption, the utility derived from each additional hot dog decreases, eventually becoming negative, as shown in image4. This reflects the principle that as more of a good is consumed, the additional satisfaction (or utility) gained from each extra unit tends to decrease. For example, the first hot dog provides a utility of +10, but the sixth provides a utility of -10, illustrating the typical pattern of diminishing marginal utility [4].\n\nIn contrast, in competitive contexts, the relationship between hot dog consumption and utility can be drastically different. Image5 shows a table where the utility from consuming hot dogs initially decreases but then experiences a dramatic increase at 64 hot dogs, jumping from -50 to +5000. This suggests that in competitive settings, such as eating contests, the utility might not follow the traditional pattern of diminishing returns. Instead, there may be a point where increased consumption leads to a significant boost in utility, possibly due to achieving a competitive goal or recognition. This is further emphasized by the photo in image5 of someone holding a large tray of hot dogs, labeled as the point where this person tied a competitor for a championship in 2007.\n\n![Diminishing marginal utility in hot dog consumption](image4)  \n![Competitive context with a dramatic utility jump in hot dog consumption](image5)\n\nIn summary, while standard consumption follows the principle of diminishing marginal utility, competitive contexts can exhibit non-linear utility patterns, where additional consumption may lead to significant increases in utility."}

To answer this, we can examine both the text and image quotes provided.\n\nFrom the text quotes, [7] mentions \"2006 Health IT Staffing Needs,\" which indicates that there was a focus on understanding what roles were necessary in healthcare IT during that year. Additionally, [3] refers to \"Intranet Functions,\" suggesting that intranets were an important part of healthcare IT infrastructure.\n\nLooking at the image quotes, image4 provides insight into the distribution of roles or functions in 2006. It shows that network support (27%), clinical informaticists (24%), and process/workflow design (24%) were among the most significant roles. These roles likely played a key part in managing and maintaining intranet functions.\n\nImage5 provides data on the current usage (\"Today\") versus projected usage in two years for various organizational functions. It shows that while some functions like posting policies and procedures (87% today, 70% in two years) and staff communication (82% today, 70% in two years) are expected to decrease in use, others like access to patient clinical information (45% today, 53% in two years) and physician access for clinical orders (44% today, 57% in two years) are projected to increase. Furthermore, the chart indicates a significant reduction in organizations without an intranet (7% today, 1% in two years).\n\n![The image is a horizontal bar chart comparing the current usage (\"Today\") versus projected usage in two years for various organizational functions.](image5)\n\nGiven these insights, it appears that the IT staffing needs in 2006, as reflected in image4, were focused on roles that would support the maintenance and management of intranet functions. The anticipated changes in intranet functions, as shown in image5, suggest a shift towards more specialized and integrated systems, such as access to patient clinical information and physician access for clinical orders. This implies that IT staffing needs would likely evolve to accommodate these changes, with a greater emphasis on roles that support these new functionalities.\n\nIn conclusion, the IT staffing needs in 2006 were aligned with the existing intranet functions, but the anticipated changes suggest a need for a shift in staffing priorities to support more integrated and specialized systems."}
