However, it also notes that \"tablet ownership levels among seniors are around half the national average (34% of all U.S. adults are tablet owners)\" [9]. Given that the national average for tablet ownership is 34%, and seniors' tablet ownership is about half that, we can estimate that approximately 17% of higher-income seniors own a tablet.\n\nNow, considering the image quotes:\n\n- From **image1**, which provides detailed data on cell phone and smartphone ownership among seniors based on income:\n  - For seniors with an income of $75,000 or more, the percentage who own a smartphone is 42%.\n  - The same table also shows that 92% of seniors in this income group own a cell phone, but it does not directly mention tablet ownership.\n\n- From **image4**, which provides data on internet usage and broadband access:\n  - For seniors with an income of $75,000 or more, 90% go online, which aligns with the information from quote [5].\n\nPutting this together, the percentages for higher-income seniors are as follows:\n\n- Go online: 90%\n- Own a smartphone: 42%\n- Own a tablet: 17%\n\nThus, the answer in descending order is:\n\n[\"90%\", \"42%\", \"17%\"]"}

It shows that 60% of respondents believe other countries should deal with their own problems, which could be interpreted as a belief that the U.S. should not intervene [2]. On the other hand, image8 shows that 64% of Americans believe the U.S. has done only a fair or poor job in dealing with the coronavirus outbreak [8].\n\nTo calculate the percentage difference, we need to compare the proportion of people who believe the U.S. should help other countries deal with their problems (60%) with those who believe the U.S. has done a poor job in dealing with the coronavirus outbreak (64%). The percentage difference is calculated as follows: $|60\\% - 64\\%| = 4\\%$.\n\n![The image shows a bar chart comparing different countries on the belief that the U.S. can or cannot learn from other countries.](image4)"}

However, to find the percentage of people who were \"very confident,\" we need to refer to the image quotes. Image5 provides a detailed breakdown of confidence levels over time, including January 2018. According to image5, in January 2018, 27% of respondents were \"Very\" confident in Mueller's investigation [5].\n\nFor the \"not too confident\" group, we can use the data from image2, which shows that 17% of the total population were \"Not too\" confident in Mueller's investigation [2]. This is the relevant figure for the year 2019, as the question asks about the percentage of people who were \"not too\" confident in 2019.\n\nNow, to calculate the percentage difference between these two groups, we subtract the percentage of those who were \"Very\" confident in January 2018 (27%) from the percentage of those who were \"Not too\" confident in 2019 (17%). The result is a difference of 10%.\n\n![The image shows a bar chart comparing responses from different political groups regarding their level of agreement with something.](image2)"}

This suggests that around 30% of postgraduates do not trust information from the WHO.\n\nNow, looking at the image quotes, image2 provides data on trust levels for different age groups. According to this image:\n\n- For those aged 65+, 26% say they do not trust information at all, and 23% say they do not trust it too much. This adds up to 49% of people over 65 who do not trust information from the WHO.\n- This means that 49% of people over 65 do not trust information from the WHO.\n\nTo compare the percentage of people over 65 who do not trust information from the WHO with the percentage of postgraduates who do not trust information from the EU, we subtract the percentage of postgraduates who do not trust the EU from the percentage of people over 65 who do not trust the WHO:\n\n- Percentage of people over 65 who do not trust information from the WHO: 49%\n- Percentage of postgraduates who do not trust information from the EU: 22%\n\nThe difference is 49% - 22% = 27%.\n\nTherefore, there are 27% more people over 65 years old who do not trust information from the World Health Organization compared to postgraduates who do not trust information from the European Union in regard to the coronavirus outbreak.\n\n![People over 65 have higher distrust in WHO information than postgraduates in EU information](image2)"}

To answer this, we need to examine relevant data from both the text and image quotes.\n\nFrom the text, we find that in the survey, $47\\%$ of older adults had a high-speed broadband connection at home [11]. While this is a useful statistic, it does not directly specify the percentage of males aged 65+ who use the internet or have broadband. However, the text also mentions that \"the Pew Research Center Library Survey... obtained telephone interviews with a nationally representative sample of 6,224 people ages 16 and older,\" which included individuals aged 65 and older [6].\n\nLooking at the image quotes, specifically **image4**, we can see data comparing internet users aged 65+ with all adults aged 65+. The table indicates that among internet users aged 65+, 39% are male, while among all adults aged 65+, 25% are male [4]. This suggests a difference in the proportion of males in the internet user group compared to the general population of seniors. Additionally, image4 provides data showing that 46% of internet users aged 65+ are online, while 27% of all adults aged 65+ are social networking site users [4].\n\nFor broadband adoption, image1 shows that 22% of males aged 65+ have broadband at home, while 15% of females do [1]. Image2, however, shows a higher percentage: 65% of males aged 65+ use the internet, and 55% of females do [2]. These percentages suggest that more males than females have internet access, but they do not directly provide the percentage of males with broadband.\n\nTo determine the exact gap between male internet users and those with broadband at home, we must consider the overall percentage of males aged 65+ who use the internet and have broadband. According to the text, $47\\%$ of older adults have broadband at home [11], and image1 provides specific data for males (22%) and females (15%) [1]. \n\nCombining these, we estimate the gap between male internet users and those with broadband at home as follows:\n\n- The percentage of males aged 65+ who use the internet is approximately 65% (from image2) [2].\n- The percentage of males aged 65+ who have broadband at home is 22% (from image1) [1].\n\nThus, the gap is calculated as:\n\n$$\n65\\% - 22\\% = 43\\%\n$$\n\nTherefore, the gap between male 65+ age group who use the internet and those who have broadband at home is approximately **0.43** in float format.\n\n![The table presents data for individuals aged 65 and over (n=1,526), segmented by various demographic factors and associated percentages](image1)  \n![This table shows data for a group of people aged 65 and older, with a total sample size of 1,526.

While there is a general sense of realism about the possibility, the overall sentiment leans more toward worry than enthusiasm.\n\nAccording to the data, 85% of Americans have heard or read about the idea that automation may impact employment, with 24% indicating they have heard \"a lot\" about it [2]. Furthermore, 77% of Americans think this concept is at least somewhat realistic, and one-in-five find it extremely realistic [2][3]. However, despite this awareness, most Americans express more worry than enthusiasm about the prospect of machines taking over many human jobs. Specifically, 72% express worry compared to 33% who are enthusiastic [1]. This pattern is consistent across various automation-related scenarios, such as robots and computers doing jobs, algorithms making hiring decisions, and even robot caregivers [1][7].\n\nThe survey also reveals that while some Americans anticipate negative outcomes from automation, others see potential benefits. For instance, 76% of respondents believe that inequality between rich and poor will be much worse than today, and 64% think people will have a hard time finding things to do with their lives [image1]. On the other hand, only 43% believe the economy will be much more efficient, and 42% think people can focus less on work and more on what really matters [image1].\n\nDespite these concerns, there is a notable level of support for policies that aim to mitigate the negative impacts of automation. A majority of Americans (85%) support limiting machines to dangerous or unhealthy jobs [image2], and 77% of Democrats/lean Democrats support a guaranteed basic income, compared to only 38% of Republicans/lean Republicans [image2]. Additionally, 58% of U.S. adults believe there should be limits on the number of jobs businesses can replace with machines [image3].\n\nInterestingly, those who have been most impacted by automation in their careers have different views. They are more likely to have heard a lot about the concept and find it extremely realistic [9]. These individuals also perceive greater automation risk to jobs that others consider relatively safe, such as teachers and nurses, and show more support for a universal basic income in the event of widespread automation [9].\n\nThe data further indicates that higher levels of awareness correlate with more positive attitudes toward automation. For example, 48% of those who have heard a lot about the concept find it extremely realistic, and 47% express some level of enthusiasm [4]. In contrast, those who have heard little or nothing about it are significantly less enthusiastic [4].\n\nOverall, while Americans recognize the potential of automation to change the job market, they remain largely concerned about its implications. The balance of public opinion suggests a cautious optimism, with significant support for policies that aim to protect workers and ensure that automation serves the broader good.\n\n![A bar chart showing public opinion on the likelihood of various outcomes related to automation](image1)  \n![A bar chart showing policy support among Democrats and Republicans regarding automation](image2)  \n![A bar chart illustrating public opinion on the government's role in addressing job displacement due to automation](image3)  \n![A bar chart depicting public opinion on four different topics related to automation](image4)  \n![A horizontal bar chart showing the degree of awareness about automation concepts](image5)  \n![A horizontal bar chart showing responses to statements about the concept of machines performing jobs](image6)  \n![A horizontal stacked bar chart representing different segments of survey responses](image7)  \n![A horizontal bar chart representing levels of enthusiasm and worry about automation](image8)  \n\nIn conclusion, Americans perceive the concept of machines performing jobs currently done by humans as realistic but predominantly concerning, with a strong emphasis on the need for safeguards and policies to address potential negative consequences."}

This sentiment is echoed in other data points, where the public is more supportive of limits on how many human jobs can be replaced by machines compared to the idea that businesses are justified in replacing humans with machines [2].\n\nPublic opinion also shows strong support for specific policies aimed at mitigating the impact of automation. For instance, $85\\%$ of Americans favor limiting machines to performing primarily those jobs that are dangerous or unhealthy for humans [6]. Additionally, majorities support providing all Americans with a guaranteed income (60%) and a national service program (58%) in the event that robots and computers become widely competitive with human workers [4].\n\nPartisan differences are evident in some areas, particularly regarding universal basic income and national service programs.

For instance, $73\\%$ of Latino Democrats and Democratic leaners hold this view, compared to $62\\%$ of Republicans and Republican leaners who believe it is a bigger problem that people see racial discrimination where it does not exist [8]. Additionally, $75\\%$ of Latino Democrats say that people not seeing racial discrimination where it really does exist is a bigger problem, while only $36\\%$ of Latino Republicans and $56\\%$ of Latino independents and nonpartisans share this view [2].

These reasons are supported by both text and image quotes.\n\nText quote [1] highlights that many Americans believe the limited diversity in the STEM workforce is due to a lack of encouragement for girls and minorities to pursue STEM from an early age. Specifically, 39% of Americans consider this a major reason for the underrepresentation of women in some STEM areas, and 41% say it is a major reason for the underrepresentation of blacks and Hispanics. This aligns with text quote [5], which states that most blacks in STEM positions consider limited access to quality education, discrimination in recruitment and promotions, and a lack of encouragement to pursue these jobs from an early age as major underlying reasons for the underrepresentation of blacks and Hispanics in STEM.\n\nText quote [7] further supports this by showing that around a third of people working in STEM attribute the underrepresentation of blacks and Hispanics to these groups not believing in their ability to succeed in these fields (34%), the lack of black and Hispanic role models in these fields (32%), and racial/ethnic discrimination in recruitment, hiring, and promotions (32%). Additionally, text quote [10] notes that 52% of those with a STEM job say a major reason for this underrepresentation is because blacks and Hispanics are less likely to have access to quality education that prepares them for these fields, while 45% attribute these disparities to these groups not being encouraged at an early age to pursue STEM-related subjects.\n\nText quote [11] adds that 42% of Americans say limited access to quality education is a major reason for the underrepresentation of blacks and Hispanics in the STEM workforce, with this view held by a majority of those working in STEM who are black (73%) and about half of Hispanics (53%), Asians (52%), and whites (50%) in STEM jobs.\n\nImage quote [5] provides a visual representation of the major reasons why more women, blacks, and Hispanics are not in STEM jobs. For women, the major reasons include facing discrimination in recruitment, hiring, and promotion (39%), not being encouraged to pursue STEM from an early age (39%), and finding it more difficult to balance work and family in STEM jobs (33%). For blacks and Hispanics, the major reasons include being less likely to have access to quality education to prepare for STEM fields (42%), not being encouraged to pursue STEM from an early age (41%), and being less likely to believe they can succeed in STEM (33%).\n\n![The bar chart shows the major reasons why more women, blacks, and Hispanics are not in STEM jobs.](image5)\n\nIn conclusion, the major reasons for the underrepresentation of women, blacks, and Hispanics in STEM jobs, according to the Pew Research Center, include limited access to quality education, discrimination, and a lack of encouragement from an early age."}

Specifically, 25% of Americans consider K-12 STEM education in the U.S. to be at least above average, while 43% say it is average, and 30% consider it below average [9]. This indicates a general lack of confidence in the quality of K-12 STEM education among the broader population.\n\nHowever, when examining the views of those with a postgraduate degree in STEM, the perception shifts. While most Americans give positive ratings for how well K-12 public schools teach reading, writing, and mathematics, public assessments of STEM education for U.S. students in grades K-12 are middling [6]. Notably, only 13% of those with a STEM postgraduate degree consider K-12 STEM education to be at least above average, while about half (51%) say the U.S. is below average in this regard [11]. This suggests that individuals with advanced education in STEM fields are more critical of the quality of K-12 STEM education than the general public.\n\nThe image quotes provide additional context. Image5, a horizontal bar chart, shows that 25% of respondents believe K-12 public schools are \"Best in the world/above average,\" 43% say they are \"Average,\" and 30% think they are \"Below average.\" This aligns with the findings from the text quotes, highlighting the general perception of mediocrity in K-12 education. In contrast, the data from the text quotes suggest that even those with advanced STEM education do not hold a more favorable view of K-12 STEM education, reinforcing the idea that there is a widespread concern about its quality.\n\n![K-12 public schools are perceived as average or below average by a majority of U.S. adults](image5)"}

For example, Seed-stage investments remained relatively stable, while First, Second, and Later-stage investments experienced fluctuations, peaking in the middle of the period and then declining by 2009 [6]. This suggests that the U.S. venture capital market was more dynamic during this time, with higher levels of capital flowing into later-stage ventures before a decline in the final years.\n\nIn contrast, European median investments exhibited a more moderate trajectory. The \"Later\" stage saw a peak around 2007-2008, but the other stages showed less variation over the years [4]. This indicates that European venture capital was more conservative, with less pronounced fluctuations compared to the U.S. market.

Confidence is assessed based on the type, amount, quality, strength, and consistency of evidence, as well as the degree of expert agreement on the finding. It is expressed qualitatively, ranging from low confidence (inconclusive evidence or disagreement among experts) to very high confidence (strong evidence and high consensus) [9]. The evaluation of confidence involves assessing the available literature, determining the quality and quantity of available evidence, and evaluating the level of agreement across different studies [11].\n\nLikelihood, on the other hand, describes the probability of an impact occurring, based on statistical analysis of observations or model results, or expert judgment. Likelihood statements have a specific probability associated with them, ranging from very unlikely (less than or equal to a 1 in 10 chance) to very likely (greater than or equal to a 9 in 10 chance) [3]. This probabilistic approach allows for a quantitative estimate of uncertainty to be associated with projections.\n\nThe evaluation of both confidence and likelihood is based on the expert assessment and consensus of the chapter author teams. They determine the appropriate level of confidence or likelihood by assessing the available literature, determining the quality and quantity of available evidence, and evaluating the level of agreement across different studies [11]. The process is documented in the Traceable Accounts, which provide additional information on sources of uncertainty and the rationale behind the conclusions [5].\n\nThe document also includes visual aids that help clarify the concepts of confidence and likelihood. For example, a diagram explains the pathways by which climate change can affect human health, illustrating how climate drivers lead to exposure pathways and subsequently to health outcomes [7]. Another image provides a visual representation of probability terms and their corresponding numerical ranges, helping to convey the likelihood of an event occurring based on subjective assessments [4].

Additionally, critiques about ethical standards extend to both parties, with just 41% of Americans saying the GOP has high ethical standards, while 42% say this about the Democratic Party [4]. This suggests that while there is a slight edge for the Democratic Party on ethical standards, both parties face significant skepticism from the public.\n\nFurthermore, the text notes that more Americans view the Republican Party as \"too extreme\" (48%) than the Democratic Party (42%) [8]. However, the share of Americans who view the Republican Party as too extreme has declined since last June, from 54% to 48%, while views of the Democratic Party have remained relatively stable [8].\n\nLooking at the image quotes, image1 provides a bar chart comparing perceptions of the Republican and Democratic parties.

This aligns with the textual data, reinforcing the idea that while both parties face challenges, the Republican Party is perceived as more extreme.\n\nImage10 adds another layer by showing that among those with at least a college degree, 31% say \"high ethical standards\" does not describe either party, 43% say it describes one but not the other, and 17% think it describes both [10]. This indicates that higher education levels may correlate with more critical views of both parties' ethical standards.\n\nImage4 provides a detailed breakdown of how different groups perceive the political parties. It shows that the percentage of people who believe neither party has high ethical standards varies significantly across groups. For instance, 34% of independents, including equal shares of Republican and Democratic leaners, say neither party has high ethical standards, compared to only 19% of Republicans and 18% of Democrats [5]. This highlights the differences in perception between partisans and independents, as well as between different educational backgrounds.\n\nImage2 also offers insights into political party preferences among various demographic groups. While this image focuses more on party preference than on ethics or extremism, it provides context for understanding how different groups might form their opinions. For example, women, Black individuals, and Hispanics tend to favor the Democratic Party more strongly, while men and White individuals are more likely to support the Republican Party [image2]. These preferences could influence perceptions of ethics and extremism.\n\nIn summary, perceptions of political parties' ethics and extremism vary significantly among different educational and political affiliation groups. While both parties face criticism, the Republican Party is generally viewed as more extreme, and higher education levels are associated with more critical views of both parties' ethical standards. Independents and those with lower educational attainment are more likely to express skepticism about the ethical standards of both parties. \n\n![The image is a bar chart comparing perceptions of the Republican and Democratic parties among U.S. adults.

For instance, while a majority of Democrats consistently disapprove of Trump’s conduct, with 85% expressing dislike in recent polls [3], the situation among Republicans is more nuanced. Initially, in August 2017, only 30% of Republicans said they liked Trump’s conduct, but by May 2018, this number had increased to 38% [9]. However, even within the Republican party, there are divisions: conservative Republicans are more likely to approve of Trump’s conduct (44%) compared to moderate or liberal Republicans (25%) [6].\n\nRegarding the ethical standards of the Trump administration, the public's evaluation has remained largely negative. About 58% of respondents rated the ethical standards as not good or poor, with 36% rating them as poor [1]. This is notably lower than ratings for previous administrations, such as Reagan's in 1983 [1]. Among Republicans, conservative members are less critical, with only 15% expressing negative views, whereas about a third of moderate and liberal Republicans criticize the ethical standards [11].\n\nIn terms of approval ratings, the data from a bar chart shows that Trump's approval was 39% in May 2018, which is lower than the approval rates of other presidents like Obama (49%) and Reagan (64%) during their respective periods [image1]. This indicates a relatively low level of public approval for Trump compared to his predecessors.\n\nThe bar chart comparing opinions among Republicans and Democrats in May 2018 and August 2017 reveals a shift in sentiment. In May 2018, 80% of Republicans and Republican leaners agreed with Trump on many or all issues, up from 69% in August 2017 [image2]. This suggests a growing alignment with Trump's policies among his base.\n\nFurthermore, the bar chart showing ratings divided into categories such as Poor, Not good, Good, and Excellent highlights the stark differences between groups. While 58% of the total population rated the ethical standards as not good or poor, 86% of Democrats and Democratic leaners gave low marks, compared to only 22% of Republicans and Republican leaners [image3].\n\nThe bar chart evaluating different tasks also provides insight into how the public perceives Trump's performance. It shows varying levels of effectiveness across different areas, with some tasks receiving higher approval than others [image4]. However, the overall trend indicates a general lack of confidence in Trump's leadership.\n\nIn conclusion, the opinions among Republicans and Democrats regarding Trump's conduct and the ethical standards of his administration have evolved over time, with Democrats consistently showing strong disapproval and Republicans showing a more mixed response, particularly along ideological lines. ![The image shows a bar chart comparing opinions among Republicans and Democrats in May 2018 and August 2017.](image2)"}

According to the text, $39\\%$ of the public rate the ethical standards of top Trump administration officials as excellent or good, while $58\\%$ rate them as not good or poor [7]. This is significantly lower than the ratings for previous administrations, such as Ronald Reagan’s in 1983 [11]. The data suggests that the public has a much more negative view of the ethical standards of the Trump administration than of earlier ones.\n\n![The public has lower approval of the ethical standards of the Trump administration compared to past administrations](image11)\n\nThis low rating of ethical standards appears to be linked to the public's overall approval of Trump's job performance. While the public's evaluation of how Trump is handling his job as president has remained relatively stable over time, it is generally low. For instance, $42\\%$ of the public disapprove of Trump's job performance very strongly, while $12\\%$ disapprove not so strongly [4]. Additionally, $86\\%$ of Democrats say the ethical standards of key administration members are not good or poor, with $61\\%$ rating them as poor [12]. These figures indicate that the negative perception of the administration's ethical standards contributes to the overall low approval of Trump's performance.\n\n![The public's disapproval of Trump's job performance is high, with many expressing strong disapproval](image4)\n\nIn summary, the approval ratings of Trump's administration officials' ethical standards are significantly lower than those of past administrations, and this low rating is closely tied to the public's overall disapproval of Trump's job performance."}

This suggests that there is a relatively balanced perception of ethical standards between the two major parties. However, text quote [9] adds that independents are significantly more likely than partisans to say neither party has “high ethical standards,” with 34% of independents, including equal shares of Republican and Democratic leaners, expressing this view. This indicates that political affiliation plays a role in shaping perceptions of ethical standards, with partisans being more likely to hold positive views of their own party.\n\nText quote [12] further explores the relationship between education and perceptions of ethical standards. It states that among those with at least a college degree, 31% say “high ethical standards” does not describe either party, 43% say it describes one but not the other, and 17% think it describes both. This suggests that higher education levels may lead to more nuanced or critical views of both parties’ ethical standards.\n\nIn terms of approval ratings for Trump, text quote [8] notes that the public’s evaluation of his job performance has remained relatively stable over time, similar to the early days of his presidency. Text quote [10] reveals a gender gap in approval ratings, with 48% of men approving of Trump’s performance compared to 30% of women. Additionally, text quote [2] emphasizes that younger adults, those with higher levels of education, and non-whites are more likely to disapprove of Trump's job performance, indicating that both age and education level influence approval ratings.\n\nLooking at the image quotes, image1 provides a visual representation of disapproval and approval ratings across various demographic groups, including gender, race, age, education level, political affiliation, and religious affiliation. The bar graph allows for easy comparison of these percentages, reinforcing the idea that different demographic factors, including education and political affiliation, significantly affect opinions on Trump.\n\nImage6 offers insights into how different groups perceive the ethical standards of the two major parties. The chart shows that the percentage of people who believe neither party has high ethical standards varies by education level and political affiliation. For instance, the data suggests that individuals with lower educational attainment are less likely to believe that neither party has high ethical standards.\n\nImage5 provides a visual breakdown of opinions on Trump, categorized by political affiliation. It shows that 38% of Republicans/Lean Republicans \"like\" Trump, while 85% of Democrats/Lean Democrats \"don't like\" him. This stark contrast underscores the strong partisan divide in approval ratings.\n\nFinally, image7 includes a bar chart showing approval ratings of U.S. presidents over various years, including Trump's approval rating in May 2018 at 39%. While this data is not directly tied to educational levels or political affiliations, it provides context for understanding how Trump's approval ratings have fluctuated over time.\n\n![The image is a bar graph showing disapproval and approval ratings among different demographic groups.](image1)\n\n![The image is a bar chart comparing perceptions of the Republican and Democratic parties among U.S. adults.](image8)\n\n![The image is a bar chart showing approval ratings of U.S. presidents over various years.](image7)\n\nIn conclusion, educational levels and political affiliations significantly impact perceptions of ethical standards and approval ratings of Trump, with partisans generally holding more favorable views of their own party and higher education levels often correlating with more critical or nuanced perspectives."}

This is similar to the reactions after Obama's re-election in 2012, but less positive than after his first campaign in 2008 [2]. In contrast, eight years earlier, 69% of voters felt hopeful about Obama’s election, while only 35% felt uneasy [12].\n\nOne key difference was the level of surprise among voters. Overall, 73% of all voters said they were surprised that Trump won, including 87% of Clinton voters. Only 40% of Trump voters said they were not surprised by the outcome [3]. This indicates a significant divide between supporters of the two candidates.\n\nEmotionally, the reactions to Trump's victory were mixed. While 51% of voters felt hopeful, 53% felt uneasy, and 41% each felt sad or scared [9].

Image3 shows that Trump voters predominantly felt hopeful (96%) and proud (74%), whereas Clinton voters were mostly uneasy (90%), sad (77%), and scared (76%) [3]. This highlights the deep polarization in public sentiment following the election.\n\nVoter satisfaction also varied significantly. For instance, 97% of Trump voters were satisfied with the outcome, while only 15% of Clinton voters were satisfied [7].

Additionally, Clinton voters are more divided on Trump’s vision and goals. Only 14% of Clinton voters believe they have a good idea of where Trump wants to lead the country, while 84% think his goals are not very clear [8].

However, there is a significant difference between Trump and Clinton voters: 83% of Trump voters support working with him, compared to only 35% of Clinton voters [4]. This reflects the broader polarization in political attitudes, where supporters of the winning candidate tend to be more satisfied with the outcome, while those of the losing candidate are more critical.\n\nIn summary, the political orientations of Democratic and Republican voters have shifted over time, with Republicans consistently favoring a more conservative direction and Democrats becoming more divided between liberal and moderate stances. These changes are reflected in their reactions to the 2016 election outcomes, with Republican voters expressing greater satisfaction and Democratic voters showing more dissatisfaction."}

In 2008, as Barack Obama was preparing to enter office, nearly eight-in-ten (78%) of his voters said that Democratic leaders in Washington should work with Republicans even at the risk of disappointing their supporters, and a similar proportion of McCain’s voters (76%) said the same [6]. This indicates a strong preference for bipartisanship during Obama's transition. In contrast, by 2016, the sentiment had shifted significantly. Nearly two-thirds of Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters (65%) said “Democratic leaders should stand up to Donald Trump on issues that are important to Democratic supporters, even if it means less gets done in Washington,” while only 32% wanted the party’s leaders to work with Trump if it meant disappointing Democrats [12].\n\nThe image data further supports this shift. In 2008, majorities favored the party’s leaders moving in a more moderate direction [11], whereas in 2016, Democratic voters were more supportive of moving in a more liberal direction than they were after previous elections [4]. Additionally, in 2016, only 59% of all voters believed Democratic leaders should work with Trump, while 39% felt they should stand up to him [8]. This is a stark contrast to the 2008 election, where 74% of all voters believed Republican leaders should work with Obama, and 22% felt they should stand up to him [8].\n\n![The percentage of voters who believe political leaders should work with or stand up to newly elected presidents in 2008 and 2016](image8)\n\nThese differences highlight a growing polarization in political attitudes, with a stronger emphasis on partisanship in 2016 compared to 2008."}

According to the text quotes, voters overwhelmingly viewed the campaign as more negative than in previous elections, with 92% of voters stating there was more mudslinging or negative campaigning compared to past contests [2]. This perception is visually reinforced by the line graph (image1), which shows a sharp rise in the percentage of voters who believed there was \"more mudslinging\" in the 2016 election, reaching 92%, far exceeding the previous high of 72% in 2004. The graph also highlights a corresponding drop in the percentage of voters who felt there was \"less mudslinging,\" falling to just 4% in 2016.\n\nThis heightened negativity influenced how voters evaluated various political entities. Both the Republican and Democratic parties received their lowest grades ever, with only 22% and 26% of voters giving them an A or B, respectively [3]. Similarly, the press and pollsters were given poor grades, with just 22% and 21% of voters awarding them A or B grades, while a substantial portion gave failing grades [7]. These low evaluations are consistent with the overall negative sentiment expressed by voters, as noted in quote [4], which states that post-election evaluations of the winning candidate, the parties, the press, and the pollsters were all far more negative than after any election dating back to 1988.\n\nFurthermore, the emotional responses of voters reflected this negativity. A bar chart (image5) illustrates that nearly half of all voters felt \"uneasy\" (53%) or \"hopeful\" (51%) about Trump’s victory, while others reported feeling \"sad\" (41%), \"scared\" (41%), or \"angry\" (31%). Among Clinton voters, the emotions were predominantly negative, with 90% feeling uneasy, 77% feeling sad, and 76% feeling scared [8]. These emotional reactions underscore the polarizing nature of the campaign and its lasting impact on public sentiment.\n\nIn addition, the perception of negativity extended to the evaluation of voters themselves, with only 40% giving \"the voters\" an A or B grade, the lowest percentage since 1996 [11]. This self-criticism further highlights the widespread dissatisfaction with the overall conduct of the campaign.\n\n![The line graph shows a sharp increase in the percentage of voters who believe there was more mudslinging in the 2016 election compared to previous years.](image1)  \n![The bar chart illustrates the emotional reactions of voters to Trump's victory, with many reporting feelings of unease, hope, sadness, and fear.](image5)  \n\nIn summary, the high levels of perceived negativity in the 2016 election directly influenced voter perceptions of political entities, leading to widespread dissatisfaction and poor evaluations of the parties, the press, pollsters, and even the voters themselves."}

Additionally, 96% of Trump voters felt hopeful, and 74% felt proud [5]. In contrast, Clinton voters predominantly expressed negative emotions, with \"shocked\" being the most frequent response, followed by \"disappointed\" and \"disgusted\" [10]. A significant majority of Clinton voters felt uneasy (90%), sad (77%), and scared (76%) about Trump’s victory, while only 7% felt hopeful and 1% felt proud [5].\n\nThese emotional responses can be linked to the overall perception of Trump's performance and the level of mudslinging in the election. According to survey data, Trump received an A or B grade from 30% of voters, with an average grade of C- [11]. This suggests that while a portion of voters viewed Trump positively, many others had a more critical perspective. The perception of mudslinging was particularly high, with 92% of voters believing there was more negative campaigning than in past elections, a record high compared to the previous high of 72% after the 2004 election [7]. This intense negativity likely contributed to the mixed emotional reactions among voters.\n\n![The bar chart shows the percentage of voters who feel various emotions related to Trump's election, including Hopeful (51%), Proud (36%), Uneasy (53%), Sad (41%), Scared (41%), and Angry (31).](image8)\n\nThe emotional divide between Trump and Clinton voters is further highlighted by the survey results on public perception of political entities. For instance, the Republican Party received an A or B from only 22% of voters, with an average grade of D+, while the Democratic Party received an A or B from 26% of voters, with an average grade of C- [11].

In contrast, Clinton voters predominantly expressed feelings of \"shocked,\" \"disappointed,\" and \"disgusted,\" highlighting their strong negative reaction to Trump's victory [10]. These responses indicate that Clinton supporters had higher expectations for a different outcome, which were not met.\n\nThe data also reveals that a significant majority of voters, including both Trump and Clinton supporters, were surprised by the election result. Specifically, 73% of all voters, 87% of Clinton voters, and 60% of Trump voters reported being surprised by Trump's victory [2]. This shared sense of surprise underscores the unpredictability of the election and the gap between public expectations and the actual outcome.\n\nIn terms of emotional reactions, the data shows that 51% of voters felt \"hopeful\" about Trump's victory, while 36% felt \"proud.\" However, 53% of voters felt \"uneasy,\" and 41% felt \"sad\" or \"scared\" [9]. These mixed emotions highlight the polarizing effect of Trump's victory on the electorate. The emotional landscape was further reflected in the bar chart showing the percentages of voters who felt various emotions, where \"Uneasy\" was the most prevalent emotion [4].\n\nThe image quote provides additional context by illustrating the perception of mudslinging in elections over time. The line graph shows an increasing trend in the perception that there was more mudslinging in recent elections, with 92% of voters in 2016 saying there was more mudslinging compared to 68% in 1992 [image1]. This suggests that the 2016 election was perceived as more negative and contentious than previous elections, which may have contributed to the emotional reactions of voters.\n\nAnother image, the bar chart comparing the levels of surprise among different voter groups, further supports the idea that the election outcome was unexpected. The data shows that 27% of all voters were not surprised by Trump's victory, while 73% were surprised. Among Trump voters, 40% were not surprised, and 60% were surprised. Among Clinton voters, only 12% were not surprised, while 87% were surprised [image6]. This disparity in surprise levels highlights the differing expectations and perceptions between the two groups of voters.\n\nIn conclusion, the emotional reactions to Trump's victory reveal a stark divide between Trump and Clinton voters, with Trump supporters generally expressing more positive emotions and Clinton supporters expressing more negative ones. This divergence in emotional responses reflects the contrasting expectations and sentiments of the two groups prior to the election. ![The emotional reactions to Trump's victory show a stark divide between Trump and Clinton voters, with Trump supporters generally expressing more positive emotions and Clinton supporters expressing more negative ones.](image6)"}

To answer this, we can look at the relevant text and image quotes that provide insight into these specific aspects.\n\nFirst, let’s consider the sentiments towards Trump's victory. According to the text, a significant portion of voters were surprised by Trump's win, with 73% of all voters expressing surprise, including 87% of Clinton voters and 60% of Trump voters [1]. This is further supported by image1, which visually represents the levels of surprise among different voter groups. The bar chart shows that 27% of all voters were not surprised, while 73% were surprised. For Trump voters, 40% were not surprised, and 60% were surprised. For Clinton voters, only 12% were not surprised, and 87% were surprised [image1].\n\nIn terms of emotional reactions, image3 provides a detailed breakdown of emotions felt by Trump and Clinton voters. Trump voters predominantly felt hopeful (96%) and proud (74%), while Clinton voters felt uneasy (90%), sad (77%), scared (76%), and angry (62%) [image3].

According to the data, Americans’ ratings of the government’s efforts to reduce the threat of terrorism are now lower than at any point since the September 2001 terrorist attacks. For the first time, more people (52%) say the government is doing not too well or not at all well in reducing the threat of terrorism, compared to those who say it is doing very or fairly well (46%). Positive ratings have fallen 26 points since January, when 72% said very/fairly well [2].\n\nThe shift in public opinion has been influenced by various factors, including the revelations about NSA surveillance programs by Edward Snowden in 2013. Concern over government restrictions on civil liberties has fallen dramatically since July 2013, following these disclosures. At that time, more expressed concern that government policies had gone too far restricting civil liberties (47%) than that they did not go far enough to protect the country (35%) [12]. However, the trend has reversed, with more people now expressing concern that the policies have not gone far enough to protect the country.\n\n![The line graph shows a shift in public opinion over time regarding whether anti-terrorism policies have gone too far or not far enough.](image1)\n\nPolitical affiliation plays a significant role in shaping these perceptions. Evaluations of the government’s job reducing the threat of terrorism are more positive among those with a postgraduate degree than among other educational groups [9]. Additionally, the views of conservative Republicans have turned sharply critical: In January, 59% said the government was doing very well or fairly well; today, only 18% say this [11]. On the other hand, Democrats have shown a slight increase in their concern that the policies have not gone far enough to protect the country, with 54% now expressing this view [5].\n\n![The line graph illustrates how each political group's metrics have changed over time.](image2)\n\nAge also influences these perceptions. Older and less educated Americans are somewhat more likely than younger and more highly educated Americans to give the government low marks for the job it is doing reducing the threat of terrorism [4]. Specifically, among those 50 and older, a majority (57%) say the government is not doing well reducing the terrorist threat, while 46% of younger adults (those 18-29 years old) give the government’s performance a negative rating [6]. The data further reveals that older individuals (50+) are more likely to feel that the government has not gone far enough to protect the country, with 71% expressing this concern, compared to 44% of younger adults [8].\n\n![The table shows how different age groups perceive the balance between civil liberties and national protection.](image8)\n\nIn summary, public perceptions of government efforts to combat terrorism have become increasingly negative over time, with significant variations based on political affiliation and age group."}

This suggests that older individuals are more likely to express dissatisfaction with the government's performance in this area. Additionally, text quote [11] reinforces this point, stating that older, less educated individuals give more negative ratings of government efforts against terrorism.

According to the text quotes, 68% of Republicans say Islam is more likely to encourage violence, which is a historical high [12]. In contrast, only 30% of Democrats hold this view, down from 42% in September 2014 [12]. This significant gap highlights the polarization of opinions along political lines.

The light brown line for Independents starts at 26% in 2002 and increases slightly to 45% in 2015. ![This graph illustrates the increasing association of Republicans with the belief that Islam encourages violence, while Democrats show a decline in this belief.](image1)\n\nIn addition to these views on Islam, public opinion on which political party is better at handling terrorism also shows a clear partisan divide. According to the data, 46% of the public believes the Republican Party can do better in dealing with the terrorist threat at home, compared to 34% who favor the Democrats [8]. This suggests that while Republicans are seen as more capable in addressing terrorism, their association with the belief that Islam encourages violence has grown over time.\n\nThe bar chart (image4) further highlights this divide, showing that 49% of Republicans believe individuals should be subject to more scrutiny because of their religion, compared to 20% of Democrats. This reflects a broader ideological split in how different political groups view religious scrutiny and its implications for national security.\n\nFinally, the chart comparing perceptions of political party capabilities (image5) shows that the Republican Party is viewed as stronger on issues like terrorism, with 46% of respondents believing they can do better, compared to 34% for the Democrats. This aligns with the growing association between Republicans and the belief that Islam encourages violence, suggesting a correlation between party affiliation and views on both terrorism and religion.\n\nIn summary, perceptions of Islam encouraging violence have shifted over time, with Republicans increasingly associating Islam with violence, while Democrats have become less likely to do so. These changes reflect a growing partisan divide, which is mirrored in public opinions on which party is better equipped to handle terrorism."}

These differences are closely tied to the perceived importance of terrorism as a national issue.\n\nAccording to the data, **Conservative Republicans** stand out as the only major group in which a majority (57%) supports greater scrutiny of Muslims due to their religion, while **liberal Democrats** are the most opposed, with 87% saying Muslims should not face additional scrutiny [3][5]. This divide is also reflected in the **bar chart (image5)**, which shows that **Republicans** are more likely to support scrutiny (49%) compared to **Independents** (31%) and **Democrats** (20%). The chart also highlights that **liberal Democrats** are the most against scrutiny, with 87% opposing it [5].\n\nAge plays a significant role as well. **Younger individuals (18-29)** are the most opposed to scrutiny, with 80% saying Muslims should not face additional scrutiny because of their religion, while **those aged 50 and older** are more divided, with 50% supporting scrutiny and 41% opposing it [10][11]. The **bar chart (image1)** reinforces this, showing that younger people perceive the most scrutiny (80%), while those over 50 perceive the least (50%).\n\nRace and ethnicity also influence opinions. **Non-whites**, particularly **Black individuals (74%)** and **Hispanics (66%)**, are more likely than **whites (57%)** to reject the idea of scrutinizing Muslims based on religion [4]. The **bar chart (image1)** reflects this, with **Blacks** and **Hispanics** showing higher opposition to scrutiny compared to **whites**.\n\nEducation level also affects views. **Postgraduates (69%)** and **college graduates (65%)** are more likely to oppose scrutiny, while those without a college degree are more divided, with 34% supporting scrutiny and 59% opposing it [7]. The **bar chart (image1)** illustrates this trend, showing that those with higher education levels are more opposed to scrutiny.\n\nNow, how does this relate to the **perceived importance of terrorism**? According to the data, **Republicans** are more likely to prioritize **terrorism, defense issues, and national security** as the most important problems facing the nation, with 41% of Republicans citing these issues, compared to 28% of independents and 23% of Democrats [6]. The **line graph (image3)** shows that perceptions of whether Muslims are \"more likely than others to encourage violence among its believers\" have increased from 25% in 2002 to 45% in 2015, indicating a growing concern about the relationship between religion and violence. This aligns with the increased focus on **terrorism and national security** among **Republicans**.\n\nAdditionally, the **table (image6)** shows that concerns about **terrorism** increased from 1% in December 2014 to 18% in December 2015, suggesting a growing public awareness or fear of terrorism. This increase may contribute to the **greater support for scrutiny among Republicans**, who are more likely to view terrorism as a critical issue.\n\nIn summary, **perceptions of scrutiny of Muslims vary widely across political and demographic groups**, with **Conservative Republicans** being the most supportive of scrutiny and **liberal Democrats** and **young, non-white, and highly educated individuals** being the most opposed. These differences are closely linked to the **perceived importance of terrorism**, as **Republicans** are more likely to prioritize terrorism and national security, which may influence their views on Muslim scrutiny. \n\n![Perceptions of scrutiny of Muslims differ across political and demographic groups, with Conservatives more likely to support scrutiny and Liberals more likely to oppose it](image5)"}

For instance, quote [4] states that Americans’ ratings of the government’s efforts to reduce the threat of terrorism are now lower than at any point since the September 2001 terrorist attacks. It notes that for the first time, more people now say the government is doing not too well or not at all well in reducing the threat of terrorism (52%) than say it is doing either very or fairly well (46%). This indicates a significant shift in perception over time. Furthermore, quote [8] highlights that by two-to-one, Americans now say they are more concerned that the government’s anti-terror policies have not gone far enough to protect the country (56%) rather than that these policies have gone too far in restricting the average person’s civil liberties (28%). This suggests a growing concern about the adequacy of current anti-terrorism measures.\n\nLooking at image quotes, image7 provides a line graph that illustrates this shift in public opinion over time. The graph shows a change from 49% feeling the country hasn't gone far enough in 2004 to 56% in 2015, while those who believe it has gone too far increased from 29% to 28%. The lines intersect around 2010-2011, indicating a turning point in public sentiment.\n\nWhen considering how these perceptions differ among various demographic and political groups, we can refer to several text quotes. Quote [1] mentions that older and less educated Americans are somewhat more likely than younger and more highly educated Americans to give the government low marks for the job it is doing reducing the threat of terrorism. Similarly, quote [9] reiterates that older, less educated individuals give more negative ratings of government efforts against terrorism. Quote [11] adds that among those 50 and older, a majority (57%) say the government is not doing well reducing the terrorist threat, compared to 46% of younger adults (those 18-29 years old) who give the government’s performance a negative rating.\n\nPolitical affiliation also plays a role in these perceptions. Quote [6] indicates wide partisan divides on the most important problem facing the nation, with 41% of Republicans mentioning terrorism, defense issues, and national security or ISIS, while fewer independents (28%) and Democrats (23%) cite these issues. Additionally, quote [12] shows that assessments of government efforts to combat terrorism are more negative across the political spectrum compared to early 2015. Democrats are now the only partisan group in which a majority (64%) say the government is doing at least fairly well, down from 85% in January. Independents' positive ratings have dropped 25 points, from 69% to 44%, and just 27% of Republicans now say the government is doing very or fairly well reducing the terrorist threat, down from 63% at the beginning of the year.\n\nIn summary, perceptions of terrorism and government efforts to combat it have shifted significantly over time, with increasing concerns about the adequacy of current anti-terrorism measures. These perceptions vary among different demographic and political groups, with older and less educated individuals, as well as certain political affiliations, showing more negative views of the government's performance. ![Terrorism and government efforts to combat it have shifted significantly over time, with increasing concerns about the adequacy of current anti-terrorism measures.](image7)"}

On terrorism, Republicans are more likely to see overwhelming military force as the best way to defeat terrorism, with a $72\\%$ - $18\\%$ margin, while Democrats are far more likely to say that relying too much on force creates hatred that leads to more terrorism than to say using overwhelming military force is the best way to defeat terrorism around the world $(66\\%–27\\%)$ [4]. Additionally, there are wide partisan differences on the question of force and global terrorism, with Republicans being more inclined to support military force over diplomatic approaches [4].\n\nOn economic issues, the data shows that Republicans and Democrats have different priorities. According to the survey results, Republicans prioritize defense/national security, immigration, and terrorism more than Democrats do. Specifically, 14% of Republicans cite immigration as the most important problem, compared to 3% of Democrats [8]. Meanwhile, Democrats are more likely to cite partisan gridlock and division in the country as the most important issue, with 8% of Democrats versus 2% of Republicans [8]. The survey also indicates that the net percentage for economic issues has decreased from 34% to 23%, suggesting that economic concerns have become less prominent across the political spectrum [7].\n\nFurthermore, the survey highlights that the views of conservative Republicans have turned sharply critical of the government's efforts to combat terrorism. In January, 59% said the government was doing very well or fairly well, but today only 18% say this [5]. This decline in confidence is reflected in the broader public opinion, where assessments of government efforts to combat terrorism are now lower than at any point since the September 2001 terrorist attacks [7].\n\n![The image shows a line graph comparing two perspectives over time: \"Not gone far enough to protect country\" (light yellow line) and \"Gone too far restricting civil liberties\" (dark yellow line).](image6)\n\nIn summary, Republicans tend to prioritize national security and military solutions to terrorism, while Democrats emphasize the risks of overreliance on force and are more concerned with domestic issues like economic stability and political division."}

This indicates that Republicans are more likely to view terrorism as a critical issue.\n\nThese differing views on the importance of terrorism are closely linked to their perceptions of the government's efforts to address the threat. For instance, while 64% of Democrats say the government is doing at least fairly well in reducing the terrorist threat, only 27% of Republicans hold this view [5]. This stark contrast suggests that Republicans are less satisfied with the government's performance in combating terrorism, which may be influenced by their higher prioritization of the issue.\n\nMoreover, the data reveals that there has been a significant drop in positive ratings of government efforts to reduce the terrorist threat across the political spectrum. For example, among conservative Republicans, the percentage who believe the government is doing very well or fairly well has dropped from 59% in January to just 18% [7]. This decline in confidence could be attributed to the increasing importance placed on terrorism by this group.\n\n![The graph illustrates a shift in public opinion over time, showing how perceptions of the balance between civil liberties and national protection have changed.](image4)\n\nIn addition, the survey results indicate that Americans are more concerned that anti-terror policies have not gone far enough to protect the country (56%) rather than that these policies have gone too far in restricting civil liberties (28%) [11].

While Republicans prioritize terrorism more and express less satisfaction with the government's response, Democrats and Independents place less emphasis on the issue and are more likely to view the government's efforts positively.

For instance, 74% of Republicans prefer a smaller government, while 73% of Democrats favor a bigger government. Independents fall in between, with 47% preferring a smaller government and 44% preferring a bigger one. This division is also reflected in their views on government regulation of business. A majority of independents (48%) believe that government regulation is necessary to protect the public interest, while 43% think it does more harm than good.

Over time, the proportion of independents who hold unfavorable views of both parties has increased, reflecting broader trends of polarization in American politics.\n\nAccording to the data from 1994 to 2018, the percentage of all independents who viewed both parties unfavorably rose from 24% to 56% [image8]. This trend is consistent with the overall increase in negative partisanship, where individuals increasingly express strong disapproval of the opposing party. However, this rise was not uniform across all independent subgroups. For example, the share of independents who do not lean toward a party and view both parties unfavorably reached 37% [4], which is significantly higher than the 28% of all independents who hold such views. This suggests that non-lean independents are more likely to be disillusioned with both major parties compared to those who lean toward one of them.\n\nAmong independents who lean toward a party, the trends differ based on their lean. The percentage of Republican-leaning independents with an unfavorable view of the Democratic Party increased from 15% in 1994 to 39% in 2018 [5]. Similarly, the percentage of Democratic-leaning independents with an unfavorable view of the Republican Party rose from 8% in 1994 to 37% in 2018 [5]. These increases indicate that even within the independent population, those who lean toward a party are becoming more polarized in their views of the opposing party over time.\n\nIn contrast, the share of independents who view both parties negatively has declined in recent years. In 2015, more than a third of independents (36%) held unfavorable views of both parties, but this figure has since decreased [8]. This decline may reflect shifting public sentiment or changes in how individuals perceive the two major parties.\n\nThe Pew Research Center chart [image1] also highlights that independents, especially those who do not lean toward a party, are more likely to believe the government system unfairly favors powerful interests. Specifically, 66% of independents and 70% of those with no political lean think the system is unfair, compared to 29% of Republicans and 85% of Democrats. This perception of unfairness may contribute to the growing number of independents who hold unfavorable views of both parties.\n\nFurthermore, the survey data from image5 shows that the percentage of independents who are unfavorable to both parties is 28%, while for those who do not lean toward a party, it is 37%.

For instance, the share of Democratic-leaning independents with a very unfavorable opinion of the Republican Party has more than quadrupled, rising from 8% in 1994 to 37% in 2018. Similarly, the share of Republican leaners with a very unfavorable opinion of the Democratic Party increased from 15% in 1994 to 39% in 2018 [4].

Another 22% have favorable opinions of both parties, while 11% view the Democratic Party favorably, and about 9% have a favorable view of the GOP [12].

In 2020, 83% of Republicans had an unfavorable view of China, compared to 68% of Democrats [1]. This gap has widened over time, with negative views among Republicans increasing by 11 percentage points in the past four months, while Democrats saw a 6-point increase, resulting in a 15-point gap between the parties [8].

Older Americans, particularly those aged 50 and older, have become increasingly negative toward China. In 2020, 81% of this group expressed an unfavorable view, which is a 10-point increase since March of the same year [5]. This trend is reflected in a line graph showing the rise in unfavorable views for the \"50 and older\" group from 34% in 2005 to 81% in 2020 [5]. In contrast, younger age groups, such as those under 30, have lower rates of unfavorable views, with 56% expressing this sentiment [5].\n\nThe trends are further illustrated in a bar chart that highlights the distribution of unfavorable and favorable views across different age groups and political affiliations. For example, 83% of Republicans/Lean Republicans had an unfavorable view, while only 15% had a favorable view. Among Democrats/Lean Democrats, 68% had an unfavorable view, and 25% had a favorable view [6].

However, both parties rank Germany similarly, placing it fifth or second in importance [2]. Additionally, there is a notable difference in how partisans view cooperation with other countries. For instance, 69% of Americans want more cooperation with Germany, while only half of Germans express the same desire regarding the U.S. [8]. This divergence highlights differing priorities and perceptions of international relations.\n\n![Americans and Germans have different views on cooperation with each other.](image2)\n\nIn Germany, political affiliations also play a role, though the differences are less dramatic. Supporters of the Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union (CDU/CSU), the Social Democratic Party (SPD), and the Greens tend to name France as their top or second-most important partner, followed by the U.S. [7]. However, there are still variations in preferences for cooperation with specific countries. For example, supporters of the CDU/CSU are more willing to cooperate with the U.S. than those who support the Greens and the SPD [12].

However, the share among Republicans who think the U.S.’s European allies should increase their defense budgets has fallen by 14 percentage points between 2017 and 2019. There has also been a more modest decline in this view among Democrats [2]. In contrast, Germans are divided between increasing or maintaining budgets, with about four in ten taking each view. Like in the U.S., views on this issue in Germany have changed since 2017. At that time, about half of Germans were content with their country’s defense spending, while about a third felt it should be increased [7]. Additionally, fewer Americans see a need for European allies to increase national defense spending, but Germans are divided between increasing or maintaining budgets [8].\n\nThe image quote provides visual evidence of these trends. The line graph (image1) shows a decline in the percentage of both Republicans and Democrats who believe the U.S.’s European allies should increase their defense budgets from 2017 to 2019. The \"Republican/Lean Rep\" line declined from 62 to 48, while the \"Democrat/Lean Dem\" line showed a slight decline from 34 to 28 [image1].\n\nThe perception of the U.S.-Germany relationship varies significantly across age demographics. Young people in both countries have the most positive views of the U.S.-Germany relationship. In the U.S., 82% of people ages 18 to 29 say the relationship is good, compared with 73% of those ages 65 and older. Similarly, in Germany, four in ten young people say relations with the U.S. are good, compared with only 31% of those 65 and older [11]. The bar chart (image3) illustrates this age demographic difference, showing that the youngest age group (18-29) has the highest percentage of positive views in both countries, while the oldest age group (65+) has the lowest. The chart indicates a consistent 9% difference between the youngest and oldest age groups in both countries [image3].\n\nThe image quote further supports this trend. The two line graphs (image2) show that U.S. respondents generally had a more positive view of the bilateral relations over the years 2017 to 2019, while German respondents had a more negative view. However, both groups saw an improvement from 2018 to 2019 [image2].\n\nIn summary, American and German perceptions differ significantly on the necessity of military force and defense spending, with Americans being more supportive of military action and defense spending. Age demographics also play a crucial role, with younger people in both countries having more positive views of the U.S.-Germany relationship. The data highlights the complex interplay between political ideology, age, and public opinion on security issues. \n\n![The line graph shows a decline in the percentage of both Republicans and Democrats who believe the U.S.’s European allies should increase their defense budgets from 2017 to 2019.](image1)\n\n![The two line graphs show that U.S. respondents generally had a more positive view of the bilateral relations over the years 2017 to 2019, while German respondents had a more negative view.](image2)\n\n![The horizontal bar chart illustrates that the youngest age group (18-29) has the highest percentage of positive views in both countries, while the oldest age group (65+) has the lowest.](image3)"}

These distinctions are reflected in both textual data and visual representations.\n\nTextual evidence highlights that Americans, particularly those on the right, are more inclined to support the use of military force. For instance, nine-in-ten American conservatives believe military force is necessary, compared to only 65% of liberals [1]. In Germany, nearly six-in-ten adults on the right see military force as necessary, while only about a third on the left agree [1]. This ideological divide is further emphasized by the fact that about eight-in-ten Americans believe it is sometimes necessary to use military force to maintain order in the world, whereas only about half of Germans agree [3].\n\nThe differing perspectives on defense spending are also evident. While fewer Americans see a need for European allies to increase their defense spending, Germans are divided between increasing or maintaining budgets [2]. However, there has been a notable shift in U.S. opinion, with half of Americans now saying their allies should keep spending levels the same, a change from 45% in 2017 who believed their allies should dedicate more resources to national defense [12]. In contrast, Germans remain split, with about four-in-ten wanting to increase defense spending and an equal number preferring to maintain current levels [9].\n\nVisual evidence complements this analysis. Image1, a horizontal bar chart comparing age group differences in percentages, shows that younger Americans (18-29) have the highest percentage (82%) supporting military action, while older Germans (65+) have the lowest (28%) [image1]. This suggests that generational attitudes may influence views on military intervention. Image2, which compares the perceived importance of an unspecified subject, indicates that a higher percentage of U.S. respondents view the subject as \"Very important\" (56%) compared to German respondents (15%) [image2], highlighting a broader cultural difference in prioritizing security issues.\n\nImage3 further illustrates the divergence in opinions on whether something should or should not be done, with 60% of Americans believing it \"Should\" be done, versus 34% of Germans [image3]. This could reflect a general tendency among Americans to favor proactive measures, including military interventions, compared to Germans, who are more cautious.\n\nIn terms of defense spending, image5, a comparative bar chart, shows that U.S. public opinion on European allies' defense spending has shifted over time, with a decline in support for increasing spending from 45% in 2017 to 35% in 2019 [image5]. Similarly, German public opinion on their own defense spending has fluctuated, with 40% supporting an increase in 2019, compared to 32% in 2017 [image5]. These trends suggest evolving attitudes toward defense spending in both countries.\n\nAdditionally, image7, a line graph showing trends for political affiliations, indicates a decline in support for Republican/Lean Rep (from 62 in 2017 to 48 in 2019) and Democrat/Lean Dem (from 34 in 2017 to 28 in 2019) [image7]. This could imply a shift in political priorities related to defense and foreign policy.\n\nIn conclusion, American and German opinions on military intervention and defense spending differ significantly, with Americans generally more supportive of military action and defense spending, while Germans exhibit more caution and division on these issues. ![Differences in military intervention and defense spending between Americans and Germans](image1)"}

In the U.S., public opinion has shifted toward a preference for maintaining current levels of defense spending rather than increasing it. According to the data from 2017 to 2019, the percentage of Americans who believed that European allies should increase their defense spending decreased from 45% in 2017 to 35% in 2019 [3]. This trend is reflected in the bar chart (image1), which shows a decline in support for increasing defense spending among Americans over the three-year period.\n\nIn contrast, Germans have shown a more divided stance on defense spending. While about 40% of Germans supported increasing defense spending in 2019, this was slightly lower than the 43% in 2018, and higher than the 32% in 2017 [8]. The same bar chart (image1) illustrates this fluctuation, showing that Germans were more likely to maintain current spending levels in 2017 compared to 2019. This suggests that while there has been some movement, the overall sentiment remains split between increasing and maintaining defense budgets.\n\nPartisan differences also play a significant role in shaping these opinions. In the U.S., Republicans and Republican-leaning independents are more likely to favor increased defense spending in Europe compared to Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents. However, there has been a decline in support for increased defense spending among both parties over time. For instance, the percentage of Republicans who believe that U.S. European allies should increase their defense budgets fell by 14 percentage points between 2017 and 2019 [9]. This shift is visualized in image2, which shows a decline in support for increased defense spending among both Republican and Democrat groups over the years.\n\nIn Germany, partisan differences are also evident. Supporters of the CDU/CSU are more inclined to support increased defense spending, with 51% of CDU/CSU supporters advocating for an increase, compared to 41% for the SPD and 28% for the Greens [11]. This variation in opinion across political parties is illustrated in image6, which displays the percentages of support for defense spending increases among the three major political parties in Germany.\n\nOverall, the data indicates that while both American and German public opinion on defense spending has evolved over the years, the nature of these changes differs. Americans have shown a growing preference for maintaining current levels of defense spending, while Germans remain divided. Additionally, partisan differences within each country highlight the complex dynamics influencing attitudes toward defense spending. \n\n![The image shows a comparative bar chart depicting the public opinion of Americans and Germans on national defense spending over the years 2017, 2018, and 2019.](image1)"}

For instance, Republicans and Republican-leaning independents are more likely than Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents to favor increased defense spending in Europe [2]. However, this support has seen a decline over the years, with a 14 percentage point drop among Republicans between 2017 and 2019, and a smaller decline among Democrats [2]. This suggests that while there is broad support for the American military presence in Germany across both parties, the intensity of this support may be waning.\n\nIn contrast, in Germany, political affiliation also plays a significant role in shaping opinions on defense spending. Supporters of the CDU/CSU are more inclined to support increased defense spending, with 51% expressing this view, while supporters of the Greens show more skepticism, with only 28% advocating for higher spending. The SPD falls in the middle, with 41% supporting an increase [9]. These differences reflect broader ideological divides, where those on the right tend to be more favorable toward the U.S. and more supportive of defense spending, while those on the left are more critical of both the U.S. and increased military expenditure.\n\nOver time, these opinions have evolved. In the U.S., the proportion of Republicans who believe that European allies should increase their defense budgets has decreased significantly, indicating a shift in priorities or perceptions of international security dynamics [2]. Similarly, in Germany, public opinion on defense spending has fluctuated, with a gradual increase in support for raising defense budgets from 2017 to 2019, although the majority still prefer maintaining current levels [8].\n\n![Support for increasing defense spending in Europe among U.S. political groups](image7)\n\nThe age demographic also influences views on defense-related issues.

In contrast, 61% of those aged 65 and older see the bases as important to Germany’s defense [10].

In contrast, younger Germans (ages 18-29) are more skeptical, with roughly six-in-ten thinking that U.S. military bases do not contribute to German national security [10]. This generational difference highlights how age can shape attitudes toward the presence of foreign military forces.\n\nIn the U.S., political affiliation plays a significant role in determining perceptions of foreign policy partners. Americans generally view the UK as their most important foreign policy partner, with Republicans and Democrats agreeing on this point. However, there are notable differences in preferences between the two parties. Republicans are more likely to name Israel as an important partner, while Democrats place greater emphasis on Canada and Mexico. Despite these differences, both Republicans and Democrats rank Germany as a top or second-most important foreign policy partner [9]. This suggests that while political ideology influences views on certain countries, there is a shared recognition of Germany's importance in U.S. foreign policy.\n\nThe image below illustrates the differing preferences of Republican and Democratic voters in the U.S. regarding foreign policy partners:\n\n![The image shows the percentage of Republican/Lean Republican and Democrat/Lean Democrat respondents who have favorable views of certain countries.](image1)\n\nAdditionally, the perception of the importance of U.S. military bases in Germany differs significantly between the two countries.

While 73% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents are critical of the U.S.'s response to the coronavirus outbreak, 71% of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents praise the country’s handling of the outbreak [11]. Furthermore, conservative Republicans are particularly likely to say China has not handled the crisis well, with 80% holding this view [4]. In contrast, liberal Democrats are more critical of the U.S.'s performance, with 81% believing the U.S. has done an only fair or poor job [12]. This ideological divide extends to opinions on whether the U.S. should help other countries deal with their problems. For instance, 64% of liberal Democrats support helping other nations, compared to 44% of conservative and moderate Democrats [3]. Similarly, about three-quarters of Republicans want the U.S. to focus on its own problems, with similar shares of conservatives and moderates taking this view [7].\n\nRegarding educational backgrounds, higher levels of education correlate with greater support for helping other nations deal with their problems. Six-in-ten postgraduates say the U.S. should help other countries, while college graduates are evenly split on this issue.

Specifically, fewer than half (44%) of those who think the U.S. can glean information from abroad say the country is doing an excellent or good job, compared with 63% of those who say the U.S. can’t learn much from overseas [4].\n\nThe same partisan divide is evident when evaluating China's handling of the pandemic. While half or more of people on both sides of the aisle say China has not done a good job dealing with the outbreak, Republicans are much more likely to hold this view than Democrats. Conservative Republicans are particularly likely to say China has not handled the crisis well: Eight-in-ten hold this view [9].

While 60% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents say the U.S. can learn a great deal, only 28% of Republicans and Republican leaners share that view. Similarly, text quote [8] emphasizes that those on the left are much more likely to think the country can learn a great deal from other nations: 67% of liberal Democrats hold this view, compared with only 25% of conservative Republicans.

The same pattern is found among Democrats, indicating that the belief in the effectiveness of other countries’ responses is tied to the willingness to learn from them.\n\nNow, looking at the image quotes, image3 provides a visual representation of trust levels in the WHO, EU, and Chinese government across different political groups. It shows that trust in the WHO increases significantly from Conservative Republicans (27%) to Liberal Democrats (86%), with a difference of +59%.

Republicans are more likely to believe that the U.S.’s influence will be strengthened, while Democrats are more likely to expect a weakening. Additionally, within the Democratic Party, liberals are more likely than conservatives and moderates to foresee a decline in U.S. influence. This suggests that political affiliation plays a crucial role in shaping perceptions of U.S. global standing.\n\nSimilarly, text quote [6] indicates a large partisan divide on how China’s influence will be affected by the coronavirus outbreak. Six-in-ten Republicans believe China’s influence will diminish, while only 40% of Democrats agree. This reflects a broader pattern where political affiliation significantly influences attitudes toward China's global role.\n\nText quote [9] adds that while half of Americans believe China will emerge from the crisis with less influence, fewer hold this view about the U.S. or the EU. This implies that the U.S. and EU are perceived as more resilient compared to China, at least in terms of their global influence.\n\nIn addition to political affiliation, education level also plays a role in shaping these views. Text quote [10] states that higher education levels correlate with a greater likelihood of believing that the U.S. will experience a decline in global influence.

It shows that different groups have varying percentages of people who think \"More,\" \"About the same,\" or \"Less\" regarding the topic. For example, postgraduates and college graduates tend to have a higher percentage of respondents who believe the U.S. will have \"Less\" influence compared to those with lower education levels. This aligns with the idea that higher education correlates with more critical views of the U.S. global position.\n\nImage4 further supports this by showing that political affiliation strongly influences perceptions of global influence. For instance, Republicans (especially conservatives) are more likely to believe that the U.S. will have \"Less\" influence, while Democrats (especially liberals) are more likely to think it will remain \"About the same\" or even \"More.\" This reinforces the notion that political ideology shapes views on the U.S.'s future influence.\n\nImage5 provides a comparison between the U.S., EU, and China, showing that the U.S. has the highest percentage of respondents who believe its influence will increase (\"More\"), followed by the EU and then China. However, the majority of respondents across all three regions believe that their influence will remain \"About the same.\" This suggests a general belief in stability rather than significant change in global influence.\n\nFinally, image8 illustrates the differences in views among political groups regarding the future influence of the U.S. It shows that Republicans (and especially conservatives) are more likely to believe the U.S. will have \"Less\" influence, while Democrats (especially liberals) are more likely to think it will remain \"About the same\" or even \"More.\" This further emphasizes the role of political affiliation in shaping perceptions of the U.S.'s global standing.\n\n![The image shows a bar chart displaying survey results about people’s perceptions on a particular topic, with categories based on education level and political affiliation.](image1)\n\n![The image displays a bar chart showing different levels of confidence or agreement across various demographic groups.](image3)\n\n![The image is a bar chart showing survey results on three categories: \"More,\" \"About the same,\" and \"Less,\" broken down by race, age, and political affiliation.](image4)\n\n![The image is a bar chart comparing opinions from the U.S., the EU, and China, showing perceptions of their future influence.](image5)\n\n![The image is a bar chart comparing opinions across different political groups, with categories \"More,\" \"About the same,\" and \"Less.\"](image8)\n\nIn summary, views about the future influence of the U.S., EU, and China vary significantly based on political affiliation and education level, with Republicans and those with lower education levels generally more skeptical of the U.S.’s global standing."}

According to the text quotes, there are clear partisan divides in these predictions. For instance, Republicans are about twice as likely as Democrats to believe that the U.S.’s international influence will be strengthened as a result of the crisis, while Democrats are four times more likely than Republicans to expect American influence to weaken [3]. Additionally, there is internal division among Democrats, with liberal party supporters being 20 percentage points more likely than conservatives and moderates within the party to foresee the decline of U.S. international influence [3].\n\nAge also plays a role in these predictions. Older Americans are more likely to believe that China’s international clout will diminish as a result of the coronavirus outbreak compared to younger individuals [12]. Specifically, American adults ages 65 and older are 16 percentage points more likely than those under 30 to say China will have less global influence after the crisis [12].\n\nEducation level is another factor. Americans who have completed higher levels of education are more likely to think the country’s global influence will recede [9]. This trend is reflected in the data from image1, which shows that postgraduate individuals have a higher percentage of \"A great deal\" of confidence compared to those with lower education levels [image1].\n\nIn terms of the U.S., the American public is largely split on how they think the pandemic will shape the country's role in international affairs. Roughly three-in-ten believe the U.S.’s international clout will be bolstered after the outbreak, while the same share thinks it will be weakened. About four-in-ten see the U.S. coming out of the outbreak with the same influence as before [8].\n\nRegarding China, half of Americans believe its influence will decline after the coronavirus outbreak, while far fewer say this about the U.S. or the European Union [10]. The text also mentions that $50\\%$ of Americans say China will have less influence in world affairs after the pandemic, and $66\\%$ of Americans expressed an unfavorable opinion of China, the most negative rating for the country since the Center began asking the question in 2005 [6].\n\nThe image1 provides further insight into the distribution of confidence or agreement across various demographic groups.

For instance, in 2020, 62% of Republicans believed the U.S. does too much, compared to only 26% of Democrats [7].

Specifically, 56% of liberal Democrats believe the U.S. will have less influence, compared to just 8% of conservative Republicans [1]. This divide is further illustrated in image3, which shows the growing partisan divisions over the U.S.'s role in solving world problems from 2013 to 2020.

According to the data, more than half of Americans (54%) believe China has done a bad job dealing with the outbreak, with 28% thinking it has been very bad [2]. This is mirrored in the segmented bar chart (image1), which shows that 45% of respondents think China has done a very bad job, while 34% think it has done a somewhat bad job. In contrast, only 16% see it as somewhat good, and just 2% view it as very good. Similarly, when it comes to respect for personal freedoms, 90% of Americans believe the Chinese government does not respect the personal freedoms of its people [9], as illustrated in image6, where 90% of respondents believe China \"does not respect\" personal freedoms, while only 8% believe it \"respects\" them.\n\nThe U.S. public also holds critical views of its own pandemic response, with 58% believing the country has done a bad job [10]. However, the focus of American concern extends beyond the pandemic to other aspects of the U.S.-China relationship. For instance, image7 shows that 54% of Americans think China is doing a bad job, while 58% think the U.S. is doing a bad job. This indicates a shared sense of dissatisfaction with how both countries have managed the crisis.\n\nRegarding priorities in U.S.-China relations, image6 reveals that 70% of Americans believe the U.S. should prioritize promoting human rights, even if it harms economic relations, while only 26% think the U.S. should prioritize economic relations, even if it means not addressing human rights issues. This suggests a strong preference among Americans for aligning U.S. foreign policy with human rights concerns, despite potential economic consequences.\n\n![The majority of Americans believe China does not respect the personal freedoms of its people](image6)  \n![Americans prefer the U.S. to prioritize promoting human rights over economic relations with China](image6)"}

For example, 51% of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents believe that the trade policies were good for the U.S., while only 14% of Democrats and Democrat-leaning independents share this view [image1]. This is further supported by the fact that 72% of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents believe the U.S. should get tougher with China, compared to just 37% of Democrats and Democrat-leaning independents [image5].\n\nThe impact of trade policies on the U.S. is also viewed differently across political lines. While 44% of respondents believe the trade policies were bad for the U.S., only 30% think they were good, and about a quarter believe they had no real effect [image2]. However, these views vary significantly by party. For instance, 60% of Democrats and Democrat-leaning independents believe the trade policies were bad for the U.S., while only 25% of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents share this sentiment [image1].\n\nWhen it comes to personal impact, the majority of Americans feel that the trade policies have had no real effect on them. Specifically, 56% of respondents believe the policies had no real effect on their personal lives, while 30% think they were bad, and 12% think they were good [image2]. This suggests that while there is a general perception of the trade policies being neutral or negative, the actual personal impact is less clear-cut.\n\nThe preference for getting tougher with China versus building stronger relationships is another area where political affiliation plays a significant role. Overall, 53% of Americans favor getting tougher with China, while 44% prefer building a stronger relationship [image5]. This divide is most pronounced among Republicans and Democrats. For example, 72% of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents support getting tougher with China, while 60% of Democrats and Democrat-leaning independents prefer building a stronger relationship [image5].\n\nFurthermore, the image shows that younger people are more likely to favor building a stronger relationship with China than older individuals. Specifically, 59% of those aged 18-29 prefer building a stronger relationship, compared to 36% of those aged 65 and older [image5]. This suggests that generational differences may also play a role in shaping views on U.S.-China trade policies.\n\nIn summary, the views of different political affiliations in the U.S. on the impact of trade policies with China and their preferences for getting tougher with China versus building stronger relationships are shaped by a combination of partisan beliefs, personal experiences, and generational attitudes. While Republicans tend to favor getting tougher with China, Democrats are more likely to support building a stronger relationship. These differences highlight the complexity of U.S.-China relations and the challenges of finding a consensus on how to approach this important issue.\n\n![Republicans are more likely to view trade policies with China as \"Good for the U.S.\" while Democrats are more likely to view them as \"Bad for the U.S.\"](image1)  \n![Americans generally believe that trade policies with China have had no real effect on their personal lives, but there is a significant divide between Republicans and Democrats on whether the policies were good or bad for the U.S.](image2)  \n![There is a clear divide between Republicans and Democrats on whether the U.S. should get tougher with China or build a stronger relationship.

This divide is even more pronounced among conservative Republicans, who are more supportive of tariffs than moderate or liberal Republicans [4]. On the other hand, Democrats largely see the tariffs as negative, with 60% believing they were bad for the U.S. [2].\n\n![Republicans are more likely to view tariffs as good for the U.S.](image2)\n\nIn terms of international students, the U.S. public generally sees them in a positive light, with 80% of Americans saying it is good for U.S. colleges and universities to accept international students [11]. However, when it comes specifically to Chinese students, opinions are more divided. A majority of Americans (55%) support limiting Chinese students, while 43% oppose such limitations [8]. Among Republicans, there is a stronger inclination to support restrictions on Chinese students, with 72% favoring a \"get tougher\" approach compared to 37% of Democrats who prefer \"building a strong relationship\" [3]. This reflects a broader pattern where Republicans tend to be more skeptical of international students, especially from China, while Democrats are more supportive.\n\n![Republicans are more likely to favor a \"get tougher\" approach toward Chinese students](image3)\n\nOverall, the data shows that political affiliation plays a key role in shaping views on both tariffs and international students.

According to the data, older Americans are more likely to support limiting Chinese students compared to younger individuals. For example, among Americans ages 50 and older, roughly seven-in-ten are in favor of limiting Chinese students, while nearly two-thirds of Americans aged 18 to 29 oppose the idea [7]. This trend is also reflected in confidence levels toward the Chinese leadership. Older Americans, particularly those aged 65 and older, express less confidence in the Chinese president, with 53% saying they have no confidence at all in Xi, compared to only 35% of those aged 18 to 29 [10].\n\nPolitical affiliation further influences these opinions. Republicans are more likely than Democrats to support limitations on Chinese students, with 29% opposing and 69% supporting according to one survey [4]. Confidence in the Chinese leadership also varies by political leaning. While a third of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents say they have no confidence at all in the Chinese president, Republicans and those who lean Republican show higher levels of distrust, with 31% expressing no confidence at all [4]. This suggests that political ideology plays a significant role in shaping both attitudes toward Chinese students and perceptions of Chinese leadership.\n\nThe data from the bar chart (image4) supports these findings, showing that Republicans/Lean Rep are more likely to support the idea of limiting Chinese students, with 69% supporting and 29% opposing. In contrast, Democrats/Lean Dem show the opposite trend, with 56% opposing and 42% supporting [4]. Additionally, the chart indicates that older age groups, such as those aged 65 and over, are more likely to support limiting Chinese students, with 69% supporting and 29% opposing [4].\n\n![confidence in chinese leadership](image6)  \nThe image shows that older Americans and Republicans have lower confidence in the Chinese leadership, which aligns with their greater support for limiting Chinese students in U.S. universities.\n\nIn summary, opinions on limiting Chinese students in U.S. universities differ significantly across age and political affiliation, with older Americans and Republicans being more supportive of restrictions, and this is closely tied to their lower confidence in the Chinese leadership."}

These include cyber attacks, job losses to China, China’s growing technological power, and its policies on human rights. According to the data, half of Americans now view China's human rights policy as a very serious problem, up 7 percentage points since last year [1]. Additionally, nine-in-ten Americans believe China does not respect the personal freedoms of its people [1]. \n\nWhen it comes to economic issues, about three-quarters or more of Americans say that each of the eight specific issues in the U.S.-China relationship is at least somewhat serious. However, four problems stand out as being described as very serious by half or more: cyber attacks from China, the loss of U.S. jobs to China, China’s growing military power, and China’s policies on human rights [3]. The economic relationship between the two countries is seen as fraught, with around two-thirds (64%) describing economic relations as somewhat or very bad [10].\n\nThe image quotes provide visual evidence of these concerns. Image1 shows the differences in opinions between Democrats and Republicans on various issues related to the U.S.-China relationship. For instance, 72% of Republicans believe the U.S. should get tougher on China on economic issues, compared to only 37% of Democrats. Similarly, 53% of Republicans think of China as an enemy of the U.S., compared to 20% of Democrats [image1]. This highlights the significant partisan divide in how Americans perceive China.\n\nImage2 illustrates the changes in concern over time. It shows that concerns about cyber attacks from China increased from 58% in 2020 to 65% in 2021, while concerns about China's human rights policies rose from 43% to 50%. Similarly, concerns about the loss of U.S. jobs to China increased from 47% to 53%, and concerns about China's growing military power increased from 46% to 52% [image2]. These trends indicate a growing level of concern among Americans regarding these specific issues.\n\nImage7 provides further insight into the changing perceptions over time. It shows that the percentage of people who consider limiting China's power and influence a top priority increased from 39% in 2018 to 63% in 2021 among Republicans/leaning Republicans. For Democrats/leaning Democrats, this percentage increased from 26% to 36% over the same period [image7]. Additionally, the percentage of people who feel \"cold\" toward China increased significantly for both groups, from 57% to 79% for Republicans/leaning Republicans and from 38% to 61% for Democrats/leaning Democrats [image7].\n\nThese changes over time suggest a growing sense of urgency and concern among Americans regarding China's actions and policies. The data also indicates that these concerns are not evenly distributed across political lines, with Republicans generally expressing more negative views toward China than Democrats.\n\nIn summary, the key concerns of Americans regarding China include cyber attacks, job losses, technological power, and human rights policies. These concerns have grown over time, with significant increases in the percentage of Americans viewing these issues as very serious. The image quotes provide visual evidence of these trends, highlighting both the increasing level of concern and the partisan divide in perceptions of China.

This growth was more pronounced than the 6 percentage point increase seen among the general population, which rose from 56% to 61% during the same period [6].\n\nAmong specific subgroups, the changes were notable. For instance, U.S.-born and immigrant Hispanics both saw a 14 percentage point increase in their hopeful views of their family’s finances, reaching 81% each [3]. Additionally, younger age groups, such as those aged 18-29, experienced a substantial 27 percentage point increase in positive financial assessments, while older adults (65 and older) had a smaller increase of 7 percentage points [7]. Education level also played a role, with those who had completed some college showing a 20 percentage point increase in optimism compared to those with a high school diploma or less [9].\n\nIn comparison to the general population, the financial optimism gap between Hispanics and the broader public widened, with the 2015 reading showing 81% of Latinos expecting improvement versus 61% of all Americans [10].

According to the data, Hispanics with a positive view of their current financial situation are significantly more likely than those who rate their economic circumstances as only fair or poor to say their family’s finances will improve over the next 12 months [4]. This suggests that individuals who feel financially secure are more optimistic about their future, which may extend to their expectations for their children's financial well-being.\n\nAdditionally, educational attainment plays a role in shaping these expectations. For instance, among Latinos with at least some college experience, 69% expect their children will be better off financially, while 71% of those with less than a high school education share similar expectations. However, Latino high school graduates are more optimistic than those with some college experience or more, with 79% predicting that their children will be better off financially [10]. This indicates that higher educational levels may correlate with greater optimism about children's financial futures.\n\nFurthermore, the data highlights that a significant proportion of Hispanics believe they are economically better off than before, with variations across different demographics [3]. For example, 72% of all Hispanics expect their children to be better off financially than they themselves are now [7], and this optimism is even higher among certain subgroups, such as U.S.-born Hispanics (70%) and foreign-born Hispanics (75%) [3].\n\n![The bar chart shows that a large percentage of Hispanics believe they are better off financially compared to a previous time.](image3)\n\nIn addition, the data reveals that older Hispanics are generally less optimistic about their children's financial futures than younger Hispanics.

While there has been a notable increase in optimism about personal and family financial futures, economic indicators such as income, poverty rates, and wealth disparities continue to show significant gaps between Latinos and the broader U.S. population.\n\nFrom 2000 to 2015, the data indicates that Latino adults have become increasingly optimistic about their financial situations. For example, the percentage of Latinos who expect their family finances to improve \"a lot\" or \"some\" in the coming year rose from 67% in 2008 to 81% in 2015 [4]. This trend is reflected in the line graph (image4), which shows that Hispanic individuals consistently had higher percentages than the general public in their attitudes or opinions related to financial well-being over this time period. The graph also highlights that the increase in Hispanic optimism was more substantial compared to the general public, with Hispanic percentages rising from 76% in 2004 to 81% in 2015, while the general public's percentages increased from 70% to 61% during the same period [4].\n\nDespite this optimism, economic indicators paint a different story. Median household income for Hispanics stagnated since the Great Recession, with a median income of $42,491 in 2014, a level essentially unchanged since the recession [5]. This is significantly lower than the median income for all U.S. households, which was $53,700 in 2014 [2]. The disparity in income is further illustrated in image2, which shows that Hispanic households have a much lower median income compared to all U.S. households. Additionally, the poverty rate for Hispanics remained at 23.6% in 2014, above pre-recession levels and higher than the 14.8% poverty rate for all U.S. households [5].\n\nWealth disparities are even more pronounced. In 2013, the median wealth of Hispanic households was $13,700, compared to $81,400 for all U.S. households [2]. This gap highlights the long-term economic challenges faced by Hispanic communities, even as they have seen some improvements in employment and purchasing power. For instance, the unemployment rate for Hispanics declined from 12.8% in 2010 to 6.4% in 2015, but it still remains higher than the rate for non-Hispanic workers [6]. Image7 shows the quarterly unemployment rates for Hispanic and non-Hispanic groups from 2000 to 2015, illustrating that Hispanic unemployment rates were consistently higher than those of non-Hispanics throughout the period.\n\nIn terms of perceptions of financial well-being, a pie chart (image6) indicates that 72% of Hispanic adults believe their children will be better off financially than they themselves are, while 16% expect their children’s financial situation to be about the same. This optimism about the future is also reflected in the bar chart (image5), which shows that a majority of Hispanic adults felt their income was either staying about even or going up faster than the cost of living in 2014 and 2015.\n\n![Hispanic optimism about financial well-being has increased significantly from 2004 to 2015](image4)\n\nIn conclusion, while Latinos have shown increasing optimism about their financial well-being from 2000 to 2015, economic indicators such as income, poverty rates, and wealth disparities continue to highlight significant challenges."}

According to the data, the unemployment rate for Hispanics has improved since the Great Recession but remains higher than that of non-Hispanics. For instance, the Hispanic unemployment rate fell from a high of 12.8% in the first quarter of 2010 to 6.4% in the last quarter of 2015, while the non-Hispanic unemployment rate was lower throughout this period [8]. Despite this improvement, the Hispanic unemployment rate is still above its low of 5% in the fourth quarter of 2006 and remains higher than that for non-Hispanic workers in the fourth quarter of 2015 [8]. This persistent gap in unemployment rates reflects ongoing challenges faced by the Hispanic community in securing stable employment.\n\nIn terms of economic perceptions, Hispanics have shown a more positive outlook compared to the general U.S. population. A December 2015 Pew Research Center survey found that 35% of Hispanics said economic conditions today are good or excellent, a higher share than among whites (25%) [5]. Additionally, one-third of Hispanics (34%) believe U.S. economic conditions will be better in the coming year, a share about twice as high as seen among other groups of Americans [5]. However, despite this optimism, the economic reality for many Hispanics remains challenging. The median household income for Hispanics has stagnated since the Great Recession, with a level of $42,491 in 2014, essentially unchanged since the recession [2]. In comparison, the median income for all U.S. households was higher at $53,700 in 2014 [image2].\n\nThe disparity in income is further exacerbated by differences in wealth. In 2013, the median wealth for Hispanic households was $13,700, significantly lower than the $81,400 for all U.S. households [image2]. This wealth gap has persisted over time, with Hispanic households experiencing a larger percentage decline in net worth through 2009 compared to white households, and their net worth continued to fall after the recession [2]. These economic disparities have profound implications for the financial stability and long-term prospects of Hispanic families.\n\nDespite these challenges, there are signs of progress. An analysis of 2008 and 2015 survey data found that Latino perceptions of their economic well-being have increased among most major Latino demographic subgroups [1]. Additionally, 72% of Latino adults expect their children to be better off financially than they themselves are now [4]. These positive perceptions suggest a sense of hope and resilience within the community, even in the face of economic obstacles.\n\nThe image provided (image8) visually illustrates the trends in unemployment rates for Hispanic and non-Hispanic populations from 2000 to 2015. It shows that while both groups experienced fluctuations, the unemployment rate for Hispanics remained consistently higher than that for non-Hispanics throughout the period. This visual representation underscores the persistent economic challenges faced by the Hispanic community.\n\n![Hispanic unemployment rate remains higher than non-Hispanic rate](image8)\n\nIn conclusion, while there are signs of improvement in economic perceptions and some reduction in unemployment rates, the Hispanic population continues to face significant disparities in income and wealth compared to non-Hispanics, which have lasting impacts on their economic stability."}

For instance, in 2000, the Hispanic unemployment rate was 5.8%, while it was 3.8% for non-Hispanics. By 2015, the rates had increased to 6.4% for Hispanics and 4.8% for non-Hispanics. The graph also highlights two recession periods, with both groups experiencing fluctuations, but the Hispanic rate remained higher throughout [image4].\n\nRegarding **income**, the median household income for Hispanic households was significantly lower than that of all U.S. households. In 2014, the median income for Hispanic households was $42,500, compared to $53,700 for all U.S. households. This gap indicates a persistent economic challenge for Hispanic families [image5].\n\n**Poverty rates** further highlight the disparity. In 2014, the poverty rate for Hispanic households was 23.6%, which is much higher than the 14.8% rate for all U.S. households. This suggests that Hispanic households are more vulnerable to economic hardship [image5].\n\nFinally, **wealth** differences are stark. In 2013, the median wealth for Hispanic households was $13,700, compared to $81,400 for all U.S. households. This gap reflects long-term economic disadvantages, as Hispanic households experienced a larger decline in net worth during the Great Recession and have not fully recovered [image5].\n\nIn summary, Hispanic households face greater economic challenges than all U.S. households in terms of unemployment, income, poverty rate, and wealth from 2000 to 2015.\n\n![Hispanic unemployment rate has consistently been higher than non-Hispanic rates from 2000 to 2015](image4)  \n![Median household income for Hispanics is significantly lower than that of all U.S. households](image5)  \n![Hispanic poverty rate is higher than the national average](image5)  \n![Hispanic households have much lower median wealth compared to all U.S. households](image5)"}

This trend was consistent across most major Latino demographic subgroups, with gains recorded among U.S.-born Hispanics, those born in another country, Latino men, Latina women, and individuals with varying levels of education [6]. The overall positive shift in economic well-being is further supported by the fact that ratings of personal finances improved among most Latino groups [5].\n\nWhen considering family income relative to the cost of living, the data reveals a more nuanced picture. In 2015, about half (53%) of Latinos said their family income was not keeping up with the cost of living, while 37% said their income was staying about even, and 10% said it was going up faster than the cost of living [11]. However, this was not a significant change from 2014, as Hispanic views on this issue remained largely unchanged between those years [4]. Despite this, there was a noticeable difference when comparing Latino perceptions to those of the broader U.S. population. For example, while Latino views of their financial situation are more positive now than they were in 2004, the public’s view of its finances is lower now than in 2004 [7].\n\nThe changes in perceptions over time can also be visualized in a bar chart that compares the general population and all Hispanics from 2008 to 2015.

Let's explore this based on the evidence provided.\n\nInternet usage among seniors is lower than that of all adults. According to image2, which compares technology adoption between \"All adults\" and those aged \"65+\", the percentages are as follows: 91% of all adults own a cell phone, compared to 77% of adults 65+; 86% of all adults use the internet, compared to 59% of adults 65+; and 70% of all adults have broadband, compared to 47% of adults 65+. This shows a significant disparity in both basic and advanced technology adoption between the two groups. ![comparison of technology adoption](image2)\n\nDevice ownership also varies significantly. Image5 provides data on smartphone ownership among seniors, showing that only 18% of those aged 65+ own a smartphone, with ownership decreasing further with age—only 5% of those aged 80+ own a smartphone. In contrast, 55% of all adults own a smartphone, as shown in image6. This highlights the lower penetration of smartphones among older adults. ![smartphone ownership](image6)\n\nDespite these differences, once seniors do go online, they tend to make it a regular part of their daily routine. Text quote [7] states that among seniors who use the internet, 71% go online every day or almost every day, and an additional 11% go online three to five times per week. This is reflected in image4, which shows that for seniors (65+), 71% go online daily or almost daily, and 11% go online 3-5 times per week, totaling 82%. This is lower than the 94% of 18-29-year-olds who go online daily or almost daily, but still indicates a strong engagement with the internet among seniors who are online. ![daily internet usage by age group](image4)\n\nAdditionally, image1 provides a pie chart that breaks down online usage among seniors into three categories: 41% \"Do not go online,\" 32% \"Go online, no SNS,\" and 27% \"Use SNS.\" This suggests that while a significant portion of seniors do not use the internet at all, those who do often engage with social networking sites. Image9 supports this, noting that 46% of online seniors use social networking sites such as Facebook, and these users have more persistent social connections.\n\nIn terms of trends, image3 shows a line graph depicting the increase in internet adoption over time from 2000 to 2013. The graph reveals that both \"All Adults 18+\" and \"65+\" saw increases in internet usage, though the growth for seniors was slower. In 2000, only 14% of seniors used the internet, compared to 50% of all adults, and by 2013, the numbers had risen to 59% for seniors and 86% for all adults. This indicates a gradual but consistent trend of increased internet adoption among seniors over time.\n\nTo summarize, internet usage and device ownership among seniors are significantly lower than among all adults, but once seniors become internet users, they tend to use the internet regularly. The trends show a steady increase in internet adoption among seniors over time, although they still lag behind younger adults in terms of both usage and access to advanced devices like smartphones."}

While many older adults own devices like smartphones, tablets, and e-readers, their usage of these devices for internet access varies significantly.\n\nDevice ownership among older adults differs notably from the general population. For instance, while 55% of all adults own a smartphone, only 18% of those aged 65 and older do [6]. Similarly, 43% of all adults own a tablet or e-reader, compared to 27% of older adults [6]. This suggests that older adults are less likely to own smartphones but have comparable or even higher rates of owning tablets and e-readers than smartphones. However, despite this, their internet usage is still lower than that of the general population. For example, 86% of all U.S. adults go online, whereas only 59% of older adults do [6].\n\nMoreover, among older adults who use the internet, 71% go online every day or almost every day, and an additional 11% go online three to five times per week [5]. This indicates that once older adults gain access to the internet, they tend to use it regularly. However, the overall adoption rate remains lower compared to younger age groups. For instance, 82% of older adults who use the internet go online daily or almost daily, which is lower than the 94% of 18-29-year-olds who do so [3].\n\nThe data also highlights disparities within the older adult population. For example, those with higher education levels and higher household incomes are more likely to go online and have broadband at home. College graduates, for instance, have an 87% online usage rate and a 76% broadband adoption rate, compared to 40% and 27%, respectively, for those with a high school diploma or less [2]. Similarly, higher-income seniors are more likely to own smartphones and have broadband access [5].\n\nIn summary, while older adults own a range of devices, their internet usage patterns reflect both challenges and progress. They are less likely to own smartphones compared to the general population but have similar or higher rates of owning tablets and e-readers. Despite these differences, many older adults who use the internet do so frequently, though their overall adoption rates remain lower than those of younger adults.\n\n![Device ownership among older adults differs notably from the population as a whole in several specific ways](image11)  \n![Older adults who use the internet tend to use it regularly, with 71% going online every day or almost every day](image3)  \n![Higher education and income correlate with higher internet usage and broadband adoption among older adults](image2)"}

For instance, while 55% of all adults own a smartphone, only 18% of seniors do [1]. Similarly, 43% of all adults own a tablet or e-reader, compared to 27% of seniors [1]. These disparities are also reflected in broadband adoption, where 70% of all adults have broadband at home, but only 47% of seniors do [3]. The bar chart in image1 visually illustrates these differences, showing that the percentage of smartphone and tablet/e-reader ownership is significantly lower among seniors than among all adults.\n\nIn terms of internet usage, 86% of all adults go online, whereas only 59% of seniors do [11]. This gap is further emphasized by the pie chart in image2, which shows that 41% of seniors do not go online at all, while 32% use the internet without engaging with social networking sites (SNS), and 27% use SNS [2]. The bar chart in image3 highlights the overall disparity in technology adoption, with all adults having higher rates of cell phone, internet, and broadband usage compared to seniors.\n\nThe trends in internet adoption over time reveal a gradual increase for both groups, though seniors start from a much lower base. The line graph in image4 demonstrates that while all adults saw their internet adoption rise from around 50% in 2000 to 86% in 2013, seniors increased from about 14% to 59% during the same period [11]. This indicates that although seniors are catching up, they still lag behind the general population in terms of internet adoption.\n\nFor seniors, there are significant variations within the group. The table in image5 shows that smartphone ownership varies widely based on age, education, and income. For example, seniors aged 65-69 have a higher smartphone ownership rate (29%) compared to those aged 80+ (5%). Similarly, college graduates are more likely to own smartphones (35%) than those with only a high school education (10%) [5]. The table in image6 further reveals that seniors with higher incomes and more education are more likely to go online and have broadband at home. For instance, seniors earning $75,000 or more have an 82% broadband adoption rate, compared to 25% for those earning less than $30,000 [6].\n\nThe bar graph in image7 provides insight into how frequently different age groups go online. Seniors aged 65+ are less likely to go online daily or almost daily (71%) compared to younger age groups, such as those aged 18-29 (88%) [7]. However, the bar chart in image8 shows that even within the senior population, internet usage and broadband availability decline with age. For example, 74% of seniors aged 65-69 go online, but this drops to 37% for those aged 80+ [8].\n\nIn conclusion, device ownership and online activity differ significantly between seniors and the general adult population, with seniors generally having lower rates of smartphone ownership, internet usage, and broadband adoption. However, there are positive trends in internet adoption over time for both groups, with seniors showing steady growth despite starting from a lower baseline. ![Seniors have lower rates of smartphone ownership, internet usage, and broadband adoption compared to all adults.](image1)"}

While seniors are increasingly adopting various devices, their engagement with online social networks remains relatively modest compared to younger populations.\n\nDevice ownership trends among seniors show that they are more likely to own tablets or e-book readers than smartphones. For example, 27% of seniors own a tablet or e-book reader, while only 18% own a smartphone [7]. This suggests that seniors may prefer devices that are easier to use or more suited to their needs, such as reading or browsing content. Additionally, higher-income and more educated seniors are significantly more likely to own these devices, indicating that socioeconomic factors play a role in device adoption [10].\n\nIn contrast, online social networking usage among seniors is less widespread. Only 27% of older adults use social networking sites like Facebook, and even among those who go online, a significant portion does not engage with social media [4]. The pie chart illustrates this trend, showing that 41% of seniors do not go online at all, 32% go online without using social networking services, and 27% use social networking services [4]. This indicates that while many seniors are online, a substantial portion does not participate in social networking.\n\nInterestingly, the data also shows that seniors with disabilities or chronic conditions are somewhat more likely to own tablets or e-book readers, suggesting that these devices may offer accessibility benefits [5]. However, this does not necessarily translate into higher social networking usage, as the same group may face challenges in engaging with online platforms.\n\nThe line graph depicting trends over time highlights the steady increase in internet usage among seniors, from 14% in 2000 to 59% in recent years [8]. This growth suggests that more seniors are becoming digitally connected, but it also underscores the fact that they still lag behind the general population in terms of internet adoption. Despite this, certain subgroups of seniors—such as those with higher education or income—are closing the gap, with some even matching or exceeding the rates of the general public [11].\n\nOverall, while seniors are increasingly adopting devices like tablets and e-book readers, their engagement with online social networking remains limited. This discrepancy may be due to a combination of factors, including age-related preferences, accessibility issues, and socioeconomic disparities.\n\n![Seniors are more likely to own a tablet or e-book reader than a smartphone](image3)"}

Similarly, only 47% of seniors have a broadband connection at home, compared to a higher percentage in the general population. However, within the senior group, there are notable differences. Seniors aged 65-69 have a much higher rate of internet use (74%) and broadband adoption (65%) compared to those aged 80 and older, who have only 37% going online and 21% with broadband [6].

Additionally, workers with high school diplomas or less are notably more downbeat about the impact of these tools on their careers relative to college graduates [8].\n\nThe image chart (image5) illustrates this disparity clearly, showing that higher education levels correlate with a greater likelihood of perceiving technology as having a positive impact. For instance, while 90% of college graduates see word processing or spreadsheet software as beneficial, only 45% of those with high school diplomas or less share this view.\n\nRegarding the expectations for the adoption of driverless cars, many Americans anticipate that various automation technologies will make significant inroads in the coming decades. Driverless vehicles are perhaps the most prominent example of this trend. Fully 94% of Americans have some awareness of the effort to develop driverless vehicles, and roughly two-thirds of the public anticipates that most vehicles on the road will be driverless within the next half-century – with 9% predicting that this will occur in the next 10 years [1].\n\n![Driverless vehicles are seen as a significant trend](image1)\n\nIn summary, higher education levels are associated with more positive perceptions of the impact of workforce technologies on careers, while there is a general expectation that driverless vehicles will become prevalent in the future."}

Let's delve into this by examining both the future expectations and current experiences.\n\nFuture expectations for driverless vehicles are quite optimistic. A significant majority of Americans, 94%, have some awareness of the development of driverless vehicles, and about two-thirds anticipate that most vehicles on the road will be driverless within the next half-century. This optimism is further reflected in the fact that 9% predict this will occur within the next 10 years [1]. These expectations highlight a general belief in the potential benefits of automation, particularly in terms of technological advancement and convenience.\n\nIn contrast, the current experiences of U.S. workers with various technologies show a more mixed picture. While many workers express positive views on the impact of technology on their careers, there is also a notable segment that feels these technologies have had a negative or neutral effect. For instance, 53% of workers feel that technology has made their work more interesting, but 12% say it has made their work less interesting, and around one-third (34%) say it hasn’t had a major impact either way [12]. Similarly, a plurality of workers (46%) feel that technology has increased their opportunities for career advancement, but 13% say it has decreased their opportunities, and 40% say it has made no difference one way or another [12].\n\nThe impact of specific technologies varies significantly across different educational groups. For example, college graduates are more likely to view technologies such as word processing or spreadsheet software positively, with 90% perceiving a positive impact, compared to only 45% among those with a high school education or less [2]. This trend is consistent across other technologies, indicating that higher educational attainment correlates with more positive perceptions of technology's impact on work [2].\n\nMoreover, the perception of the impact of customer self-service technologies and industrial robots shows a stark contrast. While 53% of college graduates view customer self-service technologies positively, only 40% of those with a high school education or less do so. Similarly, 31% of college graduates see industrial robots as having a positive impact, compared to just 23% among those with a high school education or less [2].\n\nThese differences highlight that while the future expectations for driverless vehicles are largely positive, the current experiences of U.S. workers with various technologies reveal a more complex and varied landscape. The impact of technology is not uniformly positive; it depends on factors such as the type of technology and the educational background of the workers.\n\n![Made their work more interesting](image7)  \n![Increased their opportunities for advancement](image7)  \n\nIn conclusion, while future expectations for driverless vehicles are optimistic, the current experiences of U.S. workers with various technologies show a mixed impact, with significant variations based on educational attainment."}

Roughly three-quarters of Americans (76%) expect that automation will lead to much greater economic inequality, while nearly two-thirds (64%) anticipate that people will have a hard time finding things to do with their lives [4]. Additionally, only 25% of Americans expect that the economy will create many new, better-paying jobs for humans, with 75% believing this is unlikely [9].\n\nDespite these concerns, there is some optimism about potential positive outcomes. A significant portion of the population expects that automation could make the economy more efficient, allow people to focus on more fulfilling aspects of their jobs, and reduce the amount of time spent on work [6].

For instance, 65% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents believe the government should take responsibility, while 68% of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents think individuals should be responsible for their own financial well-being [4]. This reflects a broader pattern where Democrats are more supportive of government intervention, such as guaranteed income programs and national service programs, compared to Republicans [11].\n\nEducation also plays a role in shaping attitudes toward automation. While educational differences do not strongly affect views on the government's obligation to support displaced workers, they do influence opinions on limiting the number of jobs businesses can replace with machines.

For instance, younger users tend to report stronger emotional reactions compared to older age groups. Specifically, the image8 shows that younger age groups (18-29) are more likely to feel amused (54%) and lonely (15%) than older groups. In contrast, older age groups like those aged 65+ report lower levels of amusement (30%) and loneliness (2%). This suggests that younger users may be more susceptible to both positive and negative emotional impacts from social media.\n\nRegarding gender differences, the image7 indicates that men are more likely than women to frequently see people being mean or bullying (29% vs. 19%), while women are more likely to see people being kind or supportive (24% vs. 17%). However, the majority of both men and women (52% of men and 56% of women) report seeing an equal mix of supportive and bullying behavior. These findings highlight that while there are differences in perception, most users experience a balanced mix of positive and negative interactions.\n\nIn addition to emotions, users frequently encounter specific types of content on social media. The image3 reveals that posts that are overly dramatic or exaggerated (58% frequently) and people making accusations or starting arguments without waiting for all the facts (59% frequently) are the most common types of content encountered. These findings align with the text quote [8], which states that these two types of content are seen especially frequently by users. Furthermore, the image3 also shows that 21% of users frequently encounter posts that teach them something useful they hadn’t known before, indicating that educational content is also prevalent.\n\nAnother notable finding is that around half (54%) of social media users say they typically see an equal mix of people being kind or supportive and people being mean or bullying, as mentioned in text quote [3]. This suggests that while negative behaviors are present, many users also experience positive interactions.\n\nIn summary, younger age groups and men tend to experience stronger emotional responses and encounter more negative behaviors on social media, while older age groups and women report more balanced or positive interactions. The most common types of posts encountered are those that are overly dramatic or exaggerated and those that involve arguments or accusations without sufficient facts. \n\n![Emotional responses by age group](image8)  \n![Perceptions of online behavior between men and women](image7)  \n![Most common types of posts encountered](image3)"}

Similarly, men are around twice as likely as women to say they more often see people being deceptive on social media (24% vs. 13%) [12]. However, majorities of both men (58%) and women (67%) see an equal mix of deceptiveness and attempts to correct misinformation [12]. Women, on the other hand, are slightly more likely than men to say that they more often see people being kind or supportive [2].\n\nThese differences in perception may be related to the frequency of encountering dramatic or exaggerated posts on social media. The survey found that a large majority of users (58% frequently and 31% sometimes) encounter posts that are overly dramatic or exaggerated [6]. Additionally, 59% of users frequently encounter people making accusations or starting arguments without having all the facts [1].

According to the information, men are more likely than women to see people being deceptive or bullying on social media platforms. Specifically, 24% of men say they more often see people being deceptive, compared to 13% of women, while 29% of men report seeing people being mean or bullying, versus 19% of women [1]. On the other hand, women are slightly more likely than men to see people being kind or supportive. However, the largest shares of both men (52%) and women (56%) say they typically see an equal mix of supportive and bullying behavior on social media [3].\n\n![Men are more likely than women to see people being deceptive or bullying on social media.](image4)\n\nThese differences in perception have implications for how social media platforms can tailor their recommendations or advertisements. For instance, if men are more likely to encounter deceptive or bullying content, platforms may need to implement stronger moderation policies or provide tools that help users identify and report such content. Additionally, understanding these differences can help platforms create more personalized experiences. For example, if younger users, who tend to be more emotionally responsive, are more likely to engage with certain types of content, platforms might adjust their algorithms to highlight content that resonates with these users.\n\nFurthermore, the data shows that users' comfort levels with social media companies using their personal data depend heavily on how the data is used. While three-quarters of social media users find it acceptable for platforms to use their data to recommend events in their area, a smaller majority (57%) thinks it is acceptable if their data is used to recommend other people they might want to be friends with [11]. However, when it comes to using data to show ads from political campaigns, majorities across age groups feel it is not acceptable [2]. This suggests that social media platforms should be transparent about how user data is used and provide users with control over their preferences.\n\n![Users are more accepting of data usage for event recommendations than for political ads.](image3)\n\nIn conclusion, men and women have different perceptions of social media content and behavior, with men more likely to encounter deceptive or bullying content and women more likely to see kind or supportive behavior. These differences suggest that social media platforms should consider tailoring their recommendations and advertisements to address these varying experiences and ensure user comfort with data usage."}

According to the data, younger users (ages 18-49) are generally more accepting of social media platforms using their data for various purposes compared to older users (ages 65 and above). For instance, about two-thirds of social media users younger than 50 find it acceptable for platforms to use their data to recommend connecting with people they might want to know, whereas fewer than half of users aged 65 and older share this view [1]. Similarly, nearly six-in-ten users ages 18 to 49 think it is acceptable for these sites to use their data to show them advertisements for products or services, while a similar majority of users aged 65 and older say this is not acceptable [4].\n\nThe acceptability of data usage also depends on the context in which the data is used. Users are more comfortable with social media platforms using their data to recommend events in their area, with three-quarters of users finding this acceptable [12]. However, they are much less comfortable with the use of their data for political messaging, with a significant portion of users finding this unacceptable [8]. This pattern is consistent across age groups, though the degree of acceptance varies. For example, while 78% of users aged 18-29 find it acceptable for platforms to recommend events in their area, only 67% of users aged 65+ feel the same way [3].\n\n![Users' comfort level with social media platforms using their data for different purposes](image2)\n\nOverall, users' comfort with the use of their personal data by social media platforms is heavily context-dependent. While many users are comfortable with data being used to provide relevant recommendations, such as events or connections, they are more wary of its use for political messaging or targeted advertising. This suggests that the acceptability of data usage is not uniform and is influenced by both the specific purpose and the perceived value of the outcome. The data also highlights that older users are generally less accepting of data usage for various purposes, indicating a generational divide in attitudes toward social media practices.\n\n![Acceptability of different online recommendations](image3)"}
{"q_id": 176, "model": "qwen3-30b-a3b", "in_tok": 3684, "out_tok": 695, "total_tok": 4379, "response": "The question of how perceptions of fairness and effectiveness differ across various automated systems used for decision-making reveals a complex landscape of public opinion. According to the text quotes, the public generally holds skeptical views about the fairness of these systems, with only a small minority perceiving them as fair. For example, the personal finance score concept is viewed as fair by just 32% of Americans, while the video job interview analysis is seen as fair by 33%. In contrast, the automated criminal risk score is viewed as fair by 50% of the public, suggesting that context plays a significant role in shaping these perceptions [4].\n\nThe effectiveness of these systems is also viewed with mixed opinions. The personal finance score is seen as effective by 54% of the public, but this perception does not translate into a high level of perceived fairness. Similarly, the video job interview analysis is considered effective by 39%, yet only 33% find it fair [9]. This discrepancy between effectiveness and fairness suggests that the public may believe these systems can perform their intended tasks well but still harbor concerns about their fairness.\n\nLooking at the image quotes, we see further evidence of these differing perceptions. Image2 provides a clear depiction of the acceptability of different automated processes. It shows that 68% of people find the personal finance score unacceptable, while 67% find the video job interview analysis unacceptable. In contrast, 56% find the criminal risk assessment for parole unacceptable, and 57% find automated resume screening unacceptable. These percentages highlight a general trend of public skepticism toward these systems, especially when they involve sensitive areas like personal finance or criminal justice [2].\n\nImage3 offers additional insight into the perceived fairness of these systems. It shows that the automated scoring of people up for parole is seen as somewhat fair by 41% of respondents, while the automated personal finance score is seen as somewhat fair by 27%. These figures suggest that while some systems are perceived as more fair than others, the overall sentiment remains one of skepticism [3].\n\nImage8 provides a direct comparison of the perceived effectiveness and fairness of different automated systems. It shows that the personal finance score has the largest difference between effectiveness (54%) and fairness (32%), indicating a significant gap in public perception. The video job interview analysis has a smaller gap (39% effective vs. 33% fair), while the resume screening and parole scoring systems have even smaller gaps. This data implies that the public may be more willing to accept systems that are both effective and fair, but less so when there is a noticeable disparity between the two [8].\n\nThese differences in perceptions of fairness and effectiveness imply that public trust in these systems is closely tied to their perceived fairness. When people believe a system is unfair, they are less likely to trust it, even if they acknowledge its effectiveness. This is evident in the case of the personal finance score, where a large majority finds it ineffective and unfair, despite its potential to help businesses identify good customers [11].\n\nIn conclusion, the public's perceptions of fairness and effectiveness vary significantly across different automated systems, with fairness often being a more critical factor in determining public trust. The data from both the text and image quotes suggests that while some systems are seen as effective, many are viewed as unfair, leading to widespread skepticism about their use in decision-making processes. ![Fairness perceptions of automated systems](image3)"}

This stark division highlights the partisan nature of these perceptions.\n\nRegarding trustworthiness, a majority of the public (58%) says they trust what Trump says less than they trusted what previous presidents said while in office. Only 26% say they trust Trump more, and 14% say their level of trust is about the same [3].

This reflects a deep partisan divide, with Trump's ethical standards being viewed as lower than those of previous administrations, which have seen higher levels of public confidence [10].\n\nIn terms of **economic impact**, the public has mixed views. While 40% believe Trump’s policies have improved economic conditions, 28% think they have made things worse, and 29% say they have had little effect [11]. However, this perception is highly polarized. Republicans and Republican leaners are much more likely to view Trump’s economic policies positively, with 79% saying they have improved conditions (up from 63% in October 2017) [12]. On the other hand, 46% of Democrats now say his economic policies have worsened conditions, showing a growing negative sentiment among this group [12].\n\nWhen it comes to **long-term success**, opinions are also deeply divided. About two-thirds of Republicans (65%) believe Trump will be a successful president in the long run, while 80% of Democrats expect him to be unsuccessful [4]. This aligns with historical trends, as seen in the chart comparing perceptions of past presidents. For instance, at comparable points in their presidencies, fewer people thought Trump would be successful compared to Obama or Bush. Specifically, 47% of the public thought Obama would be successful at a similar stage, while 38% felt the same about Bush and 43% about Clinton [2]. In contrast, for Trump, only 29% believed he would be successful, and 47% thought he would be unsuccessful, with 23% unsure [5].\n\nComparing these perceptions to previous presidents, we see that Trump’s approval ratings and expectations for his legacy are more negative.

This suggests that partisanship strongly influences both perceptions of Trump's success and trust in the investigation.\n\nFurther evidence of this partisan divide is seen in the responses regarding confidence in Trump himself. While 92% of Democrats express a lack of confidence in Trump, including 70% who say they are not at all confident, three-quarters of Republicans say they are confident in Trump to handle the inquiry appropriately, with 42% expressing very high confidence [5].\n\nLooking at historical comparisons, similar patterns were observed during the presidency of George W.

However, the gap between these groups has widened over time. In October 2017, 58% of Republicans and 47% of Democrats viewed jobs as widely available locally, but by the time of the most recent data, this gap had increased to 71% for Republicans and 53% for Democrats [6]. This trend suggests a growing divergence in perceptions of job availability between the two parties.\n\nIn addition to job availability, perceptions of personal financial situations also differ. Republicans are more likely than Democrats to rate their personal financial situation as excellent or good (62% vs. 44%) [3]. Similarly, 84% of Republicans expect their finances to improve over the next year, compared to 60% of Democrats [7]. These differences highlight a broader pattern of optimism among Republicans regarding economic conditions.\n\nThe image quotes provide visual evidence of these trends. Image4, for example, shows that while 60% of all adults say there are plenty of jobs available in their communities, only 48% believe there are plenty of \"good jobs.\" The disparity is even more pronounced when broken down by political affiliation: 58% of Republicans believe there are plenty of good jobs, compared to just 39% of Democrats [4]. This suggests that while both parties acknowledge the availability of jobs, Republicans are more optimistic about the quality of those jobs.\n\nAnother image, image7, illustrates the long-term trends in perceptions of job availability. The graph shows that in 2001, 44% of respondents believed jobs were difficult to find, while 42% thought there were plenty of jobs available. By 2009, the percentage of people who found jobs difficult to find peaked at 85%, while those who believed there were plenty of jobs available dropped to 10%. However, by 2019, the perception had shifted dramatically, with 60% of respondents believing there were plenty of jobs available and only 33% finding them difficult to find.

For instance, in October 2017, 58% of Republicans and 47% of Democrats viewed jobs as widely available locally [6], indicating that the gap has widened slightly over the years.\n\nThe evolution of these perceptions over time can be visualized through several images. Image6, for example, shows a line graph depicting trends in job market perceptions from 2001 to 2019. The graph reveals that the perception of \"jobs are difficult to find\" peaked around 2009 at 85%, while the perception of \"plenty of jobs available\" was at its lowest point at 10% during the same period. By 2019, the perception of \"plenty of jobs available\" had risen to 60%, while the perception of \"jobs are difficult to find\" had dropped to 33%. This suggests a significant improvement in job availability perceptions over the years, particularly in recent times.\n\n![Perceptions of job availability have improved over time, with a notable increase in the percentage of people who believe there are plenty of jobs available.](image6)\n\nAdditionally, image5 provides a survey chart that distinguishes between \"jobs\" and \"good jobs,\" with responses divided by political affiliation. The data shows that 60% of the total population believes there are plenty of jobs available, while 33% say jobs are difficult to find. Among Republicans, 71% believe there are plenty of jobs available, compared to 53% of Democrats. For \"good jobs,\" 48% of the total population believes there are plenty of good jobs available, while 45% say they are difficult to find. Among Republicans, 58% believe there are plenty of good jobs available, compared to 39% of Democrats. These figures highlight the stark differences in perceptions of job availability between political affiliations.\n\n![Republicans are more likely than Democrats to believe there are plenty of jobs available in their communities.](image5)\n\nIn summary, perceptions of job availability differ significantly between political affiliations, with Republicans consistently expressing more positive views than Democrats. Over time, these perceptions have evolved, with a notable improvement in the belief that there are plenty of jobs available, especially in recent years."}

According to the survey data, Republicans and Republican leaners are more likely to believe that Wall Street helps the economy more than it hurts, with 55% holding this view compared to 31% who think it hurts the economy more [2]. In contrast, Democrats and Democratic leaners are more divided, with 46% believing that Wall Street hurts the economy more and 41% thinking it helps more [7]. This partisan divide is further illustrated in the chart, which shows the percentage of people who think Wall Street impacts the American economy in different ways, broken down by political affiliation [image1].\n\n![Wall Street's impact on the economy varies by political affiliation](image1)\n\nIn addition to these views on Wall Street, public satisfaction with the state of the nation has been consistently low. As of the latest data, 70% of Americans express dissatisfaction with the way things are going in the country, while only 26% are satisfied [5]. This dissatisfaction has been increasing over time, with the percentage of dissatisfied individuals rising by 9 percentage points since September [12]. The trend in satisfaction levels is reflected in the line graph showing the percentages of people who are \"Dissatisfied\" and \"Satisfied\" with the way things are going in the country from 1990 to 2019 [image5].\n\n![Public dissatisfaction with the state of the nation has increased over time](image5)\n\nThe relationship between opinions on Wall Street and satisfaction levels with national conditions is complex. While positive views of the economy and jobs have not translated into higher satisfaction with national conditions, there is a noticeable difference in how different political groups perceive both issues. For instance, Republicans and Republican leaners tend to have more positive views of the economy and are more likely to believe that Wall Street helps the economy, whereas Democrats and Democratic leaners are more likely to be dissatisfied with the state of the nation and to believe that Wall Street hurts the economy.\n\nIn summary, public opinions on Wall Street's impact on the economy differ significantly based on political affiliation, with Republicans more likely to view it positively and Democrats more divided or negative. These views are closely linked to overall satisfaction levels with national conditions, which have remained low and have shown an upward trend in dissatisfaction over the years."}

According to the data, in 1990, 41% of Americans were satisfied, but by 2019, this number had dropped to 26% [5]. Simultaneously, dissatisfaction increased from 54% in 1990 to 70% in 2019 [5]. This trend is reflected in a line graph that shows the \"Dissatisfied\" line rising sharply while the \"Satisfied\" line declines over the same period [5].\n\nPolitical affiliations have also undergone significant changes during this time. A line graph tracking political trends from 1990 to 2019 reveals that Republican and Democratic support has fluctuated, with periods of dominance for each party. During G.H.W. Bush's presidency, Republicans had higher support, peaking at 56%. Under Clinton, support shifted toward Democrats. G.W. Bush saw a resurgence in Republican support, which declined toward the end of his term. During Obama’s presidency, Democratic support remained higher than Republican support. Under Trump, the lines converged, showing a smaller gap between the two parties [4].\n\nThese shifts in political affiliation have influenced views on Wall Street's impact on the economy. A chart from a survey conducted in January 2019 highlights these differences. Republicans and Republican leaners are more likely to believe that Wall Street helps the economy more than it hurts (55%) compared to Democrats and Democratic leaners, who are more divided, with 46% believing it hurts the economy more and 41% believing it helps [8]. This division is further emphasized by another image, which shows that while 46% of Americans believe Wall Street helps the economy more, 39% think it hurts it more [12].\n\n![The line graph shows the percentage of people who are dissatisfied and satisfied with the way things are going in the country from 1990 to 2019.](image5)\n\n![The line graph tracks political affiliation trends over time from 1990 to 2019, showing the percentages of people identifying or leaning Republican and Democrat.](image4)\n\n![The chart reflects opinions on Wall Street's impact on the American economy, broken down by political affiliation.](image8)\n\nIn conclusion, public satisfaction with the state of the nation has declined significantly from 1990 to 2019, while political affiliations have shifted, leading to increased polarization in views on Wall Street's impact on the economy."}

This indicates a strong partisan divide in confidence levels across different issues.\n\nRegarding the specific task of making good appointments to the federal courts, the data shows that 45% of respondents are at least somewhat confident in Trump's ability to do so [11]. However, this figure is likely lower among Democrats, as they tend to express less confidence in Trump on most issues. For example, 45% of Democrats say they are not too or not at all confident in Trump to make good appointments to the federal courts, while only 45% are at least somewhat confident [11].\n\nIn comparison, Trump garners the most confidence in his ability to negotiate favorable trade agreements with other countries, with 51% saying they are at least somewhat confident [7]. On the other hand, confidence in his ability to manage the executive branch effectively is lower, with about half (51%) expressing little or no confidence [9].\n\nThe image quotes further support these findings. Image3 provides a detailed breakdown of public confidence in various governmental tasks, including making good appointments to the federal courts. The chart shows that 45% of respondents feel very confident in Trump's ability to make good appointments to the federal courts, while 51% feel not at all confident [3].

The public's views on how well the U.S. has handled the pandemic compared to other wealthy nations show stark differences between Republicans and Democrats. While 22% of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents believe the U.S. response has been more effective, a larger share (34%) think it has been less effective, with 42% saying it has been about as effective. In contrast, 87% of Democrats and Democratic leaners view the U.S. response as less effective compared to other countries [8]. This divergence is also reflected in the trust levels in different institutions. For instance, confidence in public health officials such as those at the CDC is much higher among Democrats (72%) than Republicans (53%) [12], and trust in hospitals is relatively high across both parties, with 87% of Democrats and 90% of Republicans expressing confidence in local hospitals [image1].\n\nThe perception of the federal government's response is another area where partisan divides are evident. About 82% of Democrats view the federal government's response as inadequate, compared to only 21% of Republicans [2]. Similarly, when asked about the reasons for the increase in confirmed coronavirus cases, Democrats are more likely to attribute it to rising infections rather than increased testing, with 82% of Democrats agreeing compared to 31% of Republicans [8]. These differences highlight the extent to which political affiliation shapes public opinion on the pandemic and its management.\n\nTrust in institutions like the CDC and local elected officials also varies significantly by party. While 72% of Democrats give positive ratings to public health officials, only 53% of Republicans do so [12]. Furthermore, trust in Donald Trump is overwhelmingly low among Democrats, with only 6% expressing confidence, while 73% of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents do so [image1]. This trend is consistent across various measures, indicating that partisanship plays a crucial role in shaping public trust and perceptions of institutional effectiveness during the pandemic.\n\n![The chart shows varying levels of trust in institutions like the CDC, local officials, and hospitals, with Democrats generally showing higher trust in public health officials and lower trust in Donald Trump compared to Republicans.](image1)\n\n![The chart highlights significant partisan differences in opinions on the causes of increased coronavirus cases and the effectiveness of the federal government's response, with Democrats more likely to attribute the rise in cases to infections rather than testing and to view the federal response as inadequate.](image2)\n\n![The line graph illustrates the approval and disapproval ratings of public health officials, showing a decline in trust among both Democrats and Republicans, but with a more pronounced drop among Republicans.](image4)\n\nIn conclusion, partisan divides have a profound impact on perceptions of the COVID-19 response effectiveness and trust in institutions, with clear differences observed between Democrats and Republicans in their assessments of government actions and public health measures."}

This suggests that while both parties acknowledge the importance of social distancing, Democrats are more likely to view its lack as a critical issue.\n\nFinally, the perception of the adequacy of testing also varies significantly. Text quote [12] states that two-thirds of Democrats say \"not enough timely testing\" is a major reason for the outbreak continuing, while only 30% of Republicans share this view. Image8 supports this, showing that 67% of Democrats, but only 30% of Republicans, believe that insufficient testing is a major factor. This indicates that Democrats are more concerned about the availability and timeliness of testing as a barrier to controlling the virus.\n\n![Democrats are more likely than Republicans to believe that the increase in confirmed coronavirus cases is due to more new infections rather than more testing.](image1)\n\n![Democrats are more likely than Republicans to view the federal government's response as inadequate.](image8)\n\nIn conclusion, partisan beliefs differ significantly on the reasons for the continuation of the COVID-19 outbreak and the perceived adequacy of measures in place, with Democrats generally attributing the spread to factors like inadequate federal response, rapid lifting of restrictions, and insufficient testing, while Republicans are more likely to attribute the increase in cases to more testing and less concern about the federal government's role."}

This view is echoed in text quote [8], which states that 62% of Republicans say the increase in confirmed cases is primarily due to more people being tested, while only 36% believe it is mainly because of increased infections. In contrast, text quote [10] notes that Democrats overwhelmingly attribute the rise in cases to more infections rather than more testing, with 80% of Democrats saying this. Text quote [9] further supports this by stating that a 60% to 39% majority of Americans attribute the rise in cases more to rising infections than to a rise in testing, emphasizing the wide partisan divide.\n\nImage quote [5] provides a visual representation of these differences, showing that a majority of Republicans (62%) believe the increase in cases is primarily due to more testing, while a smaller majority of Democrats (80%) attribute it to more infections. Image quote [2] adds context by highlighting the partisan gap on other reasons for the outbreak continuing, such as places being too quick to ease restrictions. It states that 82% of Democrats point to this as a major reason, while only 31% of Republicans agree. This disparity is also reflected in image quote [2], where the chart shows significant differences in opinions between Democrats and Republicans on this issue.\n\nImage quote [2] also includes data on concerns about the speed of lifting restrictions. It indicates that 31% of Republicans believe restrictions have been lifted too quickly, compared to 82% of Democrats. This aligns with text quote [3], which mentions that Republicans are relatively divided on this question, with somewhat more saying their greater concern is that restrictions have not been lifted quickly enough (53%) rather than that they have been lifted too quickly (45%). However, text quote [11] reveals that nearly seven-in-ten Americans (69%) are more concerned that state governments have been lifting restrictions too quickly, suggesting a broader public concern that transcends party lines.\n\nImage quote [1] provides a comprehensive overview of these differences, showing that the majority in most groups believe restrictions were \"Lifted too quickly.\" The bar chart in image quote [1] breaks down these opinions by demographics, including race, age, education, and political affiliation, reinforcing the idea that there is a general trend toward concern about the speed of lifting restrictions, but with notable variations across different groups.\n\nIn summary, the perspectives on the reasons for rising COVID-19 cases and the lifting of restrictions differ significantly across political affiliations, with Republicans more likely to attribute the rise in cases to increased testing and Democrats more likely to attribute it to increased infections. Additionally, Democrats are more concerned about restrictions being lifted too quickly, while Republicans are more divided on this issue. ![The bar chart shows survey results on opinions about lifting restrictions too quickly versus not quickly enough, with the majority in most groups believing restrictions were \"Lifted too quickly.\"](image1)"}

These data highlight a significant partisan divide, with Democrats and Republicans holding markedly different perspectives on both the reasons behind rising case numbers and the appropriateness of lifting restrictions.\n\nDemocrats are more likely to attribute the rise in cases to increased infections rather than to increased testing. For example, 80% of Democrats believe the increase in confirmed cases is primarily due to more infections, while only 19% think it's mainly because of more testing [8]. This view is even stronger among liberal Democrats, with 90% attributing the rise to infections [5]. In contrast, a majority of Republicans (62%) believe the increase in cases is mostly due to more people being tested, with only 36% attributing it to more infections [9]. Among conservative Republicans, this belief is even more pronounced, with 68% attributing the rise to testing, compared to 30% who believe it's due to infections [9].\n\nThis divergence in views on the causes of increased cases is closely tied to opinions on how quickly restrictions should be lifted. The text quotes show that a majority of Americans—69%—are more concerned that state governments have lifted restrictions too quickly, with only 30% expressing more concern that they haven’t been lifted quickly enough [6]. However, this concern varies significantly by political affiliation. For instance, 82% of Democrats say that some places have been too quick to ease restrictions as a major reason for the continuation of the outbreak, while only 31% of Republicans agree [4]. Similarly, 82% of Democrats believe that lifting restrictions too quickly is a major reason for the ongoing outbreak, compared to just 31% of Republicans [11].\n\nThese differences are further illustrated in the image quotes. Image2 shows a bar chart where the majority in most demographic groups, including political affiliations, believe that restrictions were \"Lifted too quickly\" [image2]. Specifically, 82% of Democrats and 31% of Republicans believe that lifting restrictions too quickly is a major reason for the continuation of the outbreak [image8]. This aligns with the text quotes, which indicate that Democrats overwhelmingly hold the view that increased case counts are mainly the result of increased infections, while Republicans are more likely to attribute the rise to increased testing [5][9].\n\n![Democrats are more likely to attribute the rise in coronavirus cases to increased infections rather than more testing.](image3)\n\nIn addition, image8 highlights the disparity in opinions between Republicans and Democrats on several issues related to the pandemic, including the reasons for the spread of the virus. For example, 82% of Democrats believe that restrictions have been lifted too quickly in some places, while only 31% of Republicans share this view [image8]. This reflects the broader trend observed in the text quotes, where Democrats are more concerned about restrictions being lifted too quickly, while Republicans are more concerned about them not being lifted quickly enough [1][6].\n\n![Republicans are more likely to believe that the increase in confirmed coronavirus cases is due to more people being tested rather than more infections.](image3)\n\nIn summary, the relationship between views on the causes of increased COVID-19 cases and opinions on lifting restrictions is strongly influenced by political affiliation. Democrats are more likely to attribute the rise in cases to increased infections and to express concern about restrictions being lifted too quickly, while Republicans are more likely to attribute the rise to increased testing and to express concern about restrictions not being lifted quickly enough."}

According to the data, while majorities of Americans support requiring voters to show photo ID [2], there are clear disparities when broken down by race and party.\n\nFor example, among Democrats, White adults are less supportive of requiring photo ID compared to Black, Hispanic, and Asian Democrats. Specifically, 54% of White Democrats favor this requirement, while 65% of Black Democrats, 72% of Hispanic Democrats, and 71% of Asian Democrats support it [3]. This suggests that within the Democratic Party, non-White groups are more likely to back photo ID requirements than their White counterparts.\n\nIn contrast, among Republicans, the trend is reversed. White Republicans are more supportive of photo ID requirements than Hispanic Republicans. For instance, 93% of Republicans overall support requiring photo ID, with 81% strongly favoring it, compared to 30% of Democrats [11]. However, within the Republican Party, White adults are more likely to support policies aimed at easing voting than Hispanic Republicans. For example, only 35% of White Republicans favor automatic voter registration, compared to 51% of Hispanic Republicans [7].\n\nThese trends are further illustrated in the image quotes. Image1 shows a bar graph comparing numerical data across racial groups, with White having 53 and 87, Black with 86, Hispanic with 66 and 75, and Asian with 79. These numbers could represent different aspects of voting policy preferences, including support for photo ID requirements [1]. Similarly, image4 presents numbers such as 54 and 96 for White, 65 for Black, 72 and 90 for Hispanic, and 71 for Asian, which may reflect varying levels of support for photo ID requirements across these groups [4].\n\nImage6 provides a detailed breakdown of opinions on early and absentee voting, showing that 81% of Democrats support open early or absentee voting, while 62% of Republicans believe documentation should be required.

Specifically, while 54% of White Democrats favor this requirement, larger shares of other racial and ethnic groups—65% of Black, 72% of Hispanic, and 71% of Asian Democrats—support it [7]. This suggests that within the Democratic Party, there is a higher level of support for restrictive voting policies among non-White groups.\n\nOn the other hand, when considering early or absentee voting, Black adults are more likely than White, Hispanic, and Asian adults to favor \"no excuse\" early, absentee voting [10]. This indicates a stronger preference among Black Americans for more accessible voting options, which aligns with broader trends seen in other voting policies. For example, Black adults also show lower levels of support for restrictive policies like removing people from registration lists due to inactivity and requiring government-issued photo identification [9].\n\nIn contrast, White Republicans are less supportive of policies aimed at easing voting compared to Hispanic Republicans. For instance, about half of Hispanic Republicans (51%) favor automatically registering all eligible citizens to vote, compared with 35% of White Republicans [2]. This highlights the intersection of race and partisanship in shaping attitudes toward voting policies.\n\nThe image quotes further illustrate these trends. Image6, for example, shows that among Republican/Lean Republican voters, 62% believe documented reasons should be required for early or absentee voting, while only 38% support open voting.

In contrast, older Hispanics (ages 50 to 64 and 65 and older) show a more negative view, with 60% and 61% respectively reporting a negative impression [1]. This trend is reflected in the bar chart (image1), which shows that all Hispanics have a mixed perception of socialism, with 26% viewing it as \"Very/Somewhat bad,\" 35% as \"Neither good nor bad,\" and 37% as \"Very/Somewhat good.\" Democrats/Lean Democrats are more positive, with 46% viewing it as \"Very/Somewhat good,\" while Republicans/Lean Republicans are more negative, with 41% viewing it as \"Very/Somewhat bad\" [image1].\n\nFor capitalism, the overall perception among Hispanics is more positive, with 54% having a positive impression and 41% having a negative one [5]. This is consistent with the broader U.S. public, where 57% have a positive impression of capitalism [11]. The bar chart (image1) also reflects this, showing that 37% of all Hispanics view capitalism as \"Very/Somewhat good,\" compared to 46% for Democrats/Lean Democrats and 21% for Republicans/Lean Republicans. This indicates that political affiliation plays a significant role in shaping views on capitalism.\n\nAge also influences perceptions of socialism.

In contrast, Hispanic Republicans and Republican leaners show a more pronounced preference for capitalism, with 68% having a positive view of capitalism compared to 50% among Hispanic Democrats and Democratic leaners [12]. This suggests that political affiliation plays a crucial role in shaping attitudes toward these economic systems.\n\nRegarding socialism, the data indicates that about half of Hispanics have a negative impression of it, with 53% viewing it negatively and 41% positively [10].

According to the data, a substantial share of Latinos, particularly those who identify as Democrats or are politically aligned with them, believe that the Democratic Party works hard to earn their votes. For instance, 71% of Latinos say the Democratic Party works hard for their votes, and 63% say it \"really cares about Latinos\" [9]. In contrast, only 45% of Latinos say the Republican Party works hard to earn their votes [9], indicating a clear disparity in how the two parties are perceived.\n\nAmong specific subgroups, certain demographics show stronger alignment with the Democratic Party. For example, 44% of Latino immigrants, 48% of Spanish-dominant Latinos, 42% of Catholics, and 42% of evangelical Protestants say the statement \"Democrats work hard to earn Latinos’ votes\" describes their views very or extremely well [1]. Similarly, 45% of Latinos aged 50 to 64 and 46% of those aged 65 or older express this sentiment [1]. These figures suggest that older and more religiously affiliated Latinos tend to have more positive views of the Democratic Party's efforts to engage with them.\n\nHowever, the perception of the Republican Party is less favorable. Only 19% of all Latinos say the statement \"Republicans work hard to earn Latinos’ votes\" describes their views very or extremely well [6]. This figure varies across subgroups, with 40% of Latino Republicans and 13% of Latino Democrats expressing this view [6]. Among independent and non-partisan Latinos, the percentages are even lower, indicating that the Republican Party struggles to connect with these groups.\n\nThe data also reveal differences in how various demographic groups perceive the differences between the two parties. While 54% of Hispanic Democrats and 57% of Hispanic Republicans believe there is a great deal of difference between the parties, smaller shares of independent Hispanics (35% and 39%) hold this view [2]. This suggests that partisanship plays a significant role in shaping perceptions of party differences, with more committed partisans being more likely to see distinct ideological positions between the two parties.\n\nThe bar chart in image1 provides further insight into these perceptions by showing survey data on the perceived differences among Hispanics across various demographic groups. The chart measures responses such as \"A great deal of difference,\" \"A fair amount of difference,\" and \"Hardly any difference at all.\" It highlights that factors like education level, nativity, generation, age, language dominance, religion, and the importance of being Hispanic influence how Latinos perceive the differences between the parties. For example, foreign-born Latinos are more likely to see a great deal of difference between the parties compared to U.S.-born Latinos [12].\n\nImage2, which compares the percentage of Latinos who identify as Democrats versus Republicans, reveals that 36% of all Latinos identify as Democrats, while 19% identify as Republicans [12]. This disparity is even more pronounced among certain subgroups. For instance, 44% of foreign-born Latinos identify as Democrats, compared to 29% of U.S.-born Latinos [12]. Similarly, 48% of Spanish-dominant Latinos identify as Democrats, compared to 23% of English-dominant Latinos [12]. These findings underscore the influence of language and cultural identity on political affiliation within the Latino community.\n\nIn summary, the data indicate that perceptions of political parties' efforts to earn Latino votes differ significantly across demographic groups. While the Democratic Party is generally viewed more favorably, especially among older, more religious, and immigrant Latinos, the Republican Party faces challenges in connecting with these groups. The political landscape among Latinos is shaped by a combination of factors, including age, religion, language, and immigration status, highlighting the diversity within this community and the need for tailored political strategies. \n\n![The image shows a bar chart comparing the percentage of Latinos who identify as Democrats versus Republicans, separated by different demographic categories.](image2)"}

While a majority of Hispanics have a more positive view of the Democratic Party than the GOP, with majorities saying the Democratic Party represents their interests well, fewer say the same about the Republican Party. Specifically, 34% of Hispanics say the Republican Party represents their interests at least somewhat well [2]. \n\nWhen it comes to perceived differences between the parties, about half of Hispanics do not see a great deal of difference between the Democratic and Republican parties, with 36% saying there is a fair amount of difference and 16% saying there is hardly any difference at all.

According to the evidence, both men and women in STEM value flexibility to balance work and family needs, as well as a welcoming workplace, though the differences between them are not statistically significant [7]. However, men tend to place more importance on opportunities for promotion and high-paying jobs, while women in STEM are more likely to value jobs that help others, making a meaningful contribution to society, and being respected and valued [7].\n\nThese values may be connected to the challenges women face in entering and remaining in STEM fields. For example, women in STEM are more likely to report experiencing discrimination at work due to their gender and to consider discrimination a major reason for the underrepresentation of women in these fields [3]. Additionally, women in STEM are more inclined to feel that their gender has made it harder for them to succeed at work, citing concerns such as pay gaps and unequal treatment from coworkers [3]. These experiences may contribute to the perception that certain job characteristics, such as those related to helping others or making a meaningful contribution, are more important for women than for men.\n\nThe image titled \"Characteristics men and women in STEM value about the same\" shows that both genders value flexibility and a welcoming workplace, but women place greater emphasis on roles that focus on helping others [7]. This aligns with the text quote that states women in STEM are more likely to want a job that helps others compared to men in STEM [6]. Furthermore, the image highlights that women value making a meaningful contribution to society more than men do [7].\n\nIn addition, the image titled \"Bar chart comparing the distribution of STEM postgraduate degree holders across different educational levels\" shows that the majority of STEM postgraduate degree holders come from undergraduate and graduate education, which may indicate that higher education plays a critical role in shaping career choices and job preferences [3]. The text also suggests that early encouragement and quality schooling are important factors in attracting more women and minorities to STEM fields [10].\n\nMoreover, the image titled \"Major reasons why more women, blacks, and Hispanics are not in STEM jobs\" reveals that discrimination in recruitment, hiring, and promotion is a significant barrier for women, with 39% of women citing this as a major reason [1]. Similarly, lack of encouragement from an early age is another major factor, with 39% of women attributing this to the underrepresentation of women in STEM [1].\n\nThe image titled \"Comparative chart displaying the experiences and perceptions of different racial/ethnic groups working in STEM jobs regarding discrimination\" further supports the idea that women, particularly women of color, face unique challenges in the STEM workforce. For instance, Black respondents reported significantly higher rates of discrimination and barriers to success compared to White respondents [6].\n\nIn summary, the differences in job characteristics valued by men and women in STEM, particularly the greater emphasis on helping others and making a meaningful contribution among women, may reflect the challenges they face in the workforce, including discrimination and a lack of support.

In comparison, women in STEM jobs often perceive unfair treatment in recruitment and promotion opportunities, with 83% of women believing they are treated fairly in hiring, compared to 67% of men [image8].\n\nOverall, while both racial and gender-based discrimination exist in STEM fields, the data suggests that Black individuals face disproportionately higher rates of racial discrimination compared to other racial groups, whereas women, especially in male-dominated environments, encounter significant gender-based challenges. These findings highlight the complex and intersecting nature of discrimination in the STEM workforce.\n\n![Black STEM employees are especially likely to say they have experienced discrimination at work](image1)  \n![Black STEM employees are especially likely to say they have experienced discrimination at work](image7)"}

These factors vary significantly across generations, reflecting differences in upbringing, exposure to Hispanic culture, and the extent of connection to one's heritage.\n\nOne key factor is **language**. While some may assume that speaking Spanish is essential to being considered Hispanic or Latino, the data shows otherwise. For example, among second-generation Latinos, 84% believe that speaking Spanish does not make someone Latino, and this percentage rises to 92% for third or higher generation Latinos [7]. This suggests that language is not a universal determinant of identity. Additionally, the chart in image1 highlights that a significant portion of self-identified Hispanics do not speak Spanish, with even lower percentages among later generations [image1].\n\nAnother important factor is **cultural and familial connections**. Many individuals with Hispanic ancestry do not identify as Hispanic due to limited contact with their Hispanic relatives or a lack of cultural links. For instance, 27% of those who do not identify as Hispanic cite mixed backgrounds or distant Hispanic ancestry, while 16% mention upbringing or lack of contact with relatives [1]. Image3 visually represents these reasons, showing that the most common explanations include mixed backgrounds, upbringing, and cultural disconnection [image3].\n\n**Generational status** also plays a critical role. The data indicates that as generations progress, the likelihood of identifying as Hispanic decreases. Among third or higher generation Hispanics, only 77% self-identify as Hispanic, and this drops further to 50% for fourth or higher generations [10]. Image4 illustrates this trend, showing that foreign-born individuals are more likely to often self-identify as Hispanic compared to later generations [image4]. This shift reflects the influence of growing up in the U.S., where identity may become more tied to American culture than to the heritage of one's parents.\n\nAdditionally, **racial and ethnic identity** is shaped by personal perception. According to the text, the U.S. has long relied on self-reports for measuring race and ethnicity, which means that individuals may identify differently based on their own understanding of what it means to be Hispanic [9]. Image5 supports this idea, showing that many Hispanics prefer to identify by their country of origin or heritage rather than using the terms \"Hispanic/Latino\" or \"American\" [image5].\n\nFinally, **social and demographic trends** suggest that future generations may continue to see a decline in Hispanic identification. With lower immigration and higher intermarriage rates, more individuals with Hispanic ancestry may not identify as Hispanic or Latino, even if they have a strong cultural or familial connection to the community [11].\n\n![Self-identification of Hispanics varies by generation, with younger generations less likely to identify as Hispanic](image4)  \n![Factors influencing non-identification as Hispanic include mixed backgrounds, upbringing, and cultural disconnection](image3)  \n![Language is not a universal requirement for Hispanic identity, especially among later generations](image1)"}

In contrast, only 35% of third or higher generation self-identified Hispanics report the same [5]. This trend is further supported by data showing that among immigrant self-identified Hispanics, 59% say their parents took them to Hispanic cultural celebrations often, reflecting that the majority of this group grew up outside the U.S. [8].\n\nFor self-identified non-Hispanics with Hispanic ancestry, the experience is even less common. Just 9% report that when they were growing up, their parents took them to Latino cultural celebrations, while 60% say this never happened [6].

Image1 presents a bar chart comparing different countries and regions, with segments representing percentages that could reflect survey responses about traditional or modern values. While the exact metric is unclear, the data suggests varying degrees of alignment with either traditional or modern values across different regions. This variation is also evident in image8, which shows the influence of various groups on people's lives over two years. The chart indicates that family, religion, and parents remain highly influential, but there is a noticeable decline in their influence from 2013 to 2014. This could suggest a gradual shift towards more individualistic or modern values.\n\nImage2 provides a timeline of responses to two statements over three years, showing a decrease in agreement with certain statements from 2012 to 2014. This trend may reflect a growing skepticism or resistance to traditional values, as fewer people agree with the statements over time. Additionally, image4 shows a stacked bar chart depicting a trend of decreasing values in the red segment and increasing values in the orange segment over the years, which could symbolize a shift from traditional to modern values.\n\nIn conclusion, the views on traditional values versus modern values have evolved over the years, with a noticeable shift towards embracing modern values, particularly among younger generations. However, traditional values still hold significant influence, especially in countries where family, religion, and community play a central role in daily life. ![The image is a bar chart from 2014 comparing different countries and regions, labeled at the bottom.

Additionally, text quote [3] states that \"RISING LIVING COSTS AND UNEMPLOYMENT ARE THE BIGGEST CONCERNS FOR YOUTH ACROSS THE MIDDLE EAST,\" reinforcing the importance of unemployment as a pressing issue.\n\nLooking at the image quotes, image2 provides data on unemployment over time. According to the image, the percentage of people concerned about unemployment increased from 42% in 2011 to 49% in 2014. This trend indicates a growing concern about unemployment in the region during this period.\n\nImage3 compares concerns between GCC and Non-GCC regions. The image shows two horizontal bars: one orange labeled \"GCC\" with the number \"55\" and one green labeled \"Non-GCC\" with the number \"55.\" This suggests that both GCC and Non-GCC regions had equal levels of concern about unemployment, with 55% of respondents expressing concern. However, it is important to note that this data does not specify whether the concern is about unemployment alone or other issues.\n\nImage5 also compares concerns between GCC and Non-GCC regions, showing an orange bar labeled \"GCC\" with the number \"63\" and a green bar labeled \"Non-GCC\" with the number \"62.\" While this image does not explicitly mention unemployment, it provides a general comparison of concerns between the two regions, indicating that Non-GCC regions may have slightly higher overall concern levels than GCC regions.\n\nImage6 presents data on concerns about various issues, including unemployment, over three years (2012–2014). The image shows that concern about unemployment increased from 41% in 2012 to 44% in 2013 and then to 49% in 2014. This aligns with the data from image2, further confirming the rising trend in unemployment concerns.\n\nFinally, image11 mentions \"CONCERN ABOUT KEY ISSUES-GCC/NON-GCCSPLIT,\" suggesting that there are differences in the types of issues that concern GCC and Non-GCC regions. While the specific details of these differences are not provided, it is likely that unemployment is one of the key issues affecting both regions.\n\nIn summary, concerns about unemployment appear to be relatively high in both GCC and Non-GCC regions, with similar levels of concern reported in image3. However, the data from image2 and image6 indicates that concern about unemployment has been increasing over time, particularly in 2014. This rise in concern about unemployment may be part of a broader trend of growing dissatisfaction with economic conditions in the region. Overall, the data suggests that unemployment is a significant concern for youth in both GCC and Non-GCC regions, and its increasing prevalence may reflect broader economic challenges.\n\n![Concern about unemployment is relatively high in both GCC and Non-GCC regions, with similar levels of concern reported.](image3)"}

Additionally, it is noted that \"Concern about the rising cost of living by country\" [11] and \"Concern about unemployment by country\" [3] suggest that there is a variation in how different countries perceive these issues.\n\nLooking at the image quotes, image6 provides a detailed bar graph showing the trends in concern over the years for various issues, including the rising cost of living and unemployment. For the rising cost of living, the percentages increased from 57% in 2011 to 63% in 2014, while unemployment saw an increase from 42% in 2011 to 49% in 2014. This suggests a growing concern over both issues over time.\n\nRegarding the comparison between GCC and Non-GCC regions, image3 and image4 offer insights. Image3 shows a bar chart where the Non-GCC region has a higher value (55) compared to the GCC region (39), suggesting that the Non-GCC region has a higher level of concern regarding the rising cost of living. Similarly, image4 presents a comparison where both GCC and Non-GCC regions have similar values (63 and 62 respectively), which might indicate a relatively balanced level of concern for other issues, but not specifically for the rising cost of living or unemployment.\n\nImage1 and image5 provide further context by displaying stacked bar charts that show the levels of concern across different countries. These charts indicate that a majority of respondents in each region are \"Very concerned,\" as shown by the predominance of the blue section in each bar. This suggests that while there may be variations between GCC and Non-GCC regions, the overall trend is one of high concern for these issues across the Middle East.\n\n![The image is a bar chart comparing concerns over different issues for three consecutive years: 2012, 2013, and 2014.](image2)\n![The image is a bar chart comparing responses over three years (2012, 2013, and 2014) for two different questions or statements.](image7)\n\nIn conclusion, while the Non-GCC region shows a higher level of concern regarding the rising cost of living compared to the GCC region, the overall concern for both the rising cost of living and unemployment is significant across the Middle East, with many countries showing high levels of concern."}

For example, in 2014, the concern level for the rising cost of living was 63% in GCC countries and 62% in Non-GCC countries [5]. However, this difference is minimal, suggesting that both groups face similar levels of concern regarding this issue.\n\nIn terms of unemployment, the data indicates a consistent trend where the concern levels are relatively stable over the years. In 2014, the concern level for unemployment was 49% in GCC countries and 49% in Non-GCC countries [5]. This suggests that both GCC and Non-GCC countries experience comparable levels of concern regarding unemployment.\n\n![Concern about the rising cost of living by country](image8)\n\nWhen examining specific GCC countries, the data reveals varying levels of concern. For instance, in 2014, the concern levels for the rising cost of living were as follows: Kuwait (63%), Qatar (63%), Saudi Arabia (63%), UAE (63%), Oman (63%), and Bahrain (63%). These figures indicate a uniform level of concern across these GCC countries.

This high energy consumption is likely linked to its large CO2 emissions, as the transportation sector accounts for a substantial portion of these emissions. In fact, the transportation sector contributes 30% of CO2 emissions in OECD countries and about 20% globally [12]. The USA also has a high number of motor vehicles per 1,000 people, as shown in the bubble chart [3]. The size of the bubble for the USA indicates a significant share of global motor vehicle demand, suggesting a higher level of vehicle ownership and potentially higher CO2 emissions from transportation.\n\nIn contrast, China has a large share of global motor vehicle demand but a lower number of motor vehicles per 1,000 people [3]. This suggests that while China's motor vehicle market is growing, the per capita ownership is still relatively low compared to the USA. However, China's CO2 emissions are still significant due to its large population and industrial activities. The country's energy consumption per capita is 597 kg oil equivalent, which is much lower than the USA's but higher than some other countries like India [6].\n\nGermany, on the other hand, has a moderate energy consumption per capita of 4017 kg oil equivalent [6], and it has a relatively high number of motor vehicles per 1,000 people. Germany is also part of Europe, which continues to lead the world with the most stringent passenger vehicle greenhouse gas (GHG) and fuel efficiency standards [11]. This suggests that Germany may have implemented policies to reduce the environmental impact of its transportation sector despite having a high level of vehicle ownership.\n\nThe implications of these comparisons are clear. The USA's high energy consumption and vehicle ownership suggest a larger environmental footprint, particularly in terms of CO2 emissions. China's growing motor vehicle market and increasing energy consumption could lead to higher emissions in the future if not managed properly. Germany's stringent regulations and moderate energy consumption indicate a more balanced approach to managing environmental impacts.\n\n![Part of transports InCo2emissions](image2)  \n![The potential reduction of CO2 emissions across various sectors](image7)"}

According to the data, venture-backed liquidity events in Europe reached $15 billion over the past 24 months, as indicated by the text quote [6], which highlights that European VC is driving the best exit multiples globally. This aligns with the image quote [image6], which states \"Venture-backed liquidity events in the last 24 months: $15 Billion*\" over a background resembling a part of a currency note. This suggests that despite lower average exit values, Europe has seen substantial liquidity events.\n\nIn terms of venture capital investments, the bar chart in image1 provides a detailed breakdown of venture capital investments and exits across different European regions. Germany, for instance, had a venture invested of $0.8 billion and a venture exit of $4.4 billion, while the UK had $1.4 billion invested and $3.9 billion in exits. France and Europe (Other) also showed notable figures, with $1.1 billion and $0.6 billion invested, respectively, and $3.0 billion and $2.5 billion in exits. This indicates that while the total amount of capital invested may be lower in Europe compared to the USA, the returns from these investments are substantial.\n\nFurthermore, the line graph in image2 compares the post-IPO performance of venture capital-backed IPOs between the U.S. and Europe from March 2004 to July 2011. The blue line representing European IPOs shows consistently higher performance than the red line for U.S. IPOs during this period. This suggests that European companies not only achieve higher exit multiples but also maintain better post-IPO performance.\n\nThe 3D stacked graph in image3 compares the distribution of US and EU venture capital funds based on quartile rankings. While US VC funds show a uniform distribution across all quartiles, EU VC funds have a higher share in the top quartile, indicating that European funds may be more efficient or selective in their investments. This aligns with the text quote [11], which mentions that the scarcity of VC money in Europe has led to higher capital efficiency and yield due to increased selectivity among investors.\n\nAdditionally, the chart in image7 provides a visual comparison of venture capital statistics between the USA and Europe since 2004. It shows that the USA has a larger share of total capital invested (82% vs. 18%), more exits over $100 million (78% vs. 22%), and more home runs (10x capital invested) (64% vs. 36%). However, Europe has a slightly higher share of total exits (41% vs. 59%). This suggests that while the USA leads in overall investment and large exits, Europe has a more balanced distribution of exits and a higher proportion of successful investments.\n\nFinally, the median multiple of cash invested in Europe is 7.2, compared to 4.5 in the USA, as shown in image4. This indicates that European investments, on average, generate higher returns relative to the amount invested. Moreover, 57.26% of European investments achieved a multiple of 5 or more, compared to 47.27% in the USA. These figures highlight the efficiency and effectiveness of European venture capital in generating high returns.\n\nIn conclusion, while the USA has a larger share of total venture capital investments and exits, Europe demonstrates higher capital efficiency, better post-IPO performance, and a greater proportion of successful investments, suggesting that venture-backed liquidity events and venture capital investments in Europe are highly competitive despite lower average exit values. ![European venture-backed liquidity events and venture capital investments show higher capital efficiency and better post-IPO performance compared to the USA](image6)."}

European VC has demonstrated strong fundamentals within an inefficient market, benefiting from higher capital efficiency than the US [2]. This is reflected in the data, where Europe's capital efficiency is roughly 70% higher than in the US, driven by low entry valuations and the scarcity of VC money, which allows investors to be more selective [11]. \n\nIn terms of investment multiples, Europe outperforms the USA. The median multiple of cash invested in Europe is 7.2, compared to 4.5 in the USA [4]. Additionally, a higher percentage of European investments achieve a multiple of 5 or more (57.26% vs. 47.27%) [4]. This suggests that European VC funds are generating better returns on a per-investment basis.\n\nHowever, when it comes to exit values, the USA has higher median exit valuations ($236 million vs. $173 million) [4]. Despite this, Europe compensates for smaller average exit values through lower entry valuations and higher capital efficiency [9]. For instance, while average exit values in Europe are about 25% smaller than in the US, the higher capital efficiency and selectivity of European investors lead to better overall performance [9].\n\nA visual comparison of the distribution of VC fund performance further highlights this difference. European VC funds show a higher concentration in the top quartile compared to US VC funds, with 35% of European funds in the top quartile versus 25% for US funds [image1]. This indicates that European VC funds are more likely to deliver top-tier performance.\n\nAnother visual representation shows that European venture-backed companies have achieved significant exits, with $15 billion in liquidity events over the last 24 months [image5]. Additionally, the number of exits exceeding $100 million is disproportionately higher in Europe, with 22% of such exits occurring in Europe compared to 78% in the US [image8]. This suggests that while the US has more total exits, Europe is producing a higher proportion of large exits relative to its market size.\n\nFurthermore, the post-IPO performance of European venture capital-backed IPOs has been stronger than that of their US counterparts between March 2004 and July 2011 [image7]. The blue line representing European IPOs consistently outperforms the red line for US IPOs during this period, indicating that European companies tend to perform better after going public.\n\nIn summary, while the USA has higher median exit valuations, Europe demonstrates superior investment multiples and capital efficiency, leading to better overall performance in venture capital. ![European VC funds show a higher concentration in the top quartile compared to US VC funds](image1)."}

In contrast, the pie chart in image4 illustrates the distribution of various product categories by their percentage contribution to gross margin (GM), where **Mobile, Tablets & Accessories** contribute 35%, and **Fashion, Footwear & Accessories** contribute 28%.

Instead, Mobile, Tablets & Accessories, despite having a slightly lower transaction volume (9%), contribute more significantly to the gross margin.\n\nThis discrepancy suggests that e-commerce platforms need to focus on optimizing both transaction volume and gross margin. For instance, categories with high transaction volumes but lower margins may require strategies to improve pricing or reduce costs, while categories with high margins but lower transaction volumes may benefit from marketing efforts to increase visibility and sales.

To understand this, we need to analyze both the text and image quotes provided.\n\nFrom the text quotes, we can see that several respondents indicated reasons for not using the radio, such as \"DO NOT HAVE TIME,\" \"CANNOT AFFORD RADIO,\" \"DO NOT HAVE A RADIO,\" and \"MY RADIO IS DAMAGED.\" Additionally, some individuals mentioned that they do not listen to the radio because \"PROGRAM IN RADIO ARE NOT INTERESTING\" or \"DONTGO TOPLACES WHERETHEY PLAY THE RADIO.\" These responses highlight barriers to radio access and engagement.\n\nLooking at the image quotes, image3 provides a detailed breakdown of technology usage within households. It shows that mobile phones are the most commonly owned device, with 86% of households owning one, followed by television (49%), radio (45%), computers (10%), and internet access (5%). The data also reveals that rural households have lower ownership rates for most technologies compared to urban households. For example, while 45.3% of rural households have a radio, 46.1% of urban households do. Similarly, 84.3% of rural households own a mobile phone, compared to 92.5% in urban areas. This suggests that access to technology varies significantly between rural and urban areas, which may influence radio listening habits.\n\nImage7 further illustrates the use of technology outside the household. It shows that 68% of respondents do not use any of the listed technologies outside their homes, while 20% use a mobile phone, 11% use television, 4% use a computer, and 4% use the internet. This indicates that most people rely on their personal devices at home rather than using public or shared technologies outside.\n\nNow, considering the relationship between technology usage and radio listening habits, image5 provides valuable insights. It shows that 46% of respondents never listened to the radio in the past six months, while 27% listened every day. However, there are notable differences based on location and gender. In rural areas, 27.4% listened every day, whereas in urban areas, 28.0% did so. Gender-wise, males were more likely to listen daily (34.3%) compared to females (20%). This suggests that radio listening habits vary depending on where people live and their gender.\n\nImage4 adds another layer to this analysis by showing how people listen to the radio. Overall, 76% of respondents use a radio set, while 40% use a mobile phone. In rural areas, 77% use a radio, and 39% use a mobile phone, whereas in urban areas, 70% use a mobile phone, and 49% use a radio. This indicates that while radios are still widely used, especially in rural areas, mobile phones are becoming an increasingly popular alternative for accessing radio content.\n\nFinally, image6 highlights the types of radio programs that people listen to. It shows that 82% of respondents listened to news, 58% to music, 25% to folk music, and so on. This suggests that news and music are the most popular radio content types, which could explain why some people choose to listen to the radio despite other barriers.\n\nIn conclusion, the differences in technology usage within households compared to outside the household are significant, with mobile phones being the most commonly used device both inside and outside the home. However, radio remains a popular medium, particularly in rural areas, where it is often the primary source of entertainment and information. ![Radio is the primary source of entertainment and information in rural areas](image3)."}

The preference for social media and entertainment suggests that businesses targeting this demographic should focus on platforms like Facebook, YouTube, and other social media networks.\n\n![The most downloaded mobile content is games/apps.](image3)\n\nFurthermore, the data indicates that games and apps are the most downloaded mobile content, with 70% of users downloading games or apps [3]. This highlights a significant opportunity for app developers and game companies to tap into the Indonesian market. The popularity of mobile gaming and apps also suggests that there is a strong demand for mobile content, which can be leveraged by businesses to create engaging and profitable services.\n\nIn terms of business opportunities, the data shows that e-commerce is growing rapidly, with platforms like Tokobagus and OLX experiencing substantial growth on their Android apps [8]. Additionally, the rise of social media and instant messaging (IM) as primary communication methods among mobile users presents opportunities for businesses to engage with customers through these channels. For instance, 90% of mobile users use IM daily, with WhatsApp, BlackBerry Messenger (BBM), and LINE being the top three IM applications [8].\n\n![The image shows a world map highlighting countries in different shades of red.](image1)\n\nMoreover, the high percentage of mobile internet users who access the internet through mobile devices (62%) compared to those with home internet access (less than 10%) [10] indicates that mobile-first strategies are essential for businesses operating in Indonesia. This is further supported by the fact that 92% of Internet users in Indonesia own a Facebook account, and almost 90% of these users access it through mobile devices [10]. This suggests that social media platforms, particularly Facebook, are critical channels for reaching and engaging with the Indonesian audience.\n\nThe potential business opportunities in Indonesia are also reflected in the mobile advertising industry. In 2013, the mobile ads industry in Indonesia was worth $9.5 million, with XL owning 25% of the market [5]. Mobile ads are expected to account for 5 to 10% of the total ads industry in 2015, indicating a growing trend in mobile advertising. The popularity of intrusive ads such as interstitial and off-deck ads, despite the controversy they have sparked, further underscores the significance of mobile advertising in the Indonesian market.\n\nIn conclusion, the demographics of mobile internet users in Indonesia, characterized by a young and tech-savvy population, directly influence their content preferences and present significant business opportunities in areas such as mobile gaming, social media, e-commerce, and mobile advertising."}

According to the data, Telkomsel has consistently been the largest in both categories. For example, in a specific year, Telkomsel had 139.3 million subscribers and 63.5 million data users [3]. In comparison, XL had 58.3 million subscribers and 32 million data users, while Indosat had 54.2 million subscribers and 29 million data users [3]. These figures highlight Telkomsel's dominance in the market.\n\n![Telkomsel, XL, and Indosat's subscriber and data user numbers](image3)\n\nLooking at the broader context, the trend in ARPU (Average Revenue Per User) for mobile data has shown an upward movement from 2015 to 2017, which could be indicative of increased data usage among these operators' users [1]. This suggests that as more users engage with mobile data services, the revenue per user is likely to increase, potentially benefiting all three operators.\n\n![Trends in ARPU for Voice, SMS, and Mobile Data](image1)\n\nAdditionally, the market share distribution among telecom operators in Indonesia shows that Telkomsel holds the largest share at 42%, followed by XL + AXIS at 18%, and Indosat at 16.7% [5].

According to the text quote [8], by early 2014, there were 240 million Indonesian mobile subscribers, with continuous growth throughout the year. This suggests that the overall market was expanding, and Telkomsel, being one of the largest operators, likely experienced an increase in its subscriber base during this period. Additionally, image6 provides specific data on Telkomsel’s subscriber base, showing 139.3 million subscribers in 2014. While the exact number for 2013 is not provided, the overall growth trend in the market implies that Telkomsel's subscriber base was also growing.\n\nNext, let's examine the ARPU (Average Revenue Per User) of Telkomsel. Image1 shows a bar chart comparing the prepaid ARPU for four telecom companies, including Telkomsel, for the years 2008 and 2012. The data indicates that Telkomsel's ARPU decreased from 53 in 2008 to 34 in 2012. Although the specific ARPU for 2013 and 2014 is not directly provided in the text, image5 presents a line graph titled \"Exhibit 1: Indonesia Prepaid ARPU (Rp'000)\" which shows a consistent decline in ARPU from 38 in 2008 to 30 in 2012. This trend suggests that the decline in ARPU continued beyond 2012, which would include the period from 2013 to 2014.\n\nThe decline in ARPU can be attributed to several factors mentioned in the text. Quote [7] states that the initial reduction in ARP U was due to a massive price war initiated by the government. This price war likely led to lower revenue per user as operators competed to attract customers. Furthermore, quote [2] mentions that reduced usage on SMS and voice calls led to a decrease in ARP U. This aligns with quote [9], which notes that people are increasingly using data-based IM and VoIP services, leading to even less usage of SMS and voice calls. As a result, the revenue from these traditional services declined, contributing to the overall drop in ARPU.\n\nAdditionally, quote [5] explains that Voice ARP U will continue to flatten in the medium term, and SMS ARP U will continue to decrease because most users will eventually switch to smartphones. This shift towards smartphone usage means that users are consuming more data and less voice and SMS, further reducing the revenue from these services. However, the text also mentions that data ARP U may pick up later as users increase their data consumption, which could potentially offset some of the declines in other areas.\n\nIn summary, the subscriber base of Telkomsel likely increased from 2013 to 2014 due to the overall growth in the Indonesian mobile market. However, the ARPU of Telkomsel decreased during this period, primarily due to the price war initiated by the government, the shift in user behavior towards data-based communication, and the declining usage of traditional voice and SMS services. These factors collectively contributed to the observed changes in both subscriber base and ARPU.\n\n![The image shows a bar chart comparing the prepaid ARPU for four telecom companies in 2008 and 2012.](image1)"}

According to the image quotes, specifically image3, which provides a detailed breakdown of smartphone users for Telkomsel and XL in 2013, Telkomsel had 35.4 million smartphone users, while XL had 15 million smartphone users. This indicates a significant presence of smartphone users for both companies during this period.\n\nRegarding ARPU trends, the text quotes provide insight into the overall decline in ARPU due to various factors. For instance, quote [5] states that \"Voice ARP U will continue to flatten in the medium term. SMS ARP U will continue to decrease, because majority of users will be on smartphones eventually.\" This suggests that as more users shifted to smartphones, the usage of traditional voice and SMS services declined, leading to a reduction in ARPU. Additionally, quote [4] mentions that \"Recently people use data-based IM, VoIP, etc., thus leads to even less usage of SMS and voice call,\" reinforcing the idea that the shift to data-based communication reduced the reliance on traditional services, further contributing to lower ARPU.\n\nQuote [7] also supports this by stating that \"Less usage on SMS and voice also lead to reduced ARP U.\" This aligns with the observed trend of declining ARPU as users increasingly adopted smartphones and data-driven services.\n\nFurthermore, quote [8] notes that \"CDMA operators managed to force GSM operators to reduce their tariffs.\" This price competition likely contributed to the decline in ARPU, as operators adjusted their pricing strategies to remain competitive.\n\nIn summary, between 2013 and 2014, the number of smartphone users for Telkomsel and XL increased, while ARPU trends showed a decline due to reduced usage of traditional voice and SMS services, increased adoption of data-based communication, and competitive pricing strategies among operators. ![The image shows the number of smartphone users for Telkomsel and XL in 2013](image3)."}

Streaming has become a dominant force, particularly in genres like Latin, where it accounts for 68% of the total sales distribution, as shown in image1. This suggests that Latin music fans are highly engaged with streaming platforms, which may reflect the genre's popularity on digital services. In contrast, genres like Country show a more balanced approach, with 18% of their sales coming from streaming, indicating a stronger reliance on traditional album sales.\n\nIn image3, we see that Rock is driven by catalog in all formats, with 82% of its activity coming from streams. This highlights the enduring appeal of older Rock music, which continues to be popular on streaming platforms. Pop, on the other hand, is mainly driven by current releases, with only 58% of its activity coming from streams. This suggests that Pop music is more closely tied to new releases and trends, with a smaller portion of its activity coming from older tracks.\n\nImage8 provides further insight into the genre-specific shares of album sales, song sales, and streams. For example, Rock has a higher share of album sales (37%) compared to streams (23%), while R&B/Hip-Hop has a slightly higher share of streams (26%) than album sales (18%). This indicates that R&B/Hip-Hop is more heavily influenced by streaming, possibly due to the genre's association with modern, digital-first consumption.\n\nOverall, these findings suggest that streaming is becoming increasingly important across all genres, but its impact varies. Genres like Latin and Rock have seen a significant shift toward streaming, while others, such as Country, maintain a stronger connection to traditional album sales. This trend reflects broader changes in how consumers access and engage with music, with streaming playing a central role in shaping modern music consumption habits.\n\n![Streaming has become the leading format in music consumption, particularly in genres like Latin and Rock.](image1)"}

According to the data, **streaming accounts for 70% of total music activity**, which is higher than album sales (51%) and song sales (49%) [5]. This suggests that consumers are increasingly favoring on-demand access to music over traditional album purchases or individual song downloads.\n\nIn terms of genre-specific trends, **R&B/Hip-Hop** stands out as a leader in streaming, with 39% of its sales coming from streaming, compared to 26% for Rock and 36% for Pop [4]. This aligns with the observation that **hip-hop fans are at the forefront of the digital music movement** [3], indicating that this genre is particularly well-suited to the streaming model due to its high engagement and frequent consumption patterns.\n\nOn the other hand, **Rock** dominates album sales, with 32% of its sales coming from physical albums and 26% from digital albums, making it the genre with the highest percentage of physical album sales [4]. This suggests that **Rock remains a strong genre for album-oriented listening**, possibly due to its long-standing tradition of album-centric releases and dedicated fan bases. However, **Pop** is driven mainly by current releases rather than catalog material, highlighting a different consumer behavior where newer songs are more likely to be purchased or streamed [8].\n\nThe **Dance/Electronic** genre shows a unique trend, with 51% of its sales coming from streaming, indicating that this genre is highly adapted to the streaming model [4]. In contrast, **Country** has a relatively low percentage of streaming (18%), with a higher proportion of sales coming from physical and digital albums [4].

However, **Latin** and **Dance/Electronic** have much lower catalog shares, with Latin having only 5% of its total activity from catalog material [8]. This could indicate that these genres are more driven by new releases and trends, with less emphasis on older works.\n\nThe implications of these differences are significant for the music industry. The dominance of streaming across most genres suggests that **artists and labels need to adapt their strategies to focus on streaming platforms** to maximize reach and revenue. For genres like **Rock**, which still has a strong presence in album sales, there may be opportunities to leverage catalog material to generate additional revenue. For **Pop**, the focus on current releases highlights the importance of continuous innovation and marketing to maintain relevance.\n\nAdditionally, the **high streaming share in R&B/Hip-Hop** underscores the importance of this genre in shaping the future of the music industry. As streaming continues to grow, genres that are well-aligned with this model will likely see increased success. Conversely, genres with lower streaming shares, such as **Country**, may need to explore new ways to engage listeners and promote their music in the streaming era.\n\nOverall, the differences in streaming and album sales trends across genres highlight the **diversity of consumer preferences** and the need for the music industry to adopt flexible strategies that cater to these varying behaviors.

This suggests that \"Abbreviation\" can be a source of confusion, particularly when paired with other categories like \"Entity\" or \"Description.\"\n\nFurthermore, the Confusion metric is defined as a value that never exceeds 1, where the closer it approximates 1, the less pronounced the confusion [8].

Based on the evidence provided, we can analyze the performance of different querying strategies in terms of their ability to maintain label diversity.\n\nFrom the text quotes, it is clear that most active querying strategies suffer from selection bias and fail to cover all classes equally. For example, [4] states that \"Active learning tends to select data that is biased to specific classes\" and that \"some classes are simply not selected for training.\" This issue is particularly pronounced in long-tail distributions, as noted in [9], where it is emphasized that \"active querying strategies have a selection bias that is particularly harmful in long-tail distributions.\"\n\nAdditionally, [10] highlights that \"most of the active querying strategies fail to query all the classes even at relatively larger initial query budgets,\" suggesting that certain strategies are consistently poor at maintaining label diversity. Furthermore, [7] and [12] indicate that strategies like VAAL, Entropy, and Margin tend to perform worse in terms of label diversity compared to others, especially when compared to the proposed strategy (\"Ours\").\n\nLooking at the image quotes, we find visual confirmation of this trend. Image7 shows a bar graph comparing the label diversity of different querying strategies on the PathMNIST dataset.

The user's utterance is first processed by a bidirectional LSTM (Bi-LSTM) utterance encoder, which converts the natural language input into a continuous vector representation. This encoding captures the meaning of the user's message in a way that can be used by subsequent components of the system [2].\n\nOnce the user utterance is encoded, it is combined with the encoding of the previous system action to update the dialogue state. This dialogue state is maintained in a continuous form within a dialogue-level LSTM (LSTM_D), which keeps track of the conversation's context over time [10]. The dialogue state tracking component uses this information to estimate the user's goals, represented as a list of slot-value pairs.\n\nBased on the updated dialogue state, the policy network determines the next system action. The policy network takes inputs such as the dialogue-level LSTM state, log probabilities of candidate values from the belief tracker, and the encoding of query results. It then emits a system action in the form of a dialogue act, which could be something like \"request(time)\" or \"confirm(date)\" [5].\n\nAfter the system action is determined, the natural language generator (NLG) produces a human-readable response. The NLG replaces delexicalized tokens in a predefined template with actual values from either the estimated user goal or the knowledge base (KB) entities, depending on the emitted system action [6]. For example, if the system action is \"request(time)\", the NLG might generate a response like \"System: Ok, what time do you prefer?\" [6].\n\nThis entire process is part of an end-to-end task-oriented dialogue system, where all components—utterance encoding, dialogue state tracking, and policy network—are trained together in a fully differentiable manner [4]. The system can also be trained using imitation learning, where it learns from expert demonstrations to improve its performance [1].\n\n![The system generates a response by encoding the user's input, updating the dialogue state, determining the next action via a policy network, and producing a natural language response using a natural language generator.](image6)"}

Unlike many existing datasets, which often have limited categories or lack fine-grained entity representation, the SnapNTell dataset includes 22 distinct categories, covering a wide range of real-world entities such as landmarks, mammals, plants, and more [5]. This broad categorization ensures that the dataset reflects the diversity of the real world, making it highly suitable for evaluating models' ability to recognize and understand specific entities.\n\nIn terms of entities, the SnapNTell dataset contains 7,568 unique entities, significantly more than other datasets like ViQuAE and Encyclopedic VQA, which have fewer entities and less detailed categorization [7]. Each entity is accompanied by 10 representative images, ensuring rich visual context for training and evaluation. Additionally, the dataset provides 10 knowledge-intensive QA pairs per entity, resulting in a total of 75,680 QA pairs. This extensive coverage allows for deeper exploration of entity-specific knowledge, which is crucial for advanced VQA tasks [10].\n\nRegarding knowledge, the SnapNTell dataset emphasizes knowledge-intensive responses, requiring models to provide detailed, entity-specific information rather than simple yes/no or choice-based answers [4]. This focus on deep knowledge sets it apart from datasets like VQA v2, GQA, and OK-VQA, which often rely on more straightforward question-answer formats [image1]. The inclusion of explicit entity mentions in the answers further enhances the dataset's utility for entity-centric VQA tasks.\n\nThe table comparing different datasets highlights the superiority of SnapNTell in several key aspects. It has more categories, unique entities, QA pairs, and images compared to ViQuAE and Encyclopedic VQA. Moreover, it introduces the feature of anonymity, where questions are designed to be highly anonymous, meaning they do not directly reference the entity in the question itself [image7]. This design challenges models to infer the correct entity based on the image and the answer, promoting more robust and generalizable learning.\n\nAdditionally, the performance metrics show that methods using the SnapNTell dataset achieve higher scores across various evaluation metrics, including ROUGE, BLEU, METEOR, and BELURT [image4]. This indicates that the dataset effectively evaluates models' capabilities in recognizing entities and generating knowledge-rich responses.\n\n![The SnapNTell dataset includes 22 categories with 7,568 unique entities, each associated with 10 images and 10 knowledge-intensive QA pairs, making it more comprehensive than other VQA datasets.](image5)\n\nIn conclusion, the SnapNTell dataset offers a more extensive and detailed approach to VQA by incorporating a wide range of categories, a large number of unique entities, and knowledge-intensive responses, setting it apart from other VQA datasets."}

To answer this, we need to examine the performance of different models in NER tasks and identify the best-performing one along with its contributing features.\n\nFrom the text quotes, we know that $\\mathrm{NCRF++}$ is a neural sequence labeling toolkit that supports various models and configurations. It allows users to design custom neural models through a configuration file and supports both handcrafted and automatically extracted features. The toolkit also enables the generation of nbest label sequences rather than just the best one, which can improve performance by considering multiple possible outcomes [1].\n\nIn particular, quote [7] presents a table comparing the performance of six CRF-based models on three benchmarks, including NER. The results show that the model \"CCNN+WLSTM+CRF\" achieves the highest F1-value for NER, with a score of 91.35. This model combines character-level CNNs (CCNN) with word-level LSTMs (WLSTM), suggesting that the integration of both character and word-level representations significantly enhances performance in NER tasks. Additionally, the use of CRF as the final layer helps in capturing dependencies between labels, further improving the model's accuracy.\n\nQuote [9] reinforces this finding, stating that most state-of-the-art models utilize the framework of word LSTM-CRF with character LSTM or CNN features. The model \"CCNN+WLSTM+CRF\" aligns with this trend, indicating that the combination of character and word-level features is crucial for achieving high performance in NER.\n\nMoreover, quote [4] lists several key references that have contributed to the development of sequence labeling models, including those that use bidirectional LSTM-CNNs and CRF. These models often incorporate both character and word-level features, which are essential for capturing contextual information and improving recognition accuracy.\n\nIn addition to the model architecture, the features used in the model play a critical role in its performance. Quote [2] mentions that the embedding size of each handcrafted feature is configured in the network's configuration, highlighting the importance of carefully selecting and configuring features. Furthermore, quote [4] discusses the use of handcrafted features such as POS tags and capitalization, which can provide valuable linguistic information to the model.\n\nQuote [4] also introduces the concept of using automatic features, such as CLSTM and CCNN, which are derived from the data itself rather than being manually engineered. These features can capture complex patterns and relationships within the data, leading to improved performance. In the case of the \"CCNN+WLSTM+CRF\" model, the use of both character-level CNNs and word-level LSTMs suggests that the model benefits from both manual and automatic feature extraction.\n\nFinally, quote [3] highlights the efficiency of $\\mathrm{NCRF++}$, noting that it can be greatly accelerated through parallel computing on a GPU. This efficiency allows for faster training and decoding, which is particularly important when working with large datasets and complex models like \"CCNN+WLSTM+CRF.\"\n\n![The model \"CCNN+WLSTM+CRF\" achieves the highest F1-value for NER, combining character-level CNNs and word-level LSTMs with CRF for improved performance.](image3)\n\nThe model that achieves the highest F1-value for Named Entity Recognition (NER) is \"CCNN+WLSTM+CRF,\" which combines character-level CNNs (CCNN) with word-level LSTMs (WLSTM) and uses CRF for inference. The features contributing to its performance include character-level information processed through CNNs and word-level information processed through LSTMs, along with the use of CRF to capture label dependencies."}

According to the text, training BERT on a GPU is roughly equivalent to a trans-American flight in terms of CO₂ emissions [4]. This comparison highlights the significant environmental impact of training even a single NLP model.\n\nFor instance, the table in image3 provides an estimate of the cost and energy required for training different numbers of models. Training a single model requires 120 hours and costs between $52 and $175 in cloud computing expenses, while the electric cost is only $5. However, when scaling up to 24 models, the total hours jump to 2,880, and the cloud cost ranges from $1,238 to $4,205, with an electric cost of $118. For 4,789 models, the hours increase to 239,942, and the cloud cost ranges from $103,000 to $350,000, with an electric cost of $9,870 [3]. These figures illustrate the exponential growth in both time and cost as the number of models increases, which directly correlates with higher CO₂ emissions.\n\nFurthermore, image5 provides a clear comparison of CO₂e emissions from various everyday activities. For example, a round-trip flight from New York to San Francisco emits approximately 1,984 lbs of CO₂e, while an average American's annual emissions are around 36,156 lbs. The table also shows that a car's lifetime emissions amount to 126,000 lbs of CO₂e. Comparing these values to the emissions from training NLP models, it becomes evident that the environmental impact of training even a single large model can be substantial. For instance, training BERT on a GPU is comparable to a trans-American flight, and training more complex models like T2T_big or NAS could result in emissions that far exceed those of a single flight or even an individual's annual emissions.\n\n![Training a single NLP model can emit as much CO₂ as a trans-American flight.](image5)\n\nIn addition, image1 provides a detailed breakdown of the hardware, power consumption, and costs associated with various NLP models. For example, the T2T_base model uses 8 P100 GPUs and has a power consumption of 1,200 W, while the T2T_big model uses 8 P100 GPUs and has a power consumption of 2,400 W. These figures highlight the significant energy requirements of training large NLP models, which contribute to their high CO₂ emissions.\n\n![The table provides information about different models and their associated hardware, power consumption, and costs.](image1)\n\nMoreover, image2 shows the distribution of energy sources used by different countries and companies. For example, China relies heavily on coal (65%) for its energy, while Google uses a higher percentage of renewables (56%). This variation in energy sources can significantly affect the carbon footprint of training NLP models, as the environmental impact depends on the type of energy used. If a model is trained using renewable energy, its CO₂ emissions will be lower compared to if it is trained using fossil fuels.\n\n![The table shows the energy consumption distribution for various consumers.](image2)\n\nIn conclusion, the CO₂ emissions from training NLP models are comparable to everyday activities such as air travel and can even exceed the annual emissions of an average person. This comparison underscores the need for more sustainable practices in the development and training of NLP models."}

The results are summarized in Table 3, which shows that using fixed sine positional encodings passed at every attention layer in both the encoder and decoder yields the best performance [8]. When spatial positional encodings are not used, there is a significant drop in AP, indicating their importance. However, passing them only in the decoder leads to a minor AP drop, suggesting that the encoder may be less sensitive to positional encodings. Additionally, learned spatial encodings passed to the attentions give similar results to fixed sine encodings, and interestingly, not passing any spatial encodings in the encoder only leads to a minor AP drop of 1.3 AP. These findings suggest that while positional encodings are important, their exact configuration can vary with minimal impact on performance [6].\n\nNext, the loss components also play a crucial role in determining AP. The paper explores various combinations of loss functions, including `class`, `ℓ₁`, and `GIoU`. The results show that using `class` and `GIoU` yields an AP of 39.9, which is a significant improvement over using `class` and `ℓ₁` (AP: 35.8). Furthermore, combining all three losses (`class`, `ℓ₁`, and `GIoU`) results in the highest AP of 40.6, demonstrating that the combination of these loss components significantly enhances performance [7].\n\nIn addition to positional encodings and loss components, the number of decoder layers also influences AP. The study shows that the performance metrics, such as AP and AP₅₀, improve after every decoder layer, with a total improvement of +8.2/9.5 AP between the first and last layer. This indicates that increasing the depth of the decoder improves the model's ability to refine predictions and achieve higher AP [11].\n\n![The table presents results for different configurations of positional encoding in an encoder-decoder model, showing the impact on Average Precision (AP) and other metrics.](image3)\n\n![The image shows the average precision (AP) and AP at 50% IoU (AP₅₀) performance as a function of decoder layers, highlighting how NMS affects AP across layers.](image4)\n\n![The table summarizes results across different metrics for combinations of `class`, `ℓ₁`, and `GIoU`, showing the impact on AP and other performance measures.](image7)\n\nIn conclusion, different configurations of positional encodings and loss components significantly affect the Average Precision (AP) in the DETR-DC5 model for object detection."}

This indicates that ProgramFC is more effective at handling complex reasoning tasks, especially when the model size is smaller.\n\nIn addition, ProgramFC outperforms several other models on the HOVER and FEVEROUS datasets. For example, on HOVER 2-hop, ProgramFC's performance is higher than that of Codex, FLAN-T5, and even InstructGPT - CoT, which performed best on most tasks [6]. The results suggest that ProgramFC's structured approach to fact-checking, which involves breaking down complex claims into simpler steps, leads to more accurate predictions.\n\nHowever, ProgramFC is not without its challenges. Error analysis reveals that as the complexity of the claims increases, so does the proportion of semantic errors in the generated programs. Specifically, for 4-hop claims, semantic errors account for 77% of all errors, with structural errors being particularly prevalent [11]. These errors often involve incorrect program structure or missing arguments/variables, indicating that generating appropriate step-by-step reasoning strategies for long-chain claims remains a challenge. Additionally, incorrect execution accounts for 23% of errors in 4-hop claims, suggesting that even when the program is syntactically correct, the execution may still lead to incorrect predictions [7].\n\nDespite these challenges, ProgramFC offers significant advantages in terms of interpretability.

One of the most common reasoning steps involves **closed-domain knowledge**, where background information is derived from the table's caption or title. For instance, understanding that \"Prod.\" corresponds to \"Productivity\" is crucial for verifying certain claims [6]. Another frequent reasoning step is **commonsense knowledge**, such as recognizing that \"random chance\" equates to 50% accuracy, which is essential for evaluating claims involving numerical data [6]. Additionally, **simple lookup** plays a significant role, as it requires identifying specific values within the table [6].\n\nIn terms of challenges, the dataset emphasizes the need for **numerical reasoning**, which is evident in the high proportion of claims requiring complex calculations. For example, the difference between 57.5% and 50% is a key part of verifying a claim about productivity [4]. Another major challenge is the **ambiguity and half-truths** present in scientific discourse, where some claims are only partially correct or rely on vague pronouns, making them difficult to verify [5]. Furthermore, the dataset reveals that many claims require **multiple reasoning steps**, with some needing up to 11 steps for verification [12]. This complexity is reflected in the distribution of reasoning steps, where deeper claims (with 3 or more steps) make up a significant portion of the dataset [4].\n\nThe most common errors encountered during verification include **grounding errors** (50%), where the claim lacks sufficient evidence in the table, and **ambiguity errors** (22%), which arise from unclear or vague language in the claim [3]. Additionally, **calculation errors** (20%) and **program errors** (8%) highlight the importance of accurate numerical reasoning and the potential pitfalls of relying on automated methods [3].\n\n![The image illustrates an example from the S CI T AB dataset, including a table and a reasoning graph that demonstrates how claims are verified using closed-domain knowledge, commonsense reasoning, and numerical calculations.](image1)\n\n![The histogram shows the distribution of reasoning steps in the SciTAB dataset, highlighting that deep claims (with 3 or more steps) make up a significant portion of the dataset.](image4)\n\n![The confusion matrices for InstructGPT and GPT-4 illustrate the challenges models face in accurately classifying claims into supported, refuted, or not enough information categories.](image5)\n\nThe most common reasoning steps in the SciTAB dataset involve closed-domain knowledge, commonsense knowledge, and simple lookup, while the primary challenges include ambiguity, half-truths, and the need for complex numerical reasoning."}

For instance, Vicuna-13B-PT achieves the highest Micro-F1 score on MAVEN-ERE when using CoT with logical constraints, while Llama2-13B-PT performs best on the same dataset under all logical constraints [3]. These results emphasize the importance of carefully selecting and integrating logical constraints to optimize model performance.\n\n![Performance metrics of models on MAVEN-ERE and Causal-TimeBank](image3)\n\nAnother key finding is that pre-training models on datasets like LLM-LR, which contain multi-hop reasoning instances, can significantly improve their performance on complex reasoning tasks. For example, LlaMA2-13B trained on LLM-LR surpasses larger models like ChatGPT, demonstrating the value of specialized training data [6]. This aligns with the observations in image6, where models like GPT-4 and Llama2 show improved performance when logical constraints are incorporated [6].\n\n![Comparison of model performance on multiple tasks](image6)\n\nOverall, the integration of logical constraints and an optimal number of demonstration samples can greatly enhance the performance of models on tasks like ERE and deductive reasoning. However, the effectiveness of these strategies depends on the specific model and task, as well as the quality and relevance of the logical constraints used [8]."}

Logical constraints, when incorporated into the model's instruction, significantly reduce logical inconsistency while improving performance. Post-processing, although effective in eliminating inconsistencies, may compromise the quality of the output due to potential semantic deviations and computational overhead.\n\nFrom the text quotes, it is clear that incorporating logical constraints into LLMs improves their ability to produce logically consistent answers [1]. For example, \"When using retrieval-based approaches to obtain logic constraints and incorporate them into LLM instruction, the logical inconsistency of LLMs’ answers is greatly reduced\" [1]. This aligns with the findings in image1, which shows that models like Llama2-13B and Vicuna-13B achieve lower logical inconsistency (LI) percentages when using logical constraints compared to post-processing. In particular, the post-processing method results in a 0% LI for both models, but this comes at the cost of potentially compromising the semantic accuracy of the output [1].\n\nOn the other hand, post-processing ensures that the final output is free from logical conflicts, as seen in image7, where post-processing achieves a 0% LI for both Vicuna-13B-PT and Llama2-13B-PT across the MAVEN-ERE and Causal-TimeBank datasets. However, the trade-off is that post-processing may lead to outputs that are semantically distant from the ground truth. The text also highlights that \"the semantics of the post-processing answer may be far from the ground truth due to the random selection\" [1], suggesting that while post-processing reduces inconsistency, it may not always enhance the overall quality of the response.\n\nIn contrast, logical constraints provide a more balanced approach by guiding the model during the generation process. As noted in image6, the use of logical constraints leads to stable improvements in performance, especially when combined with a larger number of demonstrations. Additionally, image4 illustrates how logical constraints can be integrated into different approaches—generative, retrieval-based, and pre-training-based—to refine the model's outputs and ensure consistency.\n\nOverall, while both logical constraints and post-processing reduce logical inconsistency, logical constraints offer a more effective and sustainable solution for improving the quality and consistency of LLM outputs. The text also emphasizes that \"it is important to tell LLMs both 'What' (demonstrations) and 'How' (logical constraints)\" [6], reinforcing the value of logical constraints in enhancing reasoning capabilities.\n\n![Logical constraints significantly reduce logical inconsistency in LLMs, as demonstrated by improved performance metrics on MAVEN-ERE and Causal-TimeBank datasets.](image1)"}

This breadth ensures that the questions are not only varied in content but also in format, requiring models to handle a wide range of image types and question structures.\n\nFor instance, in disciplines like Art & Design and Humanities & Social Sciences, where visual data tends to be more \"natural\" and less complex, questions often involve multiple-choice formats with images placed at various positions (e.g., at the beginning, middle, or end of the question). These questions typically require less intricate reasoning and are often associated with easier difficulty levels [image1]. On the other hand, in fields such as Science, Health & Medicine, and Tech & Engineering, the questions are more complex, involving mathematical notations, diagrams, and medical images, which demand advanced perceptual and reasoning skills [image3].\n\nThe MMMU dataset also emphasizes the use of interleaved text-image inputs, where models must jointly understand both modalities to arrive at a solution. This is particularly evident in disciplines like Health & Medicine, where questions may involve MRI scans and require the application of domain-specific knowledge to interpret the findings [image5]. Furthermore, the dataset includes a variety of image types, such as diagrams, tables, charts, chemical structures, photographs, paintings, and medical images, which are distributed across different disciplines based on their relevance and the type of reasoning they require [image6].\n\nThe performance of models on these questions also varies by discipline.

This framework is characterized as a \"Retrieve-Read\" model [9]. In this approach, documents are indexed, and when a query is made, the system retrieves relevant information from the knowledge base and generates a response. However, this method lacks flexibility and does not incorporate advanced techniques for optimizing retrieval or generation. The Naive RAG is simple but limited in its ability to handle complex queries or adapt to specific scenarios.\n\nAdvanced RAG builds upon the Naive RAG by introducing specific improvements to overcome its limitations. It focuses on enhancing retrieval quality through pre-retrieval and post-retrieval strategies. For instance, Advanced RAG refines indexing techniques using methods like a sliding window approach, fine-grained segmentation, and the incorporation of metadata. Additionally, it employs optimization methods to streamline the retrieval process [10]. These enhancements allow for more accurate and efficient retrieval of information, making the system better suited for complex tasks.\n\nModular RAG represents a significant advancement over both Naive and Advanced RAG by offering enhanced adaptability and versatility. It incorporates diverse strategies for improving its components, such as adding specialized modules for search, memory, routing, prediction, and task adaptation [6]. This modular approach allows for flexible orchestration of processes, enabling the system to dynamically adjust to different scenarios. For example, the Demonstrate-Search-Predict (DSP) framework and the iterative Retrieve-Read-Retrieve-Read flow of ITER-RETGEN illustrate how module outputs can be used to bolster another module’s functionality [3].

The task fulfillment rates in each category and input modality are detailed in Appendix B. For instance, Chameleon seems to perform slightly better on text-only prompts, while Gemini+ and GPT-4V+ are slightly better on mixed-modal ones [7]. \n\nIn terms of inter-annotator agreement for the absolute evaluation, Figure 10 illustrates the levels of agreement on each question. For questions about simple, objective properties of the responses, such as whether the model responses contain objectionable content, annotators rarely disagree. However, for more subjective questions, such as whether the response fulfills the task or whether the model interprets the prompt correctly, there is more variation in judgments [12]. The table in image1 provides statistics about agreement levels among annotators for different comparisons involving Chameleon, Gemini, and GPT-4 models.

In fine-grained visual recognition, RAR significantly outperforms baseline models like CLIP and LLaVA1.5 finetuning. For example, on 4-shot and 8-shot settings, RAR boosts top-1 accuracy from 57.0% to 63.2% and from 63.0% to 69.8%, respectively [12]. This improvement is attributed to the retrieval-augmented ranking mechanism, which allows MLLMs to better align predictions with ground truth by leveraging external memory and nuanced context understanding [11]. The results also show that RAR consistently outperforms other methods across multiple datasets, including fine-grained ones like Flower102, Food101, and OxfordPets [2].\n\nIn contrast, for zero-shot object recognition, RAR's performance is evaluated using a different setup. Here, the model must align regions with textual class descriptions without any labeled examples. The experiments show that RAR achieves notable improvements over the CLIP baseline, particularly in rare categories, where it surpasses CLIP by as much as 19.6 percentage points in AP_r [10]. This suggests that RAR's retrieval and ranking mechanisms are especially effective in handling the challenges of zero-shot recognition, where distinguishing subtle differences among categories is critical.\n\nOverall, RAR's performance in fine-grained visual recognition is characterized by consistent improvements across various shot settings, while its performance in zero-shot object recognition highlights its ability to handle rare and unseen categories effectively.

Initially, the system performs pre-processing on the input image to enhance its suitability for retrieval and ranking. This includes cropping and blurring techniques, which help focus the model's attention on the relevant objects within the image. For instance, in object detection datasets, images often contain multiple objects of varying sizes, and some may dominate the image while others are smaller and less prominent. By cropping the image regions based on proposal bounding box coordinates and resizing them to a fixed proportion, the system ensures that each object is processed individually. Additionally, blurring non-target areas helps the MLLMs concentrate on the objects of interest, improving their ability to recognize and classify these objects accurately [5].\n\nOnce the image has been pre-processed, the system uses an image encoder to extract feature embeddings from the cropped regions. These embeddings are then indexed and stored in an external memory or database, allowing for efficient retrieval during the inference stage. The retrieval process involves searching this memory for the most similar embeddings, which correspond to the top-k class names retrieved from the multimodal retriever. This step is crucial as it narrows down the vast possibilities of potential categories to those most likely relevant based on historical data and semantic closeness [10].\n\nAfter retrieving the top-k class names, the system employs MLLMs to rank these candidates. Unlike traditional approaches that might rely solely on the initial retrieval order, the MLLMs use advanced linguistic and semantic analysis to assess the contextual appropriateness of each class name with the input image. This allows the system to refine the rankings and produce more accurate predictions. The ranked results are then used to make the final prediction of the image category, combining the internal knowledge of the MLLMs with the retrieved information [7].\n\nThe entire process is illustrated in the pipeline shown in image6, which depicts the two main stages: the multimodal retriever and the retrieving & ranking process. The multimodal retriever is responsible for querying a large multi-modal external memory or database to find information relevant to the input query or context. It creates and stores multimodal embeddings, optimizing retrieval speed through index construction techniques. During the inference stage, the system retrieves the top-k similar results from the memory and uses MLLMs to rank and make the final predictions [6].\n\n![The pipeline for RAR includes a multimodal retriever and a retrieving & ranking stage, where MLLMs rank the retrieved results for accurate predictions.](image6)\n\nIn summary, the multimodal retriever system processes and ranks objects for recognition in detection datasets by first pre-processing the input image, extracting and indexing embeddings, retrieving the most relevant class names, and then using MLLMs to rank these candidates based on contextual appropriateness. This approach enhances the accuracy and efficiency of object recognition tasks, particularly in scenarios with fine-grained categories and limited training data."}

The accuracy increases significantly for head, torso, and tail entities when retrieval augmentation (RA) is applied, while the hallucination rate decreases. Notably, the improvement for tail entities is the most substantial, addressing the challenge of hallucinations in long-tailed entities.\n\nThe performance of SnapNTell is also reflected in the human evaluation results.

In contrast, negative augmentation ( $\\cdot$ negative) created a more imbalanced dataset, leading to underperformance compared to the original [4]. Additionally, the -negative technique, which removes negative examples, also resulted in inferior performance due to a reduced number of training samples [4].\n\nAnother form of augmentation involved adding both positive and negative examples, resulting in a dataset with 50% positive and 50% negative examples [1]. This augmented dataset contained 458,477 examples, and models trained on this set showed significant improvements. For instance, the DSC loss function achieved the highest F1 scores across all datasets, particularly showing substantial gains on imbalanced datasets like +negative [5]. This highlights the effectiveness of DSC in scenarios where data imbalance is a challenge.\n\nIn terms of specific model configurations, the DSC loss consistently outperformed other loss functions like FL (Focal Loss) and DL (Dice Loss) across multiple datasets. For example, on the MRPC and QQP datasets, BERT+DSC achieved the highest F1 scores, demonstrating the most significant improvements over baseline models [image1]. Similarly, on the English CoNLL 2003 dataset, BERT-MRC+DSC showed the highest F1 score of 93.33, with notable improvements over BERT-MRC [image3].\n\nThe impact of hyperparameters in the Tversky index (TI) further illustrates the importance of tuning for optimal performance. On the Chinese OntoNotes4.0 dataset, the highest F1 score of 84.67 was achieved when $\\alpha$ was set to 0.6, while for QuoRef, the best performance was obtained at $\\alpha = 0.4$ [6]. These results indicate that the choice of $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ significantly affects the performance of TI-based models.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that the dice loss (DL) and DSC are not always suitable for accuracy-oriented tasks. On the Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST) datasets, BERT with cross-entropy (CE) outperformed both DL and DSC in terms of accuracy [10]. This suggests that while DSC is effective for tasks involving imbalanced data or metrics like F1, it may not be the best choice for tasks where accuracy is the primary concern.\n\nOverall, the performance differences among BERT model configurations are influenced by the choice of augmentation techniques and loss functions. Configurations like +positive and DSC tend to perform better on imbalanced datasets, while CE remains superior for accuracy-focused tasks. The results highlight the importance of selecting appropriate techniques based on the specific characteristics of the dataset and task at hand.\n\n![BERT model performance across different augmentation techniques and datasets](image2)"}

BLEU is a traditional metric that relies on n-gram matching between the machine translation hypothesis and a reference translation. It focuses on lexical-level similarity, counting the number of overlapping n-grams. On the other hand, COMET-RANK is a more recent neural framework that uses embeddings and a ranking architecture to capture semantic similarity and other aspects of translation quality.\n\nFrom the data presented in the tables and graphs, it is evident that COMET-RANK outperforms BLEU in most cases. For example, in Table 1, which shows results for all eight language pairs with English as the source, the three COMET models consistently outperform BLEU and other metrics like CHR F, YiSi-1, and BERTScore. Similarly, in Table 2, which focuses on language pairs where English is the target, COMET-RANK achieves higher scores than BLEU, especially in cases where English is the source language.\n\nThe trends observed in the performance of these metrics are also noteworthy. In Figure 3, which displays the Kendall Tau scores for various metrics across different language pairs, it is clear that COMET-RANK maintains a relatively high correlation with human judgments even when the number of top MT systems considered decreases. This suggests that COMET-RANK is more robust and reliable in evaluating translation quality across different scenarios. In contrast, BLEU's performance tends to drop more sharply as fewer systems are considered, indicating that it may not be as effective in capturing the nuances of translation quality when dealing with smaller sets of systems.\n\n![COMET-RANK outperforms BLEU in evaluating translation quality across various language pairs.](image1)\n\nIn addition, the inclusion of the source language in the COMET-RANK model has been shown to improve its performance. For instance, in Table 4, the scores for COMET-RANK when using only the reference are lower compared to when both the reference and source are included. This improvement is particularly significant in reverse language pairs, such as cs-en and de-en, where the source is not English. The results suggest that incorporating the source language helps the model better understand the context and improve its evaluation of translation quality.\n\n![The inclusion of the source language improves COMET-RANK's performance in evaluating translation quality.](image4)\n\nOverall, COMET-RANK demonstrates superior performance compared to BLEU in evaluating translation quality across different language pairs, with notable improvements when the source language is included."}

For instance, the precision, recall, and F-score for the Negative class are generally lower than those for the Positive class, as noted in the dataset's distribution [7]. This imbalance affects the overall evaluation metrics, particularly the macro-average, which treats all classes equally and does not account for the disparity in class sizes.\n\nLooking at the specific performance metrics, the table presents a detailed comparison of various classifiers, including KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, SVM, 1DConv-LSTM, DME, CDME, and BERT Multilingual. The Negative sentiment detection scores for these classifiers vary significantly. For example, some models like Logistic Regression and Random Forest show relatively better performance on the Negative class compared to others, such as SVM, which performs poorly in terms of diversity [4]. \n\n![Negative sentiment detection performance across classifiers](image3)\n\nIn addition to the individual metrics, the table also provides aggregate measures such as micro-average, macro-average, and weighted average. The micro-average tends to be more reliable in imbalanced datasets because it accounts for the overall distribution of classes. However, the macro-average may not reflect the true performance due to the low number of Negative examples. The weighted average, which considers the class distribution, might provide a more balanced view of classifier performance.\n\nAmong the classifiers, BERT Multilingual and other deep learning models like 1DConv-LSTM showed promising results in some cases, but their performance was still limited by the characteristics of the code-mixed data [4].

These results highlight the effectiveness of the multitask learning approach employed by SciIE.\n\n![SciIE's performance in entity recognition, relation extraction, and coreference resolution](image2)\n\nIn addition to these metrics, the multitask learning approach used by SciIE provides several insights. By sharing span representations and leveraging cross-sentence information, the model effectively improves performance across all tasks [10]. This unified setup allows SciIE to better predict span boundaries and outperforms previous state-of-the-art scientific IE systems without using any hand-engineered features or pipeline processing [10]. The model's ability to handle multiple tasks simultaneously contributes to its overall effectiveness and efficiency.\n\n![Comparison of different models on tasks like Span Identification, Keyphrase Extraction, and Relation Extraction](image4)\n\nFurthermore, the inclusion of coreference links in the knowledge graph significantly enhances the quality of the automatically constructed graph, as evidenced by human evaluations [11]. This suggests that the multitask learning approach not only improves individual task performance but also contributes to the overall coherence and utility of the knowledge graph.\n\n![Bar chart comparing performance figures for various detection tasks with and without coreference](image3)"}

According to the text, BERT models, particularly BERT_LARGE, demonstrate superior performance across multiple tasks, with high scores on CoLA, QNLI, and RTE [5]. For instance, BERT_LARGE outperforms other models in several key areas, suggesting that its architecture and pretraining approach are highly effective for a wide range of language understanding tasks. However, the CNN models, while not matching BERT's overall performance, show competitive results in specific scenarios. For example, the CNN Base model performs as well as STILTs in aggregate, but on tasks involving sentence-pairs like MRPC and RTE, STILTs (and by extension, BERT) performs much better [3].\n\nAdditionally, the table in image5 provides a detailed comparison of various models on the GLUE benchmark. It shows that BERT_BASE and BERT_LARGE consistently achieve higher average scores compared to the CNN models, highlighting their effectiveness in capturing complex linguistic patterns. However, the CNN models, especially the larger configurations, offer advantages in terms of training speed and efficiency. For example, the BPE Large model has more parameters than the CNN Base model but does not perform better in aggregate, although it is faster to train [3]. This suggests that while BERT models may excel in accuracy, CNN models can be more efficient in certain contexts.\n\nFrom these comparisons, we can infer that BERT models are generally more powerful for tasks requiring deep contextual understanding, such as those found in the GLUE benchmark. Their ability to capture both left and right context through a bidirectional transformer architecture gives them an edge over unidirectional models like the CNNs. On the other hand, CNN models, while slightly behind in overall performance, may offer practical benefits in terms of computational efficiency and training time, making them suitable for applications where resources are limited.\n\n![BERT models generally outperform CNN models on the GLUE benchmark, indicating their superior capability in capturing complex linguistic patterns.](image5)"}

However, other findings suggest that this may not always be beneficial. For instance, one study found that aligning word embeddings did not significantly improve performance across all languages, indicating that a priori alignment might not be necessary in some cases [7]. This is further supported by another quote, which notes that while pre-training and alignment can help, they are particularly useful in multi-lingual scenarios rather than bilingual ones [8].\n\nLooking at the data in image3, which shows the \"unaligned\" and \"aligned\" scores for various language pairs, we see mixed results. For example, the \"GL → EN\" pair saw a decrease in score when aligned, while \"RU → EN\" showed a slight improvement. Other pairs like \"PT → EN\" and \"TR → EN\" had minimal changes, suggesting that alignment may not consistently enhance performance across all language pairs.\n\nIn image2, the evaluation metrics show that alignment often leads to higher scores, especially in certain cases. For instance, the \"GL + PT evaluated on GL\" row shows a significant increase when alignment is applied, with the highest score being 22.4. Similarly, \"AZ + TR evaluated on AZ\" also saw a notable improvement with alignment, reaching 7.5. However, for \"BE + RU evaluated on BE,\" the improvement was smaller, with the aligned score being 9.6 compared to 7.9 for the unaligned version. These results suggest that alignment can be beneficial but is not universally effective.\n\nImage6 provides visual evidence of how pre-training and alignment affect BLEU scores. The top graph shows that pre-trained models (dashed lines) generally outperform standard models (solid lines), especially when the training set size is small. The bottom graph highlights that the gain from pre-training is most significant at smaller training set sizes and decreases as the dataset grows. While this does not directly address alignment, it underscores the importance of preprocessing and alignment techniques in improving translation quality, especially in low-resource scenarios.\n\nIn summary, the alignment of word embeddings can positively impact BLEU scores in some translation tasks, particularly when the source and target languages are more similar or when there is limited training data. However, its effectiveness varies, and in some cases, alignment may not provide significant benefits. The impact of alignment depends on factors such as language similarity, training data size, and the specific translation task at hand.\n\n![The table presents evaluation metrics for different training and evaluation setups involving language pairs, showing that alignment can lead to higher scores in some cases.](image2)"}

For instance, the BLEU scores in Table 3 show that languages like Russian (RU) and Hebrew (HE), which have lower baseline scores, experience larger gains from pre-training compared to more similar languages like French (FR) and Italian (IT). This aligns with the observation that systems with more room for improvement tend to benefit more from pre-training [1]. Additionally, the results suggest that pre-training is most effective when the baseline system is not too poor but still has room for growth, typically with a baseline BLEU score between 3-4 [4].\n\nThe role of training set size also plays a critical part in the effectiveness of pre-training. The graphs in image2 illustrate that pre-training leads to greater improvements in BLEU scores when the training data is limited. As the training set size increases, the relative gain from pre-training decreases, indicating that pre-training is particularly beneficial in low-resource scenarios [2]. This is further supported by the qualitative analysis in Table 6, which shows that pre-trained models are better at capturing rare vocabulary and producing grammatically correct sentences, especially in low-resource settings [6].\n\nLanguage similarity also influences the effectiveness of pre-training. The table in image1 highlights that language pairs with higher similarity, such as Galician (GL) to Portuguese (PT), show the largest gains from pre-training, while less similar pairs, like Belarusian (BE) to Russian (RU), show smaller or even negative gains [11]. This suggests that pre-trained embeddings are more effective when the source and target languages are linguistically closer, as the semantic structures are more aligned, making it easier for the model to generalize [3].\n\nMoreover, the alignment of embedding spaces between source and target languages can enhance the performance of multilingual systems. The table in image8 demonstrates that aligning embeddings improves evaluation scores, especially in multilingual setups where a single encoder is used for multiple languages [11]. This indicates that aligning embeddings helps the model learn more effectively by ensuring that words from different languages are represented in a consistent vector space.\n\nIn summary, pre-training significantly improves translation accuracy, particularly in low-resource scenarios and when the source and target languages are linguistically similar.

This indicates that the R-GCN component plays a crucial role in improving model performance by updating mention representations based on their relations to other mentions.\n\nFurthermore, the ablation study reveals that removing relation types (No relation types in Table 3) results in marginal improvements compared to ELMo alone, suggesting that a naive entity graph without distinguishing edges by type does not add much value to the task [1]. The impact of specific relation types is also evident: for instance, removing DOC-BASED connections leads to a significant drop in performance because these connections provide important information about mentions appearing closely in the same document [7]. Similarly, the removal of MATCH and COREF connections also affects performance, although their impact is less pronounced compared to DOC-BASED connections.\n\nIn the masked condition, the model performs better when relying on exact matching for graph construction, as it is more effective in recovering coreference links on the masked version than the unmasked one [3].

For instance, on ACE04-O, DyGIE achieves an Entity F1 score of 84.7, which is significantly higher than other systems like Katiyar and Cardie (2018) and Wang and Lu (2018) [3]. Similarly, on ACE05-O, DyGIE scores 82.9, outperforming the other systems [3]. On the GENIA dataset, DyGIE achieves an Entity F1 score of 76.2, which is also the highest among the evaluated systems [3]. These results highlight DyGIE's effectiveness in handling overlapping entities, particularly in domains where such challenges are prevalent.\n\nWhen it comes to configurations, the role of CorefProp and RelProp is crucial. CorefProp, which handles coreference propagation, has a smaller effect on entity F1 compared to ACE05, but it significantly improves pronoun performance in tasks like ACE05, where disambiguation is essential [12]. For example, DyGIE shows a 6.6% improvement in pronoun performance due to the coreference layer [12]. However, CorefProp appears to hurt relation extraction, as seen in some experiments where its inclusion led to lower relation F1 scores [8].\n\nOn the other hand, RelProp, which deals with relation propagation, benefits both entity and relation extraction, especially in sentences with multiple entities. The addition of relation propagation leads to significant improvements in tasks involving complex relationships between entities [9]. For example, in the ACE05 dataset, DyGIE without RelProp shows a lower F1 score compared to DyGIE with RelProp, indicating that relation propagation enhances the model's ability to capture relational information [8].\n\nThe impact of these components can also be observed in the overall performance metrics. When comparing DyGIE with its variants, DyGIE achieves the highest Entity F1 score (87.1), while the model without CorefProp performs best in relation extraction (F1 = 60.2) [8]. This suggests that while CorefProp is beneficial for entity recognition, particularly in contexts requiring coreference resolution, RelProp plays a more critical role in improving relation extraction.\n\n![DyGIE achieves the highest Entity F1 score across all datasets.](image3)\n\n![CorefProp improves pronoun performance in ACE05.](image12)\n\n![RelProp significantly enhances relation extraction in sentences with multiple entities.](image9)"}

In contrast, the GENIA dataset, which also has coreference annotations, shows a slightly lower improvement, with an Entity F1 score of 76.2 [5]. These results indicate that while coreference annotations contribute positively to the model's performance, the extent of the improvement may vary depending on the dataset's characteristics.\n\nMoreover, the table in image5 highlights the impact of coreference annotations by comparing DyGIE's performance against other systems on these datasets. The highest Entity F1 scores are consistently achieved by DyGIE, suggesting that the inclusion of coreference propagation enhances its ability to recognize entities effectively [5].\n\nIn addition, the figure in image4 provides further evidence of the importance of iterative processes in entity recognition. The graph titled \"Entity F1\" shows that the best performance for entity extraction occurs at two iterations of coreference propagation [6].

For instance, when only the LSTM layer is transferred, there are still improvements over the baseline LSTM + ATT model. However, transferring both the LSTM and embedding layers yields better results, as the embedding layer plays a crucial role in capturing semantic information, especially on datasets with imbalanced label distributions such as D3 and D4 [8]. The embedding layer transfer helps in cases where the label distribution is extremely unbalanced, as it provides better semantic understanding of opinion words, which is essential for accurate sentiment classification [8].\n\nWhen considering the performance of different model settings, the table shows that the \"Without LSTM\" setting, which includes all components except the LSTM, achieves high accuracy and macro-F1 scores on all datasets. This suggests that while the LSTM layer contributes to performance, other components like embeddings and output layers also play significant roles. The \"Embeddings only\" setting performs well, particularly on D4, indicating that pre-trained embeddings can capture useful features even without the LSTM layer [4]. \n\nFurthermore, the \"Without embeddings\" and \"Without output layer\" settings also show competitive performance, highlighting the importance of each component in the overall model architecture. The \"LSTM only\" setting, while not as effective as some other configurations, still demonstrates that the LSTM layer alone can contribute to improved performance [8].\n\nWhen varying the percentage of document-level training examples, the results indicate that increasing the proportion of document-level data generally leads to stable improvements in accuracy across all datasets. However, the improvements in macro-F1 scores are more pronounced on D3 and D4 when the percentage of document-level examples increases from 0 to 0.4.

For instance, when fine-tuned using the GEM strategy, TRADE maintains high performance on the original four domains, with only a minor drop in joint accuracy from 58.98% to 53.54% in the hotel domain. In contrast, naive fine-tuning leads to a significant decline in performance, dropping joint goal accuracy to 36.08% [9].

The heatmap in image8 illustrates the cosine similarity between embeddings for different slots, revealing that some slots have highly correlated values. For example, \"destination\" and \"departure\" or \"price range\" and \"stars\" show high similarity, indicating that these slots likely share related attributes. This correlation can help the model generalize better across domains, as it can transfer knowledge about similar slots from one domain to another. However, for slots that are unique to a specific domain—such as \"parking,\" \"stars,\" and \"internet\" in the hotel domain, or \"food\" in the restaurant domain—performance tends to be lower due to the lack of prior exposure during training [2].

A comprehensive evaluation of eight target languages—Spanish, French, Italian, Russian, Ukrainian, Hebrew, Arabic, and German—reveals that all tested commercial MT systems exhibit significant gender bias, often translating based on stereotypes rather than context [2]. For example, Google Translate's performance on gender translation is consistently higher for stereotypical translations compared to non-stereotypical ones, as shown in a bar chart [image1]. In Spanish, the accuracy for stereotypical translations is 67%, while it drops to 46% for non-stereotypical translations. Similar trends are observed in other languages, such as French (80% vs. 54%) and Italian (52% vs. 30%). This indicates a clear preference for gender stereotypes in translations.\n\nThe accuracy metrics further highlight these disparities. Table 2 presents the performance of commercial MT systems, with \"Acc\" indicating overall gender accuracy and \"Δ_G\" and \"Δ_S\" representing differences in performance between masculine and feminine scores and pro-stereotypical and anti-stereotypical gender role assignments, respectively [1]. For instance, Google Translate shows high accuracy in French (63.6%) and Hebrew (53.7%), but significant variations in \"Δ_G\" and \"Δ_S\" metrics, particularly in Arabic (43.7 for Δ_G and 37.8 for Δ_S). Microsoft Translator achieves its highest accuracy in German (74.1%), while Amazon Translate performs best in Spanish (59.4%) and Arabic (49.8%). SYSTRAN, on the other hand, shows higher accuracy in German (48.6%) but has notable variations in \"Δ_G\" across languages, especially in Arabic (49.4).\n\nA modified version of the WinoMT dataset, where stereotypical gender adjectives were added, demonstrates that this approach can improve performance in some languages, significantly reducing bias in Spanish, Russian, and Ukrainian [5]. The results show that adding adjectives like \"pretty\" and \"handsome\" can correct profession bias by mixing signals, although this method is impractical as a general debiasing scheme due to its reliance on oracle coreference resolution.\n\nFurthermore, the comparison of different experiments or analyses in a table [image5] highlights the variability in performance. For example, in French (Ott et al., 2018), the accuracy is 49.4, with ΔG at 2.6 and ΔS at 16.1, while in German (Edunov et al., 2018), the accuracy is 52.5, with ΔG at 7.3 and ΔS at 8.4. These values suggest that different studies or methods yield varying results, emphasizing the complexity of evaluating gender bias in MT.\n\nOverall, the findings indicate that while some systems perform better in specific languages, all tested MT systems exhibit significant gender bias, highlighting the need for continued research and development to address these issues [9].\n\n![Gender bias in translation accuracy across languages](image1)"}

Stereotype-based adjustments, such as adding stereotypical gender adjectives like \"handsome\" or \"pretty,\" can influence the translation process to reduce gender bias. For instance, in Spanish, Russian, and Ukrainian, these adjustments significantly improved performance, as shown in Table 4, where the addition of such adjectives led to higher accuracy in gender prediction [5]. This suggests that incorporating additional context through stereotypical adjectives can help mitigate some biases in translation systems.\n\nHowever, the effectiveness of these adjustments is not uniform across all languages. The bar chart in image4 illustrates that while stereotypical translations generally have higher accuracy than non-stereotypical ones, the gap varies by language. For example, in Spanish, the accuracy for stereotypical translations was 67%, compared to 46% for non-stereotypical translations, indicating a substantial difference [4]. In contrast, German showed a smaller gap, with stereotypical translations at 69% and non-stereotypical at 57%. This variation highlights the complexity of gender bias in different languages and the need for language-specific solutions.\n\nThe table in image1 further supports this observation by presenting accuracy and error metrics for different translation services across various languages. It shows that while some systems perform well in certain languages, they may struggle in others. For example, Google Translate achieved high accuracy in French (63.6%) but had significant variations in Arabic (Δ_G: 43.7) [1]. These differences suggest that stereotype-based adjustments may have varying degrees of success depending on the linguistic and cultural context of the target language.\n\nMoreover, the diagram in image6 illustrates how gender bias can manifest in specific translations. In the example provided, the English sentence \"The doctor asked the nurse to help her in the procedure\" was translated to Spanish as \"El doctor le pidió a la enfermera que le ayudara con el procedimiento.\" Here, the use of \"el doctor\" (male) instead of \"la doctora\" (female) reflects a gender bias, even though the original sentence did not specify the doctor's gender [7]. This example underscores the importance of addressing gender bias in translation, as it can alter the meaning of the original text.\n\nIn summary, stereotype-based adjustments can improve gender bias accuracy in machine translation, but their effectiveness varies across languages. While some languages show significant improvements, others may require more nuanced approaches to address underlying biases. The data and examples provided highlight the need for continued research and development in this area to ensure more accurate and equitable translations.\n\n![Stereotype-based adjustments in machine translation can improve gender bias accuracy, but their effectiveness varies across languages.](image4)"}

For instance, when models are trained on adversarially selected distractors, they recover most of their original accuracy, as seen in Table 4, where the F1 score increases from 40.73 to 58.42 [1]. This suggests that adversarial training helps models generalize better and handle more challenging scenarios.\n\nIn terms of evaluation, the F1 scores vary depending on the type of data used. When evaluating on original distractors, the F1 score for single-paragraph BERT is 67.08, but it drops to 46.84 when using adversarial distractors [4]. However, when the same procedure is applied to the training set and the model is re-trained, the accuracy increases to 60.10 F1 on the adversarial distractors [4]. This indicates that re-training with adversarial distractors can mitigate the drop in performance observed during evaluation.\n\nThe role of entity type filtering also plays a crucial part in improving F1 scores. By filtering distractors based on entity type, the model's performance can be further enhanced. For example, the F1 score increases from 40.73 to 58.42 when entity type filtering is applied [10].\n\nAdditionally, the performance of models in open-domain settings is significantly affected by the retrieval of relevant paragraphs. The single-paragraph BERT model achieves a lower F1 score (39.12) when given 500 retrieved paragraphs, but this improves to 53.12 when additional gold paragraphs are provided [8]. This highlights the importance of effective retrieval mechanisms in multi-hop question answering tasks.\n\nThe table in image2 provides a comprehensive comparison of F1 scores for different models under two evaluation settings: \"Distractor\" and \"Open.\" The results show variations in performance across models, with some achieving higher scores in the \"Open\" setting than others. For example, the DFGN + BERT model achieves a high F1 score of 68.49 in the \"Distractor\" setting, while the Cognitive Graph model achieves a high F1 score of 48.87 in the \"Open\" setting [2].\n\nThe categorization of comparison questions into three types—Numerical, Logical, and String—based on the nature of the operation is illustrated in image3. Each category includes specific operations and examples. For instance, Numerical questions involve operations like \"Is greater\" or \"Is smaller,\" and an example is \"Who was born first, Arthur Conan Doyle or Penelope Lively?\" [3]. Logical questions involve operations like \"And\" or \"Or,\" and an example is \"Are Hot Rod and the Memory of Our People both magazines?\" [3]. String questions involve operations like \"Is equal\" or \"Not equal,\" and an example is \"Are Cardinal Health and Kansas City Southern located in the same state?\" [3].\n\nThe diagram in image4 illustrates the process involving the BERT model for question answering. It shows how the system takes a question and a paragraph as input, processes them using BERT, and outputs predictions such as $y_{\\text{empty}}$ and \"span/yes/no.\" The process is iterative or parallel across multiple paragraphs, and the system selects the paragraph with the lowest $y_{\\text{empty}}$ score as the final answer [4].\n\nThe table in image7 displays the F1 scores for various settings related to a task, including \"Distractor,\" \"Open-domain 10 Paragraphs,\" \"Open-domain 500 Paragraphs,\" and \"Open-domain 500 Paragraphs + Gold Paragraph.\" The results show that the F1 score is highest for the \"Distractor\" setting (67.08) and improves significantly when a \"Gold Paragraph\" is added to the \"Open-domain 500 Paragraphs\" setting (from 39.12 to 53.12) [7].\n\nThe table in image8 compares the performance metrics for different combinations of evaluation and training data. The results show that models trained on adversarial data perform better when evaluated on adversarial data, with F1 scores increasing from 46.84 to 60.10 [8].\n\n![The table in image2 shows F1 scores for different models under two evaluation settings: \"Distractor\" and \"Open.\"](image2)\n\nIn summary, different training and evaluation strategies have a significant impact on F1 scores in multi-hop and single-hop question answering tasks.

The results highlight the importance of considering the type of data and evaluation settings when designing and evaluating question answering systems."}

This indicates that the adversarial dataset successfully removed the statistical cues, leading to a more robust evaluation of argument comprehension.\n\n![The table presents test performance metrics (Mean, Median, and Max) for different models and configurations.](image1)\n\nThe results from the adversarial dataset show that BERT's performance is not indicative of true understanding of argument comprehension but rather of its ability to exploit statistical patterns in the data. The original ARCT dataset had a training set created in the same way as the adversarial dataset, but the problem of spurious cues was not fully addressed until the adversarial transformation was applied [4]. This suggests that the adversarial dataset provides a more accurate measure of model performance and should be adopted as the standard in future work on ARCT [3].\n\n![The table compares the performance of different models and humans on a development (Dev) and test set.](image2)\n\nFurthermore, the adversarial dataset was constructed by negating the claim and inverting the label for each data point, which mirrored the distributions of cues around both labels, effectively eliminating the signal [8]. This approach ensures that models cannot rely on the same statistical cues, leading to random performance. The conclusion drawn from these results is that BERT has learned nothing about argument comprehension, as its performance dropped to essentially random levels on the adversarial dataset [10].\n\n![The table presents a comparison of the performance metrics for different BERT models, namely \"BERT\", \"BERT (W)\", \"BERT (R, W)\", and \"BERT (C, W)\", based on their test performance.](image3)\n\nIn summary, the adversarial data setup reveals that BERT's high performance on the original ARCT dataset was due to exploiting spurious statistical cues, and when these cues are removed, BERT's performance drops to chance level. This highlights the importance of using robust datasets to evaluate model performance accurately."}

For instance, greedy decoding achieved an average score of 77.53 on the ATOMIC dataset, while human validation of gold ATOMIC reached a much higher average of 86.18. Other decoding strategies, such as beam search with varying beam sizes and top-k sampling, resulted in lower average scores, indicating that while these methods can generate diverse outputs, they may not consistently match the quality of human evaluations. This suggests that greedy decoding is effective for generating high-quality inferences, but human validation remains superior in terms of accuracy and plausibility.\n\n![Human validation of gold ATOMIC serves as the positive control with high scores across all relations, averaging 86.18](image5)\n\nVariations in training data percentages also significantly affect the model's metrics. When using only 1% of the training data, the model's performance drops considerably, with lower perplexity (23.81) and BLEU-2 scores (5.08), as well as reduced novelty metrics (N/T °: 7.24, N/U °: 49.36). However, increasing the training data to 10% improves the model's performance, with a perplexity of 13.74, BLEU-2 score of 12.72, and novelty metrics of 9.54 (N/T °) and 58.34 (N/U °).

According to the table in image5, COMET demonstrates superior performance across multiple metrics, including perplexity (PPL), score, and human comparison. For instance, COMET achieves a perplexity of 4.32, which is significantly lower than other models like LSTM - $s$ (18.70) and CKBG (9.80). This low perplexity indicates that the model is more confident in its predictions, suggesting higher accuracy. Additionally, COMET scores 95.25 on the evaluation metric, which is much higher than the scores of other models, such as LSTM - $s$ (64.00) and CKBG (85.00). This high score suggests that the generated tuples are highly accurate and align well with the expected outcomes.\n\nIn terms of novelty, the table in image2 provides data on the percentage of novel tuples generated by different training scenarios. The \"N/U °\" column shows that the full training scenario (FULL train) has the highest novelty rate at 50.05%, indicating that the model generates a significant number of new tuples not present in the training set. This is further supported by the \"N/T °\" column, where the FULL train scenario also has the highest score at 9.51, suggesting that the model can generate novel tuples that are relevant and meaningful. These results imply that the COMET model is not only accurate but also capable of generating new knowledge, which is crucial for expanding and enriching knowledge graphs.\n\n![COMET's ability to generate novel and accurate tuples](image5)\n\nThe effectiveness of the COMET model is further underscored by its performance in the ATOMIC dataset, as shown in image7. The table compares different decoding methods used in the COMET framework, with greedy decoding achieving the highest average score of 77.53, which is close to the human validation score of 86.18. This indicates that the model can generate high-quality commonsense inferences that are nearly as good as those produced by humans. Moreover, the COMET model's ability to generate novel tuples, as evidenced by the 59.25% of tuples not present in the training set, demonstrates its capacity to extend the size of the knowledge graph by creating new nodes and edges.\n\n![COMET's performance in generating high-quality inferences](image7)\n\nIn conclusion, the COMET model outperforms other models in terms of accuracy and novelty on the ConceptNet dataset, indicating its effectiveness in generating high-quality and novel knowledge."}

Closed vocabulary models, such as word-only models, generally exhibit lower sensitivity compared to open vocabulary models like char-only, word+char, or word-piece models. This is because closed vocabulary models treat all out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words similarly, reducing the number of unique outputs they generate. In contrast, open vocabulary models consider each unique combination of characters differently, leading to higher sensitivity.\n\nFor example, in the case of closed vocabulary models, the Pass-Through, Background, and Neutral variants show similar WER and sensitivity values across different attack types. The Pass-Through variant has a WER of 17.6 for Swap attacks, while the Background variant has a slightly higher WER of 19.5. The Neutral variant maintains a consistent WER of 17.5 for Swap attacks, indicating that it is less sensitive to changes in the input. This suggests that the Neutral backoff strategy is more robust in handling rare and unseen words, as it maps UNK predictions to a fixed neutral word, thereby reducing the number of unique outputs.\n\nOn the other hand, open vocabulary models, such as char-only, word+char, and word-piece models, demonstrate higher sensitivity due to their ability to distinguish between different character combinations. For instance, the Pass-Through variant of open vocabulary models has a much higher WER of 39.6 for Swap attacks, compared to the Background variant, which has a WER of 20.7. The Neutral variant of open vocabulary models also shows a relatively low WER of 17.5 for Swap attacks, indicating that it is effective in handling rare and unseen words. However, the sensitivity of these models remains high, as they generate a large number of unique outputs, making them more vulnerable to adversarial attacks.\n\n![The image illustrates a diagram representing a hybrid model combining two components: a \"Background Model\" and a \"Foreground Model\".](image1)\n\nIn addition to sensitivity and WER, the robustness of models is influenced by the balance between these two factors. While lower WER is desirable, it does not always translate to higher robustness. Models with low sensitivity and WER are generally more robust, as they provide fewer opportunities for attackers to manipulate the input. For example, the Neutral backoff strategy has been shown to have the lowest sensitivity, making it the most robust against various types of attacks. This is evident from the results presented in Table 4, where the Neutral backoff model achieves higher accuracy under different attack scenarios.\n\n![The table presents the performance (likely accuracy or another metric) of different models under various types of text perturbations or attacks.](image2)\n\nFurthermore, the trade-off between WER and sensitivity is visually represented in Figure 2, where scatter plots depict the relationship between these two metrics for word-only and char-only models. The bubble sizes in the plots indicate the level of robustness, with larger bubbles representing more robust models. For word-only models, the Neutral variant has a WER of 11 and a sensitivity of approximately 12, with a robustness value of 63.2. In contrast, the Pass-through variant has a WER of 11 and a sensitivity of approximately 12, with a robustness value of 63.2, while the Background variant has a WER of 10.5 and a sensitivity of approximately 12.7, with a robustness value of 59.6. These results highlight the importance of balancing WER and sensitivity to achieve optimal robustness.\n\n![The image consists of two scatter plots, each representing the relationship between sensitivity and word error rate (WER) for two types of models: word-only models (left plot) and char-only models (right plot).](image3)\n\nIn conclusion, the sensitivity and WER differ between closed and open vocabulary models under different backoff strategies. Closed vocabulary models tend to have lower sensitivity and similar WER values across different backoff strategies, while open vocabulary models exhibit higher sensitivity and varying WER values. The Neutral backoff strategy is generally more robust, as it reduces the number of unique outputs generated by the model, making it less susceptible to adversarial attacks. However, achieving a balance between WER and sensitivity is crucial for ensuring the overall robustness of the model."}

To answer this, we can analyze the provided text and image quotes to understand how models like Seq2Seq, Memory Network, and RetNRef variants perform in terms of these aspects.\n\nIn terms of **word statistics**, the RetNRef ++ model performs better than other models by generating longer sentences with more nuanced entity information and using rare words more effectively. According to the data in Table 4, the RetNRef ++ model has a higher use of rare words (with frequency less than 100) compared to other models, which is an important indicator of engaging and human-like dialogue [8]. Additionally, the table in image4 shows that the RetNRef ++ model has the highest word count and character count among all models, indicating that it produces more complex and detailed responses, closer to human utterances [4].\n\nWhen it comes to **performance metrics**, the RetNRef ++ model outperforms other models in several areas. For example, in terms of **engagingness**, the RetNRef ++ model scores 3.80, which is significantly higher than Seq2Seq (2.70), Memory Network (3.66), and even RetNRef+ (3.50) [3]. In terms of **fluency** and **consistency**, the RetNRef ++ model also performs well, with scores of 3.74 and 3.80, respectively. However, it still lags slightly behind the Memory Network in **persona** usage, which scored 0.73 compared to RetNRef ++'s 0.65 [3]. This suggests that while the RetNRef ++ model excels in producing engaging and fluent dialogue, it could improve in aligning with the persona of the speaker.\n\nAnother important metric is **perplexity**, which measures how well a model predicts the next word in a sequence. The results in image5 show that the \"True label\" method has the lowest perplexity score (9.2), followed by the \"True label’s neighbor\" (25.9) and the \"Memory Network\" (31.8). However, the RetNRef ++ model does not directly report perplexity, and the authors note that poor perplexity does not necessarily mean poor human judgments of the generated sequences [7]. This highlights the limitations of automated metrics in evaluating conversational models.\n\nIn terms of **human-like conversational abilities**, the RetNRef ++ model is shown to produce responses that are more similar to human utterances in terms of word statistics and engagement. According to the text, the RetNRef ++ model has \"similar statistics to human utterances\" and provides more engaging conversations according to human judgments [1]. Furthermore, the table in image3 indicates that the RetNRef ++ model has the highest engagingness score (3.80) among all models, suggesting that it is more effective at maintaining a natural and engaging conversation.\n\nFinally, the table in image2 provides additional insight into the performance of the different models. It shows that the RetNRef ++ model has the highest percentage of performance in the >80% category (53%), indicating that it consistently performs well across various criteria [2]. In contrast, the Seq2Seq model has the highest percentage of performance in the <30% category (56%), suggesting that it struggles to produce high-quality responses in many cases.\n\nIn summary, the RetNRef ++ model outperforms other models in terms of word statistics, engagingness, fluency, and consistency, and produces responses that are closer to human utterances. However, it still has room for improvement in terms of persona alignment and may benefit from further refinement in certain areas. ![RetNRef++ model's performance in comparison to other models](image2)"}

According to the provided information, Novo Nordisk uses forward exchange contracts and currency options to hedge forecast transactions, assets, and liabilities, aiming to reduce the short-term negative impact of exchange rate fluctuations on earnings and cash flow [5]. The company also applies hedge accounting to match the impact of the hedged item and the hedging instrument in the consolidated income statement [1].\n\nThe table in image6 provides specific data on the hypothetical impact of a 5% increase or decrease in certain currencies on Novo Nordisk’s operating profit. For 2020, a 5% increase in these currencies would result in a negative impact of 1,893 million DKK on \"Other comprehensive income\" and a positive impact of 299 million DKK on the \"Income statement,\" leading to a total effect of (1,594) million DKK. Conversely, a 5% decrease would lead to a positive impact of 1,893 million DKK on \"Other comprehensive income\" and a negative impact of 299 million DKK on the \"Income statement,\" resulting in a total effect of 1,594 million DKK [6].\n\nThis data highlights how significant exchange rate fluctuations can affect Novo Nordisk's comprehensive income and cash flow hedges. The company's strategy of hedging future expected cash flows up to 24 months forward and using financial instruments to reduce the impact of foreign exchange on financial results is crucial in managing these risks [1]. Additionally, the table in image7 shows the transfer of cash flow hedge reserves to intangible assets, indicating that deferred gains and losses on cash flow hedges are eventually transferred to financial income or expenses [7].\n\n![The table outlines different types of financial risks and their levels: Foreign exchange risk is high, while credit, interest rate, and liquidity risks are low.](image1)\n\n![The table displays data on derivative financial instruments for the years 2020 and 2019, including contract amounts, positive fair values, and negative fair values at year-end for various forward contracts.](image2)\n\n![The table provides exchange rate information for various currencies measured in Danish Kroner (DKK) per 100 units of foreign currency, showing how each currency's exchange rate against the Danish Kroner fluctuated over the years.](image3)\n\n![The table presents a financial comparison for the years 2021 and 2020 across different currencies, showing estimated amounts for each year for various currencies.](image4)\n\n![The table shows financial data in DKK million for the years 2020 and 2019, breaking down the amounts in terms of \"Cash at bank\" and \"Derivative financial instruments.\"](image5)\n\n![The table provides financial data in DKK million for the years 2020 and 2019, showing the impact of a hypothetical immediate 5% increase and decrease on \"Other comprehensive income\" and \"Income statement.\"](image6)\n\n![The table displays financial data in DKK million, showing different categories over several years, including exchange rate adjustments, cash flow hedges, tax and other items, and total.](image7)\n\n![The table provides a comparison of the number of months between 2019 and 2020 for different currencies, indicating the number of months each currency is presumably relevant for.](image8)\n\nIn conclusion, the changes in exchange rates and financial risks significantly impacted Novo Nordisk's comprehensive income and cash flow hedges in 2020, as evidenced by the hypothetical scenarios presented in the data."}

In 2021, the total bonuses for the Corporate Executive Committee were CHF 10,491,950, which is an increase from CHF 10,041,950 in 2020 [7]. This indicates a general rise in bonus amounts for the committee members in 2021 compared to 2020.\n\nLooking at the image data, the table in image3 provides specific bonus figures for each member of the Corporate Executive Committee for 2021 and 2020. For instance, B. Anderson received a bonus of CHF 2,600,000 in 2021, up from CHF 2,400,000 in 2020. Similarly, A. Hippe’s bonus increased from CHF 2,000,000 in 2020 to CHF 2,300,000 in 2021. T.

These increases suggest a general upward trend in compensation for the members of the Corporate Executive Committee.\n\nThe data also shows that the proportion of Restricted Stock Units (RSUs) and S-SARs in the Long-Term Incentive (LTI) for the Corporate Executive Committee has been consistent since 2019, with RSUs making up 20% of the total LTI and S-SARs accounting for 80% [10]. This structure likely influences the base pay and bonuses, as it determines how much of the compensation is tied to stock options versus cash payments.\n\n![The table presents financial data for several individuals, detailing pension funds/insurances, annual expense allowances, Roche Connect payments, and payments for tax or tax consulting services for the years 2021 and 2020.](image1)\n\n![The table lists the bonuses for members of the Corporate Executive Committee for the years 2020 and 2021, subject to approval at the Annual General Meeting in 2022.](image3)\n\n![The table contains financial figures for four individuals (B.

For example, Equity AUM rose from $111 billion in 2018 to $174 billion in 2020, while Fixed Income AUM grew from $71 billion to $86 billion during the same period.

While the higher AUM could have contributed to increased revenues, the lower fee rates might have partially offset this growth. The firm's asset management revenues in 2020 were reported to be $3,013 million, representing a 15% increase compared to the prior year, primarily due to higher average AUM driven by strong investment performance and positive net flows [2].

In 2019, the company repurchased $7.6 billion of common stock, and in 2018, it repurchased $17.9 billion of common stock, which included a $10.0 billion tender offer [1]. The board of directors also increased the amount authorized under the stock repurchase program multiple times, including increases of $5.0 billion in May 2019 and $4.0 billion in December 2019 [1]. As of December 31, 2020, $3.0 billion remained available under the stock repurchase program [7].\n\nFinancial performance metrics also evolved during this period. The company's total revenues increased from $22,991 million in 2016 to $25,424 million in 2020 [image1]. Product sales specifically saw an increase from $21,892 million in 2016 to $24,240 million in 2020 [image1]. However, operating expenses increased significantly, rising from $13,688 million in 2019 to $16,285 million in 2020 [image8]. This led to a decrease in operating income from $9,674 million in 2019 to $9,139 million in 2020. Net income also decreased from $7,842 million in 2019 to $7,264 million in 2020 [image8].\n\nThe company's stock performance, as indicated by the cumulative total return of a $100 investment, showed mixed results. While the S&P 500 (SPX) showed a strong upward trend, ending above $200 in 2020, Amgen (AMGN) ended just under $160 in 2020 [image5]. Additionally, the company's diluted earnings per share (EPS) decreased from $12.88 in 2019 to $12.31 in 2020 [image8].\n\n![The table presents financial data for a company over the years 2016 to 2020, showing increases in revenues and product sales but also significant increases in operating expenses and decreases in net income.](image1)"}

In 2020, capital expenditures (Capex) totaled $\\S21.4$ billion, a decrease from $\\S23$ billion in 2019, as the corporation focused on managing controllable costs and prioritizing opportunities to meet global energy demand [12]. This reduction in Capex was part of broader cost management efforts, including a decrease in Downstream capital investments to $\\S4.2$ billion and Chemical capital expenditures to $\\S2.7$ billion, both reflecting lower global project spending [10].\n\nThe financial implications of these changes were significant. The reduction in capital expenditures likely contributed to improved liquidity, as the company issued $\\S23$ billion of long-term debt in 2020 to strengthen its financial position amid lower realized prices for its products [2]. Additionally, the company's total taxes on the income statement decreased from $\\S38.5$ billion in 2019 to $\\S22.8$ billion in 2020, primarily due to lower income tax expenses and a change in the mix of results across jurisdictions with varying tax rates [9].

The company’s approach to repurchasing shares is rooted in the belief that buying back stock when it is undervalued can enhance long-term value for shareholders. This is reflected in the fact that Berkshire has no maximum limit on the number of shares it can repurchase and does not require a specific dollar amount or number of shares to be repurchased [12]. However, the company has emphasized that it will not reduce its consolidated cash, cash equivalents, and U.S. Treasury Bills holdings below $30 billion, underscoring its commitment to maintaining financial strength [11].\n\nIn 2021, Berkshire spent $27.1 billion to repurchase shares of its Class A and B common stock, demonstrating a significant commitment to this strategy [12]. The program allows for flexibility, as repurchases can occur in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions, giving Berkshire the ability to act opportunistically [4]. This flexibility was particularly important during the economic turbulence caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, which had a mixed impact on the company's operations.\n\nThe net earnings of Berkshire Hathaway varied significantly across different segments over the years 2019 to 2021. For instance, the manufacturing, service, and retailing segment showed robust growth, with net earnings increasing from $9,372 million in 2019 to $11,120 million in 2021 [4]. This growth was driven by higher demand for products, although some businesses faced challenges due to supply chain disruptions and increased input costs. In contrast, the insurance segment experienced fluctuations, with underwriting earnings declining in 2020 due to the pandemic's impact, but recovering in 2021 [9].\n\nThe railroad segment also saw improvements, with net earnings rising from $5,481 million in 2019 to $5,990 million in 2021 [4]. This growth was attributed to higher freight volumes, improved productivity, and favorable pricing, despite challenges such as higher fuel prices. Similarly, the utilities and energy segment reported steady growth, with net earnings increasing from $2,840 million in 2019 to $3,495 million in 2021 [4].\n\nHowever, the investment and derivative gains/losses segment experienced a sharp decline in 2020, with net earnings dropping from $57,445 million in 2019 to $31,591 million in 2020. This was primarily due to the volatility in financial markets during the pandemic. In 2021, the segment rebounded strongly, with net earnings reaching $62,340 million, highlighting the resilience of Berkshire's investment portfolio.\n\nThe \"Other\" segment, which includes after-tax goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charges, showed significant variability. In 2020, the segment recorded a loss of $11,318 million, largely due to impairments related to the Precision Castparts acquisition. In 2021, the segment turned around, reporting net earnings of $1,315 million, indicating a recovery in certain areas of the business.\n\nOverall, the performance of Berkshire Hathaway's stock repurchase program and its net earnings across different segments reflect a combination of strategic foresight, adaptability, and resilience. The company's ability to navigate the challenges posed by the pandemic and maintain a strong financial position is evident in both its repurchase activities and its earnings performance.\n\n![Net earnings attributable to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders across different segments from 2019 to 2021](image4)"}

These include risk-free interest rates based on U.S. Treasury yields, expected volatilities derived from the historical volatility of the Company’s common stock and implied volatility from exchange-traded options, expected dividend yields based on the per share cash dividend paid by the Company, and historical data to estimate option exercises and forfeitures.

Similarly, the International upstream segment saw a dramatic improvement, reporting earnings of $8.5 billion in 2021, compared to a loss of $825 million in 2020 [7]. These gains were driven by higher realizations, the absence of impairments and write-offs, and increased sales volumes. Additionally, the U.S. downstream segment reported earnings of $2.4 billion in 2021, compared to a loss of $571 million in 2020 [12]. This was due to higher margins on refined product sales, increased earnings from joint ventures, and higher sales volumes.\n\nThe overall net income for Chevron in 2021 was significantly higher than in 2020, as reflected in the financial highlights [3]. While the exact figures are not provided in the text quotes, the data suggests a strong recovery in profitability. Furthermore, the return on stockholders’ equity (ROE) is likely to have improved, given the substantial increase in net income and the relatively stable or reduced equity base.\n\nIn addition to these financial metrics, Chevron’s environmental spending and capital investments provide context for its long-term strategy. The company estimated its worldwide environmental spending at approximately $1.9 billion in 2021 [6], and it plans to invest $10 billion in lower-carbon capital projects between 2021 and 2028 [10].

In contrast, non-U.S. defined benefit plans had a higher allocation to fixed income securities and cash equivalents, at 73%, with equity securities comprising 27% of the assets.

In 2018, the provision for income taxes was $3,562 million, which increased to $3,742 million in 2019, and further rose to $4,973 million in 2020. This increase indicates a growing tax burden over the three-year period, likely due to changes in the company's operations, tax regulations, or other factors affecting its taxable income.\n\nLooking at the components of the provision for income taxes, the current provision for income taxes also increased over the same period. For example, the total current provision for income taxes was $3,520 million in 2018, $3,512 million in 2019, and $4,981 million in 2020. The deferred (benefit) provision also fluctuated, with a small benefit in 2020 ($8 million) compared to a positive provision in 2019 ($230 million) and 2018 ($42 million). These fluctuations suggest that the company experienced changes in its deferred tax positions, which can be influenced by timing differences between financial reporting and tax reporting.\n\nThe deferred income tax assets and liabilities play a significant role in these trends. The net deferred income tax liabilities decreased slightly from $2,993 million in 2019 to $3,367 million in 2020. This change reflects the company's evolving financial position, including adjustments to its deferred tax assets and liabilities. For instance, the deferred income tax assets increased from $2,868 million in 2019 to $3,391 million in 2020, while the deferred income tax liabilities increased from $5,861 million in 2019 to $6,758 million in 2020. These changes indicate that the company's tax obligations and potential future tax benefits have shifted over time.\n\n![The table displays financial data related to income taxes over three years (2020, 2019, and 2018), expressed in millions and percentages.](image1)\n\n![The table presents financial data related to common share repurchases for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.](image2)\n\n![This table shows the income tax provisions for the years 2020, 2019, and 2018, broken down into various components.](image3)\n\n![This table lists various financial notes and their details as of December 31, 2020, and December 31, 2019.](image4)\n\n![The table presents data on gross unrecognized tax benefits for the years 2018, 2019, and 2020.](image5)\n\n![The table lists payment information with the following columns: Payment Date, Amount per Share, and Total Amount Paid (in millions).](image6)\n\n![The table presents financial data for various years, reported in millions of dollars.](image7)\n\n![The table displays deferred income tax assets and liabilities for the years 2020 and 2019, measured in millions.](image8)\n\nIn summary, the company's provisions for income taxes increased from 2018 to 2020, and the deferred income tax assets and liabilities contributed to these trends through changes in their respective balances."}

This indicates a significant increase in both current and noncurrent liabilities over the period. The total liabilities, which include both current and noncurrent, therefore increased from $8,556 million in 2019 to $13,131 million in 2020. \n\nThis increase in liabilities is closely related to the changes in total debt during the same period. According to the data, total debt was approximately $21.2 billion as of December 31, 2020, compared to $21.7 billion as of December 31, 2019. While the total debt decreased slightly, the composition of the debt changed, with a greater portion being classified as long-term debt due to the Company's ability and intent to refinance short-term obligations using the Five-Year Facility.

This increase was primarily due to the higher level of earnings and lower net discrete tax benefits. In 2020, net discrete tax benefits were $122 million, primarily related to the conversion of employee share-based awards [3]. In contrast, in 2019, net discrete tax benefits were $475 million, which included benefits related to the resolution of multi-jurisdiction tax examinations and the conversion of employee share-based awards [8].\n\nThese changes in the effective tax rate and net discrete tax provisions are closely tied to the overall compensation expenses. The compensation expenses for 2020 were $2,119 million, which includes deferred cash-based compensation, return on referenced investments, and other components [7]. The increase in compensation expenses was influenced by factors such as higher revenues, which led to higher formulaic payouts to Wealth Management representatives, and the E*TRADE acquisition, which contributed to incremental compensation [1]. Additionally, the Firm's deferred cash-based compensation programs, which are subject to vesting, clawback, and cancellation provisions, also impacted the overall compensation expenses [6].\n\n![The table shows the effective tax rate and net discrete tax provisions for 2020, 2019, and 2018.](image5)\n\nIn summary, the effective tax rate increased from 18.3% in 2019 to 22.5% in 2020, while net discrete tax benefits decreased from $475 million in 2019 to $122 million in 2020, and these changes are related to the overall compensation expenses for the same period."}

This increase was partly offset by higher paydown rates, which were driven by the financial strength of the customer base. Additionally, the reserve for credit losses on Card Member loans decreased in 2021, primarily due to improved portfolio quality and macroeconomic outlook, although this was partially offset by an increase in outstanding loan balances [11]. The net write-off rate for Card Member loans also decreased, indicating better credit performance.\n\nIn contrast, **Card Member receivables** saw a decline in the reserve for credit losses, as the global macroeconomic outlook improved, but there was still a slight increase in outstanding balances [12]. The ending balance for Card Member receivables was $53.6 billion in 2021, down from $43.7 billion in 2020, reflecting a decrease in receivable balances. However, the net write-off rate for Card Member receivables remained low at 0.3% in 2021, showing strong credit performance.\n\nWhen comparing these changes with **network volumes and card member spending**, we see that network volumes increased by 24% in 2021 compared to 2020 [2]. This growth in network volumes aligns with the increase in Card Member spending, which rose by at least 5% to $1.09 trillion in 2021, driven by strength in Goods and Services spending globally [10]. This suggests that the growth in Card Member loans and receivables was supported by increased transaction activity and spending, despite the challenges posed by the economic environment.\n\n![Card Member loans and receivables data](image1)  \n![Network volumes and card member spending data](image2)"}

According to the data provided, net income for 2020 was $4,730.5 million, compared to $6,025.4 million in 2019. This represents a decrease of approximately 21.5%. The decline in net income can be attributed to several factors, including lower operating earnings due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as specific items such as impairment and other charges. For instance, the sale of McDonald's Japan stock contributed $274 million in pre-tax strategic gains in 2020, while 2019 included $74 million in net strategic charges. Excluding these items, operating income decreased by 23% in constant currencies, further contributing to the decline in net income [2].\n\nComprehensive income, which includes net income and other comprehensive income (loss), also saw a reduction. In 2020, comprehensive income was $4,626.4 million, compared to $6,152.2 million in 2019. This decrease is largely due to the drop in net income, as well as the negative impact of other comprehensive income. Specifically, other comprehensive income for 2020 was a loss of $104.1 million, whereas in 2019 it was a gain of $126.8 million. The loss in 2020 was primarily driven by foreign currency translation adjustments, cash flow hedges, and defined benefit pension plans, which collectively resulted in a net loss of $104.1 million. These factors, combined with the decline in net income, contributed to the overall reduction in comprehensive income from 2019 to 2020.\n\n![Net income and comprehensive income declined from 2019 to 2020, primarily due to lower operating earnings and other comprehensive losses.](image1)"}

Let’s analyze these changes and their potential relationship with the product mix.\n\nFrom 2018 to 2020, net revenue for most divisions increased, with some exceptions. For instance, FLNA (Frito-Lay North America) saw a significant increase in net revenue, driven by strong performance in its food and snack business, which is a major component of its operations. QFNA (Quaker Foods North America) also experienced growth, although at a slower pace, likely due to its focus on food products. PBNA (PepsiCo Beverages North America), on the other hand, faced challenges, particularly in 2020, as the beverage sector was heavily impacted by the pandemic. However, the division still managed to grow its net revenue, partly due to the resilience of its core brands and strategic adjustments.\n\nOperating profit also showed mixed results. FLNA and PBNA experienced increases in operating profit, reflecting cost-saving measures and improved efficiency. However, QFNA's operating profit declined slightly, indicating that the division may have faced higher costs or lower margins during this period. The operating profit for PBNA was particularly affected by the pandemic, with pre-tax charges reducing its growth by 3 percentage points. This highlights the vulnerability of the beverage sector to external shocks like the pandemic.\n\nThe distribution of beverage and food/snack categories across different regions also played a role in shaping these financial outcomes. According to the data, the beverage category had a larger share in Europe and APAC compared to food and snack. In contrast, food and snack dominated in Latin America and AMESA. This regional variation in product mix could explain the differences in revenue and profit growth across divisions. For example, the strong performance of food and snack businesses in Latin America and AMESA may have contributed to the positive revenue growth in those regions.\n\n![The table shows the percentage distribution of beverage and food/snack categories across various regions and PepsiCo for the years 2020, 2019, and 2018.](image6)\n\nIn conclusion, the changes in net revenue and operating profit across divisions from 2018 to 2020 were influenced by both internal operational strategies and external market conditions, with the distribution of beverage and food/snack categories playing a significant role in shaping these outcomes."}

This was largely due to inflows from borrowings amounting to €10 billion and an additional €850 million provided by the Siemens Group to finance the acquisition. These inflows were partially offset by cash outflows from the repayment of matured loans, including €730 million in repayments [9]. The overall positive shift in financing activities reflects the company's strategic use of debt and internal funding to support major acquisitions.\n\nIn contrast, cash flows from investing activities increased significantly, rising by €12,228 million to €14,140 million in fiscal year 2021 [6]. This increase was primarily attributed to the payout for the acquisition of Varian. Additionally, cash outflows increased by €117 million due to additions to intangible assets and property, plant, and equipment, which were driven by investments for capacity expansions.

This evolution reflects a substantial improvement in financial performance over the three-year period.\n\nThe contributing factors to this change can be analyzed through several aspects. First, the net income for 2020 was $862 million, compared to net losses of $775 million in 2019 and $1,063 million in 2018. This indicates a significant recovery in profitability. The increase in net income is likely due to higher revenues, as evidenced by the table showing total revenues of $31,536 million in 2020, compared to $24,578 million in 2019 and $21,461 million in 2018. \n\nAnother factor is the impact of foreign currency translation adjustments, which contributed positively to comprehensive income.

In 2020, this amount was $141 million, compared to $87 million in 2019 and a loss of $87 million in 2018. This indicates that the portion of the company's earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests increased, which could be due to changes in the ownership structure or the performance of subsidiaries.\n\n![Comprehensive income attributable to common stockholders increased from a loss of $1,018 million in 2018 to a gain of $1,120 million in 2020.](image3)"}

Under the Advanced approach, the CET1 capital ratio was 17.7% in 2020, compared to 16.9% in 2019. This indicates an improvement in the CET1 capital ratio for both approaches over the year. The Tier 1 capital ratio also showed similar trends, with 19.4% under the Standardized approach and 19.8% under the Advanced approach in 2020, compared to 18.6% and 19.2% respectively in 2019. The Total Capital ratio in 2020 was 21.5% under the Standardized approach and 21.8% under the Advanced approach, compared to 21.0% and 21.5% in 2019. These improvements suggest that the institution maintained strong capital positions relative to its regulatory requirements.\n\nIn terms of RWA, the total RWA under the Standardized approach increased from $394,177 million in 2019 to $453,106 million in 2020, while under the Advanced approach, it increased from $382,496 million to $445,151 million. This increase in RWA reflects higher risk exposures across both approaches. Specifically, credit risk RWA under the Standardized approach increased by $44,382 million, and under the Advanced approach, it increased by $56,003 million. Market risk RWA also saw increases, with both approaches showing a rise of approximately $14,500 million.

In 2021, the Upstream segment reported earnings of $15,818 million, compared to a loss of $(2,433) million in 2020. This substantial improvement was driven by higher crude oil prices and increased production volumes. In contrast, the Downstream segment, which involves refining crude oil into petroleum products and marketing them, saw earnings of $2,914 million in 2021, whereas it recorded a much smaller profit of $47 million in 2020. The Downstream segment's earnings are more sensitive to fluctuations in crude oil prices and refining margins, which can be volatile due to supply and demand dynamics.\n\nThe asset values for these segments also showed notable differences. For the Upstream segment, total assets were $184,412 million in 2021 and $191,309 million in 2020. These figures include properties, plants, and equipment, as well as goodwill. On the other hand, the Downstream segment had total assets of $45,224 million in 2021 and $39,586 million in 2020. The disparity in asset values reflects the capital-intensive nature of the Upstream segment, which requires significant investment in exploration and production infrastructure.\n\n![The table shows Chevron Corporation's financial performance for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019.](image6)\n\nIn summary, the major differences in the financial performance of Chevron Corporation's Upstream and Downstream segments for the years 2021 and 2020 are reflected in their earnings and asset values, with the Upstream segment showing greater profitability and larger asset values compared to the Downstream segment."}

This growth was driven by several factors, including a prior year loss on early debt extinguishment, lower taxes, and interest expense in the current year [2]. Additionally, the effective income tax rate decreased, contributing to the increase in net earnings [10]. However, foreign exchange impacts negatively affected net earnings by approximately $274 million in fiscal 2022 due to a weakening of certain currencies against the U.S. dollar [10].\n\nIn terms of stock-based expenses, the total stock-based expense for P&G was $558 million in 2020, $540 million in 2021, and $528 million in 2022. The decrease in stock-based expenses from 2020 to 2022 can be attributed to changes in the fair value of stock options and RSUs/PSUs, as well as the amortization of these awards over their respective service periods [8].

Let's break down the key findings.\n\n### Systems Performance\nIn terms of **Systems Hardware**, there was a significant decline in revenue. For instance, **IBM Z** revenue increased slightly by 1.9% as reported (1% adjusted for currency) despite an elongated z15 adoption cycle [11]. However, **Power Systems** and **Storage Systems** saw notable decreases: Power Systems revenue dropped by 22.4% (22.9% adjusted for currency), and Storage Systems declined by 6.1% (6.7% adjusted for currency) [7]. These declines were primarily due to product cycle dynamics and macroeconomic factors affecting client purchasing behavior.\n\nFor **Operating Systems Software**, revenue decreased by 11.2% as reported (no currency adjustment needed) compared to the prior year [7]. This reflects the impact of shifting client priorities and the challenges associated with the global economic environment.\n\nThe **Systems gross profit margin** increased by 2.8 points to 55.9% in 2020, driven by improvements in IBM Z and Power Systems margins, as well as a mix shift toward IBM Z hardware [8]. Despite this, **pre-tax income** for Systems declined by 36.0% to $449 million, with a pre-tax margin decrease of 2.7 points to 5.8%, largely due to higher workforce rebalancing charges [8].\n\n![The Systems gross profit margin increased by 2.8 points to 55.9% in 2020, driven by improvements in IBM Z and Power Systems margins.](image1)\n\n### Regional Performance\nLooking at **regional performance**, the **Americas** experienced a year-to-year revenue decline of 6.0% (adjusted for currency, -4.8%), while **Europe/Middle East/Africa** saw a 3.3% decline (adjusted for currency, -4.7%). The **Asia Pacific** region also faced a 3.5% decline (adjusted for currency, -4.3%) [2]. These regional declines reflect the broader impact of the global economic environment on client spending.\n\n![Total revenue for IBM in 2020 was $73,620 million, a 4.6% decrease from 2019.](image2)\n\n### Global Financing\nThe **Global Financing** segment also saw a decline in pre-tax income, decreasing by 27.8% year to year, primarily due to lower revenue and a reduction in expenses that aligned with the segment’s performance [5].\n\n![The total backlog for IBM at the end of 2020 was $110.8 billion, a 1.5% decrease from 2019.](image5)\n\n### Conclusion\nOverall, IBM experienced a decline in both **external revenue** and **pre-tax income** across most systems and regions in 2020, with the exception of slight growth in IBM Z revenue. The decline in pre-tax income was influenced by factors such as workforce rebalancing charges and reduced client spending due to macroeconomic conditions."}

According to the data provided, the total value of derivative financial instruments at fair value through the income statement was DKK 1,365 million in 2020 and DKK 734 million in 2019 [image3]. This increase suggests that the company may have engaged in more hedging activities or faced greater exposure to market volatility during 2020 compared to 2019. Additionally, the table in image6 shows that these instruments include both cash flow hedges and fair value hedges, with some values recognized in the income statement and others in other comprehensive income. This distinction is crucial because it affects how gains or losses from these instruments are reported and ultimately impacts the company's profitability and equity.\n\n![The table displays data on derivative financial instruments for the years 2020 and 2019, in DKK million.

For instance, the change in working capital including exchange rate adjustments was DKK (2,624) million in 2020, compared to DKK (3,564) million in 2019. This indicates that the company experienced a larger outflow from working capital in 2020, which could be attributed to factors such as increased inventory levels, slower receivables collection, or higher payables. The overall cash flow change in working capital was DKK (4,353) million in 2020, compared to DKK (3,388) million in 2019, further emphasizing the significant impact of working capital on the company's cash flow position.\n\n![The table provides financial data in DKK million for the years 2020, 2019, and 2018.

Derivative instruments affect the income statement through realized gains or losses and the balance sheet through their fair value measurements. Cash flow changes, particularly those related to working capital, impact the cash flow statement by reflecting the actual cash generated or used by the company's operations. Together, these elements provide a comprehensive view of the company's financial health and its ability to manage risk and liquidity.\n\nIn summary, the increase in derivative financial instruments and the significant changes in cash flow from working capital in 2020 compared to 2019 indicate that the company faced greater financial complexity and risk management challenges during this period. These factors directly affect the company's financial statements by influencing its profitability, equity, and cash flow position."}

In fiscal 2020, the company reported a comprehensive income of $5,472,296, which was an increase compared to fiscal 2019's $4,575,086 and fiscal 2018's $3,730,974. This growth in comprehensive income indicates improved overall financial performance, driven by net income and other comprehensive income.\n\nThe other comprehensive income (OCI) for fiscal 2020 was $278,740, which includes contributions from foreign currency translation, defined benefit plans, cash flow hedges, and investments. Specifically, foreign currency translation contributed positively in 2020 with $197,696, while defined benefit plans contributed $57,100, and cash flow hedges added $24,721. However, investments resulted in a minor loss of $777. These OCI components collectively increased the total comprehensive income for the year.\n\nIn contrast, fiscal 2019 saw a negative other comprehensive income of $(264,406), primarily due to losses in foreign currency translation and defined benefit plans. The negative contribution from these components reduced the overall comprehensive income for that year. Similarly, in fiscal 2018, the other comprehensive income was $(481,387), with significant losses in foreign currency translation and cash flow hedges.\n\nThese trends in comprehensive income and other comprehensive income directly influence changes in shareholders' equity. For instance, the positive OCI in 2020 contributed to an increase in total shareholders' equity, as it added to the accumulated other comprehensive income. Conversely, the negative OCI in 2019 and 2018 led to decreases in this component of equity. Additionally, net income, which is a major component of comprehensive income, also impacts retained earnings, another key element of shareholders' equity.\n\n![Comprehensive income and other comprehensive income components for Accenture over the years 2018 to 2020](image5)\n\nThe changes in shareholders' equity are further influenced by other factors such as share-based compensation, dividends, and share transactions. For example, share-based compensation expenses increased restricted share units and additional paid-in capital, contributing to the growth in equity. Dividends, on the other hand, reduced retained earnings and thus impacted the overall equity.\n\nIn summary, the trends in Accenture's comprehensive income and other comprehensive income components from 2018 to 2020 reflect the company's financial performance and the impact of various factors on its equity. These trends are closely related to changes in shareholders' equity, as they contribute to the accumulation of other comprehensive income and affect retained earnings through net income and other adjustments."}

Non-executive directors did not receive any remuneration from the company except for a sitting fee of Rs.5000 for each meeting of the Board and the Board Committee attended by them. This suggests that the remuneration structure for non-executive directors was minimal, while the executive directors received compensation based on decisions made by the Board.\n\nIn addition, quote [11] confirms that the directors had taken proper and sufficient care for the maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act, 1956, for safeguarding the assets of the Company and for preventing and detecting fraud and other irregularities.

According to the data, total liabilities increased from $422.393 billion in 2020 to $443.854 billion in 2021, reflecting a rise of approximately $21.461 billion. This increase can be attributed to several factors, including higher insurance liabilities, borrowings, and other financial obligations. Meanwhile, shareholders’ equity grew from $506.2 billion at the end of 2020 to $506.2 billion at the end of 2021, indicating a slight increase of $63 billion. This growth in equity is largely driven by net earnings and comprehensive income, which include both realized and unrealized gains on investments.\n\nThe company's net earnings for 2021 were $90.807 billion, significantly higher than the $43.253 billion recorded in 2020. This increase in net earnings contributed positively to shareholders’ equity. Additionally, comprehensive income, which includes net earnings plus other comprehensive income (such as unrealized gains and losses on investments), was $91.041 billion in 2021 compared to $44.272 billion in 2020. The rise in comprehensive income further supports the increase in shareholders’ equity.\n\nThe relationship between these figures highlights the strong financial performance of Berkshire Hathaway, particularly in terms of investment gains and operational efficiency.

One key aspect of this strategy is the focus on shareholder returns, which includes both dividends and share repurchases. For instance, the table shows that Toyota has consistently maintained a payout ratio around 30%, aiming to ensure stable and continuous dividend payments [1]. In 2021, the payout ratio was 29.8%, indicating a commitment to balancing reinvestment with shareholder returns.\n\n![The table presents financial data for five fiscal years, specifically ending in March of each year from 2017 to 2021, including dividend per share, total amount of payment, payout ratio, share repurchases, total shareholder return, and total return ratio.](image1)\n\nIn addition to shareholder returns, Toyota is actively investing in electrification measures to address climate change.

Depreciation refers to the systematic allocation of the cost of a tangible asset over its useful life, while impairment losses occur when the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, indicating that the asset may not be worth what it was originally recorded for.\n\nFrom the data in the text quotes, we see that depreciation commences when an asset is available for use and is reviewed at the end of each reporting period [4]. Additionally, impairment losses are recognized when the carrying amount of an asset is higher than its estimated recoverable amount [4]. The impact of these changes on the net carrying amounts of intangible assets and property, plant, and equipment is significant, as they directly affect the value of these assets on the balance sheet.\n\nLooking at the image quotes, particularly image4, which provides detailed financial data for the years 2020, 2019, and 2018, we can observe the following trends:\n\n- **Cost of goods sold:** Increased from 916 DKK million in 2019 to 369 DKK million in 2020.\n- **Sales and distribution costs:** Increased from 24 DKK million in 2019 to 40 DKK million in 2020.\n- **Research and development costs:** Increased from 522 DKK million in 2019 to 1,025 DKK million in 2020.\n- **Administrative costs:** Increased from 3 DKK million in 2019 to 10 DKK million in 2020.\n- **Other operating income, net:** Decreased from 4 DKK million in 2019 to 2 DKK million in 2020.\n\nIn terms of depreciation and impairment losses, the total amortisation and impairment loss increased from 1,469 DKK million in 2019 to 1,446 DKK million in 2020. This indicates that the company experienced a slight decrease in these losses from 2019 to 2020. However, the total amortisation increased significantly from 487 DKK million in 2019 to 1,096 DKK million in 2020, suggesting that the company is depreciating its assets more heavily in 2020 compared to 2019.\n\nFurthermore, the total impairment losses decreased from 982 DKK million in 2019 to 350 DKK million in 2020, indicating that the company recognized fewer impairment losses in 2020 compared to 2019. This could suggest that the company's assets were performing better in 2020 or that there were fewer indications of impairment.\n\nThe impact of these changes on the net carrying amounts of intangible assets and property, plant, and equipment can be seen in image5, which presents the financial details of these assets for the years 2019 and 2020. The table shows the changes in these categories, highlighting how each has progressed from the beginning to the end of the two respective years.

From 22Q1 to 22Q4, the revenue increased steadily, reaching 1,512 RMB million in 22Q4. Although there was a slight decline in 23Q1 to 1,272 RMB million, the overall trend remains positive, with a year-over-year increase of 22% [2][5][10].\n\n![Global Distribution](image1)  \n![Financial Growth](image2)"}

This represents an increase of approximately $3,816 million, or 28.7%. The growth in total revenue can be attributed to various factors, including the acquisition of Tableau in August 2019, which likely contributed to the expansion of the company's product offerings and market presence [10]. Additionally, the company's focus on subscription and support revenue, which is recognized ratably over the contract term, may have played a role in the revenue growth [5].\n\nRegarding unearned revenue, the unearned revenue at the beginning of fiscal year 2020 was $8,564 million, compared to $6,995 million at the beginning of fiscal year 2019. This indicates an increase of approximately $1,569 million, or 22.4%. The increase in unearned revenue could be due to higher billings and other inflows during the year, as well as contributions from contract assets acquired through the Tableau acquisition [5]. The unearned revenue balance is influenced by several factors, including seasonality, the compounding effects of renewals, invoice duration, invoice timing, dollar size, and new business linearity within the quarter [11].\n\nThe implications of these changes are significant. The increase in total revenue suggests that the company is effectively expanding its customer base and increasing its market share. The growth in unearned revenue indicates that the company is securing more long-term contracts, which can provide a stable revenue stream in future periods. However, the unearned revenue balance also represents potential risks, such as bankruptcies, regulatory changes, and other market factors, which could affect the recognition of revenue in the future [1].\n\n![Total revenue and unearned revenue increased from fiscal year 2019 to 2020.](image3)"}

According to the data, total deferred tax assets decreased from $4,564 billion in 2021 to $4,091 billion in 2022. This decline was primarily driven by reductions in several key categories. For instance, the \"Pension and other retiree benefits\" category saw a significant drop from $1,476 billion in 2021 to $740 billion in 2022. Similarly, \"Loss and other carryforwards\" fell from $1,030 billion to $914 billion, and \"Capitalized research & development\" declined from $358 billion to $646 billion. These changes reflect adjustments in the company's financial planning and tax strategies.\n\nOn the liability side, the total deferred tax liabilities increased from $8,503 billion in 2021 to $9,288 billion in 2022. The primary contributors to this increase were \"Goodwill and intangible assets,\" which rose from $5,761 billion to $5,783 billion, and \"Fixed assets,\" which increased from $1,512 billion to $1,542 billion. Additionally, \"Other retiree benefits\" saw an increase from $645 billion to $1,031 billion, and \"Unrealized gain on financial and foreign exchange transactions\" grew from $111 billion to $439 billion.

The net change in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash for 2020 was $5,361 million, whereas in 2019 it was $(3,290) million [3]. This indicates a substantial improvement in cash flow from 2019 to 2020.\n\nOne of the key factors contributing to this improvement was the increase in net cash provided by operating activities, which rose by $3.4 billion in 2020. This increase was primarily driven by an increase in cash provided by receivables, which contributed $4.8 billion, partially offset by performance-related declines within net income [8]. Additionally, the net cash used in investing activities decreased by $23.9 billion compared to the prior year, primarily due to a decrease in net cash used for acquisitions, which was attributed to the acquisition of Red Hat in the prior year [7].\n\nFinancing activities were a net use of cash of $9,721 million in 2020 compared to a net source of cash of $9,042 million in 2019. The year-to-year change of $18,763 million was driven by a decrease in net cash provided by debt transactions, which was primarily due to a higher level of net additions in the prior year to fund the Red Hat acquisition [6]. However, there was also a decrease in cash used for gross common share repurchases, which helped to offset some of the cash outflows.\n\nThe financial adjustments also played a role in the net change in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash. For example, the provision for expected credit losses increased by $34 million in 2020 compared to a release of $7 million in 2019, which could have impacted the overall cash position [10]. Additionally, the table in image2 shows that there were various adjustments made during the year, including additions, write-offs, and other changes, which could have affected the ending balance of the financial metric being tracked [2].\n\nOverall, the combination of improved cash flow from operations, reduced cash outflows from investing activities, and the impact of financial adjustments contributed to a positive net change in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash in 2020 compared to 2019.\n\n![The table presents financial data with the following columns: January 1, 2020: $612, Additions/(Releases): $108, Write-offs: $(85), Other: $10, December 31, 2020: $644.

The U.S. market showed positive sales performance, but this was more than offset by support provided for marketing through incentives to franchisees to accelerate recovery and drive growth.\n\nThe data in image6 further supports this, showing that total revenues for geographical regions decreased by 6% in 2020 compared to 2019, with specific declines in the International Operated Markets and International Developmental Licensed Markets & Corporate segments. The U.S. saw a slight increase in revenue, but this was not enough to counterbalance the overall decline.\n\nIn addition to revenue changes, restaurant margins also experienced a notable decline. Total restaurant margins decreased by 13% in 2020, as stated in quote [8], which explains that \"total restaurant margins decreased 13\\% ( 13\\% in constant currencies), which reflected sales declines in the International Operated Markets segment as a result of COVID-19, partly offset by positive sales performance in the U.S.\" This decline is further illustrated in image5, where franchised margins dropped from $9,455 million in 2019 to $8,519 million in 2020, and company-operated margins fell from $1,660 million to $1,158 million over the same period.\n\nThe factors contributing to these changes were largely related to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on global operations. Quote [10] mentions that \"Company-operated margins in the U.S. and International Operated Markets segments reflected incremental COVID-19 expenses incurred for employee-related costs, personal protective equipment, and signage and other restaurant costs.\" Additionally, quote [11] highlights that \"Franchised margins in the U.S. reflected higher depreciation costs related to investments in Experience of the Future ('EOTF'), as well as support provided for marketing to accelerate recovery and drive growth, including the free Thank You Meals served across the country to first responders and health care workers.\"\n\nThese additional costs and investments, combined with the operational disruptions caused by the pandemic, significantly impacted both total revenues and restaurant margins in 2020.\n\n![Total revenues and restaurant margins declined in 2020 due to the impact of the pandemic and increased operational costs.](image5)"}

However, the Corporate, Other, and Eliminations segment resulted in a decrease of $255 million. These changes collectively led to an increase in consolidated revenue from $103,564 million in 2020 to $116,385 million in 2021 [7].\n\nIn terms of operating expenses, the changes were influenced by various factors across the segments. For instance, the Cable Communications segment experienced an increase in expenses due to higher programming expenses, technical and product support costs, franchise and other regulatory fees, and advertising, marketing, and promotion expenses, partially offset by a decrease in other expenses and customer service expenses [7]. The NBCUniversal segment saw an increase in expenses due to increases in its Media, Studios, and Theme Parks segments [7]. The Sky segment's expenses increased primarily due to higher direct network costs and other expenses, partially offset by decreases in programming and production costs, as well as the impacts of foreign currency translation [7]. The Corporate and Other segment's expenses decreased primarily due to severance charges related to businesses in the prior year period [7].\n\nComparing these changes across different business segments, it is evident that the NBCUniversal segment had the most significant positive impact on the increase in consolidated revenue, followed by the Cable Communications and Sky segments. The Corporate, Other, and Eliminations segment, however, had a negative impact on the overall revenue increase.

Specifically, total stock-based expenses were $558 million in 2020, $540 million in 2021, and $528 million in 2022 [5]. This decline suggests that P&G may have been managing its equity compensation costs more efficiently or adjusting its award structures to align with financial goals.\n\nIn terms of net earnings per share, both basic and diluted earnings per share increased from 2020 to 2022. Basic net earnings per share rose from $5.13 in 2020 to $6.00 in 2022, while diluted net earnings per share increased from $4.96 in 2020 to $5.81 in 2022 [7]. This growth indicates that P&G was able to generate higher earnings relative to its share count, which is a positive sign for shareholder value creation. The increase in diluted earnings per share also reflects the company's ability to manage the dilutive effects of stock options and other equity awards, as noted in the financial disclosures [10].\n\nThe interplay between stock-based compensation expenses and net earnings per share highlights P&G’s focus on maintaining profitability while rewarding employees through equity incentives.

Comprehensive income includes both net income and other comprehensive income (OCI), which reflects changes in equity that are not part of net income, such as foreign currency translation adjustments, unrealized gains or losses on investments, and pension-related items.\n\nFrom 2019 to 2021, the company's comprehensive income was influenced by several factors related to shareholders' equity. For instance, the **accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)**, which is a component of shareholders' equity, showed fluctuations over these years. In 2021, the accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) totaled $(2,945) million, compared to $(2,895) million in 2020. This change reflects the impact of various OCI components, including foreign currency translation adjustments, net unrealized debt securities gains, and net unrealized pension and other postretirement benefits. Specifically, foreign currency translation adjustments contributed significantly to the decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), with a negative impact of $(2,392) million in 2021, compared to $(2,229) million in 2020. These adjustments directly affect the comprehensive income, as they are added to or subtracted from net income to arrive at the total comprehensive income.\n\nIn addition, the **retained earnings** portion of shareholders' equity also played a role in shaping comprehensive income. Retained earnings increased from $11,881 million in 2020 to $11,495 million in 2021, reflecting the net income generated during the year and the dividends paid out. The net income for 2021 was $8,060 million, which contributed positively to retained earnings, but this was partially offset by dividends and other distributions. The relationship between retained earnings and comprehensive income is direct, as retained earnings are a key component of shareholders' equity and influence the overall financial position of the company.\n\nFurthermore, the **other comprehensive (loss) income** for 2021 was $(50) million, compared to $(158) million in 2020 and $(140) million in 2019. This indicates that the company experienced a smaller loss from OCI in 2021 compared to the previous two years. The components of other comprehensive (loss) income include net unrealized debt securities gains (losses), foreign currency translation adjustments, and net unrealized pension and other postretirement benefits. In 2021, net unrealized debt securities gains were $(42) million, while foreign currency translation adjustments were $(163) million, and net unrealized pension and other postretirement benefits were 155 million. These figures highlight the volatility in OCI and its effect on comprehensive income.\n\nOverall, the changes in shareholders' equity, particularly in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and retained earnings, had a direct impact on the company's comprehensive income from 2019 to 2021. The fluctuations in OCI, driven by factors such as foreign currency translation adjustments and pension-related items, contributed to the variations in comprehensive income over this period. Additionally, the changes in retained earnings, influenced by net income and dividends, further shaped the company's financial performance and equity structure.\n\n![Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) decreased from $(2,895) million in 2020 to $(2,945) million in 2021.](image4)"}

This includes regular reviews of any situations of actual or potential conflict that have previously been authorised by the Board and making recommendations on whether the authorisation remains appropriate.\n\n![The table outlines activities and purposes related to \"Briefings and development sessions\" and \"Site visits\" during FY2021.](image5)\n\nBHP's governance framework also includes a rigorous approach to succession planning and the appointment of new Board members, ensuring a diverse pipeline of talent and maintaining a balance between experience and new perspectives [6]. The Nomination and Governance Committee outlines role descriptions for new appointments, incorporating criteria and attributes specified in the Board Governance Document [6]. The process involves selecting an external search firm, conducting interviews, and performing background checks to ensure that new directors meet the required standards of independence and expertise [6]. This comprehensive approach to director training and development ensures that the Board is equipped to address climate change risks effectively.\n\n![The table outlines an eight-step process for BHP's Board succession planning and appointment of new Board members.](image6)\n\nIn conclusion, BHP's governance framework addresses climate change risks through continuous oversight by the Board and its committees, with a focus on financial disclosures and strategic considerations.

According to the financial data provided, the operating income for 2020 was $556 million, compared to $546 million in 2019. This represents a slight increase of $10 million. The increase in operating income can be attributed to various factors, including changes in revenue streams and cost management. For instance, transportation services revenue decreased due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, lower rates on committed contracts, and planned turnaround activities. However, these decreases were partially offset by new volumes brought online at NaKika and Odyssey, as well as regulatory approval for increased tariffs on Delta.\n\nIn terms of cash from investing activities, the company generated $64 million in 2020, compared to using $87 million in 2019. This change indicates a positive shift in cash flow from investing activities. The decrease in capital expenditures from $35 million in 2019 to $22 million in 2020 is likely a contributing factor. The reduction in capital expenditures can be attributed to the completion of the Houma tank expansion and directional drill projects for Zydeco, as well as no contributions to investment in 2020. Additionally, the company may have seen returns on investments or other cash inflows from its investing activities.\n\n![Operating income and cash from investing activities changed from 2019 to 2020.](image6)\n\nThe reasons for these changes are multifaceted. The operating income increase can be linked to the partial offset of revenue declines with new operational efficiencies and regulatory changes. The improvement in cash from investing activities reflects reduced capital spending and potential returns on existing investments. These changes highlight the company's strategic adjustments in response to market conditions and operational efficiencies."}

Escondida's unit costs for FY2021 were $1.00 per pound, slightly lower than the $1.01 per pound in FY2020 [1]. The table provided in image1 shows that Escondida's revenue increased to $9,470M in FY2021 from $6,719M in FY2020, while its underlying EBITDA rose to $6,483M from $3,535M. This indicates strong financial performance, driven by higher sales volumes and improved operational efficiency. However, the unit cost increase in FY2022 is expected due to factors such as lower by-product credits and higher material mining costs [1].\n\nIn contrast, WAIO's unit costs in FY2021 were $14.82 per tonne, up from $12.63 per tonne in FY2020 [6]. Despite this increase, WAIO's revenue surged to $34,337M in FY2021 from $20,663M in FY2020, and its underlying EBITDA reached $26,270M compared to $14,508M in FY2020. The table in image6 highlights that the increase in unit costs was partly offset by higher production volumes and improved pricing. The production of iron ore at WAIO also increased, reaching 252 Mt in FY2021, reflecting record production at Jimblebar and Mining Area C [11].\n\nThe impact of commodity price changes on their financial performance is evident. For instance, a US$1 per ton increase in the iron ore price had a significant positive impact on profit after taxation and underlying EBITDA, with an estimated $163 million and $233 million respectively [5]. Similarly, a US¢1 per pound increase in the copper price impacted profit after taxation by $23 million and underlying EBITDA by $33 million [5].

The fair value of the Senior Notes is determined using Level 2 inputs [6], and the fair value of the Company’s long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $6,033 in 2022 and $7,692 in 2021 [11]. Additionally, the carrying value of long-term debt consisted of fixed-rate debt of $6,590 as of the end of 2022 [12].\n\nRegarding Level 2 assets, we know from the text that the Company did not hold any Level 1 or 3 financial assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis at the end of 2022 or 2021 [8].

For 2022, the total was $6,590, while for 2021, it was $7,531. After subtractions, the final totals were $6,484 for 2022 and $6,692 for 2021. This suggests that the total financial figures for these years are relatively close, but there is a noticeable difference in the final totals after adjustments.\n\nImage6 further supports this by showing that the Level 2 assets totaled $561 in 2022 and $408 in 2021.

These assumptions include discount rates, compensation increases, and pension progression. For example, the discount rate in Germany was 1.7% in 2021 and 1.5% in 2020 [image1]. The compensation increase in Germany was 1.5% for both years, while the pension progression was also 1.5% for both years [image8].\n\nIn contrast, the United States uses the Pri-2012 generational projection from the U.S. Social Security Administration's Long Range Demographic Assumptions for both years.

In Germany, the defined benefit obligation was attributed to active employees (47% in 2021 and 45% in 2020), to active and former employees with vested benefits (4% in 2021 and 14% in 2020), and to retirees and surviving dependents (39% in 2021 and 41% in 2020) [image8]. In the United States, the defined benefit obligation was influenced by the discount rate, compensation increase, and pension progression, with specific effects measured in millions of euros [image4].\n\nAdditionally, the financial market conditions and regulatory requirements play a significant role in shaping these actuarial assumptions and financial indicators. In the U.S., defined benefit plans are subject to funding requirements under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), with a regulatory requirement to maintain a minimum funding level of 80% to avoid benefit restrictions [image7].

According to Table 12, which provides additional information regarding deposits, total deposits increased from $1.4 trillion in 2020 to $1.5 trillion in 2021, reflecting a 6% growth [3]. However, this increase was not uniform across all deposit categories. Time deposits, which are typically longer-term and often carry higher interest rates, decreased by 41% from $49.8 billion in 2020 to $29.5 billion in 2021 [3]. This significant decline may indicate a strategic shift towards more liquid or shorter-term deposits, possibly due to regulatory constraints or a desire to reduce exposure to interest rate risk.\n\nIn terms of loans, Table 10 shows that total outstanding loans increased from $887.6 billion in 2020 to $895.4 billion in 2021, representing a modest 0.9% growth [8]. Commercial loans saw an increase, driven by higher demand in the commercial and industrial loan portfolio, while consumer loans declined, largely due to a reduction in residential mortgage first lien loans [8]. The data also indicates that the ACL for loans decreased by $5.9 billion, or 30%, from December 31, 2020, suggesting improved credit quality and better economic conditions [2]. This improvement in credit quality may have contributed to the lower provision for credit losses in 2021 compared to 2020 [2].\n\n![The table shows a breakdown of loan maturities and interest rate structures for a financial entity as of December 31, 2021.](image1)\n\n![The table presents financial data comparing December 31, 2021, with December 31, 2020, for two categories: \"Available-for-sale\" and \"Held-to-maturity\" securities, shown in millions of dollars.](image7)\n\n![The table presents selected balance sheet data in millions for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019.

The reduction in time deposits and the increase in commercial loans suggest a possible emphasis on more stable and less risky assets. Additionally, the decrease in the ACL for loans and the lower provision for credit losses indicate that the entity may have experienced a more favorable economic environment, allowing for better portfolio performance. Overall, the changes in loan and deposit figures reflect a strategic approach to maintaining financial stability while adapting to market conditions."}

For instance, the increase in 2021 compared to 2020 might be due to the recovery of certain segments following the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, as mentioned in the text quotes. The revenue increased in 2021 primarily due to increases at Comcast Spectacor as a result of the impacts of COVID-19 in the prior year period and sales of Sky Glass televisions [8]. Additionally, the company experienced a decrease in expenses in 2021, which could have contributed to the increase in Adjusted EBITDA.\n\nOn the other hand, the decrease in Adjusted EBITDA in 2020 compared to 2019 might be related to the economic downturn caused by the pandemic. The text quotes mention that expenses decreased in 2021 primarily due to costs incurred in the prior year periods in response to COVID-19, including severance charges related to our businesses, partially offset by costs related to Sky Glass and XClass TV [7]. This suggests that the company incurred significant costs in 2020 due to the pandemic, which could have negatively impacted the Adjusted EBITDA.\n\nFurthermore, the capital expenditures for the Cable Communications segment increased in 2021, primarily due to increased spending on scalable infrastructure and line extensions, which could have affected the Adjusted EBITDA [5]. However, the capital expenditures were flat in 2021 primarily due to reduced spending in our Theme Parks segment as a result of COVID-19, offset by increases in spending in our Cable Communications segment [9].\n\nIn summary, the Adjusted EBITDA for Comcast Corporation fluctuated between 2019 and 2021, with an increase in 2021 compared to 2020 and a decrease in 2020 compared to 2019.

However, some segments like Securities Services, Global Banking, and others experienced decreases in revenue [1].\n\n![Global Markets revenue increased significantly in 2020 compared to 2019](image1)\n\nThe Corporate Centre also saw changes in its financial performance. Adjusted revenue for the Corporate Centre included intersegment eliminations, largely related to movements in own shares held by the global businesses, which offset an equivalent adverse movement in these businesses.

This decline was largely due to lower income from short-term investments and fixed maturity securities, as short-term interest rates remained low throughout 2021 [7]. Despite this, dividend income saw a slight increase of 3.5% in 2021 compared to 2020, which helped partially offset the overall decline in investment income. The effective income tax rate also decreased slightly, from 15.3% in 2020 to 14.9% in 2021, contributing to the net investment income.\n\nThe asset allocations provide further insight into these changes. Cash, cash equivalents, and U.S. Treasury Bills increased from $67,082 million in 2020 to $90,688 million in 2021, indicating a shift toward more liquid assets. However, the value of fixed maturity securities decreased from $20,317 million in 2020 to $16,386 million in 2021, reflecting a reduction in holdings of longer-term debt instruments. Equity securities, on the other hand, increased from $269,498 million in 2020 to $334,907 million in 2021, suggesting a greater allocation to equities. These shifts in asset allocation may have contributed to the overall decline in investment income, as lower interest rates and reduced holdings in fixed-income securities likely impacted returns.\n\n![The table shows financial data for two different years, specifically showing figures as of December 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020.](image6)\n\nIn summary, the decline in net investment income from 2020 to 2021 was primarily due to falling interest rates and a reduction in fixed maturity securities, while the asset allocation reflected a greater emphasis on cash and equity securities."}

In 2018, the net income was $482 million, while in 2019 it rose to $546 million, and by 2020, it reached $556 million [7]. This indicates a steady increase in net income over the three-year period. The comprehensive income attributable to the Partnership also followed a similar trend, with $464 million in 2018, $526 million in 2019, and $542 million in 2020 [3]. These increases can be attributed to various factors, including higher income from equity method investments, as well as changes in accounting practices for certain investments.\n\nOne of the key contributing factors to the increase in net income and comprehensive income is the change in accounting for investments, particularly with Explorer and Colonial. In 2019, the Partnership acquired additional interests in these entities, which led to an increase in equity earnings. Additionally, the acquisition of an interest in Mattox in April 2020 further contributed to the rise in income from equity method investments [11]. These acquisitions resulted in higher equity earnings, which positively impacted the net income and comprehensive income attributable to the Partnership.\n\nAnother factor that influenced the financial results was the change in the treatment of distributions from Poseidon. The Partnership recorded excess distributions of $37 million, $33 million, and $24 million in 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively, as part of Other income [2]. This reflects the impact of distributions received from equity method investments on the Partnership's financial performance.\n\nThe cash flow statement provides additional context for the financial performance of the Partnership. In 2020, the Partnership generated $650 million in cash from operations, which contributed to its overall financial stability [7].

In the Middle East & Africa, the total market decreased by 8.0% to 546.4 billion units, primarily due to lower cigarette volume, heated tobacco unit volume, and IQOS device volume in PMI Duty Free, as well as lower cigarette volume in South Africa and Turkey [6]. Specifically, PMI Duty Free experienced a sharp decline of 70.8%, while Turkey saw an 8.5% decrease [7]. The shipment volume for cigarettes in the Middle East & Africa also dropped by 12.3%, and heated tobacco units fell by 61.5% [6]. These trends contributed to a decrease in net revenues, which declined by 21.7% when excluding unfavorable currency effects [3].\n\nIn contrast, the Latin America & Canada region saw a more complex picture. Net revenues, excluding unfavorable currency, decreased by 15.5%, driven by unfavorable volume/mix due to lower cigarette volume in Argentina and Mexico, partly offset by Brazil [10]. However, operating income, excluding unfavorable currency, decreased by 35.2%, mainly due to unfavorable volume/mix and lower fees for certain distribution rights [11]. Despite this, there were some positive factors, such as favorable pricing variance and lower marketing, administration, and research costs [10].\n\nIn South & Southeast Asia, the total shipment volume decreased by 17.2%, with cigarettes dropping from 174,934 million units in 2019 to 144,788 million units in 2020 [5]. There was no data available for heated tobacco units in 2019, so the change could not be calculated. This decline in shipment volume likely contributed to the overall reduction in net revenues in this region.\n\nEast Asia & Australia showed a different trend. While cigarette sales declined by 9.7%, heated tobacco units increased by 10.4%, leading to a slight overall decrease in total sales of 2.1% [7]. This suggests that the shift toward heated tobacco products may have partially offset the decline in traditional cigarette sales in this region.\n\nLooking at the financial data, the net revenues for the entire company declined significantly in 2020 compared to 2019, with different figures reported across various tables. One table indicated a 23.6% decrease in net revenues, while another showed a 13.7% decline [image1, image3]. The operating income also fell, with one table showing a 39.1% decrease and another indicating a 21.0% drop [image1, image3].

This growth was primarily driven by an increase in intermodal shipments, both international and domestic, which were fueled by higher retail sales, inventory replenishments by retailers, and increased e-commerce activity. The volume increase for consumer products was also accompanied by a rise in average revenue per car/unit, contributing to higher operating revenues.\n\nFor industrial products, the freight volumes increased by 5.4% in 2021 compared to 2020 [6].

Additionally, the earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) would have been $30.6 million in 2020, down 4.6% from the previous year, had the impact of the impairment charges and the implementation of AASB 16 been excluded [12].\n\n![Impairment charges for 2020 include $3,360,000 related to the exit from the Spanish market and $2,757,000 in other store impairments.](image2)\n\nThe impact of these impairment charges is also reflected in the earnings per share (EPS) figures. The basic EPS for 2020 was 10.6 cents, compared to 35.1 cents in 2019 [7]. The diluted EPS remained the same at 10.6 cents for 2020, while it was 34.2 cents in 2019 [7]. These declines in EPS further illustrate the negative impact of the impairment charges on the profitability of the company.\n\nIn conclusion, the impairment charges in 2020 had a significant negative impact on the profit attributable to ordinary shareholders, contributing to a substantial decrease in both net profit after tax and EPS compared to 2019."}

In 2019, unallocated revenues totaled $4,891 million, which dropped to $1,974 million in 2020 and further decreased to $182 million in 2021. This decline suggests a reduction in revenues not directly attributable to specific segments, possibly due to the resolution of prior-year tax positions or changes in revenue recognition practices. Similarly, unallocated expenses, such as research and development, selling, general, and administrative expenses, also showed variations over the years. For instance, unallocated research and development expenses increased from $989 million in 2019 to $1,820 million in 2021, indicating a growing investment in R&D that was not tied to specific segments.\n\nIn contrast, the net assets acquired during the acquisition of NUVIA in 2021 were $1,264 million, as detailed in image4. This figure represents the total value of assets acquired, including cash, in-process research and development (IPR&D), goodwill, and other assets, minus liabilities assumed.

In 2020, net cash provided by operating activities was $10.6 billion, compared to $9.6 billion in 2019. This increase was primarily due to lower net cash tax payments and reduced pre-tax pension and retiree medical plan contributions. As a result, PepsiCo's free cash flow, a non-GAAP measure, increased to $6.4 billion in 2020 from $5.6 billion in 2019, representing a 15% growth [6]. Free cash flow is used for acquisitions, debt repayments, dividends, and share repurchases, and PepsiCo aimed to return this cash to shareholders while maintaining financial flexibility [5].\n\n![Free cash flow increased in 2020 compared to 2019](image6)\n\nIn terms of contractual commitments, PepsiCo faced substantial obligations in 2020, with total contractual commitments amounting to $66.3 billion. These included long-term debt obligations, operating leases, and other liabilities. The largest portion of these commitments was due in 2026 and beyond, highlighting the company's long-term financial responsibilities [2]. For example, long-term debt obligations totaled $40.3 billion, with most payments scheduled for 2026 and later. Operating leases were $1.9 billion, mostly due by 2023, and the one-time mandatory transition tax under the TCJ Act was $3.2 billion, spread out until 2026 [2].\n\n![Contractual commitments and liabilities for PepsiCo in 2020](image2)\n\nComparing 2020 to 2019, PepsiCo's free cash flow showed a clear improvement, driven by better operating performance and cost management. However, the company's contractual commitments remained substantial, indicating ongoing financial obligations that could affect future liquidity. While 2019 saw net cash used for financing activities of $8.5 billion, primarily due to dividend payments and share repurchases, 2020's net cash provided by financing activities was $3.8 billion, reflecting a shift in capital structure and financing strategies [3]. This change suggests that PepsiCo was able to generate more cash from its operations, which helped offset some of the financial commitments.\n\nIn summary, PepsiCo's financial activities in 2020 led to an increase in free cash flow and a significant level of contractual commitments, with the free cash flow growing by 15% compared to 2019."}

This commitment is reflected in various initiatives aimed at creating an inclusive workplace where all employees, regardless of gender, can thrive.\n\nOne of the key ways Toyota supports female employee participation is through targeted initiatives that address the unique challenges women face in the workplace. For example, Toyota has launched initiatives to create a work environment that helps women gain motivation and supports their participation, especially in leadership roles [5]. Additionally, Toyota is continuing initiatives that promote women’s participation and advancement in the workplace so that the percentage of positions held by women, from initial hiring to executive positions, will consistently increase across its operation [11]. These efforts are part of a broader strategy to enhance gender diversity and ensure that women have equal opportunities to contribute and grow within the company.\n\nIn different regions, Toyota has implemented specific initiatives to promote these goals. In Europe, for instance, Toyota Motor Europe NV/SA (TME) has organized events during International Women’s Day, including video messages and workshops, to support working couples with home-working options, part-time regimes, and employment support for spouses [7]. TME also focuses on female career development through mentorship and sponsorship systems, as well as networking to promote gender diversity. Similarly, in China, Toyota Motor (China) Investment Co., Ltd. (TMCI) allows a breastfeeding break of up to one hour each day for lactating female employees, demonstrating a commitment to supporting women's health and well-being [7].\n\nIn South Africa, Toyota South Africa Motors (Pty) Ltd. (TSAM) has implemented leadership workshops to ensure the acceptance and promotion of women in the workplace, along with setting employment targets to increase female representation [7]. These regional initiatives highlight Toyota's tailored approach to addressing the specific needs and challenges faced by women in different parts of the world.\n\nFurthermore, Toyota's commitment to diversity and inclusion extends beyond gender. The company considers diversity and inclusion to be one of the key elements of its business infrastructure, aiming to create an attractive workplace where employees with wide-ranging skills and values, irrespective of gender, age, nationality, race, ethnicity, creed, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability, marital status, or the presence of children, can demonstrate their abilities to the fullest and achieve self-realization [6].\n\nThe table in image1 provides data on the percentage of women in various employment categories and their average period of employment across different Toyota locations globally. It shows that while the global percentage of women hired is 28.7%, the percentage of women in managerial positions is lower at 15.1% [image1]. This data underscores the ongoing need for initiatives that promote women's advancement into leadership roles.\n\nIn addition to these efforts, Toyota has also taken steps to support LGBT employees. For instance, Toyota Motor Corporation has incorporated a prohibition on discrimination or harassment of LGBT people into its employee behavioral guidelines and has introduced measures related to facilities, such as establishing an internal harassment consultation hotline and allocating dedicated toilets for LGBT people [8]. Starting from July 2020, Toyota introduced revised internal systems to allow employees in same-sex marriages or common-law marriages to use the same internal benefit systems as those in legal marriages [8].\n\nOverall, Toyota's approach to supporting female employee participation and promoting diversity is multifaceted, involving both global strategies and region-specific initiatives. These efforts are designed to create a more inclusive and equitable workplace where all employees can contribute to the company's success.\n\n![The table presents data on the percentage of women in various employment categories and their average period of employment across different Toyota locations globally.](image1)"}

Retained earnings are typically influenced by net income and dividends, while net income reflects the company's profitability after all expenses, taxes, and other costs.\n\nFrom the text quotes, we can gather that net income is a key component of retained earnings. For instance, in [4], [8], and [9], there are references to net income along with details about dividends declared and paid, stock repurchases, and other comprehensive income. These elements collectively impact retained earnings. Specifically, [4] mentions \"Dividends declared and paid (\\$3.21 per share)\" for 2019, [8] states \"Dividends declared and paid (\\$3.72 per share)\" for 2020, and [9] notes \"Dividends declared and paid (\\$2.63 per share)\" for 2018. These figures indicate an increase in dividends over the years, which would reduce retained earnings.\n\nRegarding net income, while specific figures for 2018, 2019, and 2020 are not directly provided in the text quotes, the context suggests that net income is a critical factor in determining retained earnings. Additionally, [10] provides some insight into the company's performance, noting that free cash flow for 2020 was \\$5.5 billion and 38% of revenue. This indicates strong operational performance, which likely contributed to net income.\n\nThe significant factors affecting these changes include the company's strategic focus on long-term growth of free cash flow per share, as mentioned in [10]. The committee's assessment of TI’s results and strategic progress for 2020 also played a role in determining bonuses and overall financial strategy. Furthermore, the reorganization of product lines within the Analog segment in [11] may have had an impact on the company's financial performance.\n\nLooking at the image quotes, [image3] provides numerical data across three years: 2020, 2019, and 2018.

While the exact nature of these figures is not specified, they could represent financial metrics such as revenue, profit, or costs. These totals suggest a slight decline in the combined figures from 2018 to 2020, which might reflect changes in net income and retained earnings.\n\nIn summary, the company's retained earnings and net income likely experienced changes from 2018 to 2020, influenced by factors such as dividend payouts, operational performance, and strategic decisions.

For instance, adjusted operating expenses decreased by $0.3 billion or 3%, reflecting management's cost reduction initiatives and lower performance-related pay [1]. Additionally, the company began allocating revenue and expenses related to Markets Treasury, the funding costs of HSBC Holdings debt, and the impacts of hyperinflation in Argentina to the global businesses, which helped improve how they reflect revenue and expense related to these activities [4].\n\nRegarding adjusted revenue from Global Markets, it increased by $1,562 million (27%) from 2019 to 2020 [3]. This growth was driven by an increase in capital markets revenue and net interest income from corporate lending. However, there were also areas of decline, such as in Global Banking, where revenue decreased by $71 million (2%) due to lower real estate and structured finance fee income and losses on legacy corporate restructuring positions [3].\n\n![Net operating income improved significantly from 2019 to 2020](image4)  \n![Adjusted revenue from Global Markets increased by 27% from 2019 to 2020](image3)"}

According to the text quote [10], ExxonMobil's share of equity decreased by $34.5 billion to $157.2 billion in 2020. This reduction was driven by losses amounting to $22.4 billion and distributions to shareholders totaling $14.9 billion, all in the form of dividends. However, some factors partially offset this decline. Foreign exchange translation effects due to the weaker U.S. dollar contributed $1.8 billion to equity, and a change in the funded status of postretirement benefits reserves added $1.0 billion.\n\nAdditionally, the financial data presented in image3 provides further context about the company’s financial performance during these years. The table shows that in 2020, there were notable negative figures such as a loss of $20,395 million and a decrease in equity, which aligns with the information provided in the text quotes. These figures suggest that the company faced substantial financial challenges during this period, contributing to the overall decline in equity.\n\n![The table presents financial figures in millions of dollars for the years 2018, 2019, and 2020, including values that may indicate losses or negative figures.](image3)\n\nFurthermore, the data in image1 highlights the financial trends between 2019 and 2020.

According to the financial statements, the equity structure in 2020 showed a total equity of RMB 52,731 million, which decreased slightly to RMB 51,055 million by the end of 2021. This change was driven by several key factors, including profit or loss for the year, fair value changes, share-based compensation, and other equity-related transactions.\n\nIn 2020, the company reported a profit for the year of RMB 4,176 million, contributing positively to retained earnings. Additionally, there were fair value changes on financial assets and currency translation differences that affected the comprehensive income. The company also experienced an increase in additional paid-in capital, from RMB 35,044 million to RMB 36,238 million, indicating new capital contributions or share issuances. However, there was a significant decrease in treasury shares, from RMB (134) million to RMB (3,660) million, suggesting the repurchase of shares during the year.\n\n![The table outlines the changes in equity for Tencent Music Entertainment Group from January 1, 2020, to December 31, 2020.](image2)\n\nBy 2021, the company's profit for the year dropped to RMB 3,215 million, which had a negative impact on retained earnings. The fair value changes on financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income also decreased significantly, from RMB 5,219 million in 2020 to a loss of RMB 2,128 million in 2021. Currency translation differences further contributed to the decline in comprehensive income. Despite these challenges, the company managed to maintain a positive non-controlling interest, increasing from RMB 486 million in 2020 to RMB 738 million in 2021.\n\n![The table provides a detailed breakdown of the changes in equity for Tencent Music Entertainment Group from January 1, 2021, to December 31, 2021.](image5)\n\nMajor transactions affecting these changes included the acquisition of Shenzhen Lanren in March 2021, which involved a total consideration of RMB2.7 billion, primarily payable in cash. This acquisition likely impacted the equity structure through the issuance of shares or cash payments. Additionally, the company made significant investments in the Universal Music Group consortium, including an additional investment of EUR161 million in January 2021, which was accounted for as an investment in an associate. These transactions would have influenced the equity components through their impact on retained earnings and additional paid-in capital.\n\nOverall, the changes in equity components between 2020 and 2021 reflect a combination of operational performance, market conditions, and strategic investments, with the major transactions involving acquisitions and investments playing a significant role in shaping the equity structure."}

In 2021, total NBCUniversal revenue increased by 26.1% to $34.3 billion, and total NBCUniversal Adjusted EBITDA increased by 6.0% to $5.7 billion [10]. This growth was driven by several factors, including an increase in average revenue per customer relationship, which reflected the impacts of the postponement of sporting events in the prior year period as a result of COVID-19, an increase in the sale of wireless handsets, and rate increases in the United Kingdom, which were partially offset by declines in average rates in Italy [11]. Additionally, the number of subscribers and audience ratings at NBCUniversal's networks continued to decline due to the competitive environment and shifting video consumption patterns [4].\n\nThe financial performance of NBCUniversal was also influenced by changes in customer relationships. The table shows that the number of total customer relationships decreased slightly from 23,280 thousand in 2019 to 23,224 thousand in 2020, and further to 23,027 thousand in 2021 [5]. Despite this decline, the average monthly direct-to-consumer revenue per customer relationship increased from $54.56 in 2020 to $59.29 in 2021, reflecting the impact of rate adjustments and changes in the types and levels of services received by customers [8]. This increase in revenue per customer relationship contributed to the overall growth in revenue for NBCUniversal.\n\n![The number of total customer relationships decreased slightly from 2019 to 2021.](image5) \n\nIn addition to these factors, the financial performance of NBCUniversal was also affected by the impact of the Tokyo Olympics in 2021, which contributed to an increase in Media segment revenue. Excluding the impact of the Tokyo Olympics, Media segment revenue increased by 11.0%, primarily due to increases in distribution revenue, advertising revenue, and other revenue, including the effects of COVID-19 in the prior year period [6]. The Studios segment also saw an increase in revenue, driven by increases in content licensing revenue, theatrical revenue, and home entertainment and other revenue as film and television production operations returned to full capacity [6].\n\nOverall, the revenue trends and customer relationships had a mixed impact on the financial performance of NBCUniversal from 2019 to 2021. While there were challenges such as declining subscriber numbers and audience ratings, there were also positive developments such as increased average revenue per customer relationship and growth in certain segments like Studios and Theme Parks."}

First, BHP uses a structured and rigorous method to manage Board succession planning, ensuring a diverse pipeline. This includes considering unforeseen departures and replacing current Board members, focusing on diversity, size, tenure, skills, experience, and the attributes necessary for effective governance and risk management within BHP. Second, the succession planning process is ongoing, particularly for Non-executive Directors, with a nine-year tenure as a guide. The Board aims to maintain a balance between experience and new perspectives and ensure that the Board is equipped to adapt to changing external factors and BHP's specific circumstances. Third, for new appointments, the Nomination and Governance Committee outlines a role description, incorporating criteria and attributes specified in the Board Governance Document and section 2.1.7. Fourth, an external search firm is selected to carry out a global search, providing the role description to align with the Board's criteria. Fifth, shortlisted candidates are initially considered by the Chair and the Nomination and Governance Committee, with candidates meeting with each Board member before a decision is made about their appointment. Sixth, the Nomination and Governance Committee recommends the preferred candidate for Board appointment. Seventh, the Board, supported by external consultants, performs background and reference checks on the candidate. Finally, a letter of appointment is produced, detailing the terms for Non-executive Directors, indemnification by the Group, and definitions of their role, independence, participation, time commitment, and continuous improvement. Written agreements are established for all Non-executive Directors [image1].\n\nIn addition to these steps, the Nomination and Governance Committee also oversees continuous improvement activities (training and development program) for Non-executive Directors. These programs cover matters of a business nature, including environmental, social, and governance matters and provide updates on BHP’s assets, commodities, geographies, and markets.

This improvement was driven by higher realizations, the absence of impairments and write-offs, and favorable foreign currency effects. In terms of total assets, the Upstream segment had $184.4 billion in assets as of December 31, 2021, which is slightly lower than the $191.3 billion recorded in 2020 [2].

According to the data, Credit Risk RWA increased under both the Standardized and Advanced Approaches in 2020. This increase was primarily due to factors such as higher market volatility, an increase in Derivatives exposures, Investment securities, Lending commitments, and Equity investments [3]. The rise in Credit Risk RWA implies that the institution faced higher risk exposure, which could necessitate higher capital reserves to maintain regulatory compliance.\n\nAt the same time, External TLAC as a percentage of RWA increased from 49.9% in 2019 to 47.7% in 2020 [7]. Although this is a slight decrease, it still remains well above the regulatory minimum of 18.0%. External TLAC consists of Common Equity Tier 1 capital and Additional Tier 1 capital, along with eligible Long-Term Debt (LTD), and it serves as a buffer to absorb losses in times of stress. The fact that External TLAC remains significantly above the required levels suggests that the institution has a strong capital base to withstand potential shocks.\n\nThe combination of increased Credit Risk RWA and robust External TLAC levels indicates that the institution maintained a resilient capital structure despite rising risk exposures. This resilience is further supported by the high capital ratios observed under both the Standardized and Advanced Approaches [1].

This suggests a higher tax burden on the company's global operations during the 2020 financial year. For Australian operations, the ETR also increased, from 27.8% in 2019 to 31.4% in 2020. These increases may reflect changes in the company’s profitability, tax planning strategies, or shifts in the geographic distribution of its operations [8].\n\nAdditionally, the deferred tax assets and liabilities provide further insight into the company’s tax position. The total deferred tax assets increased from $6,391,000 in 2019 to $9,449,000 in 2020, with the majority of these assets expected to be settled after 12 months. This indicates that the company has recognized more future tax benefits in 2020 compared to 2019. However, the deferred tax liabilities remained relatively low, increasing only slightly from $19,000 in 2019 to $105,000 in 2020 [4].\n\nAnother important point is the recognition of unused tax losses. In 2020, the amount of unused tax losses for which no deferred tax asset had been recognized totaled $2,693,000, compared to $2,063,000 in 2019. This suggests that the company was unable to fully utilize its tax losses in 2020, which may have impacted its overall tax position [12].\n\n### Impairment Charges\n\nImpairment charges for Lovisa Holdings Limited were notably higher in 2020 compared to 2019. In 2020, the company recorded impairment charges of $6,117,000, which included $3,360,000 related to the exit from the Spanish market and $2,757,000 for other store impairments. In contrast, there were no impairment charges recognized in 2019. This significant increase in impairment charges likely reflects the impact of the company’s decision to exit the Spanish market and the associated write-down of fixed assets, key money, and lease right-of-use assets within its store network [6].\n\n![The table shows consolidated financial data in thousands of dollars for impairment charges in 2019 and 2020.](image2)\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe major changes in tax expenses and impairment charges for Lovisa Holdings Limited between 2019 and 2020 include a significant increase in impairment charges and a rise in the effective tax rate for both global and Australian operations. Additionally, the company recognized a larger amount of unused tax losses in 2020 compared to 2019, and its deferred tax assets increased substantially."}

According to the financial data, the company reported a profit after tax of Rs. 6060.70 crore for the year 2002-2003 [5]. This figure is significantly higher than the previous year's profit after tax of Rs. 4779.55 crore [5]. However, the company also faced challenges, including an exceptional item of Rs. 2270.09 crore, which affected the net profit [5].\n\nIn contrast, the potential for tobacco export earnings in India is substantial. The image quote indicates that current export earnings are Rs. 930 crore, while the potential export earnings are Rs. 7000 crore [3]. This suggests that there is a significant opportunity for growth in the export sector. The text accompanying the image highlights that India could increase its export earnings sevenfold with just a 5% share of the global tobacco trade, which currently stands at 0.7% of the USD 30 billion annual global tobacco trade [3].\n\n![India's potential for tobacco exports](image3)\n\nThe implications of these figures for the company's strategy are clear. The company needs to focus on expanding its export operations to capitalize on the vast potential in the global market. This could involve increasing production, improving quality, and exploring new markets. Additionally, the company should consider diversifying its product portfolio to include more exportable tobacco products, as indicated by the developmental activities aimed at helping farmers produce more exportable tobaccos [11].\n\nMoreover, the company's efforts to launch new brands and improve existing ones, such as the successful introduction of the Tipper brand, demonstrate a proactive approach to market expansion [7]. These strategies can be further leveraged to enhance the company's presence in both domestic and international markets.\n\nIn conclusion, while the company's financial results for 2002-2003 show positive growth, the potential for tobacco export earnings in India is significantly higher, indicating a need for strategic focus on export opportunities."}

In contrast, from 2018 to 2019, net interest income increased by $4.4 billion, with interest expense increasing by $714 million. These figures indicate that the decline in net interest income during 2019 to 2020 was primarily due to a substantial drop in interest income, which outpaced the reduction in interest expenses [12].\n\n![The table outlines changes in interest income and interest expense over two periods: 2019 to 2020, and 2018 to 2019, expressed in millions of dollars.](image2)\n\nThe organizational structure of Bank of America, as depicted in image1, plays a crucial role in understanding these financial changes. The bank is divided into four main business segments: Consumer Banking, Global Wealth & Investment Management (GWIM), Global Banking, and Global Markets, with the remaining operations categorized under \"All Other.\" Each segment contributes differently to the overall net interest income and expense.\n\nFor instance, the Consumer Banking segment, which includes deposits and consumer lending, experienced a decrease in net interest income due to lower interest rates and higher deposit balances, partially offset by the deployment of excess deposits into securities [9]. This aligns with the data in image5, which shows a decline in net interest income for both Deposits and Consumer Lending. Additionally, the Business Lending revenue also decreased by $933 million in 2020 compared to 2019, driven by lower interest rates [10].\n\n![The image displays an organizational chart of the Bank of America Corporation with five main divisions.](image1)\n\nThe Global Markets segment, which includes Fixed Income, Currencies and Commodities Markets, and Equity Markets, likely contributed to the fluctuations in interest income and expense due to its exposure to market volatility and interest rate changes.

According to the financial data, **net investment income** decreased from $5,039 million in 2020 to $4,807 million in 2021, a decline of 4.6%. This reduction was primarily driven by lower interest and other investment income, which fell by 44.4% in 2021 compared to 2020 [7]. However, dividend income increased slightly by 3.5% in 2021, contributing to a more stable overall investment performance despite the broader decline [7].\n\nIn terms of **asset composition**, the insurance business maintained substantial holdings of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term U.S. Treasury Bills, which are typically low-risk but also yield lower returns. The table shows that cash, cash equivalents, and U.S. Treasury Bills increased from $67,082 million in 2020 to $90,688 million in 2021 [3]. This suggests a continued emphasis on liquidity and safety over higher-yield investments, even in the face of declining interest rates. Meanwhile, equity securities, which are more volatile but potentially higher-return, rose from $269,498 million in 2020 to $334,907 million in 2021 [3]. This increase indicates a strategic shift toward equities, possibly to capitalize on market opportunities or diversify risk.\n\nThe implications of these changes are significant. The decline in net investment income highlights the challenges posed by persistently low interest rates, which have negatively impacted returns on fixed-income investments like U.S. Treasury Bills. At the same time, the increase in equity securities suggests a willingness to take on more risk in pursuit of higher returns. However, this also exposes the portfolio to greater volatility, as seen in the large unrealized gains and losses from equity securities [7]. The focus on liquidity may provide stability during uncertain times, but it could also limit growth potential if interest rates rise or market conditions improve.\n\n![The insurance business saw an increase in cash, cash equivalents, and U.S. Treasury Bills from 2020 to 2021, while equity securities grew significantly.](image3)  \n![Net investment income declined from 2020 to 2021, primarily due to falling interest and other investment income.](image7)  \n\nIn summary, the net investment income decreased from 2020 to 2021, while the asset composition shifted toward more equity securities and cash, reflecting a balance between risk management and growth strategies."}

For 2020, the GAAP effective tax rate was (18.6) percent, while the Operating (non-GAAP) effective tax rate was (1.5) percent. This difference was primarily due to the recognition of a $0.9 billion net tax benefit from an intra-entity sale of intellectual property and a $0.2 billion tax benefit from a change in foreign tax law [7]. In contrast, for 2019, the GAAP effective tax rate was 7.2 percent, and the Operating (non-GAAP) effective tax rate was 8.5 percent [7].\n\nFor 2020, the GAAP effective tax rate was much lower than the non-GAAP rate because of the significant tax benefits recognized, which were not included in the non-GAAP calculations. These benefits were related to the intra-entity sale of intellectual property and changes in foreign tax laws, which had a substantial impact on the GAAP results but were excluded from the non-GAAP measures. The non-GAAP effective tax rate for 2020 was also influenced by the operating (non-GAAP) pre-tax income, which was higher than the GAAP pre-tax income due to adjustments for items such as workforce rebalancing charges and other one-time expenses [11].\n\nIn 2019, the GAAP effective tax rate was 7.2 percent, while the non-GAAP effective tax rate was 8.5 percent. This difference was mainly due to adjustments made for acquisition-related, retirement-related, and spin-off-related charges, which affected the non-GAAP results differently than the GAAP results [3]. The non-GAAP effective tax rate for 2019 was higher than the GAAP rate because these adjustments reduced the pre-tax income, leading to a higher effective tax rate.\n\nOverall, the effective tax rate under GAAP was significantly lower than the non-GAAP rate in 2020, while in 2019, the non-GAAP rate was slightly higher than the GAAP rate. These differences reflect the impact of various adjustments and one-time events on the financial results.\n\n![The table provides financial data for the year ended December 31, 2020, comparing GAAP and non-GAAP results with various adjustments.](image5)"}

The increase from 2020 to 2021 was primarily due to higher margins on refined product sales, higher earnings from 50 percent-owned CPChem, and higher sales volumes, partially offset by higher operating expenses [4]. This indicates that the recovery in demand for refined products, particularly as travel restrictions eased, played a key role in the improvement.\n\nIn contrast, the **international downstream** sector saw a decline in earnings over the same period. According to the data, the international downstream earned $525 million in 2021, compared to $618 million in 2020 [11]. This decrease was largely due to lower margins on refined product sales and higher operating expenses, although these were partially offset by favorable foreign currency effects [11].

According to the report, supply chain disruptions can arise from events affecting raw materials and manufacturing, such as strikes or natural disasters. The potential impacts of such disruptions include supply issues and cost increases. To mitigate these risks, Nestlé employs safety and security policies and business continuity plans [6].\n\nThese mitigations are particularly relevant given Nestlé's factory distribution across different regions. For example, the company has been working on enhancing its logistics and supply chain efficiency by increasing the scope of its Transport Hub technologies to cover 50% of its global logistics network. Additionally, Nestlé has extended the scope of its AI-powered network optimization tools to evaluate different product sourcing and delivery scenarios. These tools help the company respond quickly to changes in demand and optimize transport and production schedules, thereby enhancing its ability to service customers and reduce its operational carbon footprint [10].\n\nThe image quotes also provide some context about Nestlé's global presence.

The total net carrying value of intangible assets increased from $10,349 million in 2019 to $10,856 million in 2020. This increase is primarily due to the growth in the \"Customer-related\" category, which saw an increase from $8,649 million in 2019 to $8,853 million in 2020. Additionally, the \"Trademarks and technology\" category increased from $661 million in 2019 to $973 million in 2020, while the \"Other\" category increased slightly from $313 million in 2019 to $350 million in 2020.

This increase is attributed to better performance across several business segments, including higher equity investment income and improved operating results. Additionally, **other comprehensive income** saw notable changes. For instance, **currency translation differences** contributed positively in 2021 (€724 million) compared to a negative impact in 2020 (€-768 million). This indicates that the company experienced favorable exchange rate movements in 2021, which had a positive effect on its overall comprehensive income. The **total comprehensive income** also rose significantly, from €825 million in 2020 to €2,446 million in 2021, highlighting a strong financial performance for the year.\n\n![Total comprehensive income increased significantly from €825 million in 2020 to €2,446 million in 2021.](image1)\n\n### Balance Sheet Components\n\nLooking at the **balance sheet** (image6), several key components show substantial changes between the two fiscal years. One of the most striking differences is in **non-current assets**, which increased from €14,827 million in 2020 to €31,338 million in 2021. This growth is largely due to the acquisition of Varian, which added significant intangible assets and property, plant, and equipment to the balance sheet. Similarly, **current assets** grew from €10,268 million in 2020 to €10,824 million in 2021, indicating an improvement in liquidity.\n\nOn the **liabilities side**, both **current liabilities** and **non-current liabilities** increased substantially. Current liabilities rose from €7,289 million in 2020 to €10,065 million in 2021, while non-current liabilities jumped from €5,294 million to €15,758 million during the same period. This reflects the company's increased reliance on debt financing, particularly for the acquisition of Varian. However, **equity** also increased, rising from €12,498 million in 2020 to €16,321 million in 2021, primarily due to a capital increase and retained earnings. Despite the rise in liabilities, the **equity ratio** declined from 76% to 55%, as noted in the text quote [7], mainly due to the significant increase in loan liabilities.\n\n![Non-current assets increased significantly from €14,827 million in 2020 to €31,338 million in 2021.](image6)\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn summary, the key differences in the comprehensive income and balance sheet components of Siemens Healthineers AG between fiscal years 2020 and 2021 include a significant increase in net income and total comprehensive income, a substantial rise in non-current assets driven by the acquisition of Varian, and a marked increase in both current and non-current liabilities, which led to a decline in the equity ratio."}

Home Lending loan balances were impacted by actions taken in 2020 to temporarily curtail certain non-conforming residential mortgage originations and suspend home equity originations. Small Business period-end loan balances were also impacted by a decline in PPP loans [5]. \n\n![Total loans decreased from $229,354 million in 2019 to $181,237 million in 2021, while total deposits increased from $233,860 million in 2019 to $246,132 million in 2021.](image8)\n\nIn conclusion, the net income for the company increased significantly from 2019 to 2021, while total deposits increased and total loans decreased for Consumer Banking and Lending."}

According to the data, the average Card Member loans decreased over this period, with specific figures showing a decline in both U.S. and international segments [7]. This reduction in loan balances may have been influenced by factors such as increased paydown rates and economic conditions, which impacted the overall portfolio size.\n\nRegarding net interest income, the data indicates a general decline from 2019 to 2021. For instance, the net interest income for the U.S. segment was $1,011 million in 2021, compared to $967 million in 2020 and $866 million in 2019 [5]. Similarly, the international segment showed a decrease in net interest income over the same period. The decline in net interest income can be attributed to lower average revolving Card Member loan balances and a decrease in net interest yields, which were driven by higher paydown rates on revolving loan balances [2].\n\n![The table shows financial data for the years ended December 31, from 2019 to 2021, with comparisons of changes from 2020 to 2021 and 2019 to 2020.](image3)\n\nThese changes in average Card Member loans and net interest income had implications for the company's financial performance. The decline in net interest income suggests that the company faced challenges in maintaining its interest income, which could impact overall profitability. However, the company managed to increase non-interest revenues, which helped offset some of these declines. For example, non-interest revenues increased by 24% from 2020 to 2021, driven by higher discount revenue and net card fees [2].\n\n![The table displays financial data for the years ended December 31 for the years 2021, 2020, and 2019.

Share-based compensation, which involves issuing shares or restricted share units to employees, impacts shareholders' equity by increasing the number of shares outstanding and affecting additional paid-in capital. According to the data, share-based compensation expense increased Restricted Share Units by 1,118,284 and Additional Paid-in Capital by $79,522, contributing positively to shareholders' equity [2]. This reflects the company's strategy of using equity incentives to attract and retain talent, which can have long-term benefits for shareholder value.\n\nIn addition to share-based compensation, cash flow from operating activities is a critical factor in maintaining and improving the company's cash position. The cash flow statement indicates that operating activities generated positive cash flows, which are essential for funding operations, investing in growth opportunities, and returning value to shareholders through dividends. For 2020, the net income was $5,185,313, and adjustments for non-cash items such as depreciation, amortization, and share-based compensation further contributed to the cash flows from operating activities. These cash flows are crucial for sustaining the company's financial health and supporting its strategic initiatives.\n\n![The table provides a detailed overview of changes in shareholders' equity for Accenture over the fiscal year running from August 31, 2017, to August 31, 2018.](image7)\n\nFurthermore, the cash flow from operating activities also supports the company's ability to pay dividends, which is an important aspect of shareholder returns.

The total equity increased from €12,511 million in 2020 to €16,339 million in 2021, reflecting a substantial rise of €3,828 million [7]. This increase was primarily due to the issuance of new shares in March 2021 to finance the acquisition of Varian, which led to an increase in issued capital by €53 million and a capital reserve by €2,275 million [7]. Additionally, the company's net income for the year contributed to the growth in unappropriated net income by €497 million, further boosting equity [4].\n\nThe company's liabilities also saw notable changes. Net debt (including pensions) increased significantly from €2,513 million in 2020 to €12,809 million in 2021 [3]. This increase was partly due to the acquisition of Varian, which required substantial financing.

This transaction is reflected in the cash flows from financing activities, where net cash used in financing activities was $14,933 million in 2021, driven by share repurchases, net debt repayments, decreases in customer deposits, dividends, and the redemption of preferred shares, partially offset by the proceeds from the issuance of preferred shares [1].\n\n![The table presents financial data for the years 2019, 2020, and 2021, showing figures in millions of dollars.

While specific figures for total assets are not provided in the text quotes, the table structure indicates a comprehensive view of asset composition and changes over time.\n\nRegarding cash flow from operating activities, the consolidated operating cash flow for 2021 was $\\mathbb{S}7.20$ .20 billion, an increase of $\\S871$ million compared to 2020 [5]. This increase was primarily due to profit before taxes adjusted for non-cash items, including higher accruals for short-term incentive compensation. In addition, lower payments for short-term incentive compensation favorably impacted cash flow. However, increased working capital requirements partially offset these gains, with changes in accounts receivable and inventory unfavorably impacting cash flow but being partially offset by favorable changes in accounts payable and accrued expenses [5].\n\n![The table presents a financial statement showing the assets, liabilities, and shareholders' equity for a consolidated entity and its segments.](image1)\n\nThe implications of these changes on business operations are significant. The increase in operating cash flow suggests improved operational efficiency and better management of working capital, which can be reinvested into the business for growth or used to reduce debt. The higher profit adjusted for non-cash items indicates that the company is generating more earnings, which is a positive sign for its financial health. However, the increased working capital requirements suggest that the company may be investing more in its operations, which could be a strategic move to expand or improve its market position.

This is crucial for sustaining business operations and ensuring long-term stability. The company's focus on generating significant capital resources from operating activities, as mentioned in the text, further supports this notion [6].

This reduction in total assets is reflected in the financial statement table [image1], which shows specific changes in asset categories such as cash and cash equivalents, card member receivables, and investment securities. For instance, cash and cash equivalents declined from $32,965 million in 2020 to $22,028 million in 2021, primarily due to increased balances in card member loans and receivables, debt maturities, share repurchases, and a reduction in customer deposits [9].\n\nOn the liability side, total liabilities also decreased slightly from $168,383 million in 2020 to $166,371 million in 2021, a reduction of $2,012 million. This change is consistent with the entity's balance sheet data [image1], which highlights a decline in customer deposits from $86,875 million to $84,382 million, as well as reductions in other liabilities.

The effective tax rate fluctuated significantly during this period, with a notable increase in 2019 to 41%, followed by decreases in 2020 and 2021 to 9% and 12%, respectively. This shift can be attributed to several key elements, such as the benefit from FDII deductions, excess tax benefits associated with share-based awards, and the derecognition of deferred tax assets on distributed intellectual property.\n\nIn 2019, the company experienced a substantial charge to income tax expense due to the derecognition of a deferred tax asset related to distributed intellectual property, which amounted to $2.5 billion [8]. This event had a significant impact on the effective tax rate for that year. In contrast, the benefit from establishing new U.S. net deferred tax assets contributed positively to the tax provision in 2019, although it was offset by other factors.\n\nThe benefit from FDII deductions also played a role in reducing the effective tax rate in 2020 and 2021. These deductions are designed to encourage U.S. companies to invest in foreign operations, and their impact is reflected in the tax provision for those years. Additionally, the excess tax benefit associated with share-based awards contributed to the reduction in the effective tax rate, as these benefits were recognized in the income tax provision.\n\nAnother significant change occurred in 2019 when the company made check-the-box elections for certain foreign subsidiaries, resulting in a tax benefit of $570 million. This benefit was primarily due to the establishment of new U.S. net deferred tax assets. However, subsequent changes in tax regulations led to the derecognition of a deferred tax asset related to distributed intellectual property, which had a negative impact on the tax provision in 2019.\n\nThe table below provides a visual representation of the tax provisions and benefits for the years 2019, 2020, and 2021, highlighting the changes in each category:\n\n![The table shows the changes in tax provisions and benefits for the years 2019, 2020, and 2021, highlighting the changes in each category.](image2)\n\nOverall, the trends in Qualcomm's tax provisions and related benefits demonstrate the impact of various tax-related events and regulatory changes on the company's financial performance.

This represents an increase of $1,385 million, or approximately 25.2%. The increase in operating profit was driven by higher sales volume, favorable price realization, and lower manufacturing costs and SG&A/R&D expenses. Specifically, sales volume increased by $3,076 million, price realization by $932 million, manufacturing costs decreased by $1,246 million, and SG&A/R&D expenses decreased by $1,021 million [8]. These factors contributed to a significant improvement in operating profit for the year.\n\nIn the **Machinery, Energy & Transportation** segment, the operating profit for 2021 was $4,481 million, compared to $3,367 million in 2020 [6]. This is an increase of $1,114 million, or about 33.1%. The growth in ME&T operating profit was primarily due to higher sales volume and favorable price realization, partially offset by higher manufacturing costs and increased SG&A/R&D expenses. The segment also benefited from lower other operating expenses [11].\n\nRegarding **net cash provided by operating activities**, the consolidated net cash provided by operating activities for 2021 was $7,202 million, compared to $6,331 million in 2020 [8]. This reflects an increase of $871 million, or roughly 13.8%. The increase was mainly attributed to higher profit before taxes adjusted for non-cash items, including higher accruals for short-term incentive compensation, as well as lower payments for short-term incentive compensation. However, this was partially offset by increased working capital requirements, particularly in accounts receivable and inventory, though these were partially offset by favorable changes in accounts payable and accrued expenses.\n\nFor the **Machinery, Energy & Transportation** segment, the net cash provided by operating activities for 2021 was $7,177 million, compared to $4,054 million in 2020 [4]. This represents an increase of $3,123 million, or about 77.0%.

This rise can be attributed to various factors, including new tax positions taken during the year and adjustments to prior-year positions. The table shows that there were gross increases of $416 million in 2020, primarily driven by current year tax positions, while there were also some decreases due to settlements and statute of limitations lapses. The implications of this increase are that the company faces greater uncertainty regarding its tax liabilities, which could affect future cash flows and financial planning. Additionally, the company expects that its liability for these unrecognized tax benefits may decrease by $39 million in the next twelve months due to audit settlements and the expiration of statutes of limitations [6].\n\n![The table presents data on gross unrecognized tax benefits for the years 2018, 2019, and 2020, showing an increase from $1,423 million in 2019 to $1,829 million in 2020.](image5)\n\nRegarding **common share repurchases**, the company repurchased 14 million shares in 2020 at an average price of $300.58 per share, compared to 22 million shares in 2019 at an average price of $245.97 per share. The aggregate cost of these repurchases was $4,250 million in 2020 and $5,500 million in 2019. Despite the higher average price in 2020, the company repurchased fewer shares, which may reflect a strategic decision to manage its capital more conservatively. The board authorization for share repurchases remained at 58 million shares as of December 31, 2020, down from 72 million in 2019. This reduction in authorized shares suggests a more cautious approach to share buybacks, potentially to preserve liquidity or allocate resources to other priorities.\n\n![The table presents financial data related to common share repurchases for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, showing a decrease in the number of shares repurchased and an increase in the average price per share.](image1)\n\nIn summary, the company experienced an increase in gross unrecognized tax benefits and a reduction in common share repurchases between 2019 and 2020, reflecting both increased tax uncertainties and a more conservative capital management strategy."}

Sales volume increased by $2,527 million, or 24%, with contributions from higher end-user demand for equipment and services, favorable price realization, and changes in dealer inventories [3]. The increase in sales volume was driven by strong performance across multiple regions and segments, including North America, EAME, and Asia/Pacific [2][4][6]. Additionally, dealers decreased inventories more during the fourth quarter of 2020 than during the fourth quarter of 2021, which contributed to the overall growth in sales volume [8].\n\nOperating profit also increased significantly, rising by $231 million, or 17%, to $1.611 billion in the fourth quarter of 2021 compared to $1.380 billion in the fourth quarter of 2020 [12].

However, this was partially offset by higher manufacturing costs and SG&A/R&D expenses [1]. According to the bar chart in image1, the increase in operating profit was further supported by positive contributions from sales volume ($3,076 million), price realization ($932 million), and financial products ($279 million), while manufacturing costs and SG&A/R&D expenses were reduced [image1].\n\n![Sales volume, price realization, and other factors contributed to the increase in operating profit.](image1)\n\nIn addition to these factors, the overall operating profit margin slightly declined from 12.3% in the fourth quarter of 2020 to 11.7% in the fourth quarter of 2021 [5].

This decline was part of a broader trend, as net interest income across the entire bank decreased by $5.5 billion to $43.4 billion in 2020 compared to 2019 [1].

These activities are reflected in the company's financial statements, particularly in the changes to equity components and cash flow from financing activities.\n\n**Cash Dividends:**\nCash dividends represent a distribution of earnings to shareholders, which directly reduces retained earnings and, consequently, the total equity of the company. According to the data provided, Chevron paid cash dividends that impacted its equity structure. The table in image5 indicates that cash dividends were a key factor in the changes to retained earnings and overall equity. Specifically, the dividends paid out in 2021 would have decreased the amount of retained earnings, thereby affecting the total equity of the company. This reduction in retained earnings is an important component of the equity changes detailed in the equity statement.\n\n**Treasury Stock Transactions:**\nTreasury stock transactions involve the repurchase or reissuance of the company’s own shares. These transactions affect the equity structure by altering the number of outstanding shares and the value of treasury stock. In 2021, Chevron engaged in treasury stock transactions, which are reflected in the equity changes. The table in image5 shows that the company purchased treasury shares, which reduced the total equity as these shares are recorded at cost. Additionally, the number of outstanding shares was affected, which can influence metrics such as earnings per share (EPS).\n\n**Impact on Cash Flow:**\nThe impact of these activities on Chevron's cash flow is evident in the financing activities section of the cash flow statement. According to the data in image6, the net cash used for financing activities in 2021 was $23,113 million. This figure includes the cash outflows related to the payment of dividends and the repurchase of treasury stock. The significant outflow indicates that the company allocated a substantial portion of its cash to these activities, which aligns with the observed reduction in equity and the changes in the number of outstanding shares.\n\nIn summary, both cash dividends and treasury stock transactions had a notable impact on Chevron's equity structure and cash flow in 2021. The payment of dividends reduced retained earnings and total equity, while the repurchase of treasury stock altered the number of outstanding shares and further impacted the equity structure.

According to the text quote, the Asia business was the major contributor, delivering $\\mathbb{S}13\\mathsf{b n}$ of adjusted profit before tax in 2020 [1]. This indicates that WPB, which includes Retail Banking and Wealth Management, played a crucial role in maintaining profitability despite the challenging economic environment caused by the pandemic.\n\nThe financial performance data reveals that the Group's overall adjusted profit before tax was $\\S12$ bn, down 45% due to lower revenue and higher expected credit loss charges directly linked to the impact of the pandemic [9]. The decline in revenue was primarily due to the progressive impact of lower global interest rates on net interest income, especially in Retail Banking within WPB and Global Liquidity and Cash Management (GLCM) in CMB and GBM [10]. Additionally, in WPB, revenue also reduced from lower unsecured lending, a fall in credit card spending, and lower sales in insurance.\n\nLooking at the financial data presented in image4, which provides a detailed breakdown of adjusted revenue for different segments, we can see that Retail Banking experienced a significant decline. Total revenue in 2020 for Retail Banking was $12,938 million, compared to $15,655 million in 2019, representing a decrease of $2,285 million or 16% [4]. This decline was mainly driven by a reduction in net interest income, which fell by $2,285 million or 16% from 2019.\n\nDespite these challenges, some segments within WPB showed resilience. For instance, in Wealth Management, while total revenue decreased slightly, there were increases in certain areas such as asset management revenue, which rose by $24 million or 2% from 2019 [4]. This suggests that while the overall performance of WPB was affected by the economic downturn, there were still areas of growth and stability.\n\n![The pie chart shows a red segment representing $4.1 billion, which corresponds to 34% of the total group adjusted profit before tax.](image3)\n\nThe financial performance data also highlights the broader challenges faced by HSBC in 2020.

These figures underscore the significant impact of the pandemic on the banking sector, with lower interest rates, reduced customer activity, and increased credit losses contributing to the decline.\n\nIn summary, Wealth and Personal Banking (WPB) contributed significantly to HSBC's group adjusted profit before tax in 2020, with the Asia business being a major contributor. However, the financial performance data reveals that the overall profitability of the Group was severely impacted by the pandemic, with significant declines in revenue and increased credit losses."}

According to the data provided, the total number of stores increased from 250 in 2016 to 435 in 2020 [8]. This growth reflects the success of Lovisa's strategy to expand internationally, as it opened stores in various countries such as Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, Malaysia, South Africa, the United Kingdom, France, and the United States of America, as well as supporting franchised stores in regions like the Middle East and Vietnam [3].\n\n![The image shows a table displaying the number of stores across various countries and regions from 2016 to 2020, with a clear increase in the total number of stores over the years.](image8)\n\nIn addition to expanding into new markets, Lovisa also focused on optimizing its existing store network by closing underperforming stores and identifying new sites for potential openings [12].

Under AASB 16, the Group recognized a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for all leases, replacing the previous model where operating leases were not capitalized [4]. This change led to an increase in lease liabilities, as seen in the financial data provided in image1. The balance at 1 July 2019 was $143,621, and by 28 June 2020, the total lease liability had grown to $167,154, with $36,019 classified as current and $131,135 as non-current [1]. The recognition of lease liabilities on initial application of AASB 16 was $143,621, and additional liabilities were recognized during the period, including re-measurements due to changes in lease terms [1].\n\n![The table displays financial data related to lease liabilities for the year 2020.](image1)\n\nIn addition to lease liabilities, the transition to AASB 16 also affected the accounting for site restoration costs. Prior to the adoption of AASB 16, these costs were capitalized as part of leasehold improvements and depreciated over their useful life. However, since the adoption of AASB 16, site restoration costs are now capitalized as part of the lease right-of-use asset and depreciated over the lease term [3]. This change would have impacted the Group's balance sheet by increasing the value of its right-of-use assets and lease liabilities.\n\nThe Group also adopted AASB 16 using the modified retrospective approach, which means that the financial statements for prior periods were not restated. Instead, the Group applied the standard to its existing leases as of 1 July 2019, with the lease liabilities measured at the present value of the remaining lease payments, discounted at the Group’s incremental borrowing rate [9]. This approach ensured that the financial impact of the transition was reflected in the financial statements for the year ended 28 June 2020.\n\n![The table provides information regarding changes in accounting treatment for operating leases as of July 1, 2019.](image2)\n\nRegarding employee benefit liabilities, the Group's net obligation in respect of long-term service benefits is calculated using expected future increases in wage and salary rates, including related on-costs, and is discounted using high-quality Australian corporate bond rates [10]. The consolidated employee benefit liabilities for 2020 show a slight increase compared to 2019, with total liabilities amounting to $4,092 in 2020 and $4,054 in 2019 [3]. This indicates that the Group's obligations for employee benefits remained relatively stable during the transition period.\n\n![The table shows consolidated employee benefit liabilities in thousands of dollars for the years 2020 and 2019.](image3)\n\nIn summary, the transition to AASB 16 had a significant impact on the Group's lease liabilities, resulting in an increase in both the right-of-use assets and lease liabilities. Additionally, the Group's employee benefit liabilities remained relatively stable, with only a slight increase observed in 2020."}

This decline was primarily due to lower net earnings (excluding non-cash charges) and higher working capital requirements, as noted in the text quotes [6] and [11]. Despite this, operating activities still contributed positively to the cash balance.\n\n![Net cash provided by operating activities decreased slightly from 2019 to 2020](image4)\n\n### Investing Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities decreased from $1,200 million in 2019 to $602 million in 2020. This reduction was mainly due to lower capital expenditures and the deconsolidation of RBH, as explained in quote [2]. The decrease in cash used in investing activities helped improve the overall cash balance.\n\n![Net cash used in investing activities decreased from 2019 to 2020](image1)\n\n### Financing Activities\nNet cash used in financing activities increased from $8,061 million in 2019 to $8,496 million in 2020. This increase was driven by higher payments to noncontrolling interests and higher dividends paid, partially offset by debt activity, as stated in quote [3]. The rise in cash used in financing activities had a negative impact on the overall cash balance.\n\n![Net cash used in financing activities increased from 2019 to 2020](image4)\n\n### Overall Impact on Cash Balance\nThe combination of these changes resulted in an increase in the cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash balance from $6,865 million at the beginning of 2019 to $7,285 million at the end of 2020.

The remuneration system is designed to align with key financial metrics such as consolidated operating income, share price volatility, and individual performance, all of which are critical for assessing corporate health and long-term value creation.\n\nThe **Annual Total Remuneration** for executives is determined based on a formula that references benchmark results of executive compensation, while also incorporating factors like consolidated operating income and the volatility of Toyota’s share price [7]. This ensures that executive pay is directly linked to the company’s financial performance and market conditions. For instance, if the company achieves higher operating income or maintains stable share prices, this can positively influence the amount of performance-linked remuneration [11]. \n\nMoreover, the **volatility of Toyota’s share price** serves as a key indicator for evaluating corporate value from the perspective of shareholders and investors. This metric is used to assess how well the company is performing in the stock market, which in turn influences executive compensation [5]. By tying remuneration to such indicators, Toyota ensures that executives are incentivized to make decisions that enhance shareholder value over the medium to long term.\n\nIn addition, **individual performance evaluations** play a crucial role in determining the amount of performance-based remuneration. These evaluations are qualitative assessments of each director’s contributions, ensuring that personal accountability and effort are recognized within the compensation framework [5]. This approach not only reinforces a culture of responsibility but also aligns individual goals with the broader strategic objectives of the company.\n\n![Consolidated operating income, volatility of Toyota’s share price, and individual performance evaluation are key factors in Toyota's executive remuneration system](image5)\n\nThe **consolidated operating income** is a primary indicator used to evaluate Toyota’s efforts based on business performance. It reflects the company’s ability to generate profit and sustain growth. The target for this metric is set at 1 trillion yen, and the current fiscal year’s result shows a 150% attainment rate, indicating strong performance [7]. This high level of achievement would likely contribute to higher performance-linked remuneration for executives.\n\nFurthermore, the **payout ratio**, which represents the percentage of earnings paid to shareholders in dividends, is another important factor in evaluating shareholder value. Toyota aims to maintain a consolidated payout ratio of 30%, ensuring that a significant portion of profits is returned to shareholders while still allowing for reinvestment in growth initiatives [9]. This balance between dividend payments and reinvestment is essential for sustaining long-term value for shareholders.\n\n![Toyota's financial data for five fiscal years, including dividend per share, total amount of payment, payout ratio, share repurchases, total shareholder return, and total return ratio](image1)\n\nIn conclusion, Toyota's executive remuneration evaluation reflects business performance and shareholder value indicators through a combination of financial metrics, market conditions, and individual performance assessments."}

However, more specific data is found in the image quotes.\n\nFrom **image2**, we get a detailed breakdown of consolidated employee benefit liabilities in thousands of dollars for the years 2020 and 2019:\n\n- **Current Liabilities:**\n  - Liability for annual leave: $2,848 (2020)\n  - Liability for long-service leave: $837 (2020)\n\n- **Non-Current Liabilities:**\n  - Liability for long-service leave: $407 (2020)\n\n- **Total employee benefit liabilities:** $4,092 (2020)\n\nThis indicates that the total employee benefit liabilities for 2020 were **$4,092,000**.\n\nRegarding **lease liabilities**, the relevant information comes from **image1**, which displays financial data related to lease liabilities for the year 2020. The table shows:\n\n- **Balance at 28 June 2020**: $167,154 (in thousands of dollars)\n- **Current lease liability**: $36,019 (in thousands of dollars)\n- **Non-current lease liability**: $131,135 (in thousands of dollars)\n\nThe total lease liabilities for 2020 are therefore **$167,154,000**.\n\n![Total lease liabilities for 2020 are $167,154,000.](image1)\n\n![Total employee benefit liabilities for 2020 are $4,092,000.](image2)\n\nThus, the total employee benefit liabilities and lease liabilities reported for 2020 are **$4,092,000** and **$167,154,000**, respectively."}

In 2020, the company recognized $25 million in restructuring charges, primarily for severance and benefit costs associated with the Embedded Processing business [11]. This was a significant increase from 2019, when there was a credit of $36 million due to the sale of a manufacturing facility in Greenock, Scotland [9]. The restructuring charges in 2020 were recorded as a charge, which directly reduced net income. Additionally, these charges were included in the operating profit calculation, further impacting the bottom line.\n\nIn the context of operating profit, the restructuring charges for 2020 were part of the expenses that reduced operating profit. For example, in the second quarter of 2020, restructuring charges/other amounted to $24 million, which contributed to a lower operating profit for that period [5]. In contrast, in 2019, there was a credit of $36 million from the sale of the Greenock facility, which would have increased operating profit. This difference highlights how restructuring charges can significantly affect the operating performance of a company.\n\n![Restructuring charges and their impact on financial statements](image4)"}

In 2018, the company reported comprehensive income of approximately $2.0 billion, which rose to $2.7 billion in 2019, and further increased to $6.3 billion in 2020. This growth was driven by several factors, including a substantial foreign currency translation gain in 2020 compared to a loss in 2019, higher net earnings, and a reduction in losses from cash flow hedge adjustments. Additionally, the pension and postretirement plan benefit adjustments contributed to the overall increase in comprehensive income, although these were offset by some negative impacts in certain years.\n\n![Comprehensive income increased significantly from 2018 to 2020, driven by higher net earnings and favorable changes in other comprehensive income.](image5)\n\nOne of the most notable contributors to the increase in comprehensive income in 2020 was the foreign currency translation gain of approximately $2.9 billion, which contrasted sharply with the $75 million loss recorded in 2019. This gain was largely due to the strengthening of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar, which positively impacted the value of Danaher's international operations. The company also experienced an improvement in its net earnings, which rose from $2.4 billion in 2019 to $3.6 billion in 2020, primarily due to increased sales, the acquisition of Cytiva, and the recognition of a pretax gain on the sale of product lines.\n\n![The foreign currency translation gain in 2020 was a major factor in the increase in comprehensive income.](image5)\n\nAnother important factor contributing to the change in comprehensive income was the reduction in losses from cash flow hedge adjustments. In 2020, the company recorded a loss of $72 million related to these adjustments, compared to a loss of $113 million in 2019. This improvement was due to more favorable hedging strategies and market conditions. However, the company also experienced a slight increase in losses from pension and postretirement plan benefit adjustments, which rose from $90 million in 2019 to $147 million in 2020. Despite this, the overall impact on comprehensive income remained positive.\n\n![The reduction in losses from cash flow hedge adjustments contributed to the increase in comprehensive income.](image5)\n\nIn addition to these factors, the company's strong performance in 2020 was supported by its continued investment in sales growth initiatives and the successful integration of acquired businesses, such as Cytiva. These efforts helped drive core sales growth of 6.5% and core sales growth including Cytiva of 9.5%, which contributed to the overall increase in net earnings and, consequently, comprehensive income.\n\n![The acquisition of Cytiva contributed to increased sales and net earnings, which in turn boosted comprehensive income.](image12)\n\nIn summary, the comprehensive income of Danaher Corporation increased significantly from 2018 to 2020, driven by a combination of higher net earnings, a substantial foreign currency translation gain, and improvements in other comprehensive income components."}

According to the data provided, the highest expenditure on a single project was ₹24.73 crore for a PAN India COVID relief project [7]. In contrast, rural development projects had varying amounts spent, with some projects costing as little as ₹0.04 crore [7]. For instance, in image2, the HRDP projects in Punjab had amounts spent of 0.86 crore, 0.81 crore, and 1.42 crore for projects 66, 67, and 68, respectively [2]. Similarly, image5 shows that the amount spent on HRDP projects ranged from 0.14 crore to 2.09 crore [5].\n\n![The table provides information about various rural development projects under the HRDP initiative.](image3)\n\nThe key differences in project implementation modes between COVID Relief projects and Rural Development Projects are also notable. While some projects are implemented directly by the organization, many are carried out through external agencies. For example, in image2, all HRDP projects were implemented through agencies such as Shramik Bharti and Centre for Advance Research and Development [2]. Similarly, in image7, several projects were implemented through agencies like Setu Charitable Trust, National Health and Education Society, and others [7]. In contrast, some projects, such as the 'HDFC Bank Employee Medical Support Services related to COVID-19' and 'COVID-19 pandemic Situation Employee Assistance Services for HDFC Bank Employees,' were directly managed by the organization [7].\n\n![The table provides information about various projects with details including the serial number, name of the project, item category from the list of activities in schedule VII of the Act, whether the project is in a local area, location details, amount spent on the project, mode of implementation (direct or through implementing agencies), and CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility) registration numbers.](image7)\n\nIn summary, while the amount spent on COVID Relief projects can be significantly higher, especially for large-scale initiatives, rural development projects often have a more varied budget.

According to the data, the company's net cash provided by operating activities was $9,415 million in 2018, $9,649 million in 2019, and $10,613 million in 2020. These figures indicate a consistent increase in cash flow from operations over the three-year period.\n\nIn terms of net income, PepsiCo reported $12,559 million in 2018, $7,353 million in 2019, and $7,175 million in 2020. This shows a significant decline in net income from 2018 to 2020, which is somewhat counterintuitive given the rise in operating cash flow. However, it's important to note that net income can be affected by various non-cash items and accounting adjustments, which may not directly correlate with cash flows.\n\nComprehensive income attributable to PepsiCo was $10,453 million in 2018, $8,133 million in 2019, and $5,944 million in 2020. This reflects a steady decrease in comprehensive income over the same period, which aligns with the trend observed in net income. The decline in comprehensive income could be attributed to factors such as changes in foreign exchange rates, pension obligations, and other comprehensive income items.\n\nOverall, while PepsiCo's net cash provided by operating activities increased from 2018 to 2020, its net income and comprehensive income attributable to PepsiCo decreased during the same period. This suggests that the company's cash flow from operations was not directly proportional to its profitability, which could be due to various factors such as changes in working capital, non-cash expenses, and other financial adjustments.\n\n![Net cash provided by operating activities increased from 2018 to 2020, while net income and comprehensive income attributable to PepsiCo decreased.](image4)"}

For instance, a 10% reduction in mortality rates for all beneficiaries would lead to an increase in the DBO by €110 million as of September 30, 2021 [4]. This demonstrates how sensitive the DBO is to changes in demographic assumptions.\n\nIn terms of financial assumptions, the table in image4 highlights the changes in actuarial gains and losses between 2021 and 2020. The total actuarial gains (–) and losses show a decrease from €67 million in 2020 to €-22 million in 2021, indicating that changes in financial assumptions had a negative impact on the DBO in 2021 compared to 2020 [4].\n\nMoreover, the table in image7 provides insights into the effects of changes in specific actuarial assumptions on the DBO. A half-percentage point change in the discount rate, compensation increase, and pension progression had varying impacts on the DBO. For example, a decrease in the discount rate led to an increase in the DBO by €271 million as of September 30, 2021 [7]. Similarly, changes in compensation increase and pension progression also affected the DBO, with increases in these assumptions leading to higher DBO values.\n\nRegarding plan assets, the table in image6 shows the distribution of plan assets as of September 30, 2021, and 2020. The total plan assets increased from €2,813 million in 2020 to €3,259 million in 2021. This increase can be attributed to various factors, including investment strategies and market conditions. However, the table does not explicitly mention the impact of actuarial assumptions on plan assets, but it is clear that changes in actuarial assumptions can influence the overall funded status of the pension plans.\n\n![The table provides detailed financial data related to defined benefit plans across different fiscal years, focusing on components such as the defined benefit obligation, the fair value of plan assets, and the effects of the asset ceiling.](image1)\n\n![The table shows actuarial gains and losses in millions of euros for fiscal years 2021 and 2020.](image4)\n\n![The table provides information about \"other liabilities\" in millions of euros (€) for the years 2021 and 2020, as of September 30.](image8)\n\nIn conclusion, changes in actuarial assumptions had a significant impact on the defined benefit obligation and plan assets from 2020 to 2021, with specific assumptions such as discount rates, compensation increases, and pension progression playing a crucial role in determining the DBO and the funded status of the pension plans."}

The U.S. segment experienced relatively stable performance, while the International Operated Markets faced more pronounced declines. \n\nFor the U.S. segment, total revenues remained largely unchanged, with a slight decrease of 2% in 2020 compared to 2019 [4]. This stability was likely supported by the company's focus on strategic marketing investments and promotional activities, which had a positive impact on comparable sales in the second half of 2020 [10]. Additionally, the U.S. segment benefited from the ability to maintain operations and adapt to changing consumer behaviors, such as the growth in delivery services. However, there were still challenges, including the need to support franchisees through incentives to accelerate recovery and drive growth, such as the free Thank You Meals served to first responders and healthcare workers [8].\n\nIn contrast, the International Operated Markets segment saw a much sharper decline, with a 17% decrease in total revenues in 2020 compared to 2019 [4]. This decline was primarily driven by the temporary closures of restaurants and limited operations due to the pandemic, particularly in key markets like the U.K., France, Germany, Italy, and Spain [12]. The segment also faced additional pressures from over $100 million in marketing support to accelerate recovery and drive growth, as well as higher restaurant closing costs and lower gains on sales of restaurant businesses [6]. These factors contributed to a 13% decrease in operating income for the International Operated Markets segment, reflecting the broader economic and operational challenges faced during the pandemic.\n\nThe revenue composition for both segments also shifted during this period. For the U.S., the mix of company-operated sales and franchised revenues remained relatively stable, with franchised revenues continuing to play a significant role in the company’s overall revenue stream [7]. However, the International Operated Markets segment saw a more substantial reduction in both company-operated and franchised revenues, with a 19% decrease in company-operated sales and a 14% decrease in franchised revenues in 2020 compared to 2019 [4]. This decline was exacerbated by the fact that the International Operated Markets segment is more heavily impacted by global economic conditions and local market dynamics, which were severely affected by the pandemic.\n\n![The bar chart shows restaurant margins by type in millions for the years 2018, 2019, and 2020, with franchised margins decreasing from $9,455 million in 2019 to $8,519 million in 2020, and company-operated margins decreasing from $1,660 million in 2019 to $1,158 million in 2020.](image1)\n\nThe changes in revenue composition and growth rates were further influenced by the company’s business model, which is heavily reliant on franchised operations. Franchised sales are not recorded as direct revenues but serve as the basis for calculating franchised revenues, which are a key component of McDonald's financial performance [1]. The decline in franchised sales in the International Operated Markets segment would have directly impacted the company’s ability to generate stable and predictable revenue, as most of its revenues are based on a percentage of franchisee sales [7]. This reliance on franchisee performance made the company more vulnerable to the economic disruptions caused by the pandemic.\n\nIn summary, the revenue composition and growth rates of McDonald's U.S. and International Operated Markets segments changed significantly from 2019 to 2020, with the U.S. segment showing relative resilience and the International Operated Markets segment experiencing a more severe decline. These changes were influenced by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, strategic marketing efforts, and the company’s reliance on franchised operations."}

Net income, which is the profit generated from operations, directly contributes to retained earnings, a key component of shareholders' equity. Additionally, comprehensive income includes other gains and losses that are not part of net income but still affect equity, such as foreign currency translation adjustments, changes in pension obligations, and cash flow hedges. These components collectively influence the overall equity position of the company.\n\nFor example, in fiscal 2020, Accenture reported a net income of $5,185,313, which contributed to an increase in retained earnings [6]. The comprehensive income for 2020 was $5,472,296, which included other comprehensive income of $278,740, further enhancing shareholders' equity [image2]. In contrast, 2019 saw a comprehensive income of $4,575,086, with other comprehensive income of $(264,406), indicating a decrease in some non-operational equity components [image2]. Similarly, in 2018, comprehensive income was $3,730,974, with other comprehensive income of $(481,387) [image2].\n\nThese figures illustrate how both net income and comprehensive income contribute to the changes in total shareholders' equity over the years.

In 2021, Wells Fargo announced the sale of its Wells Fargo Asset Management (WFAM) business, which was completed on November 1, 2021. This sale significantly affected the company's balance sheet, as it involved the transfer of substantial assets under management (AUM) and assets under administration (AUA). According to the data, at December 31, 2021, WFAM had AUM of $19 billion and AUA of $582 billion, which were transferred to the buyer as part of the transition services agreement [3]. The sale of WFAM also resulted in a net gain of $269 million, which contributed to the company's overall financial performance [7].\n\nThe impact of the sale on the balance sheet is further reflected in the changes in various asset categories. For instance, the table showing selected balance sheet data indicates that total assets decreased modestly in 2021, partly due to the timing of cash deployment by the investment portfolio near the end of the year [12]. Additionally, there was a decline in available-for-sale debt securities related to portfolio rebalancing to manage liquidity and interest rate risk [11]. These changes suggest that the sale of WFAM and the associated adjustments in asset management strategies influenced the composition of the balance sheet.\n\nMoreover, the table presenting \"WFAM assets under management\" highlights the significant movement in managed assets over the years. In 2021, the balance of WFAM assets under management at the beginning of the period was $603.0 billion, with inflows of $69.3 billion and outflows of $96.8 billion, resulting in a net change of $11.6 billion due to market impact. The sale of WFAM on November 1, 2021, had a major effect, with a reduction of $587.1 billion in the balance [5]. This substantial decrease in AUM reflects the immediate impact of the sale on the company's balance sheet, as the assets were no longer under Wells Fargo's management.\n\n![The table presents data on \"WFAM assets under management\" over three years, focusing on broken down categories and financial movements.](image5)\n\nIn summary, the changes in 'Total WFAM assets under management' led to significant adjustments in Wells Fargo's balance sheet in 2021, including a reduction in AUM and AUA, a net gain from the sale, and shifts in the composition of various asset categories."}

Initially, the company concentrated on establishing a strong presence in key markets such as Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, Malaysia, South Africa, the United Kingdom, France, and the United States. By 2020, Lovisa had expanded its footprint to include franchised stores in the Middle East, Vietnam, and other regions, demonstrating a shift towards leveraging franchise models to accelerate growth [9]. This evolution is supported by the data in image1, which shows an increase in the number of stores across various countries and regions from 250 in 2016 to 435 in 2020, indicating a steady expansion over the years.\n\nOne of the key achievements during this period was the successful opening of 47 stores outside of Australia, with specific counts for new stores in the UK, France, USA, and franchise stores [image2]. Additionally, Lovisa implemented a global rollout of in-store piercing services, enhancing customer loyalty and differentiating itself in the competitive fast fashion jewelry sector [11]. The company also focused on streamlining its supply chain, with over 56% of products moving through the China warehouse, which helped maintain operating speed and efficiency [image2].\n\nHowever, the expansion strategy also faced several challenges. The fast fashion jewelry sector is highly competitive, with relatively low barriers to entry, making it difficult for new entrants to replicate Lovisa's business model, design team, IT systems, store network, and brand recognition [2]. Additionally, the industry is subject to ever-changing customer preferences, requiring continuous product innovation and trend identification [6]. Lovisa addressed these challenges by employing a product team of more than 20 people who travel globally to identify trends and work closely with suppliers in Asia [6].\n\nAnother challenge was the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which affected FY20 revenue. Despite this, Lovisa continued to focus on its key drivers to deliver growth in sales and profit [4]. The company also faced risks related to exchange rates and supply chain disruptions, which were mitigated through strategies such as optimizing the supply base in Asia and exploring alternative distribution models [image2].\n\nIn summary, Lovisa's international store expansion strategy evolved from a focus on establishing a strong presence in key markets to leveraging franchise models and streamlining operations. Key achievements included the successful opening of new stores and the implementation of in-store services, while challenges such as competition, changing consumer preferences, and supply chain disruptions required continuous adaptation and innovation. ![The table outlines the business strategy for a company, focusing on different growth pillars, and is divided into five main sections: International expansion, Streamline global supply chain, Enhance existing store performance, Brand proliferation, and Lead and pre-empt trends.](image2)"}

The year 2020 had a total restructuring cost of $782 million, as indicated in the table [8]. This suggests a significant decrease in restructuring costs from 2020 to 2022.\n\nThe main components of these costs include employee separation costs, asset-related costs, and other restructuring-type charges. Employee separation costs relate to severance packages that are primarily voluntary, and the amounts calculated are based on salary levels and past service periods. Asset-related costs consist of both asset write-downs and accelerated depreciation, which are related to the establishment of a new fair value basis for assets held-for-sale or for disposal. Other restructuring-type charges primarily include asset removal and termination of contracts related to supply chain and overhead optimization.\n\n![The table shows financial data for the years ended June 30, across several categories.

For example, the table mentioned in the text quotes provides a detailed breakdown of average production prices and costs by geographic area and product type for the last three years [2]. This suggests that there was a comprehensive analysis of how these prices changed over time.\n\nThe data also shows that the average production prices for crude oil and NGL were calculated using sales quantities from the Corporation’s own production as the divisor [8].

Similarly, a $1 per tonne increase in the iron ore price impacts profit after taxation by $163 million and underlying EBITDA by $233 million [5].\n\nFor coal, the report indicates that lower prices and volumes have a direct negative effect on Underlying EBITDA. Specifically, Underlying EBITDA for Coal decreased by $1.3 billion to $288 million, including lower price impacts, net of price-linked costs, of US$0.7 billion [2]. Additionally, the average realised sales price for FY2021 was US$16,250 per tonne, which is higher than the FY2020 price of US$13,860 per tonne, but this was partially offset by lower average realised prices for metallurgical coal and LNG [7].\n\nThe key drivers behind these impacts include market volatility, global economic and geopolitical factors, industrial activity, supply and demand dynamics, and exchange rate fluctuations [4].

This aligns with quote [10], which notes that discount revenue increased 31 percent, primarily driven by an increase in consumer billed business of 29 percent, also reflecting recovery from the adverse impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic in the prior year.\n\nAdditionally, quote [6] mentions that discount revenue, our largest revenue line, increased 26 percent year-over-year, driven primarily by growth in Card Member spending. This growth in Card Member spending is further supported by quote [3], which indicates that worldwide network volumes for the year increased 24 percent compared to the prior year and reached 2019 levels. Billed business, which represented 85 percent of total network volumes and drives most of the financial results, increased 25 percent, showing different paces of recovery for G&S and T&E spend. The growth in G&S spend, which accounts for the majority of billed business, was driven by ongoing strong performance in online and card-not-present spending even as offline spending fully recovered and resumed growth compared to 2019 levels.\n\nThe data in image1 supports these claims, showing a significant increase in non-interest revenues, which include discount revenue, from $14,632 million in 2020 to $18,157 million in 2021, representing a 24% increase. This table provides a clear financial summary that corroborates the textual evidence of the growth in discount revenue. ![The table provides a financial summary for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, showing revenues, expenses, and pre-tax segment income in millions of dollars, except where percentages are indicated.](image1)\n\nIn summary, the discount revenue increased from 2020 to 2021 due to the recovery from the adverse impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, driven by increases in commercial and consumer billed business, as well as overall growth in network volumes and Card Member spending."}

According to the information provided, Shane Fallscheer’s remuneration is composed of 33% fixed and 67% at-risk components [3], while Chris Lauder’s remuneration is structured with 67% fixed and 33% at-risk components [3]. This difference reflects the distinct approaches taken by the company in aligning their compensation with performance and risk.\n\n![Shane Fallscheer has 33% of his remuneration as fixed and 67% as at-risk.](image3)\n\nIn addition to this, the long-term incentive plans (LTIPs) for both executives also show differences. For instance, Shane Fallscheer received a higher number of performance rights and options compared to Chris Lauder. In the FY18 LTIP, Shane was granted 1,308,901 rights valued at $500,000, whereas Chris was granted 337,553 rights valued at $160,000 [1]. Similarly, in the FY19 LTIP, Shane received 2,564,103 rights valued at $8,000,000, while Chris received 76,923 rights valued at $210,000 [1]. These figures highlight the disparity in the magnitude of incentives awarded to each executive.\n\n![The table presents data on \"Performance Rights/Options granted\" to two individuals, S Fallscheer and C Lauder, across different financial years and long-term incentive plans (LTIPs).](image1)\n\nFurthermore, the vesting profiles of their LTIPs indicate that Shane's grants were subject to certain conditions, such as the forfeiture of all rights in some cases. For example, in the FY18 LTIP, Shane's entire grant was forfeited, while Chris's grant was also fully forfeited [1]. However, in subsequent years, neither Shane nor Chris experienced any forfeiture of their grants, suggesting that the performance criteria were met in those periods.\n\n![The table outlines a performance-based incentive structure based on EBIT (Earnings Before Interest and Taxes) growth over a designated performance period.](image2)\n\nIn summary, the remuneration structure for Shane Fallscheer and Chris Lauder differs in terms of the percentage split between fixed and at-risk components, as well as the magnitude of their long-term incentives. Shane's remuneration is more heavily weighted towards at-risk components, while Chris's is more heavily weighted towards fixed components."}

According to the data, the total accumulated other comprehensive loss for 2020 was significantly impacted by these components. For instance, foreign currency translation adjustments, which are a key part of this account, were influenced by the exchange rates during the fiscal year.

To answer this, we need to look at the relevant financial data and understand how it reflects changes in comprehensive income.\n\nFrom the text quotes, we find that the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Costco, its wholly-owned subsidiaries, and subsidiaries in which it has a controlling interest. It also mentions that the Company reports noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities as a component of equity separate from the Company’s equity. This provides context for understanding how comprehensive income is reported and attributed [3].\n\nAdditionally, quote [11] explicitly references \"CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (amounts in millions),\" indicating that there is a specific section in the financial statements that details comprehensive income. While no direct numbers are provided in the text quotes, we can infer that comprehensive income includes both net income and other comprehensive income items, such as gains or losses on investments, foreign currency translation adjustments, and pension-related items.\n\nLooking at the image quotes, image5 provides a detailed breakdown of financial figures for the years 2022 and 2021. The table includes several sections with dollar amounts, which may represent components of comprehensive income. For example, the \"Total: $32,696\" for 2022 and \"Total: $29,505\" for 2021 could be cumulative financial indicators, potentially including comprehensive income. However, without explicit labels, it is challenging to confirm this definitively.\n\nAnother relevant image is image1, which describes a financial summary table showing figures for the years 2022, 2021, and 2020. The table includes values such as $10,203 for 2022, $11,258 for 2021, and $12,277 for 2020. These figures could represent net income or other financial metrics, but again, without clear labels, their exact relationship to comprehensive income is uncertain.\n\nDespite the lack of explicit numbers, the overall trend in comprehensive income can be inferred from the broader financial performance described in the text quotes. For instance, quote [1] discusses SG&A expenses and their impact on net income, which indirectly affects comprehensive income. Quote [2] mentions the reduction in sales due to rewards, which also impacts net income and, by extension, comprehensive income.\n\nBased on the available information, the trend in Comprehensive Income Attributable to Costco appears to show a slight decline from 2020 to 2021, followed by a modest increase in 2022. This is supported by the figures in image1, where the total for 2022 ($10,203) is lower than 2021 ($11,258), but higher than 2020 ($12,277). However, these figures may not directly represent comprehensive income, so further clarification would be needed for a precise analysis.\n\n![The table shows financial figures for the years 2022 and 2021, including various monetary values that could relate to comprehensive income.](image5)\n\nIn conclusion, the trend in Comprehensive Income Attributable to Costco over the three years presented appears to show a slight decline from 2020 to 2021, followed by a modest increase in 2022."}

This relationship is structured in a tiered manner, where different levels of EBIT growth correspond to varying percentages of incentives that can be exercised. For instance, if EBIT growth is less than the threshold, no percentage of the incentive is exercisable. As the EBIT growth increases, so does the percentage of incentives that become exercisable. Specifically, at 17.5% compound growth, 40% of incentives are awarded; at 20% compound growth, 60% are awarded; at 22.5% compound growth, 80% are awarded; and at 25% compound growth, 100% of incentives are awarded [3]. This structure ensures that executives and directors are rewarded proportionally to the company's performance, aligning their interests with those of the shareholders.\n\n![The table outlines a performance-based incentive structure based on EBIT (Earnings Before Interest and Taxes) growth over a designated performance period.

This demonstrates that the higher the EBIT growth, the greater the percentage of incentives that can be exercised, reinforcing the company's commitment to rewarding performance.\n\n![The table outlines the relationship between Earnings Per Share (EPS) growth over a performance period and the percentage of an award or benefit that is exercisable.

In 2020, the company reported a net loss of $5,561 million, whereas in 2021, it recorded a net income of $15,689 million [4]. This marked a dramatic turnaround, driven by several key financial activities. The improvement was primarily attributed to higher upstream realizations, improved downstream margins, and the absence of 2020 impairments and write-offs [11]. These factors contributed to a much stronger financial performance in 2021 compared to the previous year.\n\nIn addition to net income, Chevron's comprehensive income also increased significantly. In 2020, the company experienced a comprehensive loss, while in 2021, it recorded a comprehensive income of $17,412 million [8]. This increase was influenced by various components, including currency translation adjustments, unrealized holding gains on securities, and derivatives. Notably, there was a positive other comprehensive gain, net of tax, in 2021, which further contributed to the overall increase in comprehensive income [8].\n\nThe company's financial activities during this period were also reflected in its cash flow statements. For instance, the net cash provided by operating activities increased substantially, from $10,577 million in 2020 to $29,187 million in 2021 [image1].

However, the long-term retention rate, measured by employees who returned to work after leave and were still employed after 12 months, shows a lower percentage for females (6%) compared to males (4%). This suggests that although many women return to work after parental leave, they may face challenges in maintaining their employment over the longer term.\n\nThese statistics reflect on the gender diversity policies in the workplace. The Bank has initiatives aimed at promoting gender diversity, such as the Careers 2.0 program, which helps skilled women professionals transition back to work after a break due to family or personal reasons [5]. Additionally, the Bank has set a target to increase the representation of women in its workforce to 25% by FY25 [5]. These efforts indicate a commitment to creating an inclusive work environment that supports women's career progression.\n\n![Parental leave data](image5)"}

According to the data in the text quotes and the tables, we can determine how the total net expense changed from 2016 to 2018.\n\nFrom the text quote [7], it is mentioned that the year-on-year pension and post retirement net periodic benefit non-service costs increased by $55 million and $68 million for the years 2018 and 2017, respectively. These increases were primarily due to an increase in the net actuarial amortization expense. This indicates a rising trend in non-service costs over these years.\n\nLooking at the table in image7, which provides data on interest expense, interest income, and pension and postretirement net periodic benefit cost (benefit), we can calculate the total net expense for each year:\n\n- **2018**:\n  - Interest expense: $350 million\n  - Interest income: $(70) million\n  - Pension and postretirement net periodic benefit cost (benefit): $(73) million\n  - Total net expense: $207 million\n\n- **2017**:\n  - Interest expense: $322 million\n  - Interest income: $(50) million\n  - Pension and postretirement net periodic benefit cost (benefit): $(128) million\n  - Total net expense: $144 million\n\n- **2016**:\n  - Interest expense: $199 million\n  - Interest income: $(29) million\n  - Pension and postretirement net periodic benefit cost (benefit): $(196) million\n  - Total net expense: $(26) million\n\nFrom this data, we can see that the total net expense increased significantly from 2016 to 2018. In 2016, the total net expense was a negative value of $26 million, indicating a net benefit. However, by 2018, the total net expense had risen to $207 million, showing a substantial increase in expenses compared to the previous years.\n\n![Total net expense increased from $26 million in 2016 to $207 million in 2018.](image7)\n\nThe total net expense increased from 2016 to 2018."}

This increase was primarily driven by the reduction of financing receivables due to sales of receivables [10]. The specific figures show that in 2020, net cash provided by operating activities was $18,197 million, while in 2019 it was $14,770 million [image1].\n\nFor **investing activities**, the net cash used decreased by $23,908 million in 2020 compared to 2019. This decrease was largely due to a reduction in cash used for acquisitions, particularly because of the Red Hat acquisition in the prior year, and a wind down of OEM IT commercial financing operations [9]. The data from the table shows that in 2020, net cash used in investing activities was $(3,028) million, while in 2019 it was $(26,936) million [image1].\n\nFor **financing activities**, there was a net use of cash of $9,721 million in 2020, compared to a net source of cash of $9,042 million in 2019. The year-to-year change of $18,763 million was driven by various factors, including the payment of dividends and the impact of tax relief programs [2].

One key factor is the company's strategy of store optimisation, which involved both openings and refurbishments. In 2021, Inditex opened 226 stores and completed 130 refurbishments, including 57 enlargements [1]. This suggests a focus on improving existing stores and expanding into new markets. Additionally, the company absorbed 578 stores in 2021, indicating a strategic move to streamline operations and improve efficiency [1].\n\nAnother factor could be the impact of the pandemic, which significantly affected the majority of markets where the Group operated in 2020. The pandemic led to lockdown measures and restricted mobility, resulting in up to 90% of stores being closed in the first quarter of 2020 [11]. This likely influenced the company's decision to focus on streamlining operations and adapting to changing market conditions, which may have contributed to the changes in geographical distribution observed in 2021 and 2022.\n\nIn summary, the geographical distribution of stores for Inditex changed from 2021 to 2022, with an increase in the number of stores across all regions.

This was influenced by record volumes achieved at certain operations, such as WAIO, but these gains were offset by natural field declines, impacts from acquisitions, and adverse weather events. Despite this, the overall effect of volume changes was relatively minor compared to the impact of price changes [8].\n\nIn summary, the increase in sales prices had a substantial positive effect on Underlying EBITDA, while the impact of volume changes was more modest and slightly negative. The combined effect of these factors contributed to the significant growth in Underlying EBITDA from US$22,071 million in 2020 to US$37,379 million in 2021.\n\n![The table details the various factors contributing to a significant increase in EBITDA over the year, with major contributions from sales prices and strategic cost management, offset by negative impacts from exchange rates and inflation.](image8)"}

In 2020, the gross margin percentage was 11.20%, which dropped to 11.13% in 2021 and further declined to 10.48% in 2022 [8]. This downward trend reflects the impact of several key factors, including inflation, changes in merchandise costs, and shifts in sales mix.\n\nInflation played a significant role in the decline of the gross margin percentage. Merchandise costs in 2022 were impacted by higher inflation than in recent years, which affected both net sales and gross margin. The company's merchandising and pricing strategies, such as working with suppliers to absorb cost increases, purchasing earlier and in greater volumes, and passing cost increases on to members, influenced the gross margin. However, these strategies also included reducing prices on merchandise to drive sales or meet competition, which negatively impacted gross margin [10].\n\nAdditionally, the core merchandise categories experienced a decrease in gross margin percentage, primarily due to declines in fresh foods and foods and sundries. A LIFO charge for higher merchandise costs also contributed to the decline. On the other hand, warehouse ancillary and other businesses positively impacted gross margin, particularly through gasoline sales, although this was partially offset by e-commerce [5].\n\nChanges in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar also had a negative impact on gross margin, especially for the company's Other International operations [5]. The overall effect of these factors led to a reduction in the gross margin percentage from 2020 to 2022.\n\n![Gross margin percentage decreased from 11.20% in 2020 to 10.48% in 2022, reflecting the impact of inflation, merchandise costs, and shifts in sales mix.](image8)"}

Additionally, the text mentions that net interest income in 2021 included interest income from PPP loans of $518 million and interest income associated with loans purchased from GNMA loan securitization pools of $1.1 billion [5]. However, the image quotes provide more detailed figures. For instance, image3 shows that net interest income was $4,960 million in 2021, down from $6,134 million in 2020, indicating a significant decline [3]. This aligns with the text's explanation of the decrease being driven by lower loan balances and the impact of lower interest rates.\n\n![Net interest income decreased from $6,134 million in 2020 to $4,960 million in 2021.](image3)\n\n**Total Loans:**  \nThe text quotes indicate that total loans (average) decreased in 2021, driven by lower loan demand, including lower line utilization, and higher paydowns, reflecting continued high levels of client liquidity and strength in the capital markets [2].

Consumer nonaccrual loans, on the other hand, increased from $3.9 billion in 2020 to $4.8 billion in 2021 [3]. This indicates that while commercial loans saw a notable decrease, consumer loans experienced an increase. \n\nLooking at the image data, image2 provides a detailed breakdown of nonaccrual loans by sector. The table shows that for December 31, 2021, nonaccrual loans totaled $1,128 million, compared to $2,957 million for December 31, 2020. This represents a significant decline of over $1.8 billion.

These benefits are part of the long-term incentive (LTI) compensation structure, which is designed to align the interests of executives with those of shareholders.\n\nAccording to the information provided, the S-SARs and RSUs are allocated individually at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee [9]. The mix of S-SARs and RSUs is determined annually, with specific options available for the composition of these incentives. For example, one of the choices includes 80% S-SARs and 20% RSUs [3], while another option is 50% S-SARs and 50% RSUs [3]. This flexibility allows the Remuneration Committee to tailor the compensation packages based on individual performance and strategic considerations.\n\nThe structure of the compensation is outlined in detail in the tables and descriptions provided. For instance, the table in image1 shows that the mix of S-SARs and RSUs is fixed at 80% S-SARs and 20% RSUs, with the base for calculation being the individual target value of the total LTI for CEC members, which is 133.33% of a base pay measured on January 1st of a year [image1]. Both S-SARs and RSUs have a vesting period of 4 years, and S-SARs can be exercised within 10 years of the grant date [image1].\n\nIn addition to the CEC, the Board of Directors (BoD) also receives S-SARs and RSUs as part of their remuneration. However, the specific details of their compensation may differ. For example, the BoD Chairman (C) receives base pay, bonus, and pension, while the CEC receives base pay, bonus, S-SARs, RSUs, and pension [image2]. The Remuneration Committee decides on these components, and the Annual General Meeting (AGM) approves the final remuneration decisions [image2].\n\nThe distribution of S-SARs and RSUs is also influenced by the company's broader compensation strategy, which includes market comparisons and external consulting. The Remuneration Committee tracks market data on salaries at other leading global pharmaceutical companies and major Swiss companies, and this information is used to ensure competitive and fair compensation [3]. The external consulting firm PwC assists the Remuneration Committee in performing these market comparisons and advising on remuneration decisions [3].\n\nOverall, the beneficiaries of S-SARs and RSUs include both the Board of Directors and the Corporate Executive Committee, with the latter receiving a more significant portion of their compensation in the form of these long-term incentives.

Vijayan***) has \"NA\" marked, suggesting data is not available or applicable.\n- **Attendance at last AGM**: Shows whether each director attended the last AGM, with responses being \"Yes,\" \"No,\" or \"NA\" (not applicable or not available for some directors).\n\nFrom this information, we can infer that some directors attended a significant number of meetings, while others attended fewer. This suggests that their level of involvement in the company's affairs varied, with some directors being more active than others.\n\nIn conclusion, the number of meetings each director attended varies, with some directors attending a significant number of meetings and others attending fewer. This indicates that their level of involvement in the company's affairs varied, with some directors being more active than others."}

According to the data, net cash used in investing activities was approximately $1.2 billion in 2019 and increased dramatically to $21.2 billion in 2020. While specific figures for 2018 are not provided in the text quotes, the overall pattern indicates a sharp rise in investing activity during 2020, likely driven by major acquisitions such as the Cytiva Acquisition.\n\nIn comparison, total operating cash flows for the same period show a different trend. Operating cash flows from continuing operations were approximately $3.657 billion in 2019 and increased to $6.215 billion in 2020. This represents a substantial growth in operating cash flows, which contrasts with the large increase in net cash used in investing activities. The company's operating cash flows were sufficient to support its investing activities, but the scale of the investments made in 2020 far exceeded the operating cash flow generated.\n\n![Net cash used in investing activities increased significantly from 2019 to 2020, while operating cash flows also grew but at a much smaller scale.](image4)"}

However, this information alone does not provide the weighted-average grant date fair value. \n\nTo find the weighted-average grant date fair value, we turn to the image quote [image1], which provides a detailed table about the changes in restricted stock units (RSUs) for a company over a one-year period, from September 27, 2020, to September 26, 2021.

{"q_id": 961, "model": "qwen3-30b-a3b", "in_tok": 5279, "out_tok": 380, "total_tok": 5659, "response": "The deferred tax assets and liabilities of the company have undergone notable changes between 2021 and 2022, reflecting shifts in various tax-related components. For deferred tax assets, the total decreased from $4,564 million in 2021 to $4,091 million in 2022. This decline is primarily attributed to reductions in several categories, such as loss carryforwards, pension and retiree benefits, and capitalized research & development. However, some components like accrued marketing and promotion remained relatively stable, while others, such as stock-based compensation, showed no change. The valuation allowances also decreased, indicating a potential improvement in the likelihood of realizing these deferred tax assets. \n\nOn the other hand, deferred tax liabilities increased from $8,503 million in 2021 to $9,288 million in 2022. This increase is driven by higher amounts in categories such as goodwill and intangible assets, fixed assets, and foreign withholding taxes on earnings to be repatriated. These increases suggest that the company has more future tax obligations due to the timing differences between financial reporting and tax reporting.\n\n![The total deferred tax assets decreased from $4,564 million in 2021 to $4,091 million in 2022, while deferred tax liabilities increased from $8,503 million to $9,288 million.](image6)\n\nThese changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities can significantly impact the company's financial position. A decrease in deferred tax assets may indicate reduced future tax benefits, potentially affecting profitability. Conversely, an increase in deferred tax liabilities suggests higher future tax obligations, which could reduce net income and equity. Overall, the changes reflect the dynamic nature of the company's tax environment and its implications for financial health."}

The exact number of shares that vest may also be adjusted by the ratio of the actual Non-GAAP OI to the AOP OI Objective, up to a maximum of 125% [2].\n\nFor example, if the 2019 OI is 90% or more of the 2019 AOP OI Objective, the number of Shares that shall be received with regard to the First Tranche 2019 Performance Share Units on the applicable vesting date shall be equal to the product of: (1) the number of First Tranche 2019 Performance Share Units; and (2) the ratio of the 2019 OI to the 2019 AOP OI Objective, up to a maximum of 125% [2].\n\nIn summary, the conditions for restricted share units vesting over the first three years are tied to the Business Unit's performance against its Non-GAAP OI objectives, with vesting occurring only if the actual performance meets or exceeds 85% of the planned objective for each year."}

Image4, on the other hand, reports net revenues of $10,702 million in 2020, which is a 9.0% increase from $9,817 million in 2019. These discrepancies suggest that the European Union's net revenue may vary depending on the specific segment or region being analyzed.\n\nGiven the information provided, it is clear that PMI's net revenue for the European Union in 2020 was affected by various factors, including changes in shipment volumes and market dynamics.

According to text quote [7], \"Latino voters’ party affiliation little changed in recent years.\" This is supported by image quote [6], which shows that among Latino registered voters, 53% say they would vote for or are leaning toward the Democratic candidate for the U.S. House of Representatives, compared with 28% who say they would vote for the Republican candidate. This suggests a consistent preference for the Democratic Party.\n\nHowever, there is also evidence of some shifts in the importance of issues affecting their voting decisions. For instance, text quote [8] notes that \"abortion has risen the most in importance as a voting issue among Hispanics in recent months,\" with nearly six-in-ten Hispanic voters (57%) saying it is very important, up from 42% in March. This shift could influence how Latino voters perceive the differences between the two parties, especially as abortion becomes a more prominent issue.\n\nImage quote [3] provides further insight into this dynamic. It states that \"77% of Latino registered voters are dissatisfied with the way things are going in the country\" and that \"54% disapprove of the way Joe Biden is handling his job as president.\" These sentiments may contribute to a perception that the parties are not addressing key concerns, even though the overall alignment with the Democratic Party remains strong.\n\nImage quote [1] offers a visual representation of the preferences of different voter demographic groups, including Latino registered voters. The bar chart shows that 53% of Latino registered voters favor the Democratic candidate, while 28% favor the Republican candidate. This aligns with the text quotes and reinforces the idea that the majority of Latino voters lean toward the Democratic Party.\n\nImage quote [4] adds another layer to this discussion by highlighting that \"a 2021 Pew Research Center study of Americans’ political views found substantial shares of Latino voters fell into groups with soft ties to the political parties.\" This suggests that while many Latino voters align with the Democratic Party, there is still a significant portion of the population that is not strongly committed to either party.\n\nImage quote [8] also provides data on the perceived importance of abortion as a voting issue among Hispanics, showing a significant increase in its importance. This shift could influence how Latino voters view the differences between the parties, particularly if one party is seen as more supportive of their values on this issue.\n\nIn addition, image quote [2] highlights that \"among Latino registered voters in 2022, 80% say the economy is a very important issue when deciding who to vote for in the upcoming congressional midterm elections.\" This indicates that economic concerns remain a top priority for Latino voters, which could affect their perceptions of the parties' ability to address these issues.\n\nImage quote [5] further supports this by noting that \"about half of Latino voters say they plan to vote for the Democratic candidate in their district’s election for the U.S. House of Representatives.\" This again underscores the consistent preference for the Democratic Party among Latino voters.\n\nFinally, image quote [7] provides a visual representation of survey results about whether Trump should remain a national political figure. The data shows that a clear majority of Latino voters (73%) do not want former President Donald Trump to remain a national political figure. This sentiment could influence how Latino voters perceive the differences between the parties, particularly if they see the Republican Party as being closely associated with Trump's policies and rhetoric.\n\n![Latino registered voters prefer the Democratic Party, with 53% favoring Democratic candidates and 28% favoring Republican candidates.](image1) \n\nIn conclusion, the alignment of Latino registered voters with the Democratic and Republican parties has remained relatively stable over recent years, with a consistent preference for the Democratic Party. However, shifts in the importance of issues such as abortion and economic concerns could influence how Latino voters perceive the differences between the parties."}

To answer this, we need to analyze the relevant data from both the text quotes and image quotes.\n\nFrom the text quotes, we learn that among college-educated workers who majored in a health professions field, 69% of women and 61% of men work in a health-related occupation [1]. This is one of the most significant categories, as health professions degrees are heavily dominated by women. Additionally, it's mentioned that 81% of college-educated workers who majored in a health professions field are female [11], which suggests that the majority of those in this category are women. However, the exact number of women and men who majored in other STEM fields and are employed in their respective fields is not directly provided in the text.\n\nLooking at the image quotes, image1 provides a detailed breakdown of employment sectors for men and women with different STEM degrees. For instance, the chart shows that 61% of men and 69% of women with a health professions degree work in jobs in the field of their degree [1]. While the image does not provide a direct comparison across all STEM fields, it offers insights into how employment distribution varies by gender and degree type.\n\nTo calculate the percentage difference, we would need to aggregate the percentages of women and men employed in their respective fields across all STEM disciplines. Based on the information provided, the highest disparity is seen in the health professions field, where 69% of women and 61% of men are employed in their field. If we assume similar patterns for other STEM fields, the overall percentage difference would likely be influenced by the dominance of women in health professions and the lower retention rates of women in fields like engineering and computer science [11].\n\nGiven the data from image1 and the context provided in the text quotes, we can infer that the percentage difference between women and men employed in their field of study is significant, particularly due to the higher retention rate of women in health professions. However, without specific aggregated data across all STEM fields, we cannot provide an exact percentage difference.\n\n![The image shows a stacked bar chart comparing the employment sectors of men and women with different STEM degrees, highlighting that 61% of men and 69% of women with a health professions degree work in jobs in the field of their degree.](image1)"}

To answer this, we need to analyze both text and image quotes.\n\nFrom the text quotes, we see that there is a clear partisan divide on how Americans view the impact of the coronavirus on U.S. international influence. Specifically, **Republicans are about twice as likely as Democrats to believe the U.S.’s international influence will be strengthened as a result of the crisis**, while **Democrats are about four times more likely than Republicans to expect American influence to weaken after the outbreak** [7]. Additionally, it is noted that **liberal Democrats are 20 percentage points more likely than conservatives and moderates within the party to foresee the decline of U.S. international influence** [7]. This suggests that among Democrats, those with more liberal views are more likely to believe that the U.S. will have less influence after the pandemic.\n\nFurther evidence from the text indicates that **about 50% of Americans believe China will have less influence in world affairs after the pandemic**, and **liberal Democrats stand apart for their bleak assessment of how the pandemic will affect America’s standing on the global stage**, with **56% believing the U.S. will have less influence in world affairs** [12].\n\nNow, looking at the image quotes, specifically **image4**, which provides detailed survey results on perceptions of U.S. influence, we can see that **among political affiliations, Rep/Lean Rep (Republicans and leaning Republicans) have the highest proportion of people who believe the U.S. will have less influence**. The data shows that **63% of Rep/Lean Rep believe the U.S. will have less influence**, compared to **40% of Dem/Lean Dem** [4].\n\nAnother relevant image is **image8**, which also shows that **Republicans and leaning Republicans have the highest proportion of people who believe the U.S. will have less influence**. The chart indicates that **24% of Democrats and leaning Democrats believe the U.S. will have less influence**, while **24% of Republicans and leaning Republicans also believe this**. However, when we look at the specific breakdown of **Conservative Republicans**, it becomes clear that they are even more likely to hold this view, with **70% of Conservative Republicans believing the U.S. will have less influence** [4].\n\nIn summary, based on the evidence from both text and image quotes, the group in the United States with the highest proportion of people who believe that the U.S. will have less influence in world affairs after the coronavirus outbreak compared to before the outbreak is **Conservative Republicans**.\n\n![Conservative Republicans are the most likely to believe the U.S. will have less influence in world affairs after the coronavirus outbreak](image4)"}

For instance, 50% of women in STEM jobs say they have experienced at least one form of gender-related discrimination, compared to only 19% of men in STEM positions [2]. This disparity is even more pronounced in specific subgroups, such as women in computer jobs, where 74% report experiencing discrimination, compared to 50% of all women in STEM jobs [6].\n\nThe most common forms of gender discrimination reported by women in STEM include earning less than a man doing the same job (29%), being treated as if they are not competent (29%), experiencing repeated, small slights (20%), and receiving less support from senior leaders (18%) [2]. These issues are exacerbated in male-dominated workplaces, where 78% of women report experiencing gender-related discrimination, compared to 44% in workplaces with more women or an even gender mix [3].\n\nIn addition to these direct experiences of discrimination, women in STEM also face challenges related to perceptions of fairness and opportunities for advancement. For example, 48% of women in male-dominated workplaces believe their gender has made it harder to succeed, compared to 12% in majority-female workplaces [12]. Furthermore, women in STEM are less likely to believe that women are usually treated fairly when it comes to promotions [3].\n\n![Women in STEM are more likely to experience gender discrimination compared to men in STEM.](image3) \n\nThese findings highlight the persistent gender disparities in STEM fields, particularly for women in certain roles and environments.

To answer this, we need to focus on the relevant data from the text quotes and image quotes.\n\nFrom the text quotes, we find that:\n\n- **Quote [10]** states that a majority of Americans (56%) anticipate that most vehicles will be autonomous in the next 10 to 49 years. It also mentions that roughly one-in-ten (9%) expect that most vehicles will be autonomous in fewer than 10 years, but a comparable share (8%) expects that this outcome will never happen. This implies that the remaining percentage—those who think it will take more than 50 years—would be part of the \"never happen\" group or those who are uncertain.\n\n- **Quote [7]** and **[9]** both indicate that roughly two-thirds of Americans expect most cars to be driverless in the next half century, which is 50 years. However, these quotes do not directly address the percentage of people who believe it will take more than 50 years.\n\n- **Quote [11]** adds that 9% of Americans predict that most vehicles will be driverless in the next 10 years, and 64% believe it will happen in the next 10 to 49 years. The remaining percentage, which includes those who think it will take more than 50 years or that it will never happen, is not explicitly stated.\n\nNow, looking at the image quotes, **image7** provides a clear breakdown of how U.S. adults perceive the timeline for most vehicles becoming driverless. The image shows:\n\n- 9% believe it will take less than 10 years.\n- 56% believe it will take 10 to less than 50 years.\n- 23% believe it will take 50 to less than 100 years.\n- 5% believe it will take 100+ years.\n- 8% believe it will never happen.\n\nFrom this, the percentage of U.S. adults who say it will take more than 50 years for most vehicles on the road to be driverless is 23% (for 50 to less than 100 years) plus 5% (for 100+ years), totaling **28%**.\n\n![The image shows the percentage of U.S. adults who believe it will take different amounts of time for most vehicles to be driverless.](image7)"}

This trend is consistent across various demographic groups, emphasizing the role of both political affiliation and race in shaping opinions on the pace of lifting restrictions.\n\n![The image shows a horizontal bar chart comparing opinions on reopening stores, schools, and workplaces amidst the coronavirus pandemic.

According to the text quotes, there is a clear trend in how individuals with Hispanic ancestry perceive their neighborhood's Hispanic identity, which changes as they move further from their immigrant roots.\n\nFor instance, quote [11] states that 39% of self-identified Hispanics say that \"all\" (10%) or \"most\" (30%) of their neighbors are Hispanics. This suggests that a significant portion of self-identified Hispanics feel that their neighborhoods are predominantly Hispanic. However, this percentage decreases for self-identified non-Hispanics with Hispanic ancestry, with only 17% saying the same, indicating that non-Hispanics with Hispanic heritage are more dispersed across the country than their Hispanic counterparts.\n\nThis pattern is further supported by image4, which shows that among self-identified Hispanics, the percentage of those who believe \"All/Most\" people share similar views decreases with each generation. Specifically, 39% of all self-identified Hispanics believe \"All/Most\" people share similar views, while this drops to 30% among third or higher generation individuals. In contrast, 57% of all self-identified Hispanics believe \"Some/Only a few\" people share similar views, and this increases to 64% among third or higher generation individuals. The chart also reveals that foreign-born and second-generation individuals are more likely to believe \"All/Most\" people share similar views compared to third or higher generation individuals.\n\nAdditionally, image3 provides data on the identification of Hispanic backgrounds, showing that 70% of overall self-identified Hispanics identify as such, but this drops significantly to 26% among third or higher generation individuals. This suggests that as generations progress, the sense of connection to Hispanic identity may weaken, potentially affecting perceptions of neighborhood Hispanic identity.\n\nIn summary, perceptions of neighborhood Hispanic identity among self-identified Hispanics tend to decrease across generations, with earlier generations being more likely to believe that their neighborhoods are predominantly Hispanic. This trend is reflected in both the textual and visual evidence provided.\n\n![Perceptions of neighborhood Hispanic identity vary across generations of self-identified Hispanics.](image4)"}

According to the text, the supply of venture capital started to dry out only after 2004, leading to a dramatic shift in the market dynamics [5]. This scarcity of VC money not only resulted in lower entry valuations but also increased capital efficiency and yield because investors became more selective [10]. Furthermore, the text mentions that the post-bubble vintages (starting from 2004/2005) showed strong performance, with an exit boom starting around 2005 that drove up demand [8].\n\nThe chart in image2 provides a visual representation of these trends. It shows a line graph illustrating the relationship between the supply of capital and demand in the venture capital market from 2000 to 2010.

According to the data, the percentage of people identifying as Independents grew from a net of 33% in 1994 to 38% in 2018 [9]. This increase suggests a shift in the political landscape, where more individuals are choosing to distance themselves from traditional partisan labels. However, this growth does not necessarily mean that these Independents are entirely unaffiliated or free from political leanings. In fact, many of them still lean toward one of the major parties. For instance, in 2018, 17% of Independents leaned Democrat, 13% leaned Republican, and only 7% had no partisan leaning [9].

While there were fluctuations during the Bush and Obama administrations, the overall trajectory points to a steady increase in the number of people identifying as Independents.

This trend is reflected in various aspects such as language, cultural practices, social networks, and self-identification.\n\nFor instance, the data shows that foreign-born Hispanics are more likely to often self-identify as Hispanic (57%) compared to second-generation (50%) and third or higher generation (33%) Hispanics [image1]. Additionally, a larger proportion of foreign-born Hispanics feel connected to their country of origin (82%) than second-generation (69%) or third or higher generation (44%) Hispanics [9]. These findings suggest that as generations progress, the connection to the ancestral homeland diminishes.\n\nFurthermore, the chart indicates that among self-identified Hispanics, those who are foreign-born are more likely to speak Spanish (41%) compared to second-generation (15%) and third or higher generation (7%) Hispanics [image8]. Similarly, the percentage of self-identified Hispanics with a Spanish last name decreases across generations, from 20% for the foreign-born to 8% for the second generation and 7% for the third or higher generation [image8].\n\nIn contrast, non-Hispanics, particularly those from higher generations, are less likely to identify as Hispanic.

For example, the percentage of Democrats with an unfavorable view of the Republican Party increased from 59% in 1994 to 88% in 2018, while Lean Democrats saw their unfavorable views rise from around 48% to 84%. Similarly, Republicans' unfavorable views of the Democratic Party grew from 77% in 1994 to 87% in 2018, and Lean Republicans experienced a similar increase from 64% to 81%.

The red line representing this group starts at 54% in 2008 and rises to 64% in 2020. This increase suggests a growing alignment with the Republican Party, which may have contributed to shifting perceptions of the U.S. economy. In contrast, the blue line for Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents shows a more stable trend, starting at 43% in 2008 and reaching 44% in 2020.

According to text quote [6], while 54% of Democrats believed the U.S. was the leading global economy in March, this dropped to 44% by the time the survey was conducted. This decline reflects a growing skepticism among Democrats about the U.S. economic position, possibly influenced by the economic challenges faced during the pandemic and the contrasting economic performance of China.\n\nFor Republicans, the perception of the U.S. as the leading economic power has remained more stable. However, there is evidence of a shift in their views towards China. Text quote [11] indicates that negative views toward China among Republicans increased by 11 percentage points over four months, suggesting a growing concern about China's economic influence. This shift may have indirectly affected perceptions of the U.S. economic position, as Republicans tend to favor a tougher stance on China.\n\nAdditionally, the overall public opinion on U.S. economic and trade policy toward China has shifted over the years, as shown in image4. The \"Get tougher with China\" trend (blue line) increased from 40% in 2011 to 46% in 2020, indicating a growing preference for a more assertive approach.

However, by 1880, it had surged to 8,267, and by 1890, it reached its peak at 14,096 [2]. This rapid growth was largely due to the influx of pioneers, many of whom came from states like Missouri, Iowa, Illinois, Ohio, and the New England States, as well as later immigrants from Germany, Sweden, England, and Russia [2]. The establishment of rural school districts also reflected this growing population [1].\n\nBy 1900, the population had slightly declined to 13,330, and it continued to fluctuate over the following decades.

These sources highlight the significant differences between political groups, particularly between Republicans and Democrats.\n\nAccording to the text quotes, a majority of Republicans believe that Obama’s approach to foreign policy is not tough enough. Specifically, 84% of Republicans hold this view [5], while 61% of independents share this sentiment [5]. In contrast, most Democrats view Obama's approach as about right, with 58% of all Democrats holding this opinion [3]. However, there are variations within the Democratic Party: conservative and moderate Democrats are more likely to think Obama is not tough enough (45%), whereas liberal Democrats are more inclined to believe his approach is appropriate (69%) [3].\n\nThe data also reveals that the perception of Obama being \"not tough enough\" has increased over time. The percentage of the public saying this has risen from 53% in July to 58% currently [6]. This trend is consistent across different political groups, but it is most pronounced among Republicans, where the percentage has consistently been higher than among other groups.\n\nLooking at the image quotes, image1 provides a visual representation of trends in support or affiliation for different political groups over time. While the specific data points are not directly related to Obama's foreign policy, the overall trend shows a decline in support for Republicans and Independents, which may reflect broader sentiments toward the administration's policies. Image6 further supports this by showing an increase in the percentage of people who believe something is \"not tough enough,\" which aligns with the growing concern about Obama's foreign policy approach.\n\nAdditionally, image5 illustrates rising concerns about Islamic extremism, which could be linked to perceptions of Obama's foreign policy. Republicans show the highest levels of concern both globally and domestically, which may contribute to their perception that Obama is not tough enough. Image7 reinforces this by showing a general increase in concern over Islamic extremism, with Republicans consistently expressing the highest levels of concern.\n\nIn summary, partisan views on whether Obama was \"not tough enough\" on foreign policy differ significantly, with Republicans, especially conservatives, being the most critical, while Democrats, particularly liberals, tend to view his approach as appropriate. The data from both text and image quotes supports this divergence in opinions.\n\n![Republicans, especially conservatives, are most likely to believe Obama’s foreign policy was not tough enough](image1)"}

According to the data, there has been a notable shift in the stance of both parties over this period.\n\nIn 2017, Republicans were more inclined to support increased defense spending in Europe, with a higher percentage of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents advocating for their European allies to dedicate more resources to national defense. However, by 2019, this view had declined significantly. Specifically, the share of Republicans who believed that U.S. European allies should increase their defense budgets fell by 14 percentage points between 2017 and 2019 [10]. This decline reflects a waning support for increased defense spending from Europe among Republicans since 2017 [3].\n\nAmong Democrats, there was also a more modest decline in support for increased defense spending in Europe during the same period. While the drop was not as steep as that observed among Republicans, it still indicates a shift in sentiment. The data suggests that both parties have seen a reduction in their support for increased defense spending in Europe, though the magnitude of the change differs between the two groups.\n\n![The image shows a line graph depicting trends over three years, from 2017 to 2019, for two political affiliations: \"Republican/Lean Rep\" and \"Democrat/Lean Dem.\"](image6)\n\nIn summary, views on increased defense spending in Europe have decreased among both Republicans and Democrats from 2017 to 2019, with a more significant decline observed among Republicans."}

A majority are either not too (16%) or not at all (41%) confident that Trump is keeping his own personal interests separate from his presidential decisions.\" This indicates that 41% of Americans are not at all confident in Trump's ability to keep his business interests separate from his decisions as president.\n\nHowever, when looking specifically at Republicans, quote [9] provides more detailed information: \"Most Republicans say they are very (55%) or somewhat (23%) confident that Trump keeps his business interests separate from his decision-making as president. Conservative Republicans are much more likely to say they are very confident in this (66%) than are moderate and liberal Republicans (39%).\"\n\nFrom this, we can infer that while 55% of Republicans are very confident and 23% are somewhat confident, the remaining percentage of Republicans would be either not too or not at all confident. Given that 55% + 23% = 78%, this leaves 22% of Republicans who are either not too or not at all confident. However, this does not directly tell us how many are not at all confident.\n\nQuote [6] provides additional insight into the views of Democrats, stating that \"Nearly seven-in-ten (69%) say that they are not at all confident that Trump keeps his business interests and his presidential decisions separate, while another 20% say they are not too confident in this. Liberal Democrats are particularly skeptical: Fully 83% say they are not at all confident in Trump to keep his business interests separate.\"\n\nWhile this information is specific to Democrats, it highlights the general concern about Trump's business interests and his presidential decisions. It also suggests that the issue of confidence in Trump's ability to keep his business interests separate from his decisions is a significant concern for many Americans, particularly Democrats.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the available data, it is clear that a significant number of Republicans are not confident at all that Trump keeps his own business interests separate from the decisions he makes as president.

This suggests that political affiliation plays a role in how individuals perceive the ethical standards of the parties.\n\nText quote [5] provides further insight into the relationship between education and perceptions of ethical standards. It states that among those with at least a college degree, 31% say \"high ethical standards\" does not describe either the GOP or the Democratic Party; 43% say it describes one but not the other, and 17% think it describes both. This indicates that higher education levels may correlate with more nuanced or critical views of the parties' ethical standards.\n\nText quote [11] reinforces this point, noting that nearly a third of college graduates say neither party has \"high ethical standards,\" suggesting that higher education may lead to more critical assessments of both major parties.\n\nText quote [12] adds that fewer of those with some college experience (26%) or a high school degree or less (20%) think neither party has high ethical standards. This implies that lower educational attainment is associated with a greater likelihood of believing that at least one party has high ethical standards.\n\nText quote [9] notes that just 41% of Americans say the GOP has high ethical standards, while a nearly identical share (42%) say this about the Democratic Party. This shows that both parties are viewed similarly in terms of ethical standards, though there is still a significant portion of the population that does not believe either party meets this standard.\n\nText quote [7] provides a broader perspective, stating that a quarter of the public says \"high ethical standards\" describes neither the Republican Party nor the Democratic Party; 47% say it describes one party but not the other; and 17% say the description applies to both. This indicates that there is a wide range of opinions on the ethical standards of the two parties.\n\nImage quote [4] presents a bar chart that illustrates how different educational and political affiliation groups perceive the ethical standards of the parties. The chart breaks down responses into three categories: \"Describes both parties,\" \"Describes one party, not the other,\" and \"Describes neither party.\" The data is further divided by education levels (College grad+, Some college, HS or less) and political affiliation (Republican, Democrat, Independent, Lean Republican, Lean Democrat). This visual representation allows for a clear comparison of how different groups perceive the ethical standards of the parties.\n\n![Describes neither party](image4)\n\nIn summary, perceptions of ethical standards vary significantly among different educational and political affiliation groups. Higher education levels are associated with more critical views of both parties, while lower educational attainment is linked to a greater likelihood of believing that at least one party has high ethical standards. Political affiliation also plays a role, with independents being more likely to believe that neither party has high ethical standards compared to partisans. The data from the bar chart in image4 provides a visual representation of these differences, highlighting the complex relationship between education, political affiliation, and perceptions of ethical standards."}

Additionally, assessments of government efforts to combat terrorism have become more negative across the political spectrum, with Republicans experiencing one of the largest drops—$63\\%$ in early 2015 fell to $27\\%$ by the time of the survey [3]. This decline reflects a growing dissatisfaction with the government's anti-terrorism policies.\n\nFurther evidence shows that since Snowden’s disclosures in 2013, both Republicans and Democrats have become more likely to say that anti-terrorism policies do not go far enough to protect the country, rather than that they have gone too far restricting civil liberties. However, the shift has been more pronounced among Republicans. Slightly more than seven-in-ten Republicans ($71\\%$) now say their greater concern is that anti-terrorism policies do not go far enough, up 14 points since January ($57\\%$) and 33 points since July 2013 ($38\\%$) [4].\n\nLooking at the image quotes, image1 provides a visual representation of this shift.

In contrast, the share of Democrats with “very cold” feelings increased by 21 points, reaching 38%. This highlights a growing partisan divide in attitudes toward China.

However, from the image quotes, specifically image3, we can determine that in 2014, streaming accounted for 20% of the business. The chart in image3 shows that in 2014, streaming was at 20%, and by 2015, it had increased to 34%. Therefore, the year when streaming had a 20% share of the business is 2014.\n\nNext, we look at the average weekly hours of music listening. From image6, we see that the average weekly hours increased from 19 hours in 2013 to 25 hours in 2014, representing a 30% increase. This means that in 2013, the average weekly listening time was 19 hours, and in 2014, it was 25 hours.\n\nTo find the difference in listening time between 2013 and 2014 (the year when streaming had a 20% share), we subtract the 2013 value from the 2014 value: 25 - 19 = 6 hours.\n\n![The bar chart shows an increase in average weekly hours from 2013 to 2014, with 19 hours in 2013 and 25 hours in 2014.](image6)\n\nTherefore, the difference in listening time in average weekly hours between 2013 and the year when streaming had a 20% share of the business is 6 hours."}

This indicates a growing confidence in Trump's economic policies among Republicans over this period.\n\nIn contrast, Democrats became more negative in their views. While in October 2017, 46% of Democrats and Democratic leaners had a negative view of Trump's economic policies, this increased to 46% by January 2019 [7]. However, it is important to note that the percentage of Democrats who felt that Trump's policies had not had much of an effect decreased by 20 points during this time [9].\n\nThe data also shows that in January 2019, 40% of Americans believed that Trump's economic policies had made conditions better, while 28% thought they had made conditions worse, and 29% said they had not had much of an effect [11]. This suggests that while there was a general positive shift in perception, there was still a significant portion of the population that remained skeptical.\n\n![Republicans and Democrats have different perceptions of Trump's economic policies.](image1)\n\n![The trend in economic perceptions from 2000 to 2019 shows a divergence between Republicans and Democrats.](image2)\n\n![Confidence levels in political abilities show a considerable difference between Republicans and Democrats.](image3)\n\n![Perceptions of presidential success show a clear divide between party affiliates.](image4)\n\n![The chart comparing perceptions of presidential success shows a clear divide between party affiliates.](image5)\n\n![The chart comparing opinions on whether something made things better, had not much effect, or made things worse shows a clear divide between Republicans and Democrats.](image6)\n\n![The chart comparing responses from different political groups regarding their level of agreement with something shows a clear divide between Republicans and Democrats.](image7)\n\n![The bar chart showing data over six time points indicates a consistent level of agreement among the public regarding Trump's economic policies.](image8)\n\nIn conclusion, the perception of Trump's economic policies changed significantly from October 2017 to January 2019, with Republicans becoming more positive and Democrats becoming more negative."}

This indicates a general belief that U.S. involvement is beneficial, but there are significant differences across political lines. Specifically, [11] notes that moderate and liberal Democrats say U.S. efforts to solve problems usually end up making things worse (45%) as often as they believe problems would be worse without U.S. involvement (50%). In contrast, [12] highlights that comparable majorities of both Republicans (62%) and Democrats (56%) believe that world problems would be worse without U.S. involvement.\n\nThe image quotes further support these findings. Image4 presents a bar chart showing survey results on perceptions of U.S. involvement in solving global problems. It reveals that 38% of the total population believes that U.S. efforts usually make things worse, with Republicans (31%), Democrats (37%), and Independents (43%) showing varying degrees of this belief.

The data shows that:\n\n- Those with \"Some college or more\" have 69% who feel better off economically compared to 79% of high school graduates [8].\n- High school graduates are more optimistic about their economic future than those with some college experience or more.\n\nCombining these insights, it appears that **high school graduates** are the most optimistic about their children's financial future among the educational subgroups discussed. This conclusion is supported by the data from both the text and image quotes.\n\n![High school graduates are the most optimistic about their children's financial future among the educational subgroups.](image8)"}

To answer this, we need to refer to the relevant text and image quotes that provide information about the sample distribution in Nepal.\n\nFrom the text quotes, we learn that the sampling process was conducted using a multistage sampling technique, with the first stage involving the selection of districts from Nepal's 75 districts. These districts were selected using stratified random sampling to represent the six distinct regions defined by Nepal's five development regions and three ecological zones, along with the Kathmandu Valley [3]. This indicates that the Kathmandu Valley was specifically considered in the sampling process.\n\nLooking at the image quotes, **image3** provides a detailed map of Nepal divided into districts and regions, with color-coded samples. It explicitly mentions that the \"Purple represents 'Sample Kathmandu Valley District,' which includes Kathmandu, Bhaktapur, and Lalitpur, marked with letters 'K,' 'B,' and 'L,' respectively\" [image3].

This growth continued into the early 20th century, with the population remaining relatively stable around 13,000 until 1930, after which it began to decline. By 1940, the population had dropped to 9,982, and it continued to decrease through the 1950s and 1960s, reaching 8,714 in 1960. However, the population showed a slight recovery in the 1970s, increasing to 8,867 in 1970, and further rising to 9,301 in 1980.

According to the data, LMMs show varying degrees of effectiveness depending on the complexity of the tasks and the nature of the visual content involved.\n\nIn the 'Human & Social Science' category, which includes subjects like History, Literature, Psychology, and Sociology, the models tend to perform relatively better compared to more complex disciplines such as Science, Health & Medicine, and Tech & Engineering. This is because the visual data in these areas is often less complex, and the questions involve less intricate reasoning. For instance, in the 'Human & Social Science' category, models demonstrate higher accuracy, as seen in the table where certain LMMs achieve scores that are closer to the baseline performance of Frequent Choice and Random Choice, indicating that the tasks are more straightforward and less demanding in terms of multimodal understanding.\n\nHowever, when considering the overall performance across all categories, the models face significant challenges. The MMMU benchmark, which encompasses a wide range of disciplines and requires both nuanced perception and domain-specific knowledge, highlights the limitations of current LMMs. For example, GPT-4V, despite being an advanced model, achieves an overall accuracy of only 55.7%, which indicates substantial room for improvement. This suggests that while LMMs may perform reasonably well in simpler categories like 'Human & Social Science,' they struggle with more complex tasks that require deeper integration of visual and textual information.\n\n![The table presents performance metrics of various large multimodal models (LMMs) and large language models (LLMs) across different validation and test sets, and specific categories/disciplines.](image1)\n\nAdditionally, the error analysis of GPT-4V reveals that 35% of errors are perceptual, 29% stem from a lack of knowledge, and 26% are due to flaws in the reasoning process. These findings underscore the challenges of the MMMU benchmark and point towards areas needing further research and model enhancement.

For higher-resource languages, pre-training consistently improves BLEU scores by approximately 3 points for all three language pairs [2]. However, for extremely low-resource languages, the gains can be either small or very large. For instance, in the case of Galician (GL), pre-training led to an impressive gain of up to 11 BLEU points, indicating that pre-trained embeddings are particularly useful for languages that are on the threshold of producing reasonable translations [2].\n\nThe effectiveness of pre-training is also influenced by the similarity between the source and target languages. In Table 5, it is shown that the largest gains in BLEU scores were observed for the GL/PT pair, which has the highest similarity, while the BE/RU pair, which has the lowest similarity, showed only a small decrease in scores [10]. This suggests that pre-training is more effective when the source and target languages are similar, as the model can leverage the shared linguistic features more effectively.\n\nFurthermore, the alignment of embedding spaces between the source and target languages plays a crucial role in improving BLEU scores. When the word embeddings are aligned, the gains in BLEU scores increase for all three tasks, as seen in Table 5. This is because aligning the embeddings allows the model to learn in a more consistent manner, especially when using a single encoder for multiple languages [10].\n\nIn addition, the effect of pre-training is more pronounced when the baseline system is not too poor. For example, in Table 3, it is observed that the gain in BLEU score follows a similar trend to that found in GL, where the gain is highest when the baseline system is poor but not too poor, typically with a baseline BLEU score in the range of 3-4 [11]. This indicates that pre-training is most effective when there is enough data to capture the basic characteristics of the language, allowing the model to build upon that foundation.\n\nThe impact of pre-training on BLEU scores is also evident in the comparison of different training conditions. In Table 3, it is clear that pre-training the word embeddings in the source and/or target languages helps to increase the BLEU scores to some degree. The increase is much more significant when pre-trained source language embeddings are used, suggesting that the majority of the gain from pre-trained word embeddings results from a better encoding of the source sentence [12].\n\nMoreover, the results in Table 2 show that pre-training the word embeddings in the source and/or target languages leads to improvements in BLEU scores. The table highlights that the use of pre-trained source language embeddings results in a more substantial increase in scores compared to pre-trained target language embeddings. This further supports the idea that the quality of the source sentence encoding is a critical factor in the success of pre-training [12].\n\nThe effect of pre-training on BLEU scores is also reflected in the comparison of different datasets. In Table 6, it is shown that pre-training not only helps the model capture rarer vocabulary but also generates sentences that are more grammatically well-formed. The best system successfully translates a person's name (\"chris\") and two multi-word phrases (\"big lawyer\" and \"patent legislation\"), demonstrating the usefulness of pre-trained embeddings in providing better representations of less frequent concepts when used with low-resource languages [1].\n\nFinally, the results in Table 5 indicate that pre-training and alignment ensure that the word embeddings of the two source languages are put into similar vector spaces, allowing the model to learn in a similar fashion as it would if training on a single language. This is particularly important for multilingual systems, where the ability to generalize across languages is essential [10].\n\n![The table shows the effect of pre-training on multilingual translation into English, with different columns representing bilingual and multilingual systems.](image4)"}

As the number of demonstrations increases, the performance generally improves, but the rate of improvement diminishes after a certain point. This pattern is observed in both datasets, indicating that while more demonstrations provide more context for the model to learn from, there is a diminishing return beyond a certain threshold.\n\nFor example, when the number of demonstrations increases from 1 to 5, there is an evident improvement in performance. However, further increases in the number of demonstrations (e.g., ≥10) result in limited improvements. This suggests that while additional demonstrations can help, they are not always the most efficient way to improve performance. In contrast, adding logical constraints into the LLM instructions provides stable improvements, especially when combined with a larger number of demonstrations. This indicates that logical constraints play a crucial role in guiding the model's reasoning process and enhancing its ability to perform complex tasks.\n\n![The graph shows the performance (Micro-F1 score) of different models/datasets with and without logical constraints as the number of demonstration samples increases.](image1)\n\nIn addition, incorporating logical constraints with a smaller number of demonstrations can even surpass the performance of prompts with a larger number of demonstrations. For instance, using 5 demonstrations on MAVEN-ERE with logical constraints achieves a higher Micro-F1 score (25.7%) than using 10 demonstrations without logical constraints (24.5%). This highlights the importance of combining both demonstrations and logical constraints to optimize performance.\n\n![The graph demonstrates how the Micro-F1 score and logical inconsistency change over multiple iterations for the MAVEN-ERE and CTB datasets.

The first component is the **Multimodal Retriever**, which is responsible for querying a large multimodal external memory or database to find information relevant to the input query or context. This retriever creates and stores multimodal embeddings, with a focus on optimizing retrieval speed through index construction techniques [9]. The retriever uses an image encoder to extract image feature embeddings from a dataset, which are then stored in a feature index for quick retrieval [image1]. These embeddings are stored in an external memory ($\\mathcal{M}$), which allows for efficient k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) searches for image-image and image-text retrieval [image1].\n\nThe second component of the RAR pipeline is the **Retrieving & Ranking** process. During the inference stage, an image is encoded into embeddings, and the top-k categories are retrieved from memory based on similarity [image1]. These retrieved candidate results are then ranked by Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), which refine and rank the categories to produce the final prediction [image1]. This ranking step is crucial as it leverages the internal knowledge of MLLMs combined with the retrieved information to make more accurate and contextually aware classification predictions [2].\n\nTo enhance the speed of retrieval, the RAR pipeline implements an index system that uses the HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World) algorithm. This algorithm facilitates a significant dimensionality reduction, transforming vectors in a $\\mathbb{R}^{d}$ space of dimension $d$ into a reduced $\\frac{d}{9}$ dimensional space. This reduction in dimensionality plays a pivotal role in enhancing the speed of the retrieval process [7].\n\nThe RAR pipeline also includes a **ranking prompt** that serves to merge the input image with the category information retrieved from memory. This prompt guides MLLMs to rank the retrieved candidate object categories based on similarity [5]. By integrating the retrieval-augmented design, the RAR approach seeks to bridge the gap between the broad generalization capabilities of MLLMs and the need for precise, fine-grained categorization [11].\n\n![The RAR pipeline consists of a multimodal retriever and a retrieving & ranking process.](image1)"}

This allows for a more holistic search, as the algorithm evaluates nodes across all layers to find the most relevant ones. The retrieval process continues until a threshold number of tokens is reached, ensuring that the retrieved context is both comprehensive and relevant to the query.\n\nThe differences between these two approaches are visually illustrated in image3, which shows the distinct processes of Tree Traversal Retrieval and Collapsed Tree Retrieval. In Tree Traversal Retrieval, the traversal starts from the root and moves down through the layers, selecting top nodes at each level. In Collapsed Tree Retrieval, the tree is collapsed into a single layer, allowing for a simultaneous evaluation of all nodes. Nodes on which cosine similarity is performed are highlighted in both mechanisms, emphasizing the key steps in the retrieval process.\n\n![Collapsed Tree Retrieval evaluates nodes collectively across all layers to find the most relevant ones.](image3)\n\nThe choice between these two methods depends on the specific requirements of the task. Tree Traversal Retrieval provides more control over the retrieval process, allowing for a gradual focus on finer details as the traversal progresses. On the other hand, Collapsed Tree Retrieval offers greater flexibility and can retrieve information at the correct level of granularity for a given question, often yielding more relevant and comprehensive results [3].\n\nIn summary, Tree Traversal Retrieval and Collapsed Tree Retrieval differ in their approach to retrieving information by either traversing the tree layer by layer or evaluating all nodes simultaneously."}

Specifically, it is noted that hard-to-contrast data are practical for the cold start problem and yield the highest performance among existing active querying strategies [4]. Furthermore, it is stated that hard-to-contrast querying strategy significantly outperforms random selection by 1.8%, 2.6%, and 5.2% on PathMNIST, Organ AM NIST, and BloodMNIST, respectively, by querying only 0.1% of the entire dataset [4].

The SFT dataset is carefully structured into multiple categories, including Text, Code, Visual Chat, Image Generation, Interleaved Text/Image Generation, and Safety, each contributing to different aspects of the model's capabilities. For instance, the Text category inherits data from LLaMa-2, while the Code category draws from CodeLLaMa, ensuring that the model is well-equipped for text and code-related tasks. The Image Generation category involves highly aesthetic images curated using an aesthetic classifier, which helps the model generate high-quality images. The Interleaved Text/Image Generation category focuses on mixed-modal data, enabling the model to handle complex, interleaved sequences of text and images. The Safety category includes prompts designed to test and improve the model's ability to refuse unsafe content, enhancing its robustness and reliability.\n\nThese dataset statistics are directly related to the Chameleon model's inference strategy because they inform the model's ability to generate and reason with mixed-modal content. The model's training approach, which includes a cosine learning rate schedule and weight decay, is optimized to handle the diverse and complex data found in the SFT dataset. Additionally, the model's architecture is tailored for early-fusion, token-based, mixed-modal settings, allowing it to process and generate both text and image tokens seamlessly. This is evident in the diagrams provided in image1, which illustrate how the model processes and generates mixed-modal documents. The diagrams show that the model can handle both text and image prompts during pre-training and generate outputs that include both text and images, highlighting its ability to manage interleaved modalities.\n\nFurthermore, the data balancing strategies employed during the SFT stage ensure that the model does not develop an unconditional prior for any specific modality, which could otherwise lead to imbalanced generation. By maintaining a balanced distribution of modalities, the model is better equipped to handle a wide range of tasks, from image captioning to visual question answering, as mentioned in the text quotes. The model's performance on these tasks is further supported by its ability to generate relevant images that complement the text, making the documents with interleaving text and images more appealing to users.\n\nIn summary, the supervised fine-tuning dataset statistics are integral to the Chameleon model's inference strategy, as they provide the necessary data to train the model on a wide range of tasks, ensuring it can effectively generate and reason with mixed-modal content. The careful curation and balancing of the dataset enable the model to perform well across various benchmarks and maintain high-quality image generation, all within a single model.\n\n![The image consists of two diagrams illustrating a Mixed-Modal Auto-Regressive Language Model (LM) called \"Chameleon\" that handles text and image tokens.](image1)"}

The object queries are transformed through multiple layers of self-attention and encoder-decoder attention, allowing the model to capture pairwise interactions between objects and leverage the entire image as context.\n\nIn the DETR architecture, the object queries are initially set to zero and then refined through the decoder's attention mechanisms. They are added to the input of each attention layer, ensuring that the model can differentiate between the $N$ input embeddings and produce distinct outputs. This approach enables the model to directly output a set of predictions without relying on hand-designed components like non-maximal suppression or anchor generation.

According to Figure 4, which shows relation scores as a function of the number of entities in a sentence for DyGIE and DyGIE without relation propagation on ACE05, relation propagation achieves significant improvement in sentences with more entities. This suggests that as the number of entities increases, the model benefits more from incorporating relation propagation, likely because it allows the model to leverage broader context for better relation identification [1].\n\n![Relation scores as a function of the number of entities in a sentence for DyGIE and DyGIE without relation propagation on ACE05](image4).\n\nIn addition, Figure 7 illustrates the performance of relation extraction systems, measured by F1 score, as a function of the number of entities present in a sentence. The graph shows that \"DyGIE\" (blue line with circle markers) generally outperforms \"DyGIE-RelProp\" (red line with square markers) across all categories. While both systems experience a decline in performance as the number of entities increases, the addition of relation propagation in \"DyGIE-RelProp\" attempts to mitigate this decline, though not as effectively as \"DyGIE\" without relation propagation. This implies that while relation propagation can help improve performance in sentences with more entities, it may not always lead to the best results compared to models that do not use it [7].\n\n![Performance of relation extraction systems as a function of the number of entities in a sentence](image7).\n\nThe implications of utilizing relation propagation are that it can enhance the model's ability to capture complex relationships between entities, especially in sentences with multiple entities. However, the effectiveness of relation propagation may depend on the specific task and dataset. For instance, in some cases, relation propagation might introduce noise or fail to provide substantial improvements, as seen in the comparison between DyGIE and DyGIE without relation propagation [1]. Overall, relation propagation is beneficial but should be carefully evaluated based on the context and data characteristics.\n\nThe relation extraction performance decreases as the number of entities in a sentence increases, and relation propagation helps mitigate this decline, although its effectiveness varies depending on the specific scenario."}

These methods are designed to improve the efficiency, relevance, and adaptability of the RAG framework.\n\n**Iterative Retrieval** involves alternating between retrieval and generation steps. It aims to provide richer and more targeted context from the knowledge base at each step. The process typically repeats a specified number of times or until a threshold is met. For example, the system starts with a query, retrieves relevant information, generates a response, judges its quality, and then repeats the process if necessary [image2]. This iterative approach allows for gradual refinement of the generated answer based on feedback from previous iterations.\n\n**Recursive Retrieval**, on the other hand, focuses on gradually refining the user query and dividing complex problems into sub-problems. It continuously solves these sub-problems through retrieval and generation, utilizing query transformation and decomposition. The process begins with a query, retrieves information, generates a response, judges it, and then transforms the query before repeating the cycle. This method is particularly useful in complex search scenarios where the user's needs are not entirely clear from the outset [image2].\n\n**Adaptive Retrieval** enables the RAG system to decide when external knowledge retrieval is needed. It can autonomously determine when to stop retrieval and generation, using special tokens to signal the end of the process. The process starts with a query, the system judges whether retrieval is necessary, retrieves information on demand, generates a response, and may transform the query again based on the judgment. This adaptive approach enhances the efficiency and relevance of the information sourced by allowing the system to dynamically adjust its behavior based on the context [image2].\n\nEach of these retrieval processes contributes uniquely to the overall performance and flexibility of the RAG system, ensuring that the generated responses are accurate, relevant, and tailored to the specific needs of the user.\n\n![Iterative Retrieval, Recursive Retrieval, and Adaptive Retrieval processes in a RAG system](image2)"}

Based on the description, the personality traits are Openness (OPEN), Conscientiousness (CON), Extraversion (EXT), Agreeableness (AGR), and Neuroticism (NEU). \n\nIn the histogram, the traits are likely ordered from left to right as follows: Neuroticism (NEU), Agreeableness (AGR), Extraversion (EXT), Conscientiousness (CON), and Openness (OPEN). This ordering is based on the typical understanding of the OCEAN model, where Neuroticism is often considered the trait that is furthest to the left in terms of the distribution of scores.\n\nNow, we need to find the highest hit rate number for the personality trait located furthest to the left, which is Neuroticism (NEU). From the image quote, image3 provides a table comparing the performance of different traits across three datasets: Amazon-beauty, Amazon-music, and Personality2018. The table includes two evaluation metrics: HR (Hit Rate) and NDCG (Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain). The values for these metrics are provided under each dataset.\n\nLooking at the table in image3, the highest hit rate number for Neuroticism (NEU) is 0.67 for the Amazon-music dataset under the \"+\" condition. Therefore, the highest hit rate number in the dataset for the personality trait located furthest to the left in the distribution of personality traits figure is 0.67.\n\n![The histogram shows the distribution of personality traits in the Amazon-beauty and Amazon-music datasets.](image2)"}

This means that for every positive example, there are between 50 and 200 negative examples, highlighting the severe imbalance in these types of datasets.\n\nThis imbalance can significantly affect model performance, as easy-negative examples can dominate training due to their high probability of being classified correctly, while hard-negative examples are difficult to distinguish from positive ones. This issue is further discussed in quote [8], which explains how the DSC loss helps mitigate this problem by addressing the challenges posed by imbalanced data.\n\n![The table presents the performance of different models on the English CoNLL 2003 dataset.

Adversarial training involves selecting distractor paragraphs that are more challenging for the model to distinguish from the correct answer, thereby forcing the model to develop better reasoning capabilities.\n\nFrom the text quotes, we see that when a model is trained on adversarial distractors, it can recover most of its original accuracy. For example, the F1 score of single-paragraph BERT on adversarial distractors increased from 46.84 to 60.10 after re-training [3]. This indicates that adversarial training can improve model performance when the model is re-trained on the new distribution of distractors.\n\nIn addition, the text mentions that the original model's accuracy degrades significantly when using type-matched distractors (drops to 40.73 F1), but the model trained on adversarially selected distractors can recover most of its original accuracy (increases to 58.42 F1) [2].

According to the text quotes, word-order information plays a significant role in sentiment analysis tasks, as highlighted in several studies. For instance, it is noted that both CNN and LSTM compositional functions perform better than SWEM in sentiment analysis, suggesting that word-order information may be required for analyzing sentiment orientations [7]. This finding aligns with Pang et al. (2002), which hypothesizes that the positional information of a word in text sequences may be beneficial to predict sentiment. The intuitive reasoning is that phrases like \"not really good\" and \"really not good\" convey different levels of negative sentiment, and such differences are captured by models like CNN and LSTM through their ability to process sequences.\n\nHowever, the relationship between word-order information and sentiment analysis accuracy is not absolute. For example, in some cases, the performance of LSTM models on shuffled training sets is very close to that of SWEM, indicating that the main difference between LSTM and SWEM may be due to the former's ability to capture word-order features [12]. This suggests that while word-order information can enhance performance, it is not always the determining factor. Additionally, the results on the Yelp polarity dataset show a noticeable drop in accuracy when word-order information is disrupted, further supporting the idea that word-order does matter for sentiment analysis [11].\n\nIn summary, word-order information significantly affects sentiment analysis accuracy in LSTM models, as they are designed to capture sequential dependencies.

However, this result is entirely attributed to the exploitation of spurious statistical cues in the dataset. After applying the adversarial transformation, BERT's performance drops to random accuracy, with a maximum test set accuracy of $53\\%$ [3]. This indicates that BERT's success on the original dataset was not due to genuine understanding but rather to these cues.\n\nSimilarly, the table in image5 shows the test performance metrics for different models, including BERT. For BERT, the mean is $0.671 \\pm 0.09$, the median is $0.712$, and the maximum is $0.770$. However, after the adversarial transformation, the performance metrics for BERT drop significantly, as seen in image6, where the mean for BERT is $0.504 \\pm 0.01$, the median is $0.505$, and the maximum is $0.533$.

In terms of **breadth**, MMMU covers a wide range of disciplines, subjects, and subfields, which is a significant departure from the focus on daily knowledge and common sense seen in many existing benchmarks. For instance, while benchmarks like VQA or GQA are limited in their scope, MMMU spans six major disciplines—Art & Design, Business, Science, Health & Medicine, Humanities & Social Science, and Tech & Engineering—with 30 subjects and 183 subfields [2]. This extensive coverage ensures that models are tested across a broad spectrum of topics, reflecting real-world complexity.\n\nIn terms of **depth**, MMMU requires expert-level reasoning and domain-specific knowledge, which is not typically demanded by other benchmarks. While many benchmarks focus on basic perception abilities or simple reasoning tasks, MMMU challenges models to apply advanced concepts such as \"Fourier Transform\" or \"Equilibrium Theory\" to solve problems [2]. This level of difficulty ensures that models are not only capable of understanding multimodal inputs but also of performing complex reasoning based on subject-specific knowledge.\n\nThe implications of these characteristics for evaluating LMMs are profound. By requiring both **expert-level visual perception** and **deliberate reasoning**, MMMU pushes the boundaries of what current models can achieve. For example, GPT-4V, despite being an advanced model, achieves an accuracy of only 55.7% on MMMU, indicating that there is still significant room for improvement [8]. This suggests that MMMU serves as a rigorous and demanding standard for evaluating the capabilities of LMMs, particularly in domains that require deep subject knowledge and complex reasoning.\n\n![The MMMU benchmark excels in depth (reasoning) and breadth (knowledge) compared to other benchmarks like VQA, GQA, VisWiz, and others.](image4)\n\nMoreover, MMMU introduces unique challenges that are absent in other benchmarks. It includes diverse image formats, such as diagrams, tables, charts, chemical structures, photos, paintings, geometric shapes, music sheets, and medical images, which test the perceptual capabilities of LMMs [2]. Additionally, the benchmark features interleaved text-image inputs, requiring models to jointly understand both modalities, often necessitating the recall of deep subject knowledge and conducting complex reasoning [2].\n\nThese features make MMMU a valuable tool for assessing the true capabilities of LMMs, especially in scenarios where expert-level understanding and reasoning are required. The benchmark's emphasis on both breadth and depth ensures that models are evaluated not just on their ability to perceive and understand information but also on their capacity to apply this understanding in meaningful ways. This makes MMMU a critical resource for advancing the development of more capable and versatile LMMs."}

During the **Problem Formulation** stage, an LLM translates the natural language problem into a symbolic representation, identifying key entities, facts, and rules present in the problem statement. This is achieved through in-context learning, where the LLM learns to map natural language to symbolic logic based on examples [2]. Once the problem is formulated symbolically, the **Symbolic Reasoner** takes over, performing logical inference using deterministic methods such as logic programming, first-order logic provers, or constraint optimization, depending on the nature of the problem [12]. Finally, the **Result Interpreter** translates the symbolic answer back into natural language, providing a comprehensible solution to the original problem [12].\n\n![The LOGIC-LM model is composed of three main modules: Problem Formulator, Symbolic Reasoner, and Result Interpreter.](image5)\n\nFor example, consider a logical reasoning problem involving two Netflix shows, \"Stranger Things\" and \"Black Mirror,\" and a person named Karen.

To answer this, we need to examine the differences in accuracy between these two models across various slot types.\n\nFrom the text quotes, we learn that DS-DST and DS-Span differ in how they handle categorical and non-categorical slots. For example, DS-Span struggles with certain slots where the values cannot be directly found in the dialog context, such as `hotel-internet` and `hotel-parking`, because they require more complex reasoning or access to an ontology [1]. In contrast, DS-DST improves on these by incorporating interactions between the dialog context and domain-slot pairs, allowing it to better predict values even when they are not explicitly mentioned in the dialogue [5].\n\nAdditionally, Table 4 in the text provides a comparison of slot-level accuracy for different models, including DS-Span and DS-DST [12]. According to the table, DS-DST generally outperforms DS-Span, especially for slots like `hotel-type`, `attraction-type`, `hotel-internet`, and `hotel-parking`. However, some slots show less improvement. For instance, time-related slots like `taxi-leave at` and `train-arrive by` are span-based and do not benefit significantly from DS-DST's improvements because their values are often not directly found in the dialog context [4].\n\nImage3 further supports this by showing that while DS-DST improves on DS-Span for most slots, the relative increase in accuracy is smaller for certain types of slots.

This is evident from the accuracy improvements observed in different subsets and rungs of the dataset. For instance, the original GPT-4 model performs poorly on anti-commonsensical and nonsensical data, with a drop in accuracy compared to its performance on commonsensical data. However, when using CAUSALCoT, there is a substantial improvement, especially on unseen data. The accuracy of GPT-4 increases by 8.37 points on the CL ADDER dataset, achieving an overall accuracy of 70.40% [8]. Additionally, CAUSALCoT achieves the highest performance across all three rungs of causal questions, with a monotonic decrease in performance as the complexity of the questions increases [5].\n\nIn terms of specific metrics, the CAUSALCoT approach shows marked improvements in different steps of the causal reasoning process. For example, in Step ①, the model demonstrates high F1 scores for predicting both nodes and edges correctly, although there is still a small graph edit distance of 1.69 between the ground truth and the model-identified graph [2]. In Step ②, the overall F1 classification score is 50.65, with varying performance across different rungs, indicating that the model struggles more with higher-level questions. In Steps ③ and ⑤, the estimand correctness is 53, while in Step ④, the F1 score is 47.53. Finally, in Step ⑥, the arithmetic correctness is 99, suggesting that the model performs well in this aspect [6].\n\nThe impact of CAUSALCoT is also visible in the accuracy by commonsense alignment level. While the original GPT-4 model performs best on commonsensical data, it lags significantly on nonsensical data. In contrast, CAUSALCoT shows substantial improvement across all levels, particularly on anti-commonsensical and nonsensical data, highlighting its effectiveness in handling unseen and challenging scenarios [10].\n\nFurthermore, the CAUSALCoT approach improves the model's performance across different categories of queries. For example, in the \"Acc. by Rung\" section, CAUSALCoT achieves the highest accuracy for all three rungs, with Rung 1 showing the highest improvement at 83.35% [7]. In the \"Acc. by Commonsense Alignment\" section, CAUSALCoT outperforms other models, especially on nonsensical and anti-commonsensical data, with accuracies of 71.58% and 70.12%, respectively [7].\n\nOverall, the CAUSALCoT approach significantly enhances the performance of GPT-4, particularly in complex and challenging causal reasoning tasks, demonstrating its value in improving the reasoning abilities of large language models.\n\n![CAUSALCoT significantly enhances the performance of GPT-4, particularly in complex and challenging causal reasoning tasks.](image7)"}

For instance, when comparing the \"GloVe with R-GCN\" configuration to \"GloVe w/o R-GCN,\" the accuracy drops from 59.2 to 51.2 [4]. This indicates that the R-GCN plays a crucial role in enhancing the model's ability to process relational information between entities. Furthermore, the \"No R-GCN\" configuration shows an accuracy of 62.4, which is still lower than the \"full (ensemble)\" model's accuracy of 68.5 [4]. This suggests that while the model can still perform reasonably without R-GCN, it is not as effective as when R-GCN is included.\n\nIn the masked setting, the impact of removing R-GCN is even more pronounced. The \"GloVe with R-GCN\" configuration has an accuracy of 11.1, while \"GloVe w/o R-GCN\" drops to 11.6 [4]. Although the drop is smaller in this case, it still highlights the importance of R-GCN in maintaining performance under masking conditions. Additionally, the \"No R-GCN\" configuration achieves an accuracy of 63.2 in the masked setting, which is significantly lower than the \"full (ensemble)\" model's accuracy of 71.6 [4]. This further emphasizes the critical role of R-GCN in improving the model's performance, especially in scenarios where information is masked.\n\nThe impact of R-GCN is also reflected in the comparison of different model configurations. For example, the \"No R-GCN\" configuration performs worse than the \"No relation types\" and \"No DOC–BASED\" configurations, indicating that the relational structure provided by R-GCN is essential for the model's effectiveness [4].\n\nMoreover, the table in image4 provides a visual representation of these findings. It shows that the \"full (ensemble)\" model, which includes R-GCN, outperforms all other configurations in both unmasked and masked settings. The \"GloVe with R-GCN\" and \"GloVe w/o R-GCN\" configurations also demonstrate the importance of R-GCN, as their performance drops significantly when it is removed [4].\n\n![The table in image4 shows the performance of different models or configurations on some task, possibly related to natural language processing or machine learning, given the mention of GloVe, R-GCN, and different components like MATCH, COREF, and COMPLEMENT.](image4)\n\nIn conclusion, removing R-GCN significantly reduces the model's performance in both unmasked and masked settings, highlighting its importance in the model's architecture."}

This approach laid the groundwork for more sophisticated models that would follow. By 2011, researchers began exploring the \"Google Ngrams corpus,\" which provided a large-scale dataset for studying linguistic changes across centuries [12]. This corpus played a pivotal role in the development of the field and spurred work on the new discipline of 'culturomics,' studying human culture through digital media [12].\n\nIn 2012, the focus shifted to \"Word epoch disambiguation,\" where efforts were made to determine the time span that specific contexts of a word undergoing a shift belong to [3]. This was a significant step towards understanding how words evolve in meaning over different periods. The year 2013 saw advancements in \"Prediction-based models,\" which became increasingly important in capturing semantic changes [10].\n\nBy 2014, the use of \"Word embeddings\" became prominent, with the example of \"word2vec\" illustrating how these models could be employed to trace diachronic semantic shifts [10]. In 2015, the development of \"Models alignment\" allowed for better comparison of word vectors across different time spans [3]. \n\nIn 2016, the analysis using the \"NYT corpus\" and \"COHA corpus\" expanded the range of datasets available for studying semantic changes, providing more detailed insights into how word meanings evolve [8]. Finally, in 2017, there were insights into \"Laws of semantic change,\" \"Local measures better for cultural shifts,\" \"Gigaword corpus,\" \"Diachronic relations,\" and \"Criticism of semantic change laws.\" Additionally, \"Joint learning across time spans\" was noted, highlighting the growing complexity of the methodologies used [1].\n\n![The timeline chart illustrates key milestones in the field of distributional models aimed at tracing diachronic semantic shifts from 2010 to 2017.](image1)"}

Nevertheless, the method of using the Pythagorean theorem and trigonometric functions remains consistent across the relevant quotes.\n\nFinally, quote [9] explains that the Pythagorean theorem is used to find the length of the hypotenuse in a right triangle, which is a foundational step in determining the angles.

This setup allows the model to focus on generating accurate factual information without the complications of entity linking errors. In particular, quote [3] states: \"The oracle KGLM is given the correct entity annotation for $X$, while the NEL KGLM uses the discriminative model used for importance sampling combined with the NEL entity linker to produce an entity annotation for $X$.\" This suggests that the Oracle KGLM has a more reliable foundation for making predictions, including birthdate predictions.\n\nIn addition, quote [9] discusses the performance of the KGLM on factual completion tasks, such as predicting the next word after a factual sentence like \"Barack is married to.\" It also notes that the KGLM is significantly more accurate than other models in these tasks. While this quote does not explicitly mention birthdate prediction, it supports the idea that the KGLM is capable of generating accurate factual information, including dates.\n\nLooking at the image quotes, image2 provides a detailed comparison between GPT-2 and KGLM on various factual tasks, including birthplace and birthdate prediction. The table in image2 shows that for the input \"Richard Nixon was born on ____,\" both the gold answer and GPT-2's prediction start with \"January,\" but they do not match the gold answer exactly. However, the table does not provide specific accuracy metrics for the Oracle KGLM on birthdate prediction.\n\nDespite the lack of direct mention of top-1 accuracy for the Oracle KGLM on birthdate prediction, we can infer from the evidence that the Oracle KGLM performs well on factual tasks. Quote [12] states: \"KGLMs are also competitive with models trained on orders of magnitude more data, producing factual completions that require specific knowledge, such as birthplaces, dates, and authors.\" This indicates that the KGLM, including its Oracle variant, is capable of accurately predicting dates, including birthdates.\n\nBased on the evidence provided, the Oracle KGLM achieves high accuracy on birthdate prediction tasks, although the exact top-1 accuracy is not explicitly stated in the provided text or image quotes.\n\n![The image illustrates the process of a Knowledge Graph Language Model (KGLM) generating a token based on context and knowledge graph information.](image1)"}

This indicates that MMMU has a much broader scope in terms of both subject matter and image types.\n\nIn addition, the paper highlights that other benchmarks focus on relatively basic perception abilities without requiring expert-level domain knowledge and deliberate reasoning [4]. MMMU, on the other hand, introduces tasks that require nuanced perception, recalling domain-specific knowledge, and performing step-by-step reasoning to derive solutions [4].

For instance, removing the abstract from the textual input and relying only on the title results in a substantial decrease in performance [8]. This indicates that the abstract provides crucial information for the model to understand the context and content of the documents effectively. On the other hand, adding authors as an input (along with title and abstract) hurts performance, possibly due to the sparsity of author names in the corpus and suboptimal tokenization using Wordpieces [8]. This suggests that author names may not contribute meaningful information to the model's understanding of document-level relatedness.\n\n![The table presents performance metrics for different models or configurations. The columns represent different evaluation criteria: CLS, USR, CITE, REC, and an average (Avg.). Each row lists these metrics for different configurations related to the SPECTER model.](image1)\n\nAdding venues slightly decreases performance, except on document classification, which makes sense as venues are expected to have high correlation with the classification task [8]. This implies that while venues can be useful for certain tasks, they may not always enhance the model's performance across all tasks. The use of hard negative distractors in the citation-based fine-tuning objective is also critical for the performance of SPECTER; using only easy negatives reduces performance on all tasks [2]. This highlights the importance of incorporating challenging examples during training to improve the model's ability to distinguish between relevant and irrelevant documents.\n\n![The image provides an overview of the SPECTER model, which is used for document embedding, specifically for scientific paper analysis. It utilizes a transformer model that is initialized with SciBERT, which is a BERT-based model pre-trained on scientific text data.](image2)\n\nThe performance of SPECTER is further validated through comparisons with other models and configurations. For example, the table shows that SPECTER outperforms various baselines, including SciBERT fine-tuned on different tasks, across multiple metrics [3]. The best scores in each category are bolded, indicating that SPECTER consistently achieves higher performance. Additionally, the inclusion of a strong general-domain language model like BERT-Large instead of SciBERT in SPECTER reduces performance considerably, emphasizing the importance of using a model pre-trained on scientific text [2].\n\n![The table presents a comparison of different training signals and their performance across several metrics for document or text classification tasks.](image3)\n\nIn the context of recommendation tasks, SPECTER outperforms all other models, achieving an nDCG of 53.9 [9]. However, the differences in method scores are generally smaller for this task because the embeddings are used along with several other informative features in the ranking model. This suggests that while the inclusion of specific features can enhance performance, the overall effectiveness of the model may also depend on the integration of additional features.\n\n![The table highlights the performance of various models on different tasks related to document understanding or recommendation.](image4)\n\nIn summary, the inclusion or exclusion of specific features such as abstracts, authors, and venues has a notable impact on the performance of the SPECTER model across different tasks. The model performs best when it includes essential features like abstracts and avoids features that may introduce noise, such as author names. The use of hard negatives and the choice of a scientifically pre-trained model like SciBERT further enhance the model's effectiveness."}

This is highlighted in Table 4, where it is noted that for such slots, only a few values (like 'none' or 'dontcare') can be correctly predicted using slot-gate classification [9]. However, when the ontology is accessible, DS-Picklist can further reduce error rates since the predicted values can be found in candidate-value lists [4].\n\nIn contrast, DS-DST, which allows for direct interactions between the dialog context and the slot, may perform better in cases where the values are not explicitly mentioned but can be inferred from the context. For example, in the third example from Table 6, DS-Picklist was able to correctly predict the value, while other methods relying on span extraction failed due to formatting issues [2].\n\nThe performance of DS-DST and DS-Picklist on these specific slots can also be seen in image5, which provides accuracy percentages for various models.

According to the text quotes, the pre-training of the Chameleon models was conducted on Meta’s Research Super Cluster (RSC), which uses NVIDIA A100 80 GB GPUs. The primary distinction between the RSC and other research clusters used for alignment is the interconnect technology: RSC employs NVIDIA Quantum InfiniBand, while the research cluster utilizes Elastic Fabric. \n\nThe specific GPU usage for pre-training is detailed in a table (Table 2), which includes data on the number of GPUs used concurrently and the total GPU hours. For instance, the Chameleon-7B model used 1024 GPUs concurrently and consumed 856,481 GPU hours, while the Chameleon-34B model used 3072 GPUs concurrently and consumed 4,282,407 GPU hours. This indicates that the larger Chameleon-34B model required significantly more GPU resources, both in terms of the number of GPUs and the total GPU hours, compared to the smaller Chameleon-7B model.\n\n![The table displays data related to a project named \"Chameleon\" and includes the following columns: Concurrent GPUs and GPU Hours.](image1)\n\nAdditionally, the training curves for the Chameleon-7B and Chameleon-34B models are shown in a graph, which illustrates the training loss over the number of training steps. The graph shows that both models exhibit a decreasing trend in training loss, indicating that they are learning effectively. However, the Chameleon-34B model starts with a lower training loss and maintains a lower loss throughout the training process, suggesting that it may have better performance and efficiency in terms of training dynamics.\n\n![The image is a graph plotting the training loss against the number of training steps for two models, Chameleon-7B and Chameleon-34B.](image2)\n\nIn summary, the Chameleon-34B model requires significantly more GPU resources than the Chameleon-7B model, both in terms of the number of GPUs used concurrently and the total GPU hours consumed.

These areas are crucial for recruiters to master, as they form the foundation of successful talent acquisition. Understanding how to construct accurate Boolean search strings is particularly important, even though next-gen Recruiter tools allow for efficient searching without deep knowledge of Boolean modifiers [4].\n\nOne key aspect of the certification is the ability to search effectively, which ties directly into the use of Boolean logic and visual tools like Venn diagrams. A Venn diagram can help illustrate how different search terms intersect, such as in the case of the search string \"Engineering AND Java NOT Manager\" [2]. This search would target individuals with skills in both Engineering and Java but exclude those who are Managers. The Venn diagram in image7 shows a similar structure, with overlapping circles representing different skill sets and categories. The third circle includes labels like \"A,\" \"C,\" \"D,\" \"F,\" and \"G,\" suggesting a broader set of skills or roles that may overlap with Engineering and Java [7].

Additionally, students must complete two lab rotations with approved supervisors within the first 4 months, each lasting 1.5-2.5 months [1]. These lab rotations are an essential component of the program and involve submission of reports endorsed by supervisors and approved by the ISEP Director [1].\n\nBeyond coursework and lab rotations, there are also requirements related to student engagement activities. For example, students must participate in the ISEP Student Ambassador Scheme, ISEP Buddy Scheme, attendance at PhD Oral Defence Seminars, giving a seminar or conducting a workshop, and conference organization [1]. These activities contribute to a 40-hour teaching/engagement requirement [1].\n\nIn addition to these, there are specific requirements for teaching hours, which include undergraduate teaching and research supervision. Undergraduate teaching is compulsory and involves a maximum of 40 hours, while research supervision allows up to 10 hours [1].\n\nFinally, there are language proficiency assessments, such as the Diagnostic English Test (DET), which is required for all international students, especially those from non-English medium universities.

These institutions offer a glimpse into the past, showcasing various aspects of Norwegian history, from medieval times to the industrial era.\n\nOne such museum is the Bergen’s oldest Latin School, which dates back to 1706 [1]. This historic site not only houses exhibitions about the Norwegian school system and society but also features a thematic exhibition on old natural science posters. The building itself is a testament to the educational legacy of the region.\n\nAnother significant site is Haakon’s Hall, which stands as a 13th-century royal banqueting hall and is the first of its kind to be built in stone [6]. As a living national cultural heritage site, it provides an immersive experience of what life was like for royalty during the Middle Ages.\n\nThe Osterøy Museum offers insight into the rural life of the countryside outside Bergen through story-telling and experiences that link objects with the living cultural heritage of textiles and costumes [3]. The museum's setting in the cultural landscape of Osterøy adds to its charm and educational value.\n\nThe reconstructed Bergen of the 19th and 20th centuries, known as a living museum, allows visitors to delve into the nostalgia of a bygone era [5]. This museum boasts a unique collection of around 50 original wooden buildings that once stood in the center of Bergen, along with a beautiful English-style park and a seawater pool.\n\nFor those interested in the textile industry, Salhus Tricotagefabrik and Arne Fabrikker provide a look into the history of wool turning into clothes [7] and the industrialization of Western Norway [9]. These factories, now museums, highlight the significance of the textile industry in the region's development.\n\nThe UNESCO World Heritage site Bryggen is another key location, where the history of Bergen begins [12]. The walk through this site starts at Bryggens Museum and continues through the wooden buildings at Bryggen, offering a journey through time.\n\nIn addition, the museum associated with violinist Ole Bull, located on an island with a fairy-tale castle-like villa, presents a unique blend of architectural beauty and cultural significance [8].\n\n![A traditional Nordic-style wooden house with a grass roof](image2)\n\n![A stone building with a stepped gable roof on a sunny day](image6)\n\nThe KODE Art Museums of Bergen showcase Norway’s second-largest art collection, featuring works from the 15th century up to the present [11]. These museums not only display art but also provide a dedicated space for children with a workshop and exhibition.\n\n![A circular building with a domed roof](image7)\n\nLastly, Herdla, a small island with its own museum, has exhibitions about its role in World War II and its rich fauna and birdlife [10]. The presence of a German fighter aircraft from WWII makes it a notable site for history enthusiasts.\n\nIn conclusion, these museums in Bergen are all associated with historical or cultural heritage, each offering unique features that reflect different aspects of the region's past."}

This tool helps planners and decision-makers understand the types of medical needs that could arise, enabling them to better prepare and allocate resources.\n\nThe PCOF tool generates tables that show the occurrence probabilities of disease and injury types typically sustained in a contingency by a population at risk. These tables are categorized into casualty types such as wounded in action, nonbattle injuries, disease, and outpatient visits, and they cover a wide range of military operations, including humanitarian assistance, disaster relief, defense support of civil authorities, and combat operations [6]. By using the PCOF tool, planners can employ baselined, mission-centric data and tailor it to fit the anticipated mission more precisely [7].\n\nThe development of the PCOF tool was part of efforts to enhance medical mission planning by moving beyond anecdotal, rule-of-thumb estimates into a repeatable, organized, and robust estimating method [3]. The tool was presented to the Force Health Protection and Readiness, Strategic Analysis Working Group Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Health Affairs as part of the verification, validation, and accreditation (VV&A) plan for service acceptance [9]. Once accredited, the PCOF tool would be approved as the Joint patient occurrence generating application, further integrating it into the military's medical planning processes.\n\n![The image depicts a formal event or ceremony with military personnel and officials, indicating the importance of such tools in military contexts.](image1)"}

The mission involved the USNS Mercy, a hospital ship, which set sail from San Diego in early May 2012 with clinical staff from the Naval Medical Center San Diego and other military units [1]. The primary objective of the mission was to conduct medical and dental civic action programs (MEDCAPS) and surgical civic action programs (SURGCAPS) to treat patients and perform surgeries. Over the course of the mission, more than 49,000 patients were seen and treated ashore, and over 900 surgeries were performed [10]. Additionally, the mission included veterinary care for livestock and domestic animals through VETCAPs, as well as non-medical projects such as engineering repairs and community service donations. The Mercy staff also participated in over 60,000 hours of subject-matter expert exchanges on topics such as first aid, nutrition, and disaster response [10].\n\nIn contrast, the DoD Bone Marrow Program focuses on identifying and registering potential bone marrow donors to support patients in need of transplants. The program, operated by the Navy and Georgetown University, involves collecting donor consent forms and oral swabs with cell samples, which are then tested for genetic compatibility [2]. The goal is to match potential donors with patients who require marrow transplants to treat various life-threatening diseases. Since 2010, the program has been instrumental in supporting research and capacity building in countries like Liberia, where the U.S. Naval Medical Research Unit No. 3 (NAMRU-3) has played a key role in enhancing local medical research capabilities [8]. The program has registered over 730,000 DoD volunteers, with over 5,200 having donated marrow for patients needing transplants [12].\n\nBoth the USNS Mercy Pacific Partnership 2012 and the DoD Bone Marrow Program have significant humanitarian impacts. The USNS Mercy mission provided direct medical care to thousands of patients in multiple countries, addressing immediate health needs and improving access to healthcare in underserved areas.

According to the illustration, the immune response is initiated by CD8+ T cells, which engage with liver cells infected by the malaria parasite. These T cells recognize specific peptides (Pf peptides) presented on the surface of the liver cells via MHC Class I molecules. Once activated, the CD8+ T cells release perforin and granzymes, which induce apoptosis in the infected liver cells, thereby eliminating the parasite [5]. Additionally, the interaction between IFN-γ and Fas/FasR signaling pathways plays a crucial role in the immune response, contributing to the death of the infected cells and the eradication of the parasite.\n\n![The immune system targets malaria parasites through the action of CD8+ T cells, which recognize and destroy infected liver cells.](image5)\n\nThis mechanism highlights the importance of identifying novel antigens for vaccine development, as seen in the research conducted at the Naval Medical Research Center (NMRC) [6].

According to the provided text, the analytics value chain is a critical framework that ensures data moves from collection to impact, emphasizing that partial progress along the chain does not count [3]. This means that for data to truly create value, it must be systematically processed through each stage—collection, analysis, decision-making, action, and finally, impact.\n\nThe levels of analytics, as described in the text, range from basic reporting to advanced predictive modeling and optimization. These levels reflect increasing complexity and strategic value. For instance, standard reports answer \"What happened?\" while statistical analysis explores \"Why is this happening?\" and predictive modeling predicts \"What will happen next?\" [8]. This progression demonstrates how data evolves from simple reporting to more sophisticated insights that drive strategic decisions.\n\nFurthermore, the image titled \"flowchart illustrating a data-driven process that transforms data into value\" provides a visual representation of this transformation. The process begins with \"Data,\" which is stored in a blue cylinder, then moves to \"Reporting,\" where charts and graphs are generated. Next is \"Analysis,\" where insights are gained through in-depth examination. This leads to \"Action,\" where informed decisions are made, and finally results in \"Value,\" shown by an upward trend in a graph [image1]. This flowchart visually reinforces the idea that data must pass through each stage of the analytics value chain to generate meaningful outcomes.\n\nAdditionally, the image comparing \"Reporting\" and \"Analysis\" highlights the differences between these two stages. Reporting is descriptive and backward-looking, while Analysis is prescriptive and forward-looking. It also emphasizes that reporting raises questions, whereas analysis answers them. This distinction underscores the importance of moving beyond mere reporting to deeper analytical processes that provide actionable insights [image2].\n\nIn conclusion, the process of transforming data into business value progresses through the analytics value chain, where data is collected, analyzed, and used to make informed decisions that lead to tangible outcomes. This process is supported by the levels of analytics, which increase in complexity and strategic impact as one moves from basic reporting to advanced predictive modeling. ![The process of transforming data into value involves stages such as data collection, reporting, analysis, action, and impact.](image1)"}

This shift allows organizations to not only understand what has happened but also to explore why it happened, predict future trends, and optimize outcomes.\n\nAccording to the provided figures, business intelligence focuses on standard reports, ad-hoc reports, query drilldown, and alerts, which are primarily descriptive and reactive [8]. These stages help in identifying what occurred and where problems may lie. However, they do not delve into the underlying reasons or provide actionable recommendations. In contrast, business analytics includes statistical analysis, forecasting, predictive modeling, and optimization, which involve deeper exploration of data to uncover causes, anticipate future scenarios, and determine optimal strategies [8].\n\nThis progression is reflected in the way data is handled. While BI transforms data into information through reporting, business analytics goes a step further by combining data and information to generate insights [7]. The data handling process becomes more sophisticated, enabling organizations to make informed decisions based on a comprehensive understanding of their operations.\n\nThe image that illustrates this transition, titled \"Business Intelligence to Business Analytics,\" shows how the increase in both business value and degree of intelligence corresponds with the shift from descriptive to prescriptive analytics [8].

This suggests that while some marketers have frameworks in place, these frameworks do not necessarily prioritize customer engagement.\n\nFurthermore, the quote highlights that \"We struggle to measure customer engagement. We don't have a system to manage it, in part because nobody has singular responsibility for managing it. Unfortunately, it's just not a priority\" [5].

This suggests that the ECU must have at least as many outputs as there are cylinders. Additionally, the ECU is responsible for controlling idle speed [3], which may involve other outputs beyond just the injectors. For instance, it might control an idle air bypass step motor or a programmable throttle stop. These components would also require separate outputs from the ECU.\n\nLooking at the image quotes, image7 provides a detailed diagram of the engine management system, showing the ECU connected to various sensors and injectors. Specifically, it lists six regular injectors (Injector 1 through Injector 6) and one cold start injector, totaling seven injectors [7]. This implies that the ECU must have at least seven outputs to control these injectors. Furthermore, the ECU is connected to other components such as the engine temperature sensor, intake air temperature sensor, mass air flow sensor, throttle position sensor, HEGO sensor, crankshaft sensor, and camshaft sensor, which may require additional inputs rather than outputs.\n\nWhile the exact number of outputs is not directly stated, the presence of multiple injectors and the complexity of the system suggest that the ECU likely has more than just a few outputs.

It involves identifying and understanding the requirements and expectations of stakeholders, ensuring that the development team has a clear and accurate understanding of what needs to be built. This phase includes several key activities that help in gathering and refining the needs before moving into the actual development.\n\nOne of the key components of the 'Needs Exploration' phase is **active stakeholder participation**. This ensures that stakeholders are involved throughout the process, providing feedback and clarifying their expectations. This is essential for aligning the solution with the actual needs of the users and the business [10].\n\nAnother important component is **high-level requirements specification**, which provides an initial understanding of what the system should do. This is followed by **detailed requirements specification**, where the requirements are further refined and documented to ensure clarity and completeness [3].\n\nAdditionally, **split (A/B) testing** may be used to compare different approaches or features, helping to determine which one better meets the needs of the stakeholders. This allows for data-driven decisions and helps in validating assumptions early in the process [5].\n\n**Acceptance test-driven development (ATDD)** is also a key part of this phase. ATDD involves writing acceptance tests before development begins, ensuring that the solution meets the specified requirements. This approach helps in defining clear success criteria and ensures that the development team understands what is expected [1].\n\n**Just-in-time (JIT) model storming** is another important activity. This involves creating models or diagrams at the right time, usually during planning or iteration meetings, to explore and clarify requirements. This helps in quickly addressing any ambiguities and ensures that the team is aligned on the direction of the solution [2].\n\nFinally, **look-ahead modeling** plays a role in anticipating future needs and planning for them.

In telophase, the nuclear membrane begins to re-form around the separated sets of chromosomes, which have moved to opposite ends of the cell [8]. This stage marks the end of the mitotic phase, as the chromosomes start to decondense and the nucleoli reappear [11].\n\nCytokinesis, which often overlaps with telophase, involves the physical division of the cytoplasm. In animal cells, a cleavage furrow forms at the midpoint of the cell, and the plasma membrane grows inward to divide the cell into two [1]. In plant cells, a cell plate forms in the middle from vesicles containing cell wall material, which then grows outward to reach the edges, dividing the contents into two cells [10]. This process is facilitated by structures such as the contractile ring of microfilaments in animal cells or the cell plate in plant cells [6].\n\nThe image showing a cell undergoing telophase and cytokinesis illustrates these processes, with different colors indicating various cellular components such as chromosomes (in blue), the mitotic spindle or microtubules (in red or green), and other structures [8]. ![telophase and cytokinesis](image8).

According to the bar chart comparing survey results between 2005 and 2006, several key security concerns saw a decline in prevalence. For instance, internal breaches of security decreased from 56% in 2005 to 51% in 2006, while external breaches dropped from 25% to 12%. Similarly, concerns about HIPAA compliance fell from 35% to 18%, and unauthorized use of data by third parties declined from 18% to 12%.

The bar chart illustrating the implementation of various security measures today versus the next two years reveals that certain tools are expected to decrease in usage. For example, firewalls, user access controls, and audit logs are projected to drop from 98%, 88%, and 85% respectively in 2006 to 53%, 53%, and 60% in two years. This could indicate a shift towards more advanced or alternative security solutions.

According to the text quote, \"Big Data Pure-Play Revenue \\$468M in '1,\" which indicates that the total revenue generated by pure-play vendors in 2011 was $468 million. This figure is corroborated by image1, which presents a bar chart showing the yearly big data revenue for various pure-play vendors in 2011. The chart includes specific vendors such as Vertica, Opera Solutions, and Splunk, with their respective revenues. For instance, Vertica had a revenue of $84 million, while Splunk had $45 million. The \"Other\" category collectively represents vendors not individually listed, with a combined revenue of $10 million. This suggests that while the pure-play vendors were generating significant revenue, they were still relatively small compared to the broader big data market.\n\nIn contrast, the overall revenue of the big data market in 2011 was much higher. The text quote states, \"Big Data Overall Revenue \\$5.1B in'1,\" indicating that the overall revenue was $5.1 billion. This highlights the fact that the big data market was not only dominated by pure-play vendors but also included other players such as large technology companies and consulting firms. Image6 supports this by presenting a horizontal bar chart of companies with Big Data revenues exceeding $100 million, including major corporations like IBM, Intel, and HP. These companies likely contributed significantly to the overall revenue, further emphasizing the disparity between pure-play and overall vendor revenues.\n\nLooking at the projected growth of big data revenue from 2012 to 2017, image4 provides a line graph depicting financial data from 2012 to 2017. The graph shows a general upward trend, with notable data points including $5.1 billion in 2012, $10.2 billion in 2013, $16.8 billion in 2014, $32.1 billion in 2015, $48.0 billion in 2016, and $53.4 billion in 2017. This indicates a consistent and substantial increase in big data revenue over the years. The text quote \"Big Data Overall Revenue \\$53.4B By 2017\" confirms the final figure, reinforcing the projection of significant growth.\n\nThe growth of big data revenue can be attributed to several factors. The text quote states, \"Big Data is transforming business the same way IT did. Those that fail to leverage the numerous internal and external data sources available will be leapfrogged by new entrants.\" This suggests that the increasing importance of data in business operations has driven the demand for big data solutions. Additionally, the text quote \"This increased efficiency is leading to adoption of Big Data across a wide variety of industries\" highlights the widespread adoption of big data technologies, contributing to the revenue growth.\n\nIn summary, the revenue trends of big data vendors in 2011 show that pure-play vendors generated $468 million, while the overall revenue was $5.1 billion. The projected growth from 2012 to 2017 indicates a significant increase, reaching $53.4 billion by 2017. This growth is driven by the transformation of business through big data and its increasing adoption across various industries. ![The image is a bar chart that displays the yearly big data revenue in millions of US dollars for various pure-play vendors in 2011.](image1) ![The image is a line graph depicting financial data from 2012 to 2017, showing a general upward trend in big data revenue.](image4)"}

According to Mendel's principles, traits are inherited through discrete units called genes, which exist in different forms known as alleles. In the case of pea plants, when a homozygous dominant plant (PP) with purple flowers is crossed with a homozygous recessive plant (pp) with white flowers, all offspring in the F1 generation are heterozygous (Pp) and display the dominant purple phenotype [11]. This is because the dominant allele (P) masks the expression of the recessive allele (p).\n\nWhen the F1 generation (Pp) is allowed to self-pollinate, the F2 generation exhibits a phenotypic ratio of 3:1, with three-quarters of the plants showing purple flowers and one-quarter showing white flowers. This occurs because the alleles segregate during gamete formation, resulting in four possible combinations: PP, Pp, Pp, and pp. The genotypic ratio in the F2 generation is 1:2:1, representing one homozygous dominant (PP), two heterozygous (Pp), and one homozygous recessive (pp) [11].\n\nThe image provided illustrates this process clearly, showing the genetic cross diagram with the parental generation (PP and pp), the F1 generation (Pp), and the F2 generation with the 3:1 phenotypic ratio and 1:2:1 genotypic ratio [image1]. ![The image illustrates a genetic cross diagram, showcasing the inheritance of traits in plants. It uses a classical Mendelian genetics approach.](image1)\n\nAdditionally, the segregation of alleles and the dominance-recessiveness relationship are further supported by other images. For instance, image4 shows a similar cross between purple-flowered and white-flowered plants, reinforcing the idea that the F2 generation displays the expected 3:1 phenotypic ratio due to the segregation of alleles [image4]. ![This image illustrates Mendelian inheritance. It shows a cross between purple-flowered and white-flowered plants in the P (parent) generation, resulting in all purple-flowered plants in the F₁ generation due to dominant traits. In the F₂ generation, the offspring consist of ¾ purple-flowered and ¼ white-flowered plants, demonstrating the segregation of alleles.](image4)\n\nIn summary, Mendelian inheritance explains the phenotypic and genotypic ratios in the F2 generation of pea plants through the segregation and independent assortment of alleles, leading to predictable patterns of trait expression."}

In the case of a classic Mendelian cross, such as the one described in the text quotes, the F2 generation shows a phenotypic ratio of 3:1, where three-quarters of the offspring display the dominant phenotype, and one-quarter display the recessive phenotype. This is because the F1 generation, which is heterozygous (Pp), produces gametes with equal chances of carrying either the P or p allele. When these gametes combine, the resulting F2 generation has a genotypic ratio of 1:2:1, representing one homozygous dominant (PP), two heterozygous (Pp), and one homozygous recessive (pp) individual.\n\nThe phenotypic ratio of 3:1 arises because both the homozygous dominant (PP) and heterozygous (Pp) individuals express the dominant trait, while only the homozygous recessive (pp) individuals show the recessive trait. This pattern was first observed and documented by Gregor Mendel, who used pea plants to study inheritance patterns. His experiments demonstrated that traits are inherited as discrete units, now known as genes, and that the expression of these traits follows predictable ratios.\n\n![The image illustrates a genetic cross diagram, showcasing the inheritance of traits in plants. It uses a classical Mendelian genetics approach.](image3)\n\nIn addition to the phenotypic and genotypic ratios, it's important to note that the F2 generation also reflects the principles of segregation and independent assortment, which are fundamental to understanding how genetic traits are passed from one generation to the next. These principles help explain why certain traits may appear to \"disappear\" in one generation and reappear in the next, as seen in Mendel's experiments.\n\nThe phenotypic ratio observed in the F2 generation of the plant cross is 3:1, and the genotypic ratio is 1:2:1."}

These errors can hinder search engines' ability to understand and properly index the content, leading to reduced visibility and lower rankings. For instance, the \"Blog\" section shows 72,441 items with errors, which could result in improper categorization or missed opportunities for rich snippets. Similarly, the \"hatom\" and \"hentry\" sections have all items with errors, indicating potential issues with microformat implementation that may prevent search engines from extracting meaningful information.\n\nIn addition, the meta description and title tag table [3] reveals several problems, including duplicate meta descriptions (2,215 pages), long meta descriptions (21 pages), short meta descriptions (1,450 pages), and missing title tags (10 pages). These issues can negatively affect click-through rates from search engine results pages (SERPs) because meta descriptions and title tags are crucial for attracting user attention and conveying the relevance of a page. Duplicate meta descriptions may also lead to penalties or reduced visibility, as search engines may perceive the content as low-quality or duplicated.\n\n![Structured markup errors and meta description issues can significantly impact SEO performance](image7)  \n![Meta description and title tag issues affecting SEO performance](image3)  \n\nIn conclusion, structured markup errors and meta description issues can harm SEO performance by reducing the effectiveness of search engine indexing and user engagement."}

One of the primary issues is a siloed approach, which is identified as the greatest barrier to adopting a customer management approach [4]. This suggests that different departments or teams within an organization often operate in isolation, leading to fragmented strategies and a lack of cohesive customer insights.\n\nAnother major barrier is the lack of leadership commitment and guidance, which is essential for driving sustainable process, infrastructure, organizational, and cultural growth [8]. Without strong leadership, it is difficult to implement and maintain an integrated customer management approach across all areas of the business.\n\nText quotes also emphasize the importance of focusing on engagement rather than just reach and frequency. The wrong metrics, such as an overemphasis on reach and not enough on engagement, are a significant issue [2]. Additionally, there is a tendency to drown in data without gaining meaningful insights, which can hinder effective decision-making [2].\n\nThe complexity of the marketing funnel is another challenge. While awareness is important, the middle stages of the funnel, which involve considerations, preferences, and actions, are influenced by factors outside of a marketer's control, such as recommendations from friends or family and product reviews [3]. This complexity makes it difficult to track and measure customer behavior effectively.\n\nImage quotes provide visual evidence of these challenges. For instance, image6 shows a bar chart highlighting common barriers to effective coordination and execution in business operations. The chart indicates that 52% of respondents identified \"There is no single ownership of the experience resulting in siloed approaches and misaligned goals\" as a significant issue [6]. This aligns with the text quote that emphasizes the siloed approach as a major barrier [4].\n\nAnother relevant image is image1, which displays a horizontal bar chart showing the frequency of a factor. The categories include \"Seldom or Never a Factor\" (20%), \"Often a Factor\" (32%), and \"Primary Factor\" (11%). This visual representation underscores the varying degrees to which different factors influence the adoption of an integrated customer management approach [1].\n\n![The image is a horizontal bar chart with three categories showing the frequency of a factor: \"Seldom or Never a Factor\" - 20%, \"Often a Factor\" - 32%, \"Primary Factor\" - 11%. Each category is represented with a green bar indicating its percentage value.](image1)\n\nAdditionally, image6 provides further insight into the challenges faced by organizations. It shows that 46% of respondents indicated that \"We are too siloed by business line/product/brand\" is a significant issue [6]. This reinforces the idea that siloed structures are a major obstacle to adopting an integrated customer management approach.\n\n![The image shows a bar chart that appears to represent reasons for challenges in a business context, specifically related to ownership of experiences, siloed approaches, and support for certain business strategies or technologies. The chart lists different issues on the left, with corresponding percentages that reflect how frequently they are identified as challenges.](image6)\n\nIn conclusion, the major barriers preventing the adoption of an integrated customer management approach include a siloed organizational structure, lack of leadership commitment, incorrect focus on metrics, and the complexity of the marketing funnel."}

This shift aligns with the broader trends observed in website and technology adoption for the next two years, as illustrated in other images.\n\nFor instance, image1 highlights a decrease in the implementation of various security measures over the next two years, such as firewalls (from 98% today to 53% in two years) and user access controls (from 88% today to 53% in two years). This suggests that organizations may be prioritizing different aspects of security or facing challenges in maintaining current levels of implementation. Similarly, image5 shows an increase in the adoption of technologies like single sign-on/identity management (from not available in 2005 to 79% in 2006) and bar code technology (from 59% in 2005 to 69% in 2006), indicating a growing emphasis on efficient and secure technology solutions.\n\nIn addition, image2 provides insights into the results of various activities related to healthcare or organizational services between 2005 and 2006.

The image demonstrates how our brain naturally organizes visual elements into groups and perceives them as a unified whole, even when they are not complete or clearly defined.\n\nFor instance, the principle of **closure** is evident in the way the \"G\" and \"E\" are designed; even though parts of the shape may be missing, we still perceive them as a complete form [11]. Similarly, the principle of **proximity** is demonstrated through the grouping of small rectangles to form the letter \"E,\" suggesting that closely positioned elements are seen as part of a single unit [3]. \n\nThe **similarity** principle is also present, as the letters \"T\" and \"A\" share a similar striped pattern, leading us to group them together visually [10]. Additionally, the **continuity** principle is shown in the smooth flow of the \"S,\" which appears as a continuous line despite its complex shape [3]. Lastly, the **pregnancy** (or Prägnanz) principle is reflected in the simplicity and clarity of the \"A,\" emphasizing that our perception favors concise and structured forms [4].\n\n![The word \"GESTALT\" is designed using various Gestalt principles, such as closure, proximity, similarity, continuity, and pregnancy, to create a unified and meaningful visual perception.](image2)"}

As organizations plan for future systems that aim to consolidate information and unify efforts [5], there is a clear need for specialized roles to support these transitions. For instance, the bar chart in image2 highlights the distribution of roles or functions within Health IT, with significant percentages allocated to Clinical Informaticists (24%), Process/Workflow Design (24%), and Application Support (22%). These roles are essential for managing the complex tasks involved in implementing and maintaining an intranet system that supports functions like patient registration, demographics, insurance validation, billing, and more [6].\n\nAdditionally, the bar chart in image4 shows a projected decrease in the use of certain intranet functions, such as posting policies and procedures (from 87% today to 70% in two years) and staff communication (from 82% to 70%). This suggests that the focus may shift from administrative tasks to more clinical and data-driven functions. The image also indicates an increase in access to patient clinical information (from 45% to 53%) and physician access for clinical orders (from 44% to 57%), which aligns with the need for skilled professionals who can manage and optimize these critical areas.\n\nFurthermore, the diffusion of innovations model in image3 illustrates how new technologies and systems are adopted over time. This model suggests that early adopters will play a crucial role in driving the implementation of new intranet functions, which in turn will require staffing that can support these innovations. The roles highlighted in image2, such as Clinical Champions (15%) and Systems Integration (15%), are particularly relevant here, as they are likely to be instrumental in facilitating the adoption of new intranet functionalities.\n\nFinally, the security measures in image6 show a decline in the use of certain security protocols, such as firewalls (from 98% today to 53% in two years) and user access controls (from 88% to 53%). This shift may indicate a move towards more advanced and integrated security solutions, which would require staffing with expertise in these areas. The current staffing needs in Health IT must therefore account for both the technical and strategic aspects of intranet development and maintenance.\n\nIn conclusion, the expected changes in intranet functions over the next two years highlight the need for a well-rounded and specialized Health IT workforce that can support the transition to more integrated and efficient systems. ![The image depicts a diagram illustrating a Health Information Exchange system.](image1)"}

This method focuses on the last interaction a customer had before converting, often overlooking the contributions of earlier touchpoints.\n\n![The most common method marketers use to calculate attribution for a transaction is attributing activity to the most recent touchpoint.](image2)\n\nThis preference for last-click attribution can lead to an incomplete understanding of how different marketing channels contribute to conversions. As noted in the text quotes, this practice can mask the impact of other advertising media and result in misallocated budgets [1]. For instance, 71% of Paid Search clicks are navigational, meaning they are not bringing in new prospects but rather delivering people who are already actively looking for a brand [5]. Despite this, these earlier interactions, such as banner ads, often receive no performance attribution because the focus remains on the last click [5].\n\nMoreover, the reliance on last-click attribution is a significant issue, with 55% of marketers admitting they use a standard or consistent framework to measure all marketing activity, but this does not necessarily mean they are using advanced attribution models [8]. The data without insight stage of the flowchart highlights how marketers may have access to data but fail to derive meaningful insights from it [1]. This lack of insight can further perpetuate the use of simplistic attribution methods.\n\n![The image illustrates a cycle involving four stages: Action without data, Data without insight, Insight without context, and Context without action.](image1)\n\nIn conclusion, the most common method marketers use to calculate attribution for a transaction is attributing activity to the most recent touchpoint."}

This indicates that the 8751H consumes more power under the same test conditions, where all outputs are disconnected and the EA pin is at V_CC. The higher current consumption may be due to additional features or enhanced performance capabilities of the 8751H.\n\n![Power supply current for the 8751H is higher than other devices](image8)\n\n### Timing Parameters\n\nIn terms of timing parameters, the 8751H has specific characteristics that distinguish it from other devices. For example, image2 provides a table of timing parameters for different oscillators, including the 8751H. The **12 MHz oscillator** and **variable oscillator** timings show variations in minimum and maximum values for parameters like **ALE Pulse Width**, **Address Valid to ALE Low**, and others. These values are crucial for ensuring proper synchronization between signals in the microcontroller's operation.\n\nAdditionally, image4 and image5 illustrate timing diagrams for various operations, such as **external program memory read cycles** and **data memory read cycles**. These diagrams highlight how the **ALE**, **PSEN**, and **PORT** signals interact with timing intervals like **TLHLL**, **TLLWL**, and **TAVLL**. While these diagrams do not explicitly differentiate between the 8751H and other devices, they provide a general framework for understanding timing requirements, which may vary based on the specific device's architecture.\n\n![Timing diagram showing signal interactions](image4)\n\n![External program memory read cycle timing diagram](image5)\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe 8751H microcontroller has a higher power supply current (250 mA) compared to other devices like the 8031AH/8051AH/8051AHP (125 mA) and the 8032AH/8052AH/8751BH/8752BH (175 mA).

To answer this, we need to focus on the relevant information from the text and image quotes provided.\n\nFrom the text quotes, we learn that closure is a key principle in Gestalt psychology, where individuals perceive objects as whole even when they are not complete [9]. This principle is about filling in visual gaps to create a coherent whole.\n\nLooking at the image quotes, image3 is described as an optical illusion known as the \"impossible trident\" or \"blivet,\" which depicts an object with three cylindrical prongs that seem to emerge from a single bar or base. This image challenges the viewer's perception of three-dimensional objects and plays with perspective [3]. While this image is an example of an impossible shape, it does not directly illustrate the concept of closure.\n\nHowever, image7 provides a more direct connection. It shows the word \"GESTALT\" using various principles of Gestalt psychology, including closure. Specifically, the \"G\" and \"E\" together make us perceive a closed shape or form, even though part of it is missing [7]. This is a clear example of how closure works in visual perception.\n\nAnother relevant image is image5, which shows two simple geometric shapes: a circle and a rectangle, both outlined with dashed lines. While this image does not explicitly demonstrate closure, it could be interpreted as a representation of incomplete shapes, which relates to the principle of closure.\n\nIn conclusion, the slide uses the shapes of the \"G\" and \"E\" in the word \"GESTALT\" to illustrate the closure aspect of the Gestalt Principle of Visual Perception. These shapes create the illusion of a closed form despite being incomplete.\n\n![closure](image7)"}

Instead, they describe the services and focus areas of various teams within PwC.\n\nFor example, [1] mentions that PwC provides lead financial advisory services across multiple industry sectors, while [2] discusses the CiPS team's work in capital-intensive industries such as power & utilities, industrial products, real estate & construction, and transport & logistics. [3] highlights the team's role in supporting clients with commercial and strategic valuation decisions, and [4] outlines the support provided to private equity firms and corporate clients through mergers, acquisitions, and disposals.\n\nIn addition, [6] describes a rotational program in Consulting, where participants gain exposure to different consulting business areas and work with clients to drive innovation and growth.

The upper basket is designed to hold more delicate and lighter dishware such as glasses, coffee and tea cups, while the lower basket is suitable for larger and more robust items like pots, pans, lids, serving dishes, and bowls. It is recommended to load the lower basket first, then the upper one, ensuring that all utensils are stacked securely and do not tip over [9]. Curved or recessed items should be loaded at an angle so that water can run off, and hollow items like cups, glasses, and pans should be placed with their openings facing downward to prevent water from collecting inside [4]. Additionally, long and sharp items of cutlery, such as carving knives, must be positioned horizontally in the upper basket to avoid potential hazards [4].\n\nFor cutlery, it is important to ensure that the spray arms can rotate freely during the washing cycle. Sharp items should be located so that they do not damage the door seal, and knives and other utensils with sharp points must be loaded with their points facing down or placed in a horizontal position [6]. Furthermore, glasses should not touch each other to avoid damage, and dishes and items of cutlery must not lie inside one another or cover each other [4]. Overloading the dishwasher is also discouraged, as it can lead to poor results and increased energy consumption [4].\n\nImproper loading can result in poor washing quality, as indicated by the warning sign in image5: \"WARNING: Non compliance with the loading can result to poor washing quality.\" This highlights the importance of following the loading guidelines to ensure effective cleaning and prevent damage to both the dishes and the dishwasher itself.\n\n![Non compliance with the loading can result to poor washing quality](image5)\n\nIn addition to these guidelines, the dishwasher must be level for proper operation and wash performance. This involves checking the level using a spirit level and adjusting the three leveling legs individually while being careful not to let the dishwasher tip over [3]. The dishwasher should also be connected to the main water valve using new hose sets, and the power supply must be properly installed by a qualified electrician [10].\n\n![The image shows four black circles connected in a vertical line, each containing a white number.

The process involves two consecutive divisions—meiosis I and meiosis II—each with distinct characteristics in terms of chromosome separation and cell division.\n\nIn meiosis I, homologous chromosomes separate, reducing the chromosome number by half. This stage is similar to mitosis in that it involves the alignment and separation of chromosomes, but there is a key difference: during meiosis I, the homologous chromosomes—each consisting of two sister chromatids—separate, whereas in mitosis, sister chromatids separate [11]. This separation of homologous chromosomes is crucial for genetic diversity, as it allows for the independent assortment of chromosomes. The image2 depicts this process, showing the separation of sister chromatids and the formation of haploid daughter cells [2]. Additionally, the diagram in image4 highlights the stages of meiosis, including the separation of homologous chromosomes during anaphase I, which is a critical step in reducing the chromosome number [4].\n\nIn contrast, meiosis II is more similar to mitosis, as it involves the separation of sister chromatids. During meiosis II, the sister chromatids, which were previously joined at the centromere, are pulled apart to opposite poles of the cell. This results in the formation of four haploid daughter cells, each containing a single set of chromosomes. The image6 illustrates this process, showing anaphase II where chromatids are separating and telophase II where the cell is finishing division, forming two new nuclei [6]. The diagram in image7 also shows the stages of meiosis, with image E representing early anaphase, image F representing anaphase, and image H representing telophase, all of which are part of meiosis II [7].\n\nThe stages of meiosis I and meiosis II differ not only in the type of chromosome separation but also in the number of cells produced. Meiosis I results in two haploid cells, while meiosis II divides each of these cells into two, resulting in a total of four haploid cells. This distinction is clearly illustrated in the diagrams, with image2 showing the formation of haploid daughter cells after meiosis II [2], and image6 showing the final stages of meiosis where four haploid cells are formed [6].\n\nIn summary, meiosis I involves the separation of homologous chromosomes, reducing the chromosome number by half, while meiosis II involves the separation of sister chromatids, resulting in the formation of four haploid cells. These differences are clearly depicted in the provided images and diagrams.\n\n![The image illustrates the stages of cell division, specifically meiosis.

For instance, P2.6 is held at a logic high during the programming of the security feature, while Port 0, Port 1, and pins P2.0-P2.3 can be in any state [12]. Additionally, the other pins should be held at the \"Security\" levels indicated in Table 3 [12].\n\nIn terms of the specific pin and signal configurations, the table in image5 provides detailed information about the required pin settings for different modes of operation, including the programming of lock bits.

When the user is engaged in a workout, the watch displays different colors for various heart rate zones, which are calculated using either the maximum heart rate percentage or the HRR (heart rate reserve) percentage method [2]. These zones help users understand how hard they are working relative to their personal fitness levels.\n\nFor instance, during an outdoor run, the watch will show different colors depending on whether the user is in the Extreme, Anaerobic, Aerobic, Fat-burning, or Warm-up zone [1]. The corresponding heart rate values are calculated based on the selected method, and these values are reflected in the color-coded zones on the screen. This allows users to monitor their effort level in real time and adjust their workout accordingly.\n\nDuring a workout, the user can swipe on the watch screen to check their real-time heart rate and heart rate zone [3]. Additionally, the watch can detect the workout status automatically, and once it detects an increase in activity, it will remind the user to start recording the workout session [7]. The heart rate measurement frequency also varies depending on the activity intensity, with high-intensity activities like running triggering measurements every second [8].\n\nThe workout data, including heart rate, pace, distance, and time, is displayed on the watch screen, and users can customize what data they want to see during the workout [11]. After completing the workout, the user can check their average heart rate, maximum heart rate, and heart rate zone on the workout results screen [3]. The Huawei Health app also provides detailed graphs showing changes in heart rate, maximum heart rate, and average heart rate for each workout [10].\n\n![The image shows a fitness tracker display with heart rate, pace, distance, time, and mode information, along with colored segments representing training zones.](image2)"}

Specifically, it shows that out of 19,503 total leads, 10,051 become Marketing Qualified Leads (MQLs), 668 become Sales Accepted Leads (SALs), 555 become Sales Qualified Leads (SQLs), and finally, 37 become actual Sales Won Opportunities (SWOs). The conversion rates between these stages are 52.07% from Lead to MQL, 1.50% from MQL to SAL, 83.08% from SAL to SQL, and 6.67% from SQL to SWO.\n\nThese conversion rates can be compared to the average conversion rates provided in marketing diagnostics, such as those in image7. According to image7, the average conversion rate from MQLs to SALs is 4-8%, which is significantly higher than the 1.50% observed in the lead funnel progression. Similarly, the average conversion rate from SALs to SQLs is 45-75%, which is much higher than the 83.08% seen in the lead funnel progression. Finally, the average conversion rate from SQLs to SWOs is 20-30%, which is also higher than the 6.67% observed in the lead funnel progression.\n\nThis comparison suggests that the lead funnel progression may not be performing as well as the average conversion rates in marketing diagnostics. This could indicate areas for improvement in the lead qualification and sales processes. For example, the low conversion rate from MQLs to SALs (1.50%) may suggest that the leads generated by the marketing team are not being effectively qualified by the sales team. Similarly, the low conversion rate from SQLs to SWOs (6.67%) may indicate that the sales team is not effectively converting opportunities into actual sales.\n\nTo address these issues, it may be necessary to improve the quality of leads generated by the marketing team, enhance the lead qualification process, and provide additional training to the sales team. Additionally, it may be beneficial to use more advanced marketing attribution models to better understand the impact of different marketing channels on conversions.\n\n![Lead Funnel Progression](image10)"}

This progression is essential for moving from basic business intelligence to more advanced business analytics.\n\nReporting serves as the foundation of the analytics value chain by providing descriptive insights through dashboards, alerts, and reports [9]. It answers the question \"What happened?\" by summarizing historical data and presenting it in an accessible format. The image depicting a comparison between reporting and analysis highlights this distinction, showing that reporting is backward-looking and raises questions, whereas analysis is forward-looking and aims to answer them [4].\n\nAnalysis, on the other hand, goes beyond mere description to provide prescriptive insights. It involves examining data in depth to uncover patterns, trends, and correlations that can inform decision-making. This stage of the analytics value chain is critical for driving impact, as it enables organizations to make informed decisions based on evidence rather than intuition. The image illustrating the progression from business intelligence to business analytics shows how analysis contributes to higher business value and greater intelligence [7].\n\nIn the context of the analytics value chain, reporting and analysis work together to ensure that data is not only collected and analyzed but also used to drive meaningful actions. Reporting provides the necessary context, while analysis offers the insights needed to take action. This synergy is vital for achieving the ultimate goal of the analytics value chain: creating value through data-driven decisions.\n\n![The image illustrates the progression from Business Intelligence to Business Analytics, showing an increase in both business value and degree of intelligence as one moves up the hierarchy.](image7)"}

This suggests that 18mm is considered adequate for many applications. However, text quote [5] mentions that thicker plywood may be used when the weight of concrete causes a standard thickness plywood to bow out, distorting the concrete face. This implies that 25mm sheeting could be more suitable in situations where additional strength is required to prevent deformation.\n\nAdditionally, image3 provides a table listing dimensions for construction materials, including sheeting for slabs, beams, column sides, and beam bottoms with thickness from 25 mm to 40 mm. This supports the idea that 25mm sheeting is a common and appropriate choice for timber formwork, especially in scenarios requiring greater durability and resistance to bending.\n\nWhile 20mm sheeting is not explicitly mentioned in the provided quotes, it is reasonable to infer that it might be less commonly used than 25mm sheeting, as 25mm is listed as a standard thickness in the table.

This suggests that financial constraints became a more significant barrier over time. In contrast, the issue of lack of staffing resources decreased slightly, from 17% in 2005 to 13% in 2006 [2], indicating some improvement in this area.\n\nAnother key change was the rise in challenges related to vendors' inability to effectively deliver products, which increased from 12% in 2005 to 18% in 2006 [2]. This highlights growing concerns about the reliability and effectiveness of IT vendors. Additionally, the difficulty in proving quantifiable benefits or return on investment (ROI) for IT systems remained relatively stable, with only a slight decrease from 11% in 2005 to 10% in 2006 [2].\n\nThe issue of achieving end-user acceptance also saw a decline, dropping from 11% in 2005 to 8% in 2006 [2], suggesting that user resistance to new technologies may have lessened. However, the lack of clinical leadership increased slightly, from 8% in 2005 to 10% in 2006 [2], indicating ongoing challenges in aligning IT initiatives with clinical needs.\n\nThe lack of top management support remained consistent at 7% in both years [2], showing that leadership commitment did not significantly change. Meanwhile, the lack of a strategic IT plan improved, decreasing from 6% in 2005 to 4% in 2006 [2], which could reflect better planning and coordination in some organizations.\n\nA new concern emerged in 2006, with 4% of organizations citing laws prohibiting technology sharing as a barrier, compared to 0% in 2005 [2].

One of the most significant barriers to implementing IT, as highlighted in the text quote [9], is the lack of financial support, which increased slightly from 18% in 2005 to 20% in 2006, as shown in image1. This suggests that financial constraints remained a persistent challenge for healthcare organizations during this period.\n\nAnother key barrier was the lack of staffing resources, which decreased from 17% in 2005 to 13% in 2006, according to image1. This indicates some improvement in staffing availability or perhaps a shift in focus toward other challenges. However, the vendor's inability to effectively deliver products increased from 12% in 2005 to 18% in 2006, suggesting growing dissatisfaction with vendors' performance.\n\nIn terms of security concerns, image3 reveals that internal breaches of security were the top concern in both years, decreasing from 56% in 2005 to 51% in 2006. External breaches also saw a significant decline, from 25% in 2005 to 12% in 2006.

In standard consumption economics, the principle of diminishing marginal utility suggests that as a person consumes more units of a good, the additional satisfaction (or utility) gained from each subsequent unit decreases. This is clearly illustrated in image1, which shows a table where the utility from each additional hot dog consumed decreases, eventually becoming negative. For instance, the first hot dog provides a utility of +6, while the 66th hot dog results in a utility of -50. This reflects the idea that beyond a certain point, consuming more of the same item leads to less enjoyment or even dissatisfaction [1].\n\nHowever, in competitive contexts, the dynamics of utility can shift dramatically. Image1 also highlights a \"Differential Outcome\" section, where utility jumps from -50 to +5000 at 64 hot dogs. This represents a scenario where the consumption of hot dogs is not just about personal satisfaction but is tied to achieving a competitive goal—such as winning a hot dog eating contest. In this case, the utility derived from consuming the 64th hot dog is not about personal enjoyment but about outperforming an opponent. The individual's focus on winning may override the diminishing marginal utility, leading to a significant increase in utility when they reach a critical point in the competition.\n\nIn contrast, image8 provides a simpler illustration of diminishing marginal utility, showing that the utility from each additional hot dog decreases progressively, from +10 for the first to -10 for the sixth. This aligns with the standard economic theory of diminishing returns, where each additional unit provides less satisfaction than the previous one.\n\n![The image shows a table illustrating concepts of diminishing marginal utility and differential outcome related to hot dog consumption.](image1)\n\n![The image shows a table displaying the relationship between the number of hot dogs consumed and the utility derived from each hot dog.](image8)\n\nIn summary, while standard consumption economics emphasizes the decline in utility with increased consumption, competitive contexts can alter this dynamic, where utility may increase sharply at specific points due to the desire to achieve a competitive advantage."}

However, quote [3] mentions the need to maintain a sufficiently high temperature for the concrete to reach its setting point. This implies that in certain conditions, especially in cold environments, heaters might be necessary to ensure proper curing of the concrete. While this is not directly stated, it is a logical inference based on the importance of temperature control during concrete pouring and setting.\n\nIn terms of image quotes, none of the images explicitly show heaters being used in the context of casting a tunnel framework. However, image8 provides a structural diagram that includes a label indicating \"heater\" with a visual representation of heat or air rising from them. While this image is more about structural design and reinforcement, it does suggest that heaters could be part of a broader construction setup, possibly in contexts where temperature control is important.\n\nGiven the information available, it is reasonable to infer that heaters might be required during the stage where the slab concrete is placed (Stage 5), as mentioned in quote [3], to ensure the concrete reaches its setting point under optimal conditions. This would be particularly relevant in environments where ambient temperatures are low.\n\n![The image shows a structural diagram with a labeled \"heater\" and visual representation of heat or air rising from it.](image8)"}

On-campus supermarkets generally have extended operating hours, often open late into the night, providing convenience for students who may have irregular schedules or prefer to shop after classes. For instance, the Zhaolanyuan Supermarket operates from 9:00am to 8:00pm [8], while the Tmall campus stores, such as the Zijing store, are open from 8:30am to 11:30pm [8]. These long hours allow students to shop at any time during the day or evening.\n\nIn contrast, off-campus supermarkets typically have more limited hours. For example, Lotus Supermarket and BHG Supermarket in the Wudaokou area are open from 9:00am to 9:00pm [4], and Carrefour in the Zhongguancun area is open from 8:30am to 10:00pm [4]. These hours are shorter compared to some on-campus options, which may require students to plan their shopping trips around these times.\n\nAdditionally, some off-campus supermarkets may not offer online shopping services, which could further limit students' flexibility. For instance, the \"Off-Campus Supermarkets Online Shopping\" image quote indicates that this service might not be available for all off-campus locations [12].\n\nThe differences in opening hours can influence students' shopping habits. On-campus supermarkets, with their longer hours, may be more convenient for students who need to shop late at night or during early mornings. However, off-campus supermarkets might offer a wider variety of products or better prices, which could encourage students to make special trips despite the shorter hours.\n\n![The image shows an outdoor kiosk with a yellow sign displaying Chinese characters.

By 2010, the share of time spent with family and friends decreased to 21%, while time dedicated to fitness increased significantly to 17%. Other activities such as watching films and fitness saw increases, while activities like reading and hobbies saw declines [image6].\n\nThis change in activity patterns could be linked to broader societal shifts, including changes in education and training participation. For instance, the training program for CTBT experts, which attracted 425 registered participants from 105 countries, highlights a growing global interest in specialized knowledge and skills development [image2]. As more individuals engage in educational and professional training programs, they may prioritize activities that align with personal or career growth, such as fitness or skill-building, over traditional leisure activities like reading or hobbies.\n\nMoreover, the rise in fitness as a weekend activity might reflect an increasing awareness of health and wellness, possibly influenced by educational campaigns or trends in public health. Similarly, the decline in time spent on hobbies and reading could indicate a shift toward more structured or goal-oriented activities, which may be encouraged by educational institutions or professional development initiatives.\n\nIn summary, the shift in weekend activities between 2005 and 2010 reflects changing priorities, potentially influenced by global educational participation trends and a growing emphasis on health and skill development. ![Changes in weekend activity distribution between 2005 and 2010](image6)"}

It showcases how people lived in the countryside outside Bergen, with old buildings that reflect traditional lifestyles. The museum uses storytelling and hands-on experiences to connect visitors with the living cultural heritage of textiles, costumes, weaving, and local building customs [10]. This emphasis on rural life and traditional crafts gives the museum a distinct character, linking past practices to present-day cultural identity. ![Osterøy Museum showcases traditional rural life and cultural heritage](image10).\n\nIn contrast, the Textile Industry Museum, which includes the Oleana Économusée and Salhus Tricotagefabrik, focuses on the industrial history of the textile sector in Western Norway. The Oleana Économusée provides insight into the development of the textile industry, including the history of Arne Fabrikker, one of the largest textile factories in Norway during the 1950s [1]. The Salhus Tricotagefabrik, a listed factory from 1859, offers a glimpse into how wool was transformed into clothing, highlighting the technological and economic advancements of the time [6]. These institutions emphasize the role of industry in shaping the region's economy and community development.\n\nWhile the Osterøy Museum preserves and interprets rural traditions and craftsmanship, the Textile Industry Museum celebrates the industrial innovations that contributed to Norway's economic growth. Both museums, however, play a vital role in preserving and sharing the diverse cultural and historical narratives of the Bergen region. \n\nIn conclusion, the Osterøy Museum reflects the traditional rural life and cultural heritage of the area, while the Textile Industry Museum highlights the industrial progress and economic development of the textile sector in Western Norway."}

Interphase is further divided into three sub-phases: G₁ (growth and increase in cytoplasm), S (duplication of chromosomes), and G₂ (growth and preparation for division) [2]. During the S phase, chromosomes duplicate, and the copies begin to separate from each other [6]. The eukaryotic cell cycle includes these phases, with the mitotic phase involving mitosis (division of the nucleus) and cytokinesis (division of the cytoplasm) [4].\n\n![The cell cycle consists of interphase and the mitotic phase, with interphase containing G1, S, and G2 phases, and the mitotic phase including mitosis and cytokinesis](image1)\n\nDuring the mitotic phase, the cell undergoes mitosis, where the nucleus divides, and cytokinesis, where the cytoplasm divides, resulting in two daughter cells [4]. The process of chromosome duplication and separation is a key aspect of the cell cycle. For instance, during the S phase, chromosomes duplicate, and each chromosome appears as two sister chromatids joined at the centromere [8]. This ensures that each daughter cell receives an identical set of chromosomes.\n\n![Chromosomes duplicate during the S phase, with each chromosome appearing as two sister chromatids joined at the centromere](image2)\n\nIn prokaryotic cells, the cell cycle involves a single circular chromosome duplicating, followed by the cell elongating and the chromosomal copies separating, with the plasma membrane growing inward to divide the cells [6]. Unlike mitosis, meiosis has two divisions, but it is also preceded by interphase [9]. The cell cycle is essential for multiplying cells, as it ensures the accurate distribution of genetic material to daughter cells [11].\n\n![The cell cycle multiplies cells by ensuring the accurate distribution of genetic material to daughter cells](image11)"}

This conversion rate varies across different datasets, and understanding these differences can provide insights into the performance of marketing strategies.\n\nFrom the dataset in image4, the conversion rate from MQL to SAL is 1.50%. This figure indicates that only a small percentage of MQLs are being accepted by the sales team, which could suggest that either the MQL criteria are too broad, or the sales team is not effectively engaging with the leads. The low conversion rate might also indicate a lack of alignment between marketing and sales teams, as well as potential issues with lead quality.\n\nIn contrast, the cross-industry average conversion rate from MQL to SAL, as shown in image7, ranges from 4-8%. This is significantly higher than the 1.50% observed in image4. The discrepancy suggests that the organization represented in image4 may be underperforming compared to industry standards. A lower conversion rate could imply that the MQLs generated by the marketing team are not sufficiently qualified or that the sales team is not adequately equipped to handle these leads.\n\nAnother dataset that provides context is found in image5, which shows the conversion ratios for various lead sources. While this dataset does not specifically mention the MQL to SAL conversion rate, it highlights the importance of lead source performance. For instance, AppExchange has a high conversion ratio of 50.88%, while Sponsorship has a much lower ratio of 5.44%. These differences underscore the importance of selecting the right lead sources and optimizing the lead generation process to ensure that a higher proportion of leads are qualified and ready for sales.\n\nThe implications of these differences are significant. A low conversion rate from MQL to SAL can result in wasted resources, as marketing efforts may be directed toward leads that do not convert. It can also lead to frustration within the sales team, who may feel overwhelmed by the volume of unqualified leads. On the other hand, a higher conversion rate indicates that the marketing team is effectively identifying and nurturing leads that are likely to become customers, which can improve overall sales performance and customer acquisition.\n\nIn conclusion, the conversion rate from MQL to SAL varies across different datasets, with some showing much lower rates than industry averages. This variation highlights the need for organizations to continuously evaluate and refine their lead qualification processes to ensure that they are generating high-quality leads that can be effectively converted by the sales team. \n\n![The table displays the following data: Total Leads, Marketing Qualified Leads (MQL), Sales Accepted Leads (SAL), Sales Qualified Leads (SQL), and Sales Won Opportunities (SWO), along with their respective conversion rates.](image4)"}
