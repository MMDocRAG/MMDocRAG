This surge in activity aligns with broader trends in the Bay Area, where transit systems like Caltrain are struggling to accommodate the growing number of commuters ![Crowded train interior](image2).\n\nThe Caltrain system, which serves these areas, has seen ridership increase from approximately 4,000 daily trips to around 20,000, with projections suggesting a need to double ridership to 120,000 daily trips in the next decade [10]. However, the current infrastructure and service levels are insufficient to handle this demand, leading to overcrowding on trains ![Northbound train capacities and loads](image6). The system’s capacity issues are further exacerbated by the fact that 40% of commuters still drive alone, highlighting the need for expanded transit options and better integration with other transportation modes [2].\n\nEfforts to address these challenges include plans to increase service frequency and reliability, as well as funding for grade separations to reduce delays at rail crossings [3]. However, funding disparities between San Mateo and Santa Clara counties complicate these initiatives [3]. Additionally, the region’s focus on transit-oriented development—accommodating 80% of housing and 60% of job growth in less than 5% of land with transit access—aims to reduce reliance on cars and alleviate traffic congestion [5]. Despite these measures, the immediate reality is that trains are operating at or near full capacity, with many passengers standing during peak hours ![Crowded train station](image7).\n\nIn summary, the increase in weekday ridership growth in Mountain View and Palo Alto has directly strained Caltrain’s capacity, necessitating urgent infrastructure improvements and expanded services to meet the rising demand."}

This representation captures the semantic meaning of the user’s request [2].\n\n3. **Dialogue State Update**: The encoded user utterance, along with the encoding of the previous system action, is fed into a dialogue-level LSTM. This updates the dialogue state, maintaining a continuous representation of the conversation. The dialogue state includes slots and values representing the user’s goals, such as \"date=Thursday\" [10].\n\n4. **Dialogue State Tracking**: The system tracks and estimates the user’s goal by maintaining a probability distribution over candidate values for each goal slot. For example, it identifies that the user is asking about a movie on a specific date [10].\n\n5. **Knowledge Base Query**: Based on the updated dialogue state, the system formulates a symbolic query to retrieve relevant information from an external knowledge base. The query results are then encoded for further processing [7].\n\n6. **Policy Network**: The policy network takes the dialogue state, slot value logits, and query results as inputs. It determines the next system action, such as requesting additional information (e.g., \"What time do you prefer?\") [12].\n\n7. **Natural Language Generation**: Finally, the system uses a template-based natural language generator (NLG) to convert the system action into a natural language response. The response incorporates values from the dialogue state or knowledge base, ensuring it is contextually appropriate [6].\n\n![The policy network processes inputs from the dialogue state and query results to select the system action, which is then converted into a natural language response.](image1)\n\nThis end-to-end process ensures the system can effectively interpret user requests, track dialogue progress, and generate relevant and coherent responses."}

Here’s how it works:\n\n1. **Pre-processing**: The input image is first pre-processed to isolate regions of interest. This involves cropping the image based on proposal bounding box coordinates and resizing the cropped regions to a fixed proportion. To further assist the model in focusing on relevant objects, non-target areas are blurred. This step ensures that the model directs its attention to the specific objects to be recognized, especially in cases where objects are small or variably positioned [5].\n\n![Pre-processing involves cropping and resizing image regions for object recognition](image7)\n\n2. **Embedding & Retrieval**: The pre-processed image regions are then encoded into embeddings using a visual encoder, which is identical to the one used in the multimodal retriever. These embeddings are indexed and stored in a memory bank (Memory $\\mathcal{M}$). During the inference stage, the system performs a k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) search on this memory bank to retrieve the top-k category labels most similar to the input image. This retrieval process leverages the multimodal retriever’s ability to efficiently encode and store embeddings for quick and accurate retrieval [1][11].\n\n![Embedding and retrieval process using k-NN search for top-k categories](image6)\n\n3. **Ranking**: Once the top-k category labels are retrieved, they are sent to a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) for ranking. The MLLM employs advanced linguistic and semantic analysis to assess the contextual appropriateness of each class name with the input image. This ranking step ensures that the final prediction is not only based on similarity but also on the semantic alignment between the image and the retrieved labels. The MLLM’s ability to rank the retrieved results is further enhanced through fine-tuning on a small-scale classification dataset or using in-context learning examples [3][4].\n\n![Ranking process using MLLMs for accurate label selection](image2)\n\nBy combining pre-processing, efficient embedding and retrieval, and advanced ranking through MLLMs, the multimodal retriever system achieves precise and contextually aware object recognition in detection datasets."}

This aligns with the hypothesis that semantically similar languages benefit more from alignment as their semantic neighborhoods are more congruent [9].\n\n![The table presents evaluation metrics for different training and evaluation setups involving language pairs](image2)\n\nInterestingly, in some scenarios, alignment can even lead to a slight decrease in BLEU scores. For instance, in the GL→EN and PT→EN translation tasks, aligned embeddings resulted in minor reductions in performance compared to unaligned embeddings [3]. This suggests that pre-alignment of embeddings may not always be necessary, and its effectiveness depends on the specific language pair and the amount of training data available [8].\n\n![The table shows different datasets with scores for \"unaligned\" and \"aligned\" categories](image3)\n\nOverall, while alignment can enhance translation quality in certain contexts, its impact varies significantly across different language pairs and training setups, making it a tool to be selectively applied rather than universally adopted [7][8]."}

This is because the semantic neighborhoods of words are more likely to align in similar languages, making the embeddings more effective [3]. ![The table shows translation datasets from various source languages to Portuguese, with improvements in pre-trained metrics](image1). For example, in the table, the largest improvements are seen for Hebrew to Portuguese (+8.9) and Spanish to Portuguese (+7.0), with Hebrew being linguistically distant and Spanish being closer to Portuguese [image1].\n\nTraining set size also influences the impact of pre-training. Pre-training is particularly effective when the training data is limited but not so sparse that the system cannot be trained at all. ![The graph illustrates how BLEU scores improve with pre-training, especially at smaller training set sizes](image2). As shown in the graph, the gain from pre-training is more significant for smaller datasets, such as Portuguese to English, Turkish to English, and Russian to English [image2]. This suggests that pre-training helps to compensate for the lack of data by leveraging shared linguistic features across languages.\n\nAdditionally, in multilingual systems, aligning the embedding spaces of source and target languages further enhances translation accuracy. ![The table shows that aligning word embeddings increases BLEU scores in multilingual training scenarios](image8). For instance, in the evaluation of GL + PT, pre-training and alignment boosted the score from 20.8 to 22.4, indicating that aligning embeddings ensures the model learns more effectively [image8].\n\nIn summary, pre-training improves translation accuracy most significantly when languages are similar and when training data is limited, while alignment in multilingual systems further amplifies these gains."}

This is particularly useful for low-resource languages, as it simplifies the transformation of input embeddings and improves BLEU scores [4].

The **MATCH** heuristic captures easy coreference cases, reducing the necessity of coreference edges, but their removal still slightly degrades performance [7].

Additionally, **fine-tuning from a base model with GEM generally yields better performance on new domains than training from scratch**, as highlighted in domain expansion experiments [6, 10].\n\nSlot similarities, as visualized in the heatmap of cosine similarity between embeddings, also play a significant role in performance. **Slots with high similarity, such as \"destination\" and \"departure\" or \"price range\" and \"stars\", tend to have correlated attributes**, which facilitates knowledge transfer across domains [image8]. For example, in zero-shot scenarios, **knowledge about slots like \"people\", \"area\", and \"price range\" is successfully transferred from seen to unseen domains** [2]. However, **unique slots like \"parking\" and \"internet\" in the hotel domain or \"food\" in the restaurant domain are harder to track correctly because they lack shared attributes with other domains** [2]. This is also evident in the error analysis, where **slots like \"restaurant-name\" and \"hotel-name\" have higher error rates due to their domain-specific nature** [image6].\n\nIn summary, **GEM is more effective than EWC in adapting to new domains while preserving performance on original domains, and slot similarities significantly influence the model’s ability to transfer knowledge across domains**."}

This stark decline demonstrates that the adversarial dataset successfully removed the statistical cues, providing a more robust evaluation of argument comprehension [8]. The adversarial dataset was constructed by negating claims and inverting labels, which mirrored the distribution of cues across both labels and eliminated the exploitable signal [9]. \n\n![Adversarial dataset construction eliminates spurious cues](image6)\n\nMoreover, when models were trained and validated on the adversarial data from scratch, BERT’s mean and median accuracy settled at 50%, aligning with random chance [6].

The company’s financial contracts, including derivatives, are expected to impact the income statement within the next 12 months, with deferred gains and losses on cash flow hedges being transferred to financial income or expenses [7]. `![Impact of a 5% exchange rate fluctuation on comprehensive income and income statement in 2020](image6)` illustrates that a hypothetical 5% increase in exchange rates would negatively impact other comprehensive income by DKK 1,893 million, while a 5% decrease would positively impact it by the same amount. The income statement, conversely, would see a smaller positive impact of DKK 299 million in the case of a 5% increase and a negative impact of DKK 299 million in the case of a 5% decrease.\n\nAdditionally, the table `![Financial data on cash flow hedges and other comprehensive income trends](image7)` highlights the transfer of cash flow hedge reserves to intangible assets and the net effect of exchange rate adjustments on other comprehensive income over several years, including 2020. This indicates how cash flow hedges were managed to stabilize financial outcomes amidst exchange rate volatility.\n\nOverall, changes in exchange rates and financial risks in 2020 significantly impacted Novo Nordisk’s comprehensive income and cash flow hedges, but the company’s hedging strategies helped mitigate these effects and contribute to the predictability of financial results [4]."}

This growth aligns with its focus on food and snack products, which account for a significant portion of PepsiCo’s revenue. This is further supported by the higher operating profit margins for FLNA, which reflect strong cost management and productivity savings [6].\n\n![Beverage and food/snack distribution across regions](image6) illustrates that **LatAm** and **AMESA** have a heavy reliance on food/snack categories (90% and 70% in 2020, respectively). This distribution correlates with their revenue growth over the years, particularly in LatAm, where net revenue increased from $3,878 million in 2018 to $3,924 million in 2020. The stability in food/snack sales may have contributed to this resilience, despite economic challenges.\n\nIn contrast, divisions with a higher beverage focus, such as **PBNA (PepsiCo Beverages North America)**, experienced mixed results. While PBNA’s net revenue grew from $19,493 million in 2018 to $21,727 million in 2020, its operating profit growth was muted, increasing by only 2% in 2020 [9]. This could be attributed to higher operating costs and the impact of COVID-19 pandemic-related charges. Similarly, **Europe**, with a more balanced beverage and food/snack distribution (55% and 45% in 2020), saw a 2% decline in operating profit in 2020, driven by cost increases [7].\n\n![Changes in total assets and capital spending](image7) further highlights that divisions like **APAC** and **AMESA**, which have a lower beverage focus, saw significant increases in total assets and capital spending, indicating investments in their food/snack businesses. This aligns with their revenue growth, particularly in APAC, where net revenue rose from $1,164 million in 2018 to $1,732 million in 2020.\n\nIn summary, divisions with a strong focus on food/snack categories, such as FLNA and LatAm, demonstrated consistent revenue growth and profitability, while beverage-heavy divisions like PBNA faced challenges in managing costs and sustaining profit margins. The data suggests that the distribution of beverage and food/snack categories plays a significant role in shaping the financial performance of PepsiCo’s divisions."}

This shift from a tax benefit to a provision indicates an increasing tax liability on foreign income.\n\nThese changes could impact the company's financial strategy in several ways. First, the growth in foreign income suggests that international markets are becoming more significant to the company’s revenue, prompting a focus on optimizing global operations and tax efficiency. Second, the increasing foreign tax provision highlights the need for strategic tax planning to mitigate potential adverse effects on cash flows and profitability. For instance, the company may explore opportunities to utilize foreign tax credits, as mentioned in [2], to offset U.S. tax liabilities. Additionally, the company might consider restructuring its foreign operations to align with tax-efficient jurisdictions, especially given the potential changes in U.S. tax policy, such as the elimination or reduction of the FDII deduction, as noted in [1].\n\nIn summary, the growth in foreign income and the corresponding increase in foreign tax provisions between 2019 and 2021 suggest that the company’s financial strategy should focus on optimizing global tax efficiency and mitigating potential tax-related risks."}

Net income, which represents the company’s profitability, directly increases retained earnings, a key component of shareholders’ equity.

Additionally, comprehensive income for 2020 was $5,472,296, attributable to both net income and other comprehensive income components, such as foreign currency translation and cash flow hedges [image2]. The $278,740 of other comprehensive income attributable to Accenture PLC was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss, further affecting shareholders’ equity.\n\nFor 2019, the company reported a net income of $4,846,241 and comprehensive income of $4,575,086. While net income increased retained earnings, other comprehensive income (loss) of $(264,406) reduced accumulated other comprehensive loss, contributing to a smaller increase in total shareholders’ equity compared to 2020 [image2].\n\nIn 2018, net income of $4,214,594 and comprehensive income of $3,730,974 also impacted shareholders’ equity.

Prior to the sale, WFAM managed a diverse portfolio of assets, including equity, alternative, balanced, fixed income, money market, and stable value funds [4]. The sale resulted in a substantial reduction of WFAM AUM, directly affecting Wells Fargo’s financial metrics.\n\nThe table `![WFAM assets under management](image5)` provides a detailed breakdown of WFAM AUM activity from 2019 to 2021. In 2021, the total AUM balance at the beginning of the period was $603.0 billion. However, the sale of WFAM led to a significant outflow of $(587.1) billion, reducing the end-of-period balance to $0. This contrasts with previous years, where WFAM’s AUM grew due to market impacts and inflows. For example, in 2020, the beginning balance was $508.8 billion, with inflows of $168.1 billion and a market impact of $30.8 billion, resulting in an end balance of $603.0 billion.\n\nThe sale of WFAM also contributed to changes in other balance sheet components. For instance, `![Selected balance sheet data](image1)` shows a decline in total loans, partially attributed to portfolio rebalancing and the sale of non-core assets like WFAM [11]. Additionally, the sale impacted noninterest income, as WFAM previously generated investment advisory and asset-based fees [10].

In 2020, the total restructuring costs were $782 million, which decreased to $330 million in 2021 and further declined to $253 million in 2022 [5]. The main components of these costs include employee separation costs, asset-related costs, and other restructuring charges [5]. \n\nEmployee separation costs are primarily related to severance packages, which are generally voluntary and depend on salary levels and past service periods. These costs are charged to earnings when the employee accepts the offer. Asset-related costs consist of asset write-downs, which establish a new fair value basis for assets held for sale or disposal, and accelerated depreciation for long-lived assets taken out of service early due to manufacturing consolidations or technology standardizations. Other restructuring charges include asset removal and termination of contracts related to supply chain and overhead optimization [5].\n\n![Total restructuring costs decreased from $782 million in 2020 to $253 million in 2022](image8)\n\nSignificantly, the restructuring costs were spread across various segments, with Corporate consistently bearing a substantial portion.

This growth was primarily driven by higher service costs, which accounted for 87.0% of total cost of revenues in 2021, up from 89.3% in 2019 [6]. Service costs include royalties, content delivery costs, and fees paid to content creators, reflecting the company’s investment in strengthening its platform and services [8].

This growth in noncurrent assets reflects strategic adjustments in IBM’s asset portfolio, such as the intra-entity sale of intellectual property and favorable pension plan returns [9].\n\nLong-term debt increased marginally by $253 million, from $54,102 million in 2019 to $54,355 million in 2020 [image8]. This modest rise, despite early retirements and maturities of debt totaling $11,267 million, was offset by new issuances of $8,982 million [12]. The stability in long-term debt, coupled with a decline in Global Financing debt by $3,560 million, indicates a focus on managing debt levels in line with reduced financing assets and portfolio adjustments [5][6].\n\nCash flows also reflect these changes. Operating activities provided $18,197 million in 2020, up from $14,770 million in 2019, while financing activities shifted from a net source of $9,042 million in 2019 to a net use of $9,721 million in 2020, primarily due to reduced funding needs and debt repayments [5][image5].

In 2021, the company operated 6,477 stores globally, with a significant presence in Europe, the Americas, and other regions. The data reveals a shift in the number of stores across these regions by 2022.\n\nFor instance, in 2021, Spain had 1,229 company-managed stores and 38 franchises, totaling 1,267. By 2022, this increased to 1,371 company-managed stores and 40 franchises, totaling 1,411. Similarly, the Rest of Europe saw a rise from 3,044 company-managed stores and 156 franchises in 2021 to 3,088 company-managed stores and 151 franchises in 2022. The Americas also experienced growth, with company-managed stores increasing from 601 to 646, and franchises from 156 to 177.

The company’s focus on expanding younger formats and relocating sales to local stores and online platforms likely influenced these adjustments. Additionally, the pandemic's impact in 2020 led to significant restrictions on store openings, which Inditex addressed by streamlining its store network in 2021 and 2022[11]. The majority of stores are leased, minimizing the financial impact of these changes on the company’s net assets[6]. \n\nIn summary, Inditex’s geographical store distribution shifted slightly between 2021 and 2022, with growth in most regions driven by its optimization strategy and adaptation to pandemic-related challenges."}

Revenue growth, particularly in premium revenues and services, played a key role.

Additionally, increased 2% rewards negatively impacted gross margin by one basis point. Warehouse ancillary and other businesses, especially gasoline, partially offset these declines with a 29 basis-point positive impact [5]. The ceasing of incremental COVID-19-related wages positively impacted gross margin by five basis points, but this was partly offset by a one-time charge for granting employees an additional paid day off [5].

In 1870, the population was a modest 130, but by 1880, it surged to 8,267, reaching its peak in 1890 at 14,096 [1]. This rapid growth was fueled by the Homestead Act of 1862, which attracted settlers by offering 160 acres of land to those who improved and resided on it for five years [5]. The Act spurred a westward migration, with Nebraska becoming a major destination for pioneers seeking agricultural opportunities.\n\n![Hamilton County’s population data from 1870 to 2000.](image2)\n\nHowever, after 1890, the population began a gradual decline, dropping to 13,330 in 1900 and further decreasing over the ensuing decades [1]. By 2000, the population had stabilized at 9,403. This decline can be attributed to several factors, including the mechanization of agriculture, which reduced the need for labor and led to farm consolidation. As farms grew larger, fewer workers were required, and rural communities shrank [6]. Additionally, transportation developments, particularly the railroad, initially boosted settlement but later facilitated the movement of people away from rural areas to more urban centers [10].\n\n![Map of Hamilton County, Nebraska, highlighting its communities and transport routes.](image3)\n\nEthnic clustering also played a role in shaping the county's demographic landscape. Settlers from Missouri, Iowa, and European countries like Germany, Sweden, and Russia established distinct communities across the county [2]. These groups formed strong cultural and religious centers, such as the Danish St. John’s Lutheran Church in Kronborg, which helped sustain their populations for a time [12].\n\n![St. John’s Lutheran Church in Kronborg, a focal point for the Danish community.](image5)\n\nIn summary, Hamilton County’s population grew rapidly in the late 1800s due to the Homestead Act and railroad expansion but declined steadily in the 20th century due to agricultural mechanization and urbanization."}

For higher-resource languages, pre-training consistently provides a gain of approximately 3 BLEU points across all tested language pairs [2]. In contrast, for extremely low-resource languages, the effect varies: some show minimal gains (e.g., AZ and BE), while others, like GL, achieve significant improvements of up to 11 BLEU points [2]. This suggests that pre-trained embeddings are particularly beneficial for languages that are on the verge of producing reasonable translations but still have room for improvement.\n\nThe similarity between source and target languages also plays a role. For example, the GL/PT pair, which has the highest similarity, shows the largest gains with pre-training, while BE/RU, with the lowest similarity, shows a small decrease [10]. Additionally, aligning the word embeddings of source and target languages further enhances BLEU scores, as it ensures that the embeddings are in similar vector spaces, facilitating better translation quality [10].\n\nWhen the training data size is reduced, pre-training proves especially advantageous. Experiments with down-sampled data for higher-resource languages demonstrate that pre-training helps maintain or improve translation quality even with limited data [3]. This is further supported by the observation that pre-training significantly boosts BLEU scores for low-frequency words in the training corpus [7].\n\n![Pre-training enhances translation quality, especially for low-resource languages like GL/PT](image5)  \n\nOverall, pre-training is most effective when the baseline system is moderately functional but has room for improvement, typically with baseline BLEU scores in the range of 3-4 [11].

This is evident as fine-tuning leverages the model’s ability to adapt specifically to the dataset’s characteristics, leading to better alignment with the task of ranking. \n\n![Performance comparison of fine-tuning vs. in-context learning on various datasets](image5)\n\nIn contrast, in-context learning, while less resource-intensive, relies on the model’s existing knowledge and examples provided in the prompt to perform ranking tasks. Although it shows improvements over baseline methods, its performance is generally lower than fine-tuned models. For instance, the fine-tuned InternLM-XC2 model achieved an average accuracy of 82.7% on the FGVC-Aircraft dataset, while in-context learning showed slightly lower scores [10]. \n\nThe robustness of fine-tuning is further highlighted by its consistent performance across diverse datasets, demonstrating its adaptability to different task requirements. In summary, fine-tuning provides a more reliable and accurate ranking capability for the RAR method compared to in-context learning, particularly when dealing with complex and diverse datasets."}

The power consumption of these GPUs can be estimated using the methodology described in [10] and [11], which involves calculating the total power draw from GPUs, CPUs, and DRAM, then multiplying by the Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) coefficient.\n\nFrom the image quotes, **image4** provides a comparison of power consumption and costs for various models, including T2T_big. While the exact power consumption for T2T_big is not explicitly stated in the image, we can infer that training such a model on GPUs would incur a significant energy cost, leading to substantial CO₂ emissions. For context, **image5** shows that air travel between New York and San Francisco (round trip) emits 1,984 lbs of CO₂e. Training BERT on a GPU is mentioned to be roughly equivalent to a trans-American flight [4], which provides a benchmark for comparison.\n\nGiven that the Transformer (big) model requires significant computational resources, its CO₂ emissions are likely comparable to or higher than those of BERT.

Here's how each module works:  \n\n1. **Problem Formulation**:  \n   The process begins with an LLM translating a natural language problem into a symbolic representation. Using in-context learning, the LLM identifies key entities, facts, and rules from the problem statement and converts them into a task-specific symbolic language [1, 5, 12]. For example, a problem like \"If the circuit is complete and the circuit has the light bulb, then the light bulb is glowing\" is translated into a logical formula such as `Complete(Circuit, True) ∧ Has(Circuit, LightBulb) → Glowing(LightBulb, True)` [6].  \n![The Problem Formulator module converts natural language problems into symbolic representations using LLMs.](image5)  \n\n2. **Symbolic Reasoning**:  \n   Once the problem is symbolically formulated, a deterministic symbolic solver (such as Prover9 for first-order logic or Z3 for constraint satisfaction) performs inference on the symbolic formulation [2, 12]. This step ensures logical faithfulness and accuracy, as the solver executes precise algorithms like forward/backward-chaining to derive the answer [2].  \n![The Symbolic Reasoner module uses logic programming and constraint optimization to perform inference on symbolic formulations.](image5)  \n\n3. **Result Interpretation**:  \n   Finally, the Result Interpreter module translates the symbolic answer back into natural language, providing a comprehensible output for the user [12]. This step ensures that the solution is both accurate and interpretable. Additionally, LOGIC-LM incorporates a self-refinement mechanism that uses error messages from the symbolic solver to iteratively revise the symbolic formulation, improving its accuracy [8, 12].  \n![The Result Interpreter module translates symbolic answers back into natural language for comprehensibility.](image5)  \n\nBy combining the strengths of LLMs and symbolic solvers, LOGIC-LM effectively shifts the burden of complex reasoning from LLMs to deterministic external tools, ensuring faithful and transparent solutions [9, 12]."}

As illustrated in the diagram, the process begins with an image containing multiple objects, each highlighted by bounding boxes. These objects are **cropped** based on the bounding box coordinates and **resized** to a fixed proportion. This ensures that each object is isolated and standardized, making it easier for the model to process and recognize individual elements [8].\n\n![Pre-processing involves cropping and resizing objects for better recognition](image8)\n\nAdditionally, a **blurring technique** is applied to non-target areas surrounding the objects. This helps direct the focus of the Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) toward the relevant objects, improving their identification in zero-shot detection tasks [8]. After pre-processing, the image embeddings for each object are created using an Image Encoder, which are then indexed and retrieved using a k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) search. The retrieval process associates each bounding box with possible labels, such as \"flower arrangement,\" \"saltshaker,\" or \"vase\" [8].\n\nThis pre-processing ensures that the system can handle objects of varying sizes and positions, leading to more accurate and contextually aware recognition in zero-shot scenarios."}

Removing the abstract from the textual input and relying only on the title results in a substantial decrease in performance [8]. This suggests that the abstract contains critical information for document-level relatedness. Adding author information as an input, along with the title and abstract, also hurts performance. One possible explanation is that author names are sparse in the corpus and may be suboptimally tokenized, leading to noisy correlations [8]. On the other hand, adding venue information slightly decreases performance overall, except in document classification tasks, where it is beneficial due to the high correlation between venues and document topics [8].\n\n![SPECTER model performance with different features](image1)\n\nInterestingly, the use of hard negative distractors during training is crucial for SPECTER’s performance. Removing hard negatives reduces performance across all tasks, as they help the model better distinguish between related and unrelated documents [2]. Additionally, initializing the model with SciBERT, which is pretrained on scientific text, is more effective than using a general-domain language model like BERT-Large. SciBERT’s domain-specific pretraining enables it to capture scientific text nuances more effectively [2].\n\n![SPECTER model architecture and training process](image2)\n\nOverall, the SPECTER model achieves its best performance when trained with abstracts and citation-based hard negatives, while avoiding the inclusion of author information.

In contrast, tree traversal shows a steady increase in F1 score with longer context lengths but does not reach the same level of performance as the collapsed tree. \n\nThis aligns with findings in the text, where the collapsed tree approach’s greater flexibility allows it to retrieve information at the correct granularity for a given question, as highlighted in [6]. While tree traversal provides control over specificity and breadth by traversing layers sequentially [10], it maintains a constant ratio of higher-order thematic information to granular details, which may limit its effectiveness. Thus, the collapsed tree method is preferred for its consistent and higher F1 score performance across varying context lengths."}

Gregor Mendel’s experiments with pea plants demonstrated that traits are inherited in predictable patterns, influenced by the alleles contributed by each parent [1][4].\n\nIn the parental (P) generation, Mendel crossed homozygous plants: one with purple flowers (PP) and one with white flowers (pp). All gametes from the purple-flowered plant carried the dominant P allele, while all gametes from the white-flowered plant carried the recessive p allele. The F₁ generation, resulting from this cross, were all heterozygous (Pp) and exhibited the dominant purple flower phenotype [11][image1].\n\nWhen F₁ plants were self-fertilized, each could produce gametes with either the P or p allele in a 1:1 ratio. The F₂ generation offspring resulted from random combinations of these gametes, leading to three possible genotypes: PP, Pp, and pp. The phenotypic ratio in the F₂ generation was 3 purple-flowered plants to 1 white-flowered plant, while the genotypic ratio was 1 PP: 2 Pp: 1 pp [11][image1][image4].\n\nMendel’s explanation for these ratios was based on the segregation of alleles during meiosis. Each parent contributes one allele to the offspring, and the dominant allele (P) masks the expression of the recessive allele (p) in heterozygous individuals (Pp). This is why the F₁ generation all showed the dominant phenotype, and the recessive trait reappeared in the F₂ generation [1][4][11].\n\n![Mendelian inheritance illustrated in pea plants](image1)\n![Genotypic and phenotypic ratios in Mendelian inheritance](image4) \nThus, Mendelian inheritance explains the 3:1 phenotypic ratio and 1:2:1 genotypic ratio in the F₂ generation through the segregation of alleles and the dominance of certain traits."}

For instance, **Electronic Medical Records (EMRs)** saw a slight increase from 61% to 62%, and **Digital Picture Archiving (PACS)** significantly rose from 26% to 42% [image6]. However, **Bar Coded Medication Management** decreased slightly from 58% to 55%, and **Ambulatory Systems** dropped from 22% to 17% [image6]. This suggests that while certain applications like PACS gained traction, others faced challenges in adoption.\n\n![Adoption trends of healthcare IT applications from 2005 to 2006](image6)\n\nThe barriers to implementing IT in healthcare during the same period were significant. For example, **Lack of Financial Support** increased from 18% to 20%, and **Vendor's Inability to Effectively Deliver Product** also rose from 12% to 18% [image2]. Additionally, **Lack of Clinical Leadership** increased slightly from 8% to 10%, while **Lack of Top Management Support** remained unchanged at 7% [image2]. These barriers likely contributed to the slower adoption or decline of certain IT applications.\n\n![Barriers to implementing IT in healthcare from 2005 to 2006](image2)\n\nOne of the key trends is the focus on reducing medical errors, which aligns with the high priority given to **Reduce Medical Errors/Promote Patient Safety** as a healthcare IT priority, though it is projected to decrease from 50% to 35% in two years [image5]. This suggests that while initial efforts were strong, other priorities like **Implementing an EMR** (projected to increase from 45% to 46%) are gaining attention [image5].\n\n![Healthcare IT priorities today and in two years](image5)\n\nIn summary, the adoption of healthcare IT applications from 2005 to 2006 varied, with some systems growing while others faced challenges, likely due to persistent barriers such as financial constraints, vendor issues, and lack of leadership. The trends reflect a shift in focus from immediate safety concerns to broader system implementations like EMRs."}

National priorities shifted towards technological and scientific advancements, which may have influenced healthcare spending indirectly by fostering innovation and economic growth. However, the Space Race itself did not directly cause the rise in healthcare spending; rather, the latter reflects broader societal and economic changes, including medical advancements, an aging population, and increasing healthcare demand during this period.  \n\nIn summary, while U.S. healthcare spending as a percentage of GDP grew consistently from 1960 to 2007, this trend was part of a larger economic context that included, but was not directly driven by, the events of the Space Race."}

Here’s how they work and enhance photography:\n\nMetering modes determine how the camera measures light to set the correct exposure. The three primary metering modes are:  \n1. **Matrix Metering Mode** measures light across the entire frame, making it ideal for natural landscapes where balanced lighting is essential [5].  \n2. **Center Metering Mode** focuses on light near the center of the screen, which is perfect for portraits where the subject is centrally located [5].  \n3. **Spot Metering Mode** measures light from a specific region, such as a subject’s eyes or a small area, ensuring precise exposure in complex lighting conditions [5].  \n![Matrix Metering Mode is ideal for natural landscapes, while Center Metering Mode suits portraits](image5)\n\nFocus modes, on the other hand, control how the camera locks onto a subject:  \n1. **AF-S (Single Autofocus)** is best for stationary subjects, providing sharp focus for still scenes or posed portraits [4].  \n2. **AF-C (Continuous Autofocus)** tracks moving subjects, making it ideal for action shots or sports photography [4].  \n3. **MF (Manual Focus)** allows for precise control by manually adjusting focus, which is useful for macro photography or when capturing subjects with intricate details [4].  \n![AF-S is ideal for stationary subjects, while AF-C is better for moving subjects](image4)\n\nBy selecting the appropriate metering and focus modes, photographers can achieve better exposure and sharper focus tailored to their shooting conditions. For example, using **Matrix Metering** with **AF-C** would be ideal for capturing a moving subject in a well-lit landscape, while **Spot Metering** with **MF** would be perfect for focusing on a specific detail in a low-light scene.  \n\nThe Pro Mode interface, as shown in the diagram, provides easy access to these settings, enabling photographers to adjust ISO, shutter speed, exposure compensation, and more for professional-quality results [3].![Pro Mode interface provides comprehensive control over camera settings](image3) \n\nUltimately, these modes empower photographers to adapt to diverse scenarios, ensuring clarity, proper exposure, and creative control in every shot."}

This discrepancy could indicate potential inefficiencies in lead qualification or misalignment between marketing and sales teams in the dataset from **image4**.  \n\nOn the other hand, the high conversion rate range (45-75%) for SALs in **image7** suggests that once leads are accepted by sales, they are more likely to progress further in the funnel. However, this also highlights the importance of ensuring that only high-quality leads are passed to the sales team, as lower conversion rates at the MQL to SAL stage can bottleneck the funnel.  \n\nThe implications of these differences are critical for optimizing marketing and sales alignment. A low MQL to SAL conversion rate may signal the need for better lead scoring methodologies, improved qualification criteria, or stronger collaboration between teams. Conversely, higher rates in certain datasets, as in **image7**, may indicate effective lead nurturing and alignment but also the need to maintain those standards consistently.  \n\n![Low MQL to SAL conversion rate of 1.50%](image4)  \n![Cross-industry MQL to SAL conversion rate of 4-8%](image7)  \n\nIn summary, the observed differences in MQL to SAL conversion rates highlight the need for tailored strategies to improve lead quality and alignment between marketing and sales teams."}
