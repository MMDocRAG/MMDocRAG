According to survey data, 53% of those aged 18-29 say the government is doing very or fairly well, compared to only 40% of those 65 and older—a group that is much more negative, with 58% saying the government is not doing well[10]. This trend is clearly illustrated in the data:\n\n![Younger adults rate the government’s counterterrorism efforts more positively than older adults.](image3)\n\nAmong all age groups, the oldest are also much more likely to prioritize national security over concerns about civil liberties. Only 15% of seniors (65+) feel policies have gone too far in restricting civil liberties, while a dominant 71% worry that the government hasn’t gone far enough to protect the US. By contrast, among those aged 18-29, concern is nearly split between civil liberties (43%) and security (44%)[2][3].\n\n![Older Americans worry far more about security, while the young are nearly split between security and civil liberties.](image2)\n\n### Influence of Political Ideology\n\nPolitical party affiliation and ideology are perhaps the most significant drivers of perception. Democrats are far more likely than Republicans or Independents to say the government is doing a good job on terrorism (64% of Democrats approve vs. just 27% of Republicans). Liberals especially give the highest marks (76%), while conservatives are the most critical (only 18% positive)[7].\n\nAdditionally, shifts over time have been dramatic:\n\n- Republicans’ approval sharply declined during the Obama administration, dropping from 63% to 27%.\n- Democrats’ ratings also fell but remained higher than other groups.\n- Independents showed a significant drop as well[7].\n\nThese trends are visible both in survey tables and over-time graphics:\n\n![Republican confidence in government counterterrorism efforts has collapsed under Obama, while Democrats stay higher but also drop.](image1)\n\n![Positive ratings of government counterterrorism peaked among Republicans during Bush, then among Democrats during Obama; both have declined in recent years.](image3)\n\n### Trends Over Time\n\nGeneral concern about whether the government is doing enough to protect the country has increased significantly since 2013, while concern over civil liberties has decreased. This indicates a post-Snowden shift back toward prioritizing security[5][8].\n\n![Recent years have seen a sharp rise in concern that anti-terror policies don’t go far enough, and falling concern over civil liberties.](image5)\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn summary, younger adults are more positive about government anti-terror efforts and more balanced between security and liberty, while older adults are more critical and clearly prioritize security. Politically, Democrats and liberals are much more likely to approve of government efforts, but both Democrats and Republicans have grown more negative in recent years, often along partisan lines.

This consensus indicates broad comfort when data use aligns with personal relevance and community interests [1][4].  \n![Acceptance of data use for different purposes varies by age, especially for recommending people or showing ads and political messages.](image1)\n\nHowever, major generational divides appear with other types of data use. While about two-thirds of those under 50 are comfortable with data suggesting new connections, only 36% of those 65+ agree [6][10]. When it comes to advertisements for products or services, acceptance dips further. For users ages 65+, just 39% are comfortable compared to 60% among 30-49-year-olds [10].\n\nThe least tolerated use across all age groups is for political campaign messages, with only a minority finding it acceptable—31% of those 65+, rising slightly to 40% for the youngest groups. A sizable portion of users across demographics deem this use not acceptable at all [1][5].\n![Younger people are more receptive to data use for recommendations, while older users are less comfortable with most non-event uses.](image2)\n\nThese sentiments are mirrored in overall comfort levels: Most users are open to data used for community-relevant services like event recommendations but oppose uses that feel more intrusive or manipulative, especially those involving political content or targeted advertising. This context dependency in comfort is highlighted repeatedly in user perceptions and acceptance rates [7][8][9].\n\nIn summary, user comfort with social media data use is highly context-dependent and varies greatly by age, with universal preference for community-related content and increasing resistance for commercial and political applications."}

For instance, a majority (54%) think the automated personal finance score would do a good job at identifying good customers, but only 32% see it as fair to consumers, creating the largest gap (+22 percentage points) among the evaluated systems [1][8].\n\n![The personal finance score is seen as effective by 54% but fair by only 32%, resulting in a notable gap between effectiveness and fairness across systems.](image3)\n\nSimilarly, while about half believe systems like the parole risk score (49%) or automated resume screening (47%) are effective, more indicate the parole algorithm (50%) is fair compared to resume screening (43%) or personal finance scoring (32%) [1][3][4]. This context dependence demonstrates that judgments about fairness do not necessarily follow judgments about effectiveness, especially notable for the personal finance score [4].\n\n![Americans are far less likely to rate personal finance and video interview systems as fair, with only about one third believing so, compared to higher fairness ratings for parole and resume screening systems.](image4)\n\nPublic skepticism is particularly strong regarding fairness: No automated system surveyed is deemed fair by a majority, and particularly low fairness is associated with personal finance and video interview algorithms (32% and 33%, respectively) [7][9]. Major reasons for viewing personal finance scores as unacceptable include concerns about privacy, accuracy, unfairness/discrimination, and lack of recourse to change scores, with 68% finding them not acceptable for company use.\n\n![A clear majority (68%) of Americans say it is not acceptable for companies to use automated personal finance scores, citing privacy and fairness as major reasons.](image2)\n\nUnderlying these perceptions is a broad mistrust about the potential for algorithmic bias: 58% of Americans believe that computer-based systems will always reflect the biases of their designers, further eroding trust, especially among older adults [6].\n\n![A majority, especially among older Americans, feel algorithmic systems will always reflect designer biases rather than make unbiased decisions.](image1)\n\nIn conclusion, public trust in automated decision-making systems is conditional and highly context-dependent, with widespread skepticism about their fairness—especially in consumer and employment domains—despite moderate confidence in their effectiveness.

One major influence is generational distance from immigrant roots: by the third generation, only 77% of adults with Hispanic ancestry identify as Hispanic, dropping to about half for the fourth or higher generation [1]. This generational shift reflects changing experiences and connections to Hispanic culture and ancestry [2].\n\nA core factor for not identifying as Hispanic is a mixed or distant background, limited contact with Hispanic relatives, absence of Spanish language use, and identifying more as American than Hispanic. Among those with Hispanic ancestry who do not call themselves Hispanic, 27% cite a mixed background or distant Hispanic roots, 16% mention lack of contact with relatives, 15% lack cultural or language links, and 9% were born in the U.S. and see themselves as American [10].\n\n![Key reasons for not identifying as Hispanic include distant ancestry, upbringing, language, appearance, and identifying as American.](image2)\n\nLanguage and surnames also show generational effects.

This indicates that unemployment is a much more acute priority for Non-GCC countries, likely reflecting higher joblessness and less economic security outside the Gulf states [4].\n\n![Concern about unemployment is much higher in Non-GCC (55%) than in GCC (39%) countries.](image2)\n\nThese differences reveal that while inflation and living costs are pan-regional worries, unemployment weighs more heavily on young people in Non-GCC countries. This points to regional disparities: GCC countries, benefiting from wealth and relative job stability, focus slightly less on unemployment than Non-GCC states struggling with higher jobless rates and weaker economies.\n\nIn summary: Concern about the rising cost of living is equally high in both GCC and Non-GCC countries, but concern about unemployment is significantly higher in Non-GCC countries, reflecting greater economic insecurity outside the Gulf."}

Nevertheless, a substantial proportion of online shoppers turn to mobile internet to engage in these activities, with apparel dominating both domains—67.1% for online and 79.2% for offline [1].\n\n![Apparel is the leading category in both online and offline shopping; online shoppers also buy shoes and bags.](image1)\n\nThis strong presence of social media use directly influences shopping behaviors. Actually, a significant amount of e-commerce in Indonesia happens through \"F-commerce\" or shopping via Facebook and Instagram \"shops\", as well as group chats on instant messaging platforms. About 26% of e-commerce users shop via social media, and 27% use instant messaging groups like BBM [3]; this highlights a unique merging of social and shopping activities.\n\nAdditionally, the demographics and everyday mobile habits support this link between social and commercial engagement. With 92% of internet users on Facebook and nearly 90% of those accessing Facebook through their mobile device, social influence is very strong and shapes shopping decisions [6]. It’s also noteworthy that games/apps are the most downloaded mobile content, suggesting a culture of online engagement and digital commerce, even if shopping is not the dominant activity, it’s seamlessly integrated into mobile life [3].\n\nIn summary, Indonesians’ mobile internet activities, dominated by social media and entertainment, are tightly woven with their shopping behavior, as social platforms serve both as spaces for interaction and commerce.\n\nDirect answer: Mobile internet usage in Indonesia, especially through social media and instant messaging, strongly facilitates and shapes shopping behaviors, making social platforms key channels for both daily interaction and online commerce [3][6]."}

This demographic distribution suggests that mobile users are not only young and tech-savvy but also commercially active, making them receptive to digital services and content that fit their lifestyles and entrepreneurial pursuits.\n\n![Younger users dominate mobile internet usage, and 1/4 are business-oriented](image3)\n\nCorrespondingly, their mobile content preferences reflect these demographics: social media, entertainment, and games are the top activities, followed by general information and email. In terms of downloadable content, games/apps lead with 70%, significantly higher than video (49%) or music (44%). Shopping via mobile, while currently at 8%, aligns well with the commercial mindset of a sizable user segment.\n\n![Games/apps are the most preferred and downloaded mobile content, followed by video, music, and social media](image2)\n\nPotential business opportunities arise from these patterns. The dominance of young, entrepreneurial users with a strong preference for entertainment and social engagement indicates major prospects for advertising, digital goods (like games and music), and e-commerce. Businesses catering to these preferences—with tailored content, digital marketplaces, and payment solutions—stand to benefit, especially given the entrepreneurial momentum among users, which can help in adoption and viral growth of new services.\n\nIn summary: Indonesia’s youthful, entrepreneur-leaning mobile user base heavily favors games, entertainment, and social content, creating strong business opportunities in digital advertising, digital goods, and e-commerce."}

This is evident from the confusion matrix, where a substantial proportion of supported and refuted claims are classified as NEI. In contrast, GPT-4 shows \"over-confidence,\" often misclassifying true NEI claims as either supported or refuted rather than correctly identifying them as NEI [5].\n\n![InstructGPT and GPT-4 NEI misclassification patterns](image5)\n\nThe root of these challenges is the inherent difficulty in distinguishing verifiable from unverifiable claims based on tabular data. Both models struggle with this distinction, but in different ways: InstructGPT overuses the NEI label, likely due to its conservative predictions, while GPT-4 underuses it, displaying overconfidence by forcing claims into verifiable categories.\n\nThis discrepancy is further explained by the overall challenge of the NEI class for all models, since distinguishing between ‘refuted’ and ‘NEI’ claims is even difficult for human annotators and tends to diminish model confidence, causing a shift towards NEI predictions in the case of less-confident models [8]. These issues are exacerbated by the unique properties of the SCI TAB dataset, particularly ambiguous claims and grounding errors, making accurate NEI identification especially challenging [4][3].\n\nIn summary, InstructGPT often mislabels verifiable claims as NEI due to lack of confidence, whereas GPT-4 tends to mislabel NEI claims as supported or refuted due to overconfidence, reflecting differing biases in their handling of claim verifiability.\n"}

This matches the text observation that “ICL makes errors in categories with similar label anchors,” which manifests as lower classification accuracy for certain labels [9]. The strong alignment between predicted and actual confusion not only validates the anchor-based analysis framework as a diagnostic tool but also exposes where accuracy bottlenecks exist.\n\nIn summary, accuracy and efficiency metrics show the anchor re-weighting and compression methods significantly enhance performance—especially in more ambiguous or challenging datasets. Insights from the confusion matrices reveal that ICL model errors most frequently arise for categories with similar label anchors, contributing to misclassification in those specific label pairs.\n\nIn conclusion, GPT2-XL and GPT-J perform best with anchor re-weighting and compression, but their classification accuracy tends to drop for category pairs with similar anchors, as evidenced by confusion matrix analysis."}

This suggests that the models become better at precisely locating which knowledge is missing, even if they don't find more missing elements overall.

This advantage is visually confirmed by a performance comparison graph:\n\n![Collapsed tree yields higher F1 scores than tree traversal across context lengths.](image3)\n\nAdditionally, RAPTOR with SBERT—especially when leveraging the collapsed tree approach—consistently exceeds the performance of RAPTOR with DPR. On the QASPER dataset, RAPTOR achieves higher F1 Match scores compared to DPR for all language models tested. For example, when using UnifiedQA, RAPTOR’s F1 score is 36.6%, surpassing DPR by 4.5 points. Across different LLMs (GPT-3, GPT-4, UnifiedQA), RAPTOR maintains a consistent performance edge over DPR and BM25 [2][6]. This shows the tree-based retrieval's ability to synthesize more relevant context than dense chunk retrieval alone.\n\nA summary table of F1 and accuracy metrics demonstrates the performance difference:\n\n![SBERT with RAPTOR shows the highest F1 (36.70%) and QuALITY accuracy (56.6%), outperforming DPR with RAPTOR and other baselines.](image4)\n\nMoreover, on broader quality metrics—including ROUGE, BLEU-1/4, and METEOR—RAPTOR with SBERT again achieves the highest scores, indicating improved answer quality and relevance compared to RAPTOR with DPR or BM25 [5]:\n\n![SBERT with RAPTOR achieves the highest ROUGE, BLEU, and METEOR scores, confirming superior generative performance.](image5)\n\nTo summarize:  \nThe collapsed tree retrieval method outperforms both tree traversal and RAPTOR with DPR on QASPER, with higher F1, accuracy, and generative quality metrics, due to its flexibility and effective context synthesis capabilities."}

The system then applies a cropping operation to focus on these regions and employs a blurring technique on the non-target areas to ensure that the attention of the model remains on the objects to be detected. This is crucial because, unlike classification datasets where objects are often centered and prominent, in detection datasets objects vary widely in size and position. The cropping and blurring steps help the subsequent embedding and retrieval processes focus on relevant features for each object [8].\n\n![Preprocessing uses cropping and blurring to focus on bounding box objects.](image4)\n\nEach cropped sub-image (object region) is then encoded into an embedding using an image encoder. These embeddings are compared with those stored in a structured memory bank to retrieve top-k candidates per object. For detection, because the cropped images are small and low-resolution (affecting CLIP’s feature extraction), the system typically uses image-to-text retrieval, leveraging CLIP's capabilities to rank relevant category labels for these object queries [6][8].\n\n![The retriever encodes cropped object boxes and retrieves top-k class labels from memory.](image4)\n\nAfter retrieval, the multimodal large language model (MLLM) is used to rank the retrieved category labels for each object, considering both the embedding similarity and contextual fit. This reranking step leverages the MLLM’s linguistic and semantic reasoning to accurately categorize each detected object, even when the retrieved candidates are close in meaning or when objects are small or occluded. The reranked labels provide a final, contextually-aware prediction for each detected object [4][5].\n\n![The MLLM reranks retrieved class names for each detected object for accurate recognition.](image2)\n\nIn summary, the system identifies objects in detection datasets by cropping and encoding each object region, retrieving top-k candidate labels from a multimodal memory, and finally ranking these via an MLLM to determine the best match for each detected object.\n\nDirect answer: The multimodal retriever system crops object regions, encodes them, retrieves top-k candidate labels, and uses an MLLM to rerank and identify objects with high accuracy in detection datasets."}

For instance, BERT+DSC surpasses BERT by +1.24 to +4.00 EM and up to +2.57 F1, while XLNet+DSC also shows improvements over XLNet, especially on QuoRef (+1.46 EM, +1.41 F1) [4][1].\n\n![DSC brings notable improvements in EM and F1 for both BERT and XLNet on MRC datasets.](image1)\n\n### Paraphrase Identification (QQP)\nDSC again outperforms FL and DL, yielding higher F1 scores for both BERT and XLNet, with improvements up to +0.81 for BERT and +0.79 for XLNet over their baselines [10].\n\n![DSC offers the largest F1 gain for paraphrase identification, especially under data imbalance.](image4)\n\n### Named Entity Recognition (NER)\nWhen NER is framed as an MRC task, using DSC achieves higher F1 than FL or DL, with incremental but consistent gains.

The effect of these augmentations is measured using F1 scores, as this metric accounts for both precision and recall and is thus especially important in imbalanced tasks [7].\n\nLooking at the experimental results:\n\n- On the QQP dataset, the baseline (original) BERT model achieves an F1 of 91.3.\n- Augmenting with +positive raises F1 to 92.27; with +negative, it drops to 90.08.

Pairs such as HE→PT show the largest relative improvement, indicating that languages with less commonality to the target may see more dramatic benefits in low-resource settings.\n\n![Pre-training increases BLEU scores for all language pairs, especially for low-resource or less similar languages.](image1)\n\n**Role of Training Set Size**\n\nPre-training is most effective when there is only a moderate amount of data available: enough to train a system, but not so much that the system is already highly effective without pre-training. As described in [4], there is a “sweet-spot” where pre-trained word embeddings provide maximal benefit, typically when the baseline BLEU score is in the range of 3-4 [9]. The graphical results in image5 highlight that the gains from pre-training are highest for smaller training set sizes, and diminish as more data is used for training.\n\n![Pre-training provides the largest BLEU score increases at lower training set sizes, with diminishing returns as data increases.](image5)\n\n**Influence of Language Similarity**\n\nLanguage similarity between the source and target plays a significant role in determining how much pre-training helps. When languages are more similar, the semantic neighborhoods in embedding space are more alike, making pre-trained embeddings more immediately useful [10]. Empirical results confirm that pre-training yields larger gains for more similar pairs, such as G L /P T, compared to less similar ones like B E /R U [3][6]. However, even for dissimilar pairs, benefits are observed, particularly in low-resource scenarios, since baseline performance is typically lower, allowing for greater headroom for improvement [8].\n\n**Qualitative Improvements**\n\nPre-training is not just beneficial quantitatively (in BLEU), but also qualitatively. As demonstrated in image2 and noted in [7], pre-trained embeddings help the translation system better capture rare vocabulary and produce more grammatically accurate output, especially for less frequent or semantically complex expressions.\n\n![Pre-training enables better translation of rare words and phrase structure, demonstrated by more accurate and fluent output.](image2)\n\n**Summary**\n\nPre-training improves translation accuracy for all language pairs studied, with the greatest relative impact in low-resource settings and for language pairs with higher similarity. The effect is strongest when the systems are trained with limited data, and pre-trained embeddings help especially with rare words and linguistic phenomena. Overall, pre-training is an effective strategy for boosting neural machine translation, particularly when data is scarce and languages are related.\n\n**Direct answer**:  \nPre-training increases translation accuracy most when training data is limited and when the languages are more similar, but it also benefits dissimilar or low-resource pairs, especially in capturing rare words and improving fluency."}

When embedding spaces between source and target languages are aligned, it provides the neural machine translation (NMT) model with semantically consistent representations, making it easier to learn correspondences between languages. This is particularly beneficial when a single encoder is used for multiple sources, as alignment simplifies the learning process and leads to improved BLEU scores. For instance, results show that aligning embeddings (using methods like orthogonal transformations) yields higher BLEU scores across all three evaluated multilingual pairs, with the gains being most pronounced when the source and reference languages are more similar (e.g., GL+PT)[3][7]. \n\n![Aligned embeddings boost BLEU scores most for similar language pairs (GL+PT), showing clear impact in multilingual settings.](image3)\n\nIn bilingual systems, alignment has less pronounced or negligible impact, and in some cases, the difference is minimal or absent; performance might even slightly decrease for certain language pairs[5][4].\n\nWhen examining the F-measure scores for target word translation, pre-training and (implicitly) embedding alignment have the greatest effect on low-frequency words. Pre-training notably boosts the accuracy for rare words, as demonstrated by a consistently higher F-measure for infrequent terms. The relative gain is largest for words occurring fewer than 10 times in the corpus, indicating that pre-trained embeddings and alignment are especially useful for translating rare or unseen vocabulary[8].\n\n![Pre-training (and alignment) substantially improve F-measure for rare words—those seen less frequently in training.](image2)\n\nQualitative examples also show that systems with pre-trained and aligned embeddings generate more accurate and grammatically suitable translations, including for complex, multi-word expressions and rare names[4].\n\n![Multilingual systems with aligned embeddings better translate rare phrases and names, improving fluency and accuracy.](image1)\n\nIn summary:  \nAlignment of word embeddings most benefits translation performance for similar language pairs in multilingual settings and especially aids the accuracy (F-measure) of translating low-frequency words."}

This highlights the need for a more sophisticated graph encoding rather than a naïve fully-connected approach[9][1].\n\nAblating specific edge types provides further insight:\n\n- Removing DOC-BASED (connections for mentions within the same document) leads to a more substantial performance drop (62.9 unmasked; 65.8 masked) than removing MATCH or COREF (the latter being heuristic or predicted coreference links)[1]. This is because document-based links constitute the majority of useful connections and encode vital proximity/co-occurrence information that the model leverages for highly local and some multi-hop inferences[1].\n- Ablating MATCH or COREF has more marginal effects: accuracy remains high (64.3–64.8 unmasked; 67.4 masked). This suggests that while matching helps, its absence can in part be compensated by DOC-BASED and other edges, and COREF links often overlap with MATCH or may be unreliable out-of-domain[1].\n- Inducing edges using learned functions instead of heuristics produces an even greater accuracy loss, below 'No R-GCN', indicating that the model is less able to learn meaningful connectivity unsupervised[5].\n\nOverall, the R-GCN module, relation typing, and especially document-based connections are key factors for high performance on multi-hop reading comprehension.

In fact, the Entity-GCN model without coreference information achieves a slightly higher test accuracy (67.6%) than the model with coreference information (66.4%) [4]. This performance degradation is attributed to the fact that test documents may be more challenging for the coreference system to process, and that the exact match heuristic already handles many of the straightforward coreference cases [6]. Additionally, the advantage of coreference is diminished in the unmasked case due to lexical variation of mentions (e.g., “US” vs. “United States”), leading to potential failures in matching by the coreference system [2][6].\n\n![Comparison of Entity-GCN model performance with and without coreference information on unmasked and masked test sets.](image4)\n\nIn masked settings, coreference information plays a less significant role, as all mentions of an entity are replaced with a unique identifier (e.g., MASK1). This masking process ensures that coreference links are trivially recoverable through exact match, making the inclusion of an external coreference system largely redundant [2][10]. As a result, the support provided by modeling coreference is diminished, and sometimes the inclusion of additional coreference-based edges can slightly degrade performance, as observed in development and test results [6][4].\n\nThe following table summarizes key ablation results, revealing that the removal of coreference edges only slightly affects accuracy, whereas removing other edge types (like DOC-BASED or MATCH) has a more noticeable impact:\n\n![Ablation results showing the effect of removing coreference and other edge types from the Entity-GCN model.](image2)\n\nIn conclusion, the inclusion of coreference information has limited or even negative impact on Entity-GCN performance in both unmasked and masked settings; in masked settings it is largely redundant due to the unique identifier for each entity, and in unmasked settings, reliance on exact match and system limitations may reduce its effectiveness."}

On the single restaurant domain, it achieves 65.35% joint and 93.28% slot accuracy[6]; these results are summarized in the table above.\n\nBeyond in-domain evaluation, TRADE is designed for strong generalization to unseen domains by sharing parameters across domains and using a copy mechanism for slot value extraction[1][3]. In zero-shot settings—where a domain is held out during training and evaluated without further adaptation—TRade achieves varied performance across domains. For instance, in the taxi domain, it achieves a notably high 60.58% joint accuracy, outperforming zero-shot results in other domains, which tend to be lower (e.g., 13.70% for hotel, 19.87% for attraction)[3].\n\n![In zero-shot settings, TRADE achieves the highest joint accuracy on the taxi domain (60.58%) compared to other domains.](image3)\n\nThis means that while TRADE is highly effective in multi-domain settings and can dramatically outperform other models, its zero-shot generalization is domain-dependent but demonstrates promising results, especially in some domains like taxi.\n\nIn summary: The TRADE model achieves state-of-the-art performance across domains on MultiWOZ and shows strong, though variable, zero-shot ability, with the highest zero-shot joint accuracy observed in the taxi domain[1][3]."}

The evidence shows that GEM consistently outperforms both naive fine-tuning and EWC in this setting, especially in preventing catastrophic forgetting:\n\n- When a model trained on four domains is fine-tuned on a new domain (using only 1% of the new domain data), GEM preserves much higher joint accuracy on the original domains compared to naive fine-tuning and even EWC. For example, after fine-tuning on the hotel domain, GEM retains 53.54% joint accuracy on the remaining four domains, compared to 36.08% (naive) and 40.82% (EWC) ([5]). This benefit extends to other held-out domains as well.\n\n![GEM retains substantially higher joint goal accuracy on original domains than EWC or naive fine-tuning.](image3)\n\n- GEM also enables slightly better or comparable adaptation to the new domain, sometimes offering improvements over EWC and naive fine-tuning, especially in the attraction (34.73% vs. 29.39% naive, 32.28% EWC) and train domains ([1], [3]).\n- Both GEM and EWC are designed to alleviate catastrophic forgetting, but GEM does so by constraining gradients based on stored samples from source domains, while EWC regularizes updates based on parameter importance as estimated by the Fisher matrix ([8], [3]).\n- For the new domain itself, GEM and EWC provide similar or slightly better results than naive fine-tuning, but GEM's main advantage is in retention of prior knowledge ([3], [6], [9]).\n\nSlot similarity and transfer:\n\n- Knowledge transfer between domains is strongly influenced by slot similarity. Slots that are common or semantically similar across domains (like people, area, price range, day) benefit from prior knowledge, enabling the model to generalize more effectively ([7]).\n- Unique or rare slots (such as parking, stars, internet for hotel) are not tracked as well, as the model lacks experience with them in other domains ([7]).\n![Slots shared between domains attain higher accuracy in zero-shot transfer, as shown by good prediction rates on shared slots.](image2)\n\n- Error rates for slot tracking reflect this pattern, with name slots exhibiting the highest error due to their distinctive values, while slots like book people and book day have lower error rates as they are more often shared across domains.\n![Slot error rates are highest for unique slots and lowest for frequently shared slots.](image4)\n\nIn summary:  \nGEM is more effective than EWC in preventing catastrophic forgetting while adapting to new domains, and slot similarity across domains enhances transfer performance—shared slots are tracked more accurately, while unique slots remain challenging."}

Table data shows that, across eight tested languages, no single MT system consistently achieves high accuracy, and often the best system for a given language still performs only marginally better than chance [8], [4], ![Accuracy and gender bias across MT systems and languages](image2). For example, accuracy for Google Translate ranges from 37.7% (Russian) to 63.6% (French); for Amazon Translate, from 39.7% (Russian) to 62.4% (German).\n\nSecondly, gender bias is analyzed using two primary metrics: Δ_G (the difference in performance between masculine and feminine translations) and Δ_S (the difference in performance between pro-stereotypical and anti-stereotypical scenarios) [4]. Higher Δ_G and Δ_S values indicate stronger gender biases. Across most languages and systems, significant bias exists—some systems, like SYSTRAN with Italian, have very high Δ_G (47.5), suggesting a much stronger preference or accuracy for one gender over the other. This finding is confirmed by multiple studies stating that popular MT systems are indeed biased, tending to reproduce gender stereotypes in their translations [3], [9], [2].\n\nA bar chart further visualizes that all tested systems translate pro-stereotypical roles (e.g., female nurse) significantly better than anti-stereotypical ones (e.g., male receptionist), with drops in accuracy as high as 26 percentage points or more for languages like French or Hebrew ![Stereotypical translations are significantly more accurate than anti-stereotypical ones](image3), [1].\n\nFinally, different languages present unique challenges: for some like German, system accuracy is comparatively higher and gender bias slightly lower, likely due to linguistic similarity to English [8], whereas for languages like Arabic or Russian, both accuracy and bias issues are more pronounced.\n\nIn summary, translation accuracy varies considerably across systems and languages, but all tested systems exhibit significant gender bias, performing consistently better on translations that conform to traditional gender stereotypes.\n\nDirect answer: Across MT systems and languages, translation accuracy is generally low and all systems show significant gender bias, with much better performance on stereotypical gender roles than on anti-stereotypical ones."}

In many tested languages, translation accuracy is significantly higher when dealing with pro-stereotypical (i.e., matching social stereotypes) roles compared to non-stereotypical ones. For example, Google Translate and other systems perform markedly better when translating gender roles that fit traditional stereotypes, as shown by a wide gap in accuracy between stereotypical and non-stereotypical roles across eight languages:\n\n![Accuracy is higher for stereotypical gender roles in MT across ES, FR, IT, RU, UK, HE, AR, and DE.](image1)\n\nThis trend of higher accuracy with stereotypical cues is quantitatively supported in the literature, which also observes that anti-stereotypical role assignments cause a notable drop in translation accuracy [2]. When stereotype-based cues are artificially introduced (e.g., “pretty doctor”), the accuracy of gender prediction improves, particularly in languages where gender is morphologically marked. For instance, using such adjustments increases gender accuracy by over 10 percentage points in Spanish and Russian, and by 4.5 points in Ukrainian:\n\n![Adding stereotypical gender adjectives boosts gender prediction accuracy in ES, RU, and UK.](image2)\n\nConcrete sentence examples further clarify this effect: in one case, a sentence with an ambiguous gender reference in English leads the MT system to default to a male translation in Spanish. However, inserting the stereotypically feminine adjective “pretty” prompts the system to produce the correct feminine translation, reducing gender bias:\n\n![Adding \"pretty\" to a profession in the source sentence corrects translation gender bias in MT.](image3)\n\nIn summary, stereotype-based adjustments boost MT gender accuracy because they reinforce or clarify expected gender cues for the system—but they do so in a way that depends on reinforcing gender stereotypes, rather than reducing true gender bias [8][2]. These adjustments alleviate gender bias in translation output, but they are not a general solution and point to the underlying issue that MT systems rely on social and linguistic stereotypes to resolve gender, rather than meaningful context.\n\nIn conclusion: Stereotype-based adjustments in MT temporarily improve gender accuracy by leveraging stereotypes, but they do not solve the root problem of gender bias in machine translation."}

Lower sensitivity is preferable, as it supplies fewer degrees of freedom for an attacker [5,6].\n\n- For **closed vocabulary models**, pass-through and neutral backoff strategies have similar and low sensitivity because all OOV words are mapped alike (see \"All\" column for closed vocab in image2).\n- For **open vocabulary models**, the pass-through strategy has much higher sensitivity since every character sequence is treated uniquely.

The company uses forward exchange contracts and, to a lesser extent, currency options as hedging instruments, covering the majority of its total currency exposures, and applies hedge accounting to match gains and losses of hedged items and hedging instruments in its consolidated income statement [7][8][9].\n\nExchange rate fluctuations in 2020 had a tangible effect. The USD, CNY, JPY, CAD, and GBP all depreciated against DKK by 3% to 9% by year-end [5].

These assumptions are driven by financial modeling and market data related to the company's stock and relevant interest and dividend rates. The risk-free interest rates are based on U.S. Treasury yields at the time of grant, expected volatility is based on the company’s stock history and options trading, dividend yield reflects actual payments, and expected lives draw from employee exercise patterns [1][4].\n\nThe following table summarizes these key inputs for the past three years:\n![Summary of stock option valuation assumptions for 2018–2020](image4)\n\nIn contrast, the company’s future minimum lease payments as of December 31, 2020, represent concrete cash obligations under non-cancelable operating leases.

This represents a significant decline compared to previous years, largely due to reductions in both net income and other comprehensive income components.\n\nThe primary factors contributing to this decrease are as follows:\n\n- Net income declined to $4,730.5 million in 2020 from $6,025.4 million in 2019 and $5,924.3 million in 2018, a decrease of about 21% year-over-year.

Changes in Net Revenue and Operating Profit\n\n- **Net Revenue:**\n  - FLNA's net revenue increased from $16,346M in 2018 to $18,189M in 2020.\n  - PBNA rose significantly from $21,072M (2018) to $22,559M (2020).\n  - Europe, AMESA, and APAC divisions also posted growth in net revenue between 2018 and 2020.\n  - LatAm’s net revenue, however, was relatively flat with a minor dip in 2019.\n\n- **Operating Profit:**\n  - FLNA's operating profit went from $5,008M (2018) to $5,340M (2020), showing a steady increase.\n  - PBNA experienced a decline, from $2,276M in 2018 to $1,937M in 2020.\n  - Europe and AMESA had moderate increases, while LatAm slightly decreased, and APAC saw a drop in 2019 but partially recovered by 2020.\n\n![Divisional net revenue and operating profit increased for most segments, while PBNA's operating profit declined despite revenue growth.](image4)\n\n### 2. Link to Beverage vs. Food/Snack Category Distribution\n\n- PepsiCo’s overall portfolio is 45% beverage and 55% food/snack for all analyzed years. However, the split by division is illuminating:\n  - FLNA and QFNA (North America) are predominantly food/snack.\n  - PBNA is almost entirely beverage.\n  - Europe is balanced (55% beverage, 45% food/snack in 2020).\n  - LatAm, AMESA, APAC are more heavily weighted toward food/snack.\n\n- Despite PBNA's strong net revenue growth, its operating profit has declined, possibly indicating higher costs or margin pressures in the beverage category.\n- Conversely, FLNA and food-dominated regions/segments (like AMESA and APAC) generally demonstrate positive operating profits and resilience, likely due to higher margins in food/snacks compared to beverages.\n\n![PepsiCo's division revenue mix varies, with PBNA leading in beverages and other regions skewing towards food/snacks.](image3)\n\n### 3. Interpretation and Relationship\n\nThe data suggests that divisions with a higher proportion of food/snack revenue (FLNA, AMESA, APAC) tend to maintain or increase operating profit, even as net revenue grows moderately. In contrast, PBNA, which has a heavy beverage focus, exhibits weaker operating profit despite robust net revenue, possibly reflecting lower margins, higher costs, or greater impacts from external factors like the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThis pattern highlights the resilience and profitability of the food/snack category over beverages within PepsiCo's divisional performance from 2018-2020.\n\n**In summary:** From 2018 to 2020, divisions with a greater emphasis on food and snacks (FLNA, AMESA, APAC) generally achieved higher or growing operating profits, while beverage-heavy divisions (PBNA) saw declining profits despite rising revenues, underscoring the relative strength of the food/snack segment in PepsiCo’s portfolio."}

This suggests that remuneration decisions were made in a context of compliance and corporate governance.\n\nFrom a market perspective, the share price data and the comparison of GPI's performance with the BSE Sensex over the same period indicate that GPI's market price was somewhat volatile but underperformed the broader BSE Sensex towards the end of the financial year.\n\n![Over the financial year 2002-03, GPI's share index started above the BSE Sensex but declined more sharply, closing the year with a lower relative value.](image1)\n\nThe GPI share price showed a declining trend from a high of Rs. 420 in July 2002 to Rs. 329 in March 2003, reflecting challenging market conditions.\n\n![GPI share prices declined throughout the year, falling from a high of Rs. 420 in July 2002 to Rs. 329 in March 2003.](image4)\n\nIn summary, director remuneration in 2002-03 was structured according to role and responsibilities, with higher total compensation for executive directors and limited sitting fees for non-executives, all within the framework of legal compliance. This occurred in a year where the company maintained governance standards but faced declining share prices and relative underperformance against the market index.\n  \nDirectors' remuneration in 2002-03 was structured by position and aligned with board decisions, taking place as the company experienced declining share prices and market underperformance."}

This large net earnings figure flowed largely into retained earnings, a component of shareholders' equity, driving much of the increase. Similarly, comprehensive income, which considers other comprehensive income items along with net earnings, increased almost as much as net earnings, suggesting minimal adjustments for items like foreign currency translation or appreciation of securities. This is corroborated by text evidence noting strong net earnings, including significant investment gains in 2021 [2].\n\nThe more modest rise in total liabilities ($21,461 million) reflects overall business expansion but is much smaller than the rise in equity, highlighting that the primary driver of balance sheet growth in 2021 was profitability rather than increased leverage.\n\n**In summary:**\nFrom 2020 to 2021, Berkshire Hathaway saw a significant rise in shareholders’ equity primarily due to very strong net earnings and comprehensive income, with a smaller increase in total liabilities, underscoring robust profitability as the main source of balance sheet growth."}

The higher losses in 2020 can also be seen as part of a progressive trend since 2018, indicating increased charges overall for asset write-downs and consumption.\n\n![Total depreciation and impairment losses rose slightly from 2019 to 2020, reaching DKK 4,307 million in 2020.](image5)\n\nFocusing specifically on intangible assets, an impairment loss of DKK 350 million was recognized in 2020, mostly related to patents and licences and primarily associated with research and development projects. This amount was less than in 2019 (DKK 982 million), suggesting that while there was still notable write-down of intangible assets, the pressure from impairment was lower in 2020 than the prior year. Additionally, intangible assets not yet available for use are not amortised but are tested annually for impairment, demonstrating a careful approach to adjusting asset values when recoverability is in question [3][9].\n\nFor property, plant, and equipment (PP&E), annual depreciation charges increased to DKK 964 million in 2020 (from DKK 852 million in 2019).

While there was a notable increase from 2019 to 2020, there was a slight decrease from 2020 to 2021, partly due to the non-renewal of a major health contract in 2021[8].\n  - Overall, other segments and total company data indicate premiums earned grew, with specific increases attributed to the end of special pandemic givebacks (such as the GEICO Giveback program) and organic growth. For example, GEICO premiums earned increased by $2.6 billion (7.4%) in 2021 versus 2020, after a reduction in 2020 due to refunds[4].\n- The fluctuations are partially explained by the impact of one-time programs (like pandemic-related premium reductions), the non-renewal of large contracts, and organic premium growth in some regions[4][8].\n\n### Net Investment Income\n\nNet investment income reflects earnings from the investment of premiums and float:\n\n- There is a clear declining trend in net investment income from 2019 to 2021:\n  - Net investment income was $5,530 million in 2019, $5,039 million in 2020, and $4,807 million in 2021.

This swing is explained by several changes across operating, investing, and financing cash flows:\n\n![IBM had a positive net cash change of $5,361 million in 2020 vs. a negative $3,290 million in 2019, driven by increases in cash from operations and reduced investing outflows.](image2)\n\n**Operating Activities:**  \nNet cash provided by operating activities increased by $3.4 billion in 2020 compared to 2019, mainly due to higher cash inflows from receivables, such as increased sales of receivables and tax deferrals due to COVID-19 aid, partially offset by performance-related declines in net income [6][10]. This boost in operational cash flow helped offset other negative impacts.\n\n**Investing Activities:**  \nCash used in investing activities dramatically decreased by $23.9 billion in 2020, primarily because the prior year saw significant cash outflow for acquisitions (notably Red Hat), which was not repeated in 2020. There was incremental cash outflow from higher purchases of marketable securities and a decrease in cash provided by finance receivables, primarily due to winding down certain financing operations [1][5][9].\n\n**Financing Activities:**  \nFinancing activities shifted from being a source of $9,042 million in 2019 to a net use of $9,721 million in 2020, a year-over-year swing of $18,763 million. This shift mainly reflects repayments and less new borrowing [8].\n\n**Key Evidence Summary:**  \n- Operating cash flow grew due to higher inflows from receivables and COVID-related tax deferrals [6][10].\n- Investing outflows dropped, mainly because 2019 included a significant acquisition, not repeated in 2020 [1][5][9].\n- Financing switched from a cash inflow in 2019 to a strong outflow in 2020, reflecting a net repayment of debt [8].\n  \nAs a result of these contrasting changes, IBM moved from a net cash decrease in 2019 to a net cash increase in 2020.\n\nIn summary, IBM’s net change in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash improved in 2020, turning positive mainly due to increased cash from operations and a sharp reduction in investment outflows (because there was no major acquisition like Red Hat), despite a shift to net financing outflows [1][5][6][8][9][10].\n\nThe main impact on IBM’s net change in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash in 2020 versus 2019 was a result of higher operating cash flow and significantly reduced investing outflows, which more than offset an increase in net cash used for financing."}

Copper prices also provided added value, but the effect is mathematically smaller per unit due to the lower scale of sales and price impact.\n\n### Summary Table\n\n| Metric                 | WAIO (Iron Ore)           | Escondida (Copper)      |\n|------------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------|\n| Revenue (US$M)         | 34,337–34,475             | 9,470                   |\n| Underlying EBITDA (US$M)| 26,270–26,278            | 6,483                   |\n| Production             | 252 Mt (equity), 254 Mt   | 1,066 kt (2,350 Mlb)    |\n| Cost per unit          | $14.82/tonne              | $1.00/lb                |\n| Price impact per unit on EBITDA| $233M per $1/t   | $33M per $1/lb          |\n\n### Direct Answer\nIn FY2021, WAIO posted record financial results with revenue of US$34.5 billion and high production, mainly due to a sharp increase in iron ore prices, dramatically boosting EBITDA. Escondida also achieved strong revenues and stable costs, but the financial impact of copper price changes was less pronounced than for iron ore, with both assets benefiting significantly from favorable commodity prices."}

In 2021, there was a negative total actuarial result (-€22 million), driven by negative impacts from both demographic assumptions (-€8 million) and financial assumptions (-€26 million); experience gains and losses partly offset this with +€12 million. By contrast, in 2020, positive changes in financial assumptions (+€72 million) contributed heavily to a positive total actuarial gain (+€67 million), with both demographic assumptions and experience losses being much smaller in magnitude.\n\n![The table shows that in fiscal year 2021, changes in financial assumptions led to a €26 million actuarial loss, while in 2020, they led to a €72 million actuarial gain.](image5)\n\nThe discount rate, a critical financial assumption, saw an increase from 1.5% in 2020 to 1.7% in 2021.\n\n![The discount rate increased from 1.5% in 2020 to 1.7% in 2021.](image2)\n\nAn increase in the discount rate typically reduces the defined benefit obligation and could lead to actuarial gains.

This indicates a shift in foreign profitability and associated tax obligations.\n\nAs foreign profits became a much larger portion of total earnings, the company had to pay more in foreign taxes, affecting overall tax planning. Text quote [7] shows the company still asserts some foreign earnings are indefinitely reinvested and hasn't provided deferred taxes on those:\n\n> \"At September 26, 2021, we had not recorded a deferred tax liability of approximately $63 million related to foreign withholding taxes on approximately $761 million of undistributed earnings of certain subsidiaries that we continue to consider to be indefinitely reinvested outside the United States.\" [7]\n\nThis strategy allows the company to defer U.S. taxation on these foreign profits, providing more resources for international reinvestment and growth. However, higher foreign income and tax obligations may prompt ongoing reviews of profit repatriation, tax credits, and use of tax incentives.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nBetween 2019 and 2021, foreign income before taxes sharply increased, and the foreign tax provision shifted from a benefit to significant expenses; these changes heighten the importance of international tax planning and could drive the company to optimize its use of tax credits, repatriation strategies, and local incentives.\n\n**Summary Sentence:**  \nThe company experienced a substantial rise in both foreign income before taxes and foreign tax expenses from 2019 to 2021, which will likely require enhanced tax planning strategies for managing global tax liabilities and cash flows."}

At the beginning of 2021, WFAM managed a total of $603.0 billion, consisting of $197.4 billion in money market funds and $405.6 billion in other assets. Over the course of the year, there were inflows of $69.3 billion, outflows of $96.8 billion, and a positive market impact of $11.6 billion. However, on November 1, 2021, the sale of WFAM removed $587.1 billion from assets under management, bringing the year-end WFAM AUM to zero.

This small reduction was likely influenced by asset mix adjustments and the bank's efforts to optimize capital and liquidity management, in alignment with its business and risk strategies [3][8].\n\n### WFAM Assets Under Management\n\nWFAM assets under management dropped dramatically—from $603.0 billion at the start of 2021 to zero at year-end, as a result of the business sale finalized on November 1, 2021. The breakdown below demonstrates this shift:\n\n![The sale of WFAM led to a drop in AUM to zero by year-end 2021.](image5)\n\nThe sale represented a major strategic move, as Wells Fargo exited the asset management business to sharpen its focus on core banking operations, capital management, and risk reduction [6][10]. This divestiture freed up capital and simplified the company’s business model, which could help improve returns and align with regulatory expectations.\n\n### Strategic Impact\n\nThe relatively stable total assets, combined with the complete divestiture of WFAM's AUM, underscore a deliberate shift in Wells Fargo's financial strategy toward focusing on its primary banking and lending businesses. The freed-up capital from the sale can be redeployed to support core activities, improve liquidity, and bolster compliance with regulatory requirements[6][10]. It also indicates a move toward optimizing risk-adjusted returns and simplifying the company’s structure.\n\nIn summary, the combination of slightly reduced total assets and the sale of WFAM's assets under management reflects Wells Fargo’s strategic realignment to concentrate on core banking operations and optimize its capital and risk profile.\n\n**Direct answer:**  \nFrom 2020 to 2021, Wells Fargo's slight decrease in total assets and the sale of all WFAM assets under management reflect a strategic shift to focus on core banking, capital optimization, and risk management."}

Discount Rates\n\nDiscount rates are crucial as they impact the present value calculation of pension obligations. For the euro (applicable to Germany) and the U.S. dollar (applicable to the U.S.), the discount rates were as follows:\n![Discount rates for euro and U.S. dollar increased in 2021 compared to 2020.](image4)\n- Germany (Euro): 1.0% in 2021, up from 0.9% in 2020\n- United States (U.S. dollar): 2.7% in 2021, up from 2.4% in 2020\n\n### 2. Compensation Increases and Pension Progression\n\nCompensation increases affect future pension obligations by raising the salary basis for benefits. Pension progression especially matters in Germany, where benefits often scale with the final salary.\n![United Kingdom and Switzerland saw notable increases in compensation assumptions for 2021, useful as a comparative indicator.](image1)\nAlthough the table does not provide Germany or U.S. compensation increases directly, it does show relevant data for comparison and highlights that such adjustments are tracked and influence the liability calculations.\n\n### 3. Demographic Assumptions (Mortality Tables)\n\nThe mortality tables underpinning longevity assumptions are country-specific and have been updated as follows:\n![Germany updated its Siemens-specific mortality tables in 2021; the U.S. continued with Social Security generational projections.](image5)\n- Germany: Updated to Siemens Bio 2017/2021 tables (previously 2017/2020), still based on the Siemens population and federal statistics.\n- United States: Continues using the Pri-2012 generational projection from the U.S. Social Security Administration’s Long Range Demographic Assumptions.\n\n### 4. Actuarial Gains and Losses\n\nChanges in actuarial assumptions (both demographic and financial) and experience variances affected the financial indicators each year:\n![Significant actuarial losses in 2020, but gains (negative losses) in 2021 mainly from changes in financial assumptions.](image2)\n- In 2021, there were overall actuarial gains of €22 million (meaning lower obligations), largely from changes in financial assumptions.\n- In 2020, actuarial losses were €67 million, with significant negative impact from financial assumptions.\n\n### 5. Defined Benefit Obligation and Plan Asset Values\n\nLastly, the financial statement provides the closing balances for defined benefit obligations by country, essential for year-over-year comparison:\n![Germany and the U.S. both saw modest changes in defined benefit obligations, reflecting all the above factors.](image3)\n- Germany’s defined benefit obligation: €2,033 million in 2021 (vs. €2,007 million in 2020)\n- United States: €986 million in 2021 (vs. €1,050 million in 2020)\n\n---\n\n**In summary:**  \nFor fiscal years 2021 and 2020, the main differences were an increase in discount rates for both Germany and the U.S., updated mortality tables for Germany while the U.S. kept existing projections, and different actuarial gains/losses each year primarily due to changing financial assumptions; Germany’s defined benefit obligation increased slightly, while the U.S. obligation decreased."}

Commercial Banking (CMB)\n- Net operating income decreased by $1,852m (12%) to $13,312m. This drop was mainly due to a $1,754m (30%) fall in Global Liquidity and Cash Management and declines in other areas, with only Credit and Lending showing an increase.\n- The negative income change for this segment reflects significant challenges in liquidity and markets products, along with adverse impacts from lower interest rates.\n![Commercial Banking suffered a significant drop in net operating income, led by Global Liquidity and Cash Management.](image1)\n\n### Main Factors Driving Changes\n- The profit before tax in GBM fell despite revenue growth due to higher credit impairment/losses, mostly linked to the Covid-19 pandemic's economic impacts [4], [7].\n- The Corporate Centre posted much better results due to lower expenses and better management of legacy positions.\n- In Commercial Banking, income fell sharply mainly because of declines in Global Liquidity and Cash Management and Markets-related products, again linked to the broader environment of low interest rates [5], [7].\n\n### Summary Table\n\n| Segment                  | 2020 Net Operating Income ($m) | Change vs 2019 | 2020 Profit Before Tax ($m) | Change vs 2019 |\n|--------------------------|-------------------------------|---------------|-----------------------------|----------------|\n| GBM                      | 15,303                        | +434 (3%)     | 4,830                       | -342 (-7%)     |\n| Corporate Centre         | -262                          | +392 (60%)    | 1,311                       | +387 (42%)     |\n| Commercial Banking (CMB) | 13,312                        | -1,852 (-12%) | Not specified directly       |                |\n\n### Direct Answer\n\nIn 2020, GBM increased its adjusted net operating income but saw a drop in profit before tax due to higher credit losses; the Corporate Centre sharply reduced its losses and increased profit before tax, while Commercial Banking suffered a significant decrease in net operating income, primarily due to weakness in liquidity and markets-related revenues."}

Notably, noninterest-bearing demand deposits, interest-bearing demand deposits, and savings deposits all rose, while time deposits and interest-bearing deposits in non-U.S. offices dropped significantly. Time deposits fell 41%, and non-U.S. office deposits dropped 44%[5][10].\n\n![Table showing deposit breakdown and increases in noninterest-bearing, interest-bearing demand, and savings deposits, but decreases in time and non-U.S. deposits.](image1)\n\nFrom the loan perspective, total loans saw a moderate rise from $887,637 million to $895,394 million (about $7.8 billion increase). This overall increase is composed of a notable rise in commercial loans (from $478,417 million to $513,120 million) while consumer loans actually decreased (from $409,220 million to $382,274 million), reflecting shifts within the portfolio[1].\n\n![Table comparing loan balances year over year, showing commercial loans increased, consumer loans decreased.](image5)\n\nThe text evidence helps explain the underlying strategy: there was a decline in consumer loans, particularly in residential mortgage first liens, due to both heavy paydowns and significant sales of such loans. However, commercial loans increased, driven by higher demand, increased originations, and loan draws[1]. The fall in time deposits and brokered CDs suggests deliberate actions to manage under the asset cap and limit more expensive or less stable funding sources[10].\n\nIn summary, the financial entity increased total deposits (driven by demand/savings, not time deposits), shifted away from consumer lending towards commercial, and strategically managed its deposit mix under regulatory constraints. This points to a strategy focused on growth in core, stable funding and higher-yielding commercial credit, while actively managing regulatory limits and portfolio risks.\n\n**Answer:**  \nFrom December 31, 2020, to December 31, 2021, total deposits increased by 6% with growth concentrated in demand and savings deposits, while total loans rose slightly due to higher commercial lending and lower consumer lending; this suggests a strategic emphasis on stable funding sources and growth in commercial loans, while carefully managing under asset cap restrictions and risk from consumer lending[1][5][10]."}

This increased net income as well, but less dramatically than Amberjack.\n- The net incomes then remained steady from 2019 to 2020, suggesting a stabilization after the initial year-over-year growth.\n\n#### Cost and Asset Considerations\n- Depreciation and amortization expenses, which are part of total operating expenses, were fairly stable year over year, suggesting that there were no dramatic asset write-downs or impairment charges impacting net income over this period [7].\n- No impairment was recorded in 2020 despite the COVID-19 pandemic, as management determined there was no triggering event requiring asset re-evaluation [6].\n\n#### Other Influencing Factors\n- Potentially, favorable market conditions and increased sales (revenue) could have driven the growth in net income from 2018 to 2019.\n- Debt and interest expenses don’t seem to be a major factor for these units individually, based on the consolidated nature of debt disclosures.\n\n### Tabular View (2018–2020)\n\n| Year | Amberjack Net Income | Mars Net Income |\n|------|---------------------|-----------------|\n| 2018 | $157 million        | $154 million    |\n| 2019 | $243 million        | $179 million    |\n| 2020 | $243 million        | $179 million    |\n\n---\n\nIn summary, Amberjack and Mars both saw significant increases in net income from 2018 to 2019, driven largely by increased revenues outpacing increases in operating expenses, and their net incomes remained flat from 2019 to 2020, likely due to stabilization following the prior year’s growth and no significant impairment charges or extraordinary expenses."}

This was primarily driven by robust Global Markets performance, notably in Fixed Income, Currencies, and Commodities (FICC), and offsetting declines elsewhere.[4][8]\n- **Net Operating Income:** Net operating income for GBM climbed to $15,303 million (a $434 million, or 3%, increase from 2019).\n- **Profit Before Tax:** GBM's profit before tax was $4,830 million, a decrease of $342 million (7%) from 2019, reflecting increased expected credit losses and other credit impairment charges, despite higher revenue and reduced operating expenses.\n- **Return on Tangible Equity (RoTE):** RoTE for GBM was 6.7% in 2020, down from 9.8% in the previous year, reflecting profit pressures from the broader economic downturn and increased loan loss provisions.\n- **Key Drivers:** The revenue boost in Global Markets was underpinned by growth in FICC (up $1,541 million or 33%), especially in Foreign Exchange, Rates, and Credit trading, where Credit-related income surged by 90%.[4]\n\n![GBM revenue and income details show strong Global Markets performance and a moderate profit decline.](image1)\n![Segment breakdown reveals FICC and Credit trading as top contributors to revenue growth in GBM.](image4)\n\n### Corporate Centre\n\n- **Adjusted Revenue and Net Operating Income:** The Corporate Centre remained loss-making but improved markedly: net operating income improved by $392 million (60%), though it still posted a negative $262 million in 2020. Adjusted revenue losses narrowed—most notably, the 'Other' category's negative contribution improved by $321 million (44%) and legacy portfolio losses decreased.[2]\n- **Profit Before Tax:** There was a significant improvement in profit before tax for the Corporate Centre, rising to $1,311 million in 2020 compared to $924 million in 2019 and $144 million in 2018—a $387 million (42%) increase year-on-year.\n- **Return on Tangible Equity (RoTE):** RoTE excluding significant items and UK bank levy improved from 0.8% in 2019 to 3.1% in 2020.[3]\n- **Key Drivers:** Improvement was mainly attributable to reduced operating expenses and smaller losses in legacy portfolios and the 'Other' segment, along with more favorable contributions from central treasury activities.\n\n![Corporate Centre results improved with lower losses and higher profit before tax, supported by cost reductions and better treasury outcomes.](image2)\n![Corporate Centre financials show improved net operating income, reduced costs, and higher profit before tax.](image3)\n\n### Additional Context\n\n- The broader environment of 2020 was shaped by the Covid-19 pandemic, which drove up expected credit losses and led to profit pressures, but also saw banks like HSBC play a critical role in supporting customers and markets through increased funding and risk management activities [7][10].\n- GBM performance showcased resilience, with strong trading results offsetting pandemic headwinds, while the Corporate Centre's results reflect ongoing restructuring and risk management improvements.\n\n**In summary:**  \nIn 2020, HSBC's Global Banking and Markets achieved higher adjusted revenue, particularly from strong Global Markets trading, but profit before tax declined slightly due to increased provisions; meanwhile, the Corporate Centre showed marked improvements in net operating income and profit before tax, though it remained loss-making on an operating income basis."}

This improvement was primarily due to lower net cash tax payments and reduced pre-tax pension and retiree medical plan contributions[2]. However, despite higher operating cash flow, net cash used for investing activities rose sharply to $11.6 billion from $6.4 billion, mainly reflecting major acquisitions (Rockstar, Pioneer Foods, and Be & Cheery) and increased capital spending[3]. Financing activities provided a net inflow of $3.8 billion in 2020 (versus an outflow of $8.5 billion in 2019), largely due to increased long-term debt issuance ($13.8 billion), offset by dividend payments and share repurchases of $7.5 billion[5][10].\n\nThe resulting free cash flow—a non-GAAP metric capturing net cash from operations minus capital spending plus sales of property, plant and equipment—rose 15% year-on-year, from $5,587 million in 2019 to $6,428 million in 2020.

Total commercial membership dropped from 27,760,000 in 2019 to 26,220,000 in 2020, a decline of 1,540,000 members (6%). Risk-based commercial dropped by 665,000 (8%) and fee-based by 875,000 (5%).\n- **Medicare Advantage:** Increased from 5,270,000 in 2019 to 5,710,000 in 2020, up 440,000 (8%).\n- **Medicaid:** Increased from 5,900,000 in 2019 to 6,620,000 in 2020, up 720,000 (12%).\n- **Medicare Supplement (Standardized):** Slight decrease from 4,500,000 to 4,460,000 (-1%).\n- **Total Public and Senior (Medicare Advantage, Medicaid, Medicare Supplement):** Increased by 1,120,000 (7%).\n- **Global:** Decreased from 5,720,000 to 5,425,000, a drop of 295,000 (5%).\n- **Total UnitedHealthcare—Domestic Medical:** Fell slightly from 49,150,000 to 43,010,000.\n- **Total UnitedHealthcare—Medical:** Decreased from 49,150,000 in 2019 to 48,435,000 in 2020, a decline of 715,000 (1%).\n\n![Membership changes by business segment at UnitedHealthcare; notable declines in commercial and global, growth in Medicare Advantage and Medicaid](image3)\n\n### Causes of These Changes\n\n- **Commercial Segment:** The decrease was primarily due to increased unemployment and related attrition during the COVID-19 pandemic, which caused both risk-based and fee-based commercial enrollment to drop[10].\n- **Medicare Advantage:** Growth resulted from an increased number of people served through individual Medicare Advantage plans[10]. This likely reflects demographic trends and greater market penetration.\n- **Medicaid:** Growth was driven by states easing redetermination requirements (making it easier for people to remain enrolled) during COVID-19, and greater participation in Dual Special Needs Plans[10].\n- **Global:** The decrease in individuals served was due to increased unemployment and underwriting discipline, again tied to the broader economic impacts of the pandemic[10].\n\n### Additional Evidence\n\nThe narrative confirms these trends and links them to the pandemic’s impact, with increased unemployment reducing commercial/global coverage, and policy responses boosting Medicaid enrollment. The total number of individuals in Medicare Advantage and Medicaid increased, while those in the commercial segment—especially employer-based—dropped[5],[10]. Revenue changes in UnitedHealthcare also reflect these shifts, with gains in Medicare & Retirement and Community & State, and declines in Employer & Individual and Global segments.\n\n![Revenue changes: Medicare & Retirement and Community & State increased, Employer & Individual and Global declined](image4)\n\n**In summary:** From 2019 to 2020, UnitedHealthcare saw declines in commercial and global membership, but growth in Medicare Advantage and Medicaid, primarily due to economic impacts of COVID-19 (rising unemployment) and policy changes affecting Medicaid eligibility[10]."}

Specifically, the Standardized Credit Risk RWA rose from $342,684 million to $387,066 million, an increase of $44,382 million; the Advanced Credit Risk RWA increased from $228,927 million to $284,930 million, an increase of $56,003 million.

This decrease in the ratio was due primarily to the faster growth of RWA compared to the growth of TLAC[5].\n\n![External TLAC as a percentage of RWA decreased, despite higher nominal TLAC](image5)\n\n### Implications for the Capital Structure\n\nThe rising Credit Risk RWA means that more risk-weighted assets are present on the balance sheet, requiring a higher base of loss-absorbing capital to meet regulatory requirements. However, since the increase in RWA outpaced the growth in TLAC, the buffer of loss-absorbing capacity relative to risk shrank somewhat. This change in the ratio signals a slimmed margin above regulatory requirements, potentially constraining future distributions or requiring further capital increases if RWA continues to grow.\n\nAdditionally, regulatory standards require maintaining TLAC ratios above set minimums. Although the institution remained well above these thresholds, this dynamic reflects a shift in risk and capital, suggesting enhanced risk in exposures that needs to be balanced by future capital planning[3][7].\n\n---\n\nIn summary:  \nFrom 2019 to 2020, Credit Risk RWA increased significantly, while External TLAC as a percentage of RWA decreased, indicating that although the institution’s total loss-absorbing capacity grew in dollar terms, it did not keep pace with the increased risk on the balance sheet, modestly reducing its capital cushion relative to risk."}

The key drivers were:\n- From 2018 to 2019: Modest increases across earning asset categories and deposit balances, coupled with smaller increases in interest expenses.\n- From 2019 to 2020: A sharp **decline in interest income** due to falling rates in nearly every earning asset class, more than offsetting any benefit from deposit growth or reduced funding costs. There was also a significant decrease in total interest expense, especially in deposit costs, but not enough to offset lost asset yields.  \n\n![Sharp decline in interest income and expense from 2019 to 2020, compared to a moderate rise from 2018 to 2019.](image4)\n\nQuantitative summary from image4:\n- **Interest income**: Major decreases in 2020 (e.g., -$3,313 million on interest-bearing deposits, -$4,237 million on debt securities).\n- **Interest expense**: Largest drops in expense were in U.S. interest-bearing deposits (-$4,643 million), but the impact was magnified by a much larger drop in asset-side interest.\n\nThis shift is also reflected in the net interest spread and yield:  \n- 2018: Net interest yield was 2.45%  \n- 2019: 2.43%  \n- 2020: 1.90%  \n\nThis signals a sharp margin compression in 2020, driven by a steeper fall in asset yields than liability costs.\n\n![In 2020, net interest income/yield dropped sharply to 1.90%, reflecting interest rate pressures.](image5)\n\n### Organizational Structure Impact\n\nBank of America’s business is organized into four segments with distinct revenue sources: Consumer Banking, Global Wealth & Investment Management, Global Banking, and Global Markets, plus \"All Other\" for non-core or corporate activities. Consumer Banking, which includes deposits and various loan products, is most exposed to changes in net interest income—and is, therefore, particularly hit by margin compression.\n\n![Consumer Banking generates most of the bank’s net interest income through deposits and lending, making it especially vulnerable to rate changes.](image2)\n\nIn the detailed segment view:\n- Consumer Banking’s net interest income fell **12% year-over-year** ($24.7B in 2020 vs $28.2B in 2019).\n- This mirrored the group-wide effect, as lower interest rates squeezed all interest-earning asset returns, especially for segments relying on net interest income from deposits and loans.\n\n![Consumer Banking net interest income dropped by $3.5B year-over-year, underscoring its sensitivity to interest rate changes.](image1)\n\n### Synthesis\n\nIn summary, from 2019 to 2020, net interest income fell dramatically due to lower interest rates, which sharply reduced returns on earning assets. Although the cost of interest-bearing liabilities also dropped, it did not fall as much as asset yields, leading to aggressive margin compression. This shift is pronounced in the Consumer Banking segment, shown in the organizational structure as heavily reliant on deposit and lending activity, which makes it most sensitive to changes in net interest income. In contrast, 2018 to 2019 saw growth fueled by higher average balances and rates with milder changes in liability costs.\n\n**Direct Answer:**  \nFrom 2019 to 2020, net interest income decreased sharply due to falling interest rates that reduced returns on earning assets, far outpacing reductions in interest expense, a reversal from the modest growth seen from 2018 to 2019; this change disproportionately impacted Bank of America’s Consumer Banking segment, which relies heavily on net interest income, as reflected in its organizational structure."}

As a result, total revenues net of interest expense after provisions for credit losses rose 42% year-over-year in 2021 [2][6].\n\n![Financials table shows provisions for credit losses moved from a build in 2020 to a release in 2021, helping net segment income.](image1)\n\nIn summary, while average Card Member loans and net interest income both fell from 2019 to 2021, the company's financial performance rebounded in 2021 because of strong credit quality, leading to large credit reserve releases and much higher pre-tax earnings."}

This growth mainly resulted from the issuance of new shares in March 2021 to finance the acquisition of Varian, which increased issued capital by €53 million and capital reserves by more than €2.2 billion. Retained earnings also improved, moving from -€1,276 million to -€300 million.

These entries both appear under “Cash Flows from Financing Activities,” showing a net inflow from issuance and an outflow from redemptions in 2021. No such transactions occurred in 2020.\n- This closely aligns with the textual disclosure: “On August 3, 2021, we issued $1.6 billion of 3.550% Fixed Rate Reset Noncumulative Preferred Shares, Series D. With the proceeds from that issuance, we redeemed in full the $850 million of 4.900% Fixed Rate/Floating Rate Noncumulative Preferred Shares, Series C on September 15, 2021 and the $750 million of 5.200% Fixed Rate/Floating Rate Noncumulative Preferred Shares, Series B on November 15, 2021.” [2]\n\n![2021 includes issuance and redemption of preferred shares, while there was none in 2020.](image1)\n\n### 2.

Liability reductions are most notable in customer deposits and long-term debt. These shifts are aligned with increases in lending activity (higher receivables and loans), strong net income and operating cash inflows, but offset by reductions in liquid assets and significant financing outflows (share repurchases, debt repayment) which relate to both comprehensive income (via retained earnings and equity buybacks) and cash movement.\n\n**In summary:**  \nFrom 2020 to 2021, total assets and liabilities both decreased, driven chiefly by a reduction in liquid assets and some liabilities, while loans and receivables increased, aligning with higher net income and operating cash flows but significant cash outflows for investing and financing purposes."}

The substantial additions reflect continued capital investment, while the increased depreciation and impairment reduce the net value [4].\n\n- **Hardware and Software**: The carrying amount rose from $3,082,000 at 30 June 2019 to $2,258,000 at 28 June 2020. Despite $1,074,000 in additions, the higher depreciation expense for the year ($1,825,000) and disposals led to a net decrease. Exchange rate movements had a minor positive effect [4].\n\n- **Right-of-Use Assets**: This asset category did not exist prior to the adoption of AASB 16 (with zero opening balance at 1 July 2019). Following the adoption, $138,403,000 was recognised as right-of-use assets at the start, and by 28 June 2020, the carrying amount had increased to $150,464,000. Key drivers were additions from new leases ($48,793,000), re-measurements ($1,698,000), offset by depreciation and impairment charges for the year ($37,454,000), disposals, and the impact of exchange rates [1][5].\n\n![Leasehold improvements and hardware/software saw increased carrying amounts primarily due to additions and despite depreciation and impairments.](image4)\n\n![Right-of-use assets experienced a significant increase throughout the year, mainly driven by the initial recognition upon AASB 16 adoption and further additions.](image5)\n\nThe main factors influencing these changes were:\n- Adoption of AASB 16 and initial recognition of right-of-use assets for leases,\n- Additions of new assets across all categories,\n- Depreciation, impairment losses, and disposals reducing the carrying amounts,\n- Effects of exchange rate movements.\n\nIn summary: Carrying amounts for leasehold improvements rose due to heavy additions despite higher depreciation and impairments, hardware and software decreased slightly due to significant depreciation, and right-of-use assets increased sharply following AASB 16 adoption and ongoing lease activity throughout the year."}

Total Tax Provision Each Year\nThe total tax provision decreased sharply from 2019 to 2020, then increased again in 2021:\n![The tax provision was $3,095 million in 2019, dropped to $521 million in 2020, then rose to $1,231 million in 2021.](image3)\n\n### 2. Effective Tax Rate Movement\nQualcomm's effective tax rate displayed notable fluctuations—peaking at 41% in 2019, plummeting to 9% in 2020, and rising to 12% in 2021:\n![The effective tax rate was 41% in 2019, dropped to 9% in 2020, and increased slightly to 12% in 2021.](image2)\n\n- The spike in 2019 mainly resulted from the derecognition of a deferred tax asset on intellectual property, leading to a $2.5 billion charge ([6]), as shown in image2.\n- The much lower rates in 2020 and 2021 were due in part to the absence of such one-time charges, and also from benefits like the FDII deduction, excess share-based tax benefits, and research tax credits.\n\n### 3. Breakdown and Key Drivers of Tax Provision\nThe composition of federal, state, and foreign current and deferred provisions shifted over time:\n- In 2019, there was a large federal deferred tax expense due to the IP asset write-down ([6]), which reversed in future years.\n- Foreign current tax expense increased from a negative provision in 2019 (\\$-407 million) to positive provisions of \\$526 million (2020) and \\$518 million (2021).\n![Federal and foreign tax provision components shifted significantly, with a large federal deferred provision in 2019 and steadily increasing foreign current provisions.](image3)\n\n### 4. Unrecognized Tax Benefits\nUnrecognized tax benefits rose each year, starting from \\$217 million in 2019 to \\$1.9 billion in 2020, and reaching \\$2.1 billion in 2021:\n![Unrecognized tax benefits increased each year, reflecting ongoing uncertainties surrounding various tax positions globally.](image5)\n\nThese increases were \"primarily due to expected refunds of Korean withholding taxes previously paid\" and ongoing global tax audits ([3],[5]).\n\n### 5. Other Significant Developments\n- One-time items such as the recognition, and subsequent derecognition, of deferred tax assets linked to intellectual property transfers had major impacts, particularly in 2019 ([6]).\n- There were also growing tax benefits from share-based awards, which increased each year ([8]), contributing favorably to tax provisions.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nOver 2019–2021, Qualcomm’s tax provisions and related benefits were highly volatile due to large one-time deferred tax asset derecognition in 2019, changes in foreign and federal tax components, increasing benefits from share-based awards, and rising unrecognized tax benefits due to ongoing disputes and expected tax refunds. The effective tax rate dropped sharply after 2019’s one-off event, stabilizing at a lower level in subsequent years."}

At the beginning of 2021, total WFAM AUM stood at $603.0 billion. However, following the sale, all remaining WFAM-managed assets were removed from Wells Fargo's reporting, dropping the end-of-period balance to zero:\n\n![All WFAM assets under management were divested after the sale, bringing reported AUM for WFAM to zero.](image5)\n\n### Broader Effects on Income\n\nThe sale contributed to a notable gain in noninterest income—specifically, a $269 million profit was realized on the WFAM transaction[2][10]. In Wells Fargo’s income statement, noninterest income more than doubled from 2020 to 2021, rising from $4,916 million to $10,036 million, driven in part by such asset sales. Total net income also saw a significant jump:\n\n![Noninterest income increased by 104% in 2021, supporting a marked rise in overall net income.](image1)\n\nBecause WFAM historically generated investment advisory and asset-based fees, its sale also meant the loss of these recurring income streams. This was noted as a reduction in future asset-based fee income, partially offsetting the short-term gain from the divestiture[3][6][8].\n\n### Effects on the Balance Sheet\n\nFrom a balance sheet perspective, the sale factored into a modest overall decline in period-end total assets from $728.7 billion in 2020 to $721.3 billion in 2021, reflecting the removal of WFAM-managed assets[1][3]. Despite this, there were modest increases in equity securities related to the company's affiliated venture capital business, which offset some of the decline[1]:\n\n![Total assets decreased modestly year-over-year, reflecting divestitures like WFAM, partly offset by increases in equity securities.](image3)\n\n### Summary\n\nThe sale of WFAM in late 2021 removed approximately $603 billion in AUM from Wells Fargo’s reporting, resulted in a one-time gain that boosted noninterest income and net income for the year, and contributed to a modest reduction in total reported assets at year-end. The sale also meant a future reduction in recurring asset-based fee income streams.\n\nIn summary: The sale of WFAM eliminated WFAM’s AUM from Wells Fargo’s balance sheet, produced a significant one-time income gain, and reduced the company’s recurring asset-based fees going forward."}

This drop was primarily due to lower interest rates, which affected both interest earned on assets and interest paid on liabilities. The net interest yield on a fully taxable-equivalent (FTE) basis declined by 53 basis points (bps) to 1.90% in 2020[6].\n\nThis trend is illustrated by the following image, which breaks down the changes in net interest income and net interest expense due to volume and rate changes, showing a total year-over-year decrease of $19,747 million in net interest income and a reduction in net interest expense by $14,120 million:\n\n![Net interest income drop was driven by lower rates; expense declined as well, but less than income.](image2)\n\nDespite reductions in funding costs and other mitigating actions (such as the deployment of excess deposits into securities), the decrease in interest income from assets outpaced the reduction in interest expense on deposits and liabilities. This led to a compression of the net interest spread, falling from 2.03% in 2019 to 1.75% in 2020, as shown below:\n\n![Net interest spread dropped from 2.03% to 1.75% from 2019 to 2020, reflecting earnings pressure from rates.](image5)\n\nThe main contributing factors to this compression included:\n- Lower interest rates, causing a reduction in interest income on loans, securities, and other earning assets.\n- Only partially offsetting reductions in interest expense due to lower deposit and funding costs.\n- Additional influences such as shifts in earning asset mix and funding composition, but the overarching theme was the declining rate environment[6].\n\n**In summary:** The net interest spread decreased from 2.03% to 1.75% from 2019 to 2020 due to a larger decline in net interest income (from falling asset yields) than in net interest expense, mainly driven by significantly lower interest rates and partially mitigated by lower deposit and funding costs[6]."}

This replaced the previous model (AASB 117), where operating leases were not recognized on the balance sheet except for straight-line rent and lease incentives, which were previously recorded as provisions but now are part of the right-of-use asset or lease liability. The transition meant that the Group no longer recognized provisions for straight line rent and lease incentives, instead including all lease-related payments as part of its lease liability[10][4]. \n\n![\"Lease liabilities were recognized on the balance sheet as a result of AASB 16 adoption, with a significant increase at transition.\"](image1)\n\nAt the point of transition (1 July 2019), the Group recognized a lease liability of $143,621,000.

By 28 June 2020, the lease liability increased to $167,154,000 due to new leases, interest, and remeasurement, offset by lease payments and exchange rate effects.

This decrease is primarily attributed to unfavorable currency movements and higher working capital requirements, partially offset by higher net earnings, with the exclusion of non-cash charges in 2019 related to the Canadian tobacco litigation-related expense and the loss on deconsolidation of RBH [10].  \n![Operating cash flows, investing, and net cash shown for 2018, 2019, and 2020](image2)\n\n**Investing Activities:**  \nNet cash used in investing activities decreased from $(1,811) million in 2019 to $(1,154) million in 2020, a reduction in cash outflow by $657 million. The lower outflow was mainly due to the absence of the 2019 cash reduction resulting from the deconsolidation of RBH and to lower capital expenditures in 2020 [9].  \n![Net cash used in investing activities decreased in 2020 compared to 2019](image2)\n\n**Financing Activities:**  \nNet cash used in financing activities increased from $(8,061) million in 2019 to $(8,496) million in 2020, i.e., an increase in outflow by $435 million. This increase was primarily due to higher payments to noncontrolling interests and higher dividends paid, only partially offset by debt activity [4].  \n![Financing activities showed increased outflows in 2020 versus 2019](image3)\n\n**Effect on the Overall Cash Balance:**  \nCombining these effects, despite the increased outflow in financing activities and slightly lower cash from operations, the reduction in outflows from investing activities (especially the absence of the large 2019 charge for the deconsolidation of RBH) helped mitigate the decrease in net cash change. The effect of exchange rate changes on cash also contributed favorably ($258 million in 2020 versus $27 million in 2019). Ultimately, the total cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash at year-end increased from $6,865 million at the end of 2019 to $7,285 million at the end of 2020—a net increase of $420 million.  \n![Ending cash balance increased by $420 million from 2019 to 2020](image3)\n\n**In summary:**  \nThe overall cash balance at the end of 2020 was higher than at the end of 2019, mainly due to the reduced outflows in investing activities and the positive impact of exchange rate changes, which outweighed the decreased operating cash inflow and increased outflows from financing activities."}

The annual total remuneration for executives is calculated using a formula that incorporates three major components: consolidated operating income (business performance), the volatility of Toyota’s share price (shareholder value), and individual performance evaluation [1].\n\n![The three main evaluation indicators for executive remuneration are consolidated operating income, share price volatility, and individual performance.](image1)\n\nConsolidated operating income is used as a primary business performance metric, serving as an indicator of how well Toyota achieves its targets and sustainable growth. The volatility of Toyota’s share price evaluates the company’s performance from a shareholder value perspective, reflecting corporate value and the assessment of efforts by shareholders and investors. Each of these two quantitative indicators is given an equal weighting (50%) in the performance-linked remuneration evaluation, where the operating income is compared against a reference value (e.g., 1 trillion yen), and the share price volatility is benchmarked against values like the Nikkei average [3]. This ensures executive remuneration not only rewards profit generation but also alignment with market value and investor interests.\n\n![Evaluation weight for consolidated operating income and share price volatility each contribute 50% to performance evaluation.](image3)\n\nThese measures, combined with qualitative individual performance assessments, directly affect both the bonus and share-based compensation awarded to executives.

This shift from a credit in 2019 to a charge in 2020 led to an increased expense recognized on the financial statements, ultimately reducing operating profit for the year[1][5].\n\nThe detailed financials show that in the second quarter of 2020, $24 million in restructuring charges/other were included in operating profit. By contrast, the only comparable entry for 2019 was a $36 million credit in the second quarter, which increased operating profit that year. Therefore, the reversal from a positive to a negative restructuring impact directly decreased operating profit in 2020 relative to 2019.\n\nThe movement in restructuring charges is also reflected in the changes to the restructuring accrual balance, starting from $0 at the beginning of 2020, with $25 million charged, $1 million in non-cash items added, $8 million paid, resulting in an ending balance of $18 million. In 2019, the balance moved from $28 million to $0, largely due to a $15 million credit and $13 million in payments[5].\n\n![Significant restructuring charge in 2020 compared to a credit in 2019](image5)\n\nThis shift is evidenced in the quarterly breakdown, where restructuring charges/other were a $24 million expense in Q2 2020 and a $36 million credit in Q2 2019, directly impacting operating profit figures in those quarters.\n\n![2020 saw an expense from restructuring charges; 2019 saw a credit, flipping the effect on operating profit](image3)\n\nIn summary: In 2020, restructuring charges were a $25 million expense that reduced operating profit, in stark contrast to 2019 when a $15 million credit from restructuring increased operating profit—directly reversing the effect year-over-year[1][5]."}

PAN India projects saw the highest expenditures:\n- A nationwide COVID Relief project amounted to ₹70.00 crore, executed via the PM Cares fund, not directly by the company, but through a government-endorsed channel.\n- Additional sizable COVID Relief expenditure is seen with another PAN India project at ₹24.73 crore.[image3]\n\nOther significant COVID Relief spending:\n- Maharashtra received multiple interventions, including ₹4.00 crore (Mumbai Police Foundation), ₹0.75 crore (National Health and Education Society), and more.\n- Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat, and Haryana had smaller allocations, generally under ₹1 crore each.[image4]\n\nMode of implementation: COVID Relief initiatives were frequently delivered in partnership with government trusts (PM Cares, Mumbai Police Foundation) or through recognized NGOs (Setu Charitable Trust, Yuva Unstoppable). Many large allocations were not executed “directly” by the corporate entity but rather through intermediaries or direct government support.[image4]\n\n![COVID Relief: Highest allocation to PAN India initiatives, largely through government channels](image3)\n![Multiple smaller and a few large COVID Relief projects across states, using external implementing agencies](image4)\n\n### Rural Development Projects\n\nRural Development Projects (frequently listed as HRDP) are distributed more granularly across numerous states and districts, with mostly smaller individual allocations per project (often between ₹0.5 crore and ₹1 crore each):\n- States like Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Chhattisgarh host several HRDP projects.\n- Notable rural allocations include ₹1.04 crore in Jharkhand, ₹0.87 crore in Madhya Pradesh, and ₹1.93 crore in Uttar Pradesh for different districts.[image2][image5]\n- Total spend per district is relatively modest compared to the flagship COVID Relief projects.\n\nMode of implementation: Rural Development Projects predominantly utilize NGO partners, with only a small fraction marked as “Direct” implementation.

The discount rate is typically linked to yields on high-quality corporate bonds, and changes in these rates significantly affect the DBO[2]. A decrease in the discount rate increases obligations, while an increase reduces them[4].\n\nFrom 2020 to 2021, the discount rate rose from 1.5% to 1.7% overall, with notable increases for major currencies, such as the U.S. dollar (from 2.4% to 2.7%) and the Euro (from 0.9% to 1.0%)![Discount rates increased for all major currencies from 2020 to 2021](image4). This means the present value of future pension liabilities decreased due to higher rates.\n\nSensitivity analysis shows that a half-percentage-point increase in the discount rate in 2021 would reduce the DBO by €242 million; conversely, a decrease would increase the DBO by €271 million. Similar effects are observed for compensation increases and pension progression![The defined benefit obligation is highly sensitive to changes in key actuarial assumptions, especially discount rate](image1).\n\nWhen looking at the actuarial gains and losses, in 2021 there was a total actuarial gain of €22 million, compared with a loss of €67 million in 2020. This shift is mainly due to changes in financial assumptions (minus €26 million in 2021 versus plus €72 million in 2020) and indicates that the assumptions moved more favorably in 2021, likely due to the higher discount rate![Actuarial gains replaced losses as assumptions became more favorable in 2021](image3).\n\nOn the plan assets side, total assets increased from €2,813 million in 2020 to €3,259 million in 2021, with the largest increases in fixed income securities and multi-strategy funds. The composition and growth in assets support efforts to stabilize funded status despite changing obligations![Total plan assets increased, driven by higher fixed income securities and multi-strategy funds](image2).\n\nIn summary, the increase in discount rates and other assumption changes led to actuarial gains and reduced the DBO, while plan assets also grew, improving the overall funded status between 2020 and 2021."}

Additionally, Advanced Approach RWA rose due to more exposure in derivatives and higher credit spread volatility for CVA[5]. \n- Market risk RWA rose as well, primarily due to higher Regulatory VaR driven by increased market volatility[6].\n- There was a decline in operational risk RWA under the Advanced Approach, owing to reduced frequency and severity of litigation-related losses[9].\n\nThese details are reflected in the following image, which shows substantial increases in various risk RWA components from end-2019 to end-2020:\n\n![Credit risk and market risk RWA both increased significantly in 2020, driving up total RWA.](image3)\n\nFrom this, we see that total RWA rose from $394,177 million (Standardized, end-2019) to $453,106 million (Standardized, end-2020).\n\nNext, considering the external TLAC ratio:\n\n- The actual external TLAC as a percentage of RWA was 49.9% at the end of 2019 and 47.7% at the end of 2020, as per the summary table:\n\n![External TLAC as a percentage of RWA declined from 49.9% in 2019 to 47.7% in 2020, despite an increase in the absolute TLAC amount.](image5)\n\nEven though the total external TLAC amount increased from $196,888 million to $216,129 million, the ratio to RWA decreased. This decline occurred because the growth in RWA (mainly from increased derivatives, lending, and equity exposure) outpaced the growth in TLAC.\n\nIn summary, the increase in various RWA components (especially credit and market risk) in 2020 led to a higher overall RWA denominator, which caused the external TLAC as a percentage of RWA to decrease, despite the fact that the actual dollar amount of TLAC increased during the year.\n\n**Direct Answer:**  \nThe increases in credit and market risk RWA components in 2020 caused total RWA to rise, leading to a decrease in external TLAC as a percentage of RWA from 49.9% in 2019 to 47.7% in 2020, even though the absolute TLAC amount grew."}

Year-end equity rose to $14,827,691.\n- In 2020, net income of $5,185,313 and positive OCI resulted in an even greater boost, pushing equity to $17,499,173.\n\nThis impact is clearly reflected in the changes seen in equity statements for each year:\n\n![2018 equity rollforward showing net income and comprehensive income impact.](image3)\n![2019 equity rollforward showing net income and comprehensive income impact.](image4)\n![2020 equity rollforward highlighting how improved comprehensive income drove a significant increase in equity.](image5)\n\nIn summary, Accenture's growing net income each year consistently increased retained earnings, while fluctuations in comprehensive income, driven mainly by foreign currency and pension adjustments, either amplified or moderated these increases in total shareholders’ equity.

This growth is evidenced by the increase in total stores from 250 in 2016 to 435 in 2020, with notable expansion in the United Kingdom, France, and the USA, among others. For example, the number of stores in the USA grew dramatically from zero in 2018 to 48 in 2020, and in France from zero to 21 over the same period. Lovisa also increased its stores in the Middle East and continued to open new locations in existing markets like South Africa and New Zealand, while maintaining a stable footprint in Australia.[5]\n\n![Lovisa's international store count significantly increased from 2016 to 2020, especially in the USA, UK, and France.](image5)\n\nThe company’s strategy has focused on leveraging existing territories, rolling out new markets through pilot programs, and responding opportunistically to retail leasing conditions. For instance, regular investigation of new sites, seeking opportunities in high-traffic shopping precincts, and leveraging the company’s capital in large international markets are core aspects of this approach. The achievements during this period include the opening of 47 new stores outside Australia in a single year (2019/2020), with specific mentions of new stores in the UK, France, and USA, as well as the successful establishment of franchised stores in the Middle East and Asia.[4]\n\n![Lovisa's strategic growth pillars include international expansion, with achievements such as opening 47 new stores outside Australia in the year.](image4)\n\nHowever, Lovisa faced several challenges amid its international expansion. The competitive retail environment and changes in consumer preferences posed ongoing threats, as did securing appropriately sized sites in good locations. COVID-19 also greatly affected the global retail leasing market, requiring close monitoring and adaptability. There were risks in executing growth strategies and possible disruptions in supply chains and sourcing as Lovisa optimized its global operations and logistics network.

This change was driven by movements in both deferred tax assets and liabilities. \n\nLooking into the components, total deferred tax assets before the valuation allowance decreased slightly from $662 million in 2019 to $645 million in 2020, while the valuation allowance itself remained almost unchanged (from $(180)$ million in 2019 to $(179)$ million in 2020). The principal driver of the net deferred tax asset increase was the substantial decrease in total deferred tax liabilities, which dropped from $(363)$ million in 2019 to $(213)$ million in 2020. The reduction in deferred tax liabilities is most notable in areas like property, plant, and equipment, and acquisition-related intangibles and fair-value adjustments [image2].\n\nThe reduction in uncertain tax positions contributed to these shifts: the liability for uncertain tax positions fell dramatically from $303 million in 2019 to $89 million in 2020, primarily because of a $249 million tax benefit recognized for the settlement of a depreciation-related uncertain tax position [3]. This effective settlement resulted in the reversal of $46 million in accrued interest, which was reflected in other income and expenses [3]. The balance table for uncertain tax positions illustrates that significant reductions were made for prior years in 2020 [image4].\n\nTherefore, while deferred tax assets remained relatively steady, the marked drop in deferred tax liabilities—driven in part by the resolution of uncertain tax positions—greatly increased the net deferred tax asset reported for year-end 2020.\n\n![The net deferred tax asset rose from $119 million in 2019 to $253 million in 2020 due to a sharp drop in deferred tax liabilities.](image3)\n\n![The breakdown shows a stable deferred tax asset, but a reduction in deferred tax liabilities was the key driver for the increase in the net asset.](image2)\n\n![Uncertain tax position liabilities fell sharply due to a $249 million settlement, helping to reduce deferred tax liabilities.](image4)\n\nIn summary, the net deferred tax asset increased from 2019 to 2020 mainly because the resolution and settlement of uncertain tax positions caused deferred tax liabilities to decrease significantly."}

As outlined in the report, fluctuations in commodity prices are a core determinant of value for BHP, with even small changes in coal and nickel prices translating to significant shifts in profits and EBITDA. For example, a US$1 per tonne change in metallurgical coal price shifts underlying EBITDA by US$35 million, while a US$0.01 per pound movement in nickel price affects underlying EBITDA by US$1 million, illustrating the financial leverage BHP has to commodity market swings. \n\n![Table showing financial sensitivity to commodity price changes; a US$1/t change in metallurgical coal price has a US$35M EBITDA impact, and a US$0.01/lb change in nickel price equals US$1M EBITDA impact.](image1)\n\nIn FY2021, coal experienced lower average realised prices and reduced volumes, leading to a substantial decrease in underlying EBITDA—reflecting a drop from US$1,632 million to US$288 million. This significant decline is attributed mainly to lower coal market prices, higher maintenance and stripping costs, and lower volumes sold, which were only partly offset by internal cost-saving initiatives [2]. In contrast, nickel benefited from price increases and stronger demand, which drove underlying EBITDA up by US$296 million, with price rises and higher volumes outpacing negative factors like higher third-party concentrate purchase costs and adverse currency movements [1].\n\nFor coal, average realised prices for metallurgical coal fell from US$130.97/t in 2020 to US$106.64/t in 2021, and similar declines were seen in hard coking and weak coking coal, exerting downward pressure on revenues and profits.\n\n![Coal revenues and realised prices dropped significantly from FY2020 to FY2021, contributing to a weaker EBITDA.](image2)\n\nIn summary, commodity price movements—whether up or down—are a principal driver for BHP's financial outcomes, especially for coal and nickel. Coal profits are highly exposed to changes in international coal prices and volumes, while nickel’s profitability can rise sharply with stronger pricing and demand, but is also sensitive to input costs and currency effects.

Stronger profits from consolidated and affiliated companies: In 2021, profit rose to $6,493 million from $3,003 million in 2020. This doubling in profit is largely due to increased sales volume, driven by higher end-user demand for equipment and services, better price realization, and improvements in dealer inventories. Favorable impacts from mark-to-market pension and OPEB remeasurement gains, a lower effective tax rate, foreign currency exchange gains, and lower restructuring expenses also played key roles, though these were partially offset by higher manufacturing, SG&A/R&D costs[1][10].\n\n2. Other comprehensive income turned negative: While the company’s profit rose sharply, total other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax, swung from a positive $679 million in 2020 to a negative $(665) million in 2021, primarily due to a negative effect from foreign currency translation ($ -598 million for 2021) instead of a positive effect ($577 million in 2020), and smaller negative impacts from pension and postretirement benefits, derivatives, and available-for-sale securities.\n\nIn summary, the increase in comprehensive income attributable to shareholders in 2021 was powered chiefly by a large rise in profits, partially dampened by a shift to losses in other comprehensive income (notably from foreign currency translation).\n\n**Answer:** Comprehensive income attributable to shareholders increased by $2,147 million from 2020 to 2021, mainly due to a sharp rise in profits from consolidated and affiliated companies, which was partially offset by a shift to losses in other comprehensive income, especially from foreign currency translation effects."}

This increase was primarily driven by reductions in financing receivables due to sales of receivables and certain COVID-19 related tax payment deferrals.

This large decrease was mainly due to lower cash used for acquisitions, as there was a major outflow in 2019 related to the Red Hat acquisition; it was partially offset by a decrease in cash provided by finance receivables and increased purchases of marketable securities [2][3].\n\n### Financing Activities\n\nFinancing activities shifted dramatically: The company used $(9,721) million of cash in 2020, compared to generating $9,042 million in 2019.

This rise was affected by several key factors:\n\n- The adoption of the new CECL accounting standard, which initially reduced the ACL by $41 million at transition but, as reflected in annual movements, led to a more comprehensive and forward-looking approach to measuring credit losses [5].\n- Gross charge-offs during the year amounted to $105 million, partly offset by recoveries of $8 million, leading to net charge-offs of $97 million [8].\n- The most significant increase came from provisions, which added $762 million to the ACL during the year [8]. These provisions were driven by actual and forecasted changes in asset quality trends, the continued economic impact and uncertainty brought on by COVID-19, and specific risks related to sectors in focus.\n- The allowance at year-end comprised $835 million for loans and $396 million for lending commitments.\n\n![ACL increased from $590 million in 2019 to $1,231 million in 2020, driven by CECL adoption, charge-offs, and large provisions.](image4)\n\nEconomic uncertainty, especially concerning the effects of COVID-19, played a crucial role in setting the 2020 provision.

This goal is aligned with the Paris Agreement and includes science-based interim targets, active engagement with clients on climate goals, and setting GHG targets for all scopes of emissions—namely Scope 1 (direct emissions), Scope 2 (indirect emissions from purchased energy), and Scope 3 (other indirect emissions from the supply chain and investment activities) [1][7].

At the same time, increases in warehouse ancillary and other businesses (like gasoline sales) partially offset the decline, but not enough to prevent the overall drop. There were also minor impacts from increased reward programs and currency fluctuations[5].\n- Gross margin percentage on a segment basis declined across all segments, with decreases in core merchandise categories being offset only partially by better results in ancillary operations. The U.S. segment also faced negative effects from LIFO charges, while international operations felt the impact of increased rewards. The cessation of extra COVID-19 wages did provide a small positive offset[1].\n- Inflation in merchandise costs, higher than recent years, also pressured margins. The company sometimes absorbed these cost increases or kept prices steady to maintain price perception among members rather than passing full increases on to customers, which further reduced margins[3].\n- Gasoline operations, which generally have a lower gross margin percentage, contributed a higher share of sales. Rapid gasoline price increases boost the sales base (the denominator), which can make gross margin percentage appear lower, even if dollar gross margin rises[2][7].\n\nIn summary, Costco’s gross margin percentage decreased from 2020 to 2022 primarily due to lower margins in core merchandise categories, inflation-driven cost pressures absorbed by the company, and a shift in sales mix towards lower-margin gasoline sales."}

However, in 2021, net financing outflows increased again, nearly doubling relative to 2020, but still less negative than in 2019.\n\nThis is corroborated by the following explanation:\n- In 2021, there were higher repayments of interest-bearing liabilities and higher dividends paid, reflecting strong profits, which contributed to the increase in net financing cash outflows compared to 2020 [7]. The main reasons include bond repayments, early hybrid bond repurchases, and record dividend payouts.\n\nIn summary, \nThe trend in net financing cash flows from continuing operations was a large outflow in 2019, a significant moderation in 2020, and then a substantial increase in outflow again in 2021, reflecting higher repayments and dividends in the latter year."}

In 2021, this amount becomes a large benefit ($(1,122)$M), and for 2022, a smaller expected benefit ($(121)$M).\n\nThis trend closely correlates with the mark-to-market (MTM) losses and gains.

The note also specifies that the expected net periodic benefit cost (benefit) figure does not include an estimate for mark-to-market gains or losses, indicating that MTM changes cause large year-to-year swings in the total reported figure.\n\nFrom supporting text:\n- The 2021 net mark-to-market gain was primarily due to higher discount rates at the end of 2021 compared to the prior year, despite some offsets by assumption changes and lower-than-expected asset returns[10].\n- Conversely, both 2020 and 2019 had net mark-to-market losses mainly due to lower discount rates[6][7].\n\nTherefore, the trend in the Total Net Periodic Benefit Cost (Benefit) from 2019 to 2022 is largely driven by the presence and magnitude of mark-to-market gains or losses—large losses increase the cost, while large gains generate a reported benefit.\n\nIn summary:  \nThe Total Net Periodic Benefit Cost (Benefit) fell sharply from a cost in 2019-2020 to a large benefit in 2021 and a smaller expected benefit in 2022, a trend driven primarily by large mark-to-market losses in 2019-2020 and a large mark-to-market gain in 2021[1][6][7][10]."}

For example, among self-identified Hispanics, just 18% of foreign-born individuals are in the third or higher generation, while among self-identified non-Hispanics, this number rises sharply to 96%, indicating that most with distant ancestry do not identify as Hispanic.

As a result, the number of individual farms plummeted from over 2,000 in 1900 to just 603 in 2002, while the average farm size grew significantly from around 180 acres to nearly 600 acres[4].\n\nEthnic settlement patterns also played a role in shaping rural life, as various groups clustered in distinct areas, fostering strong church-centered communities that became lasting focal points for those populations![Hamilton County's rural religious complexes helped sustain cultural traditions](image1)[1][7][8].\n\nIn summary, Hamilton County's population soared rapidly due to railroad expansion and homesteading opportunities, but then gradually declined as agriculture industrialized, resulting in fewer but larger farms and changing community structures.\n\nHamilton County's population rapidly increased from 130 in 1870 to a peak of 14,096 in 1890 due to railroad expansion and land policies, then declined and stabilized due to farm consolidation and mechanization throughout the 20th century."}

Multimodal Retriever\nThe multimodal retriever is responsible for creating and storing multimodal embeddings for both images and text descriptions. It employs an image encoder to extract feature embeddings from a database of images and uses indexing methods to facilitate efficient similarity-based retrieval. The retriever queries a large external memory to find the top-k class names that are most similar to the input image, based on image-image or image-text k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) in the embedding space [1][8].\n![Diagram showing the process of encoding images and retrieving the most similar category embeddings.](image3)\n\n### 2. Memory and Index System\nThe retriever stores embeddings in an external memory, which is optimized for quick access using techniques like the HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World) algorithm. This reduces the dimensionality of stored vectors to speed up retrieval from large-scale datasets [7][8].\n\n### 3. Retrieving and Ranking via MLLM\nOnce the top-k candidate categories are retrieved, both the category labels and the image embedding are passed to a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM). The MLLM uses an integrated ranking prompt to evaluate and rank these candidates according to their relevance to the input image, drawing from both internal model knowledge and retrieved information [1][4][5]. This process results in a more precise and contextually aware classification.\n![The MLLM ranks the retrieved categories to predict the final class.](image4)\n\n### 4. (For Object Detection) Preprocessing and Focus Mechanisms\nFor object detection, specific preprocessing steps, such as cropping and blurring, are applied to images. Cropping isolates objects using bounding box proposals while blurring non-target areas helps the model focus on relevant regions for better detection and recognition [3].\n![Shows bounding box cropping and retrieval for object detection to focus on relevant items.](image5)\n\n---\n\nIn summary, the main components of RAR are: (1) a multimodal retriever for embedding extraction and similarity-based retrieval, (2) an efficient memory and index system for scalable storage and access, (3) an MLLM that ranks candidates for accurate categorization, and (4) task-specific preprocessing for improved detection.

These object queries serve as input tokens that allow DETR to predict a fixed set of objects in parallel, representing candidate bounding boxes and class labels.\n\nWithin DETR's overall workflow, image features are first extracted by a CNN backbone, after which positional encodings are added and the features are passed through a transformer encoder. The output is then fed to the transformer decoder, which receives the set of object queries as input. Each object query guides the decoder to attend to image features relevant to a potential object, and the decoder transforms these queries—via multi-head self- and encoder-decoder attention—into output embeddings, which are then independently converted into bounding box coordinates and object class labels by feed-forward networks[2][3][5].\n\nThis framework, highlighted in the illustrative diagrams, shows object queries entering the decoder and branching into parallel prediction heads, producing boxes and class scores for each query.

This effect is demonstrated by comparing models with and without repetition control: without repetition control, models can reach question-asking rates close to 100% as intended; however, when repetition control is added, the maximum achievable question-asking rate drops, and certain question-asking bigrams are suppressed, leading to reduced rates of generated questions.\n\nSpecifically, text evidence explains that the primary reason is the repetition control feature (\"extrep bigram\"), which discourages the generation of bigrams that have already appeared, including those that commonly form questions (e.g., \"do you,\" \"what is\"). As a result, even settings designed to produce nearly all questions are limited to lower rates unless special mechanisms are used to bypass this restriction [3].\n\nThis effect is visually confirmed in the graph below: the curve for question-controlled conditional training with repetition control plateaus at a significantly lower question-asking rate than the version without repetition control. Only with an added \"boost\" setting—removing the restriction during initial beam search—does the model approach the target rate for question-asking, at a cost of increased repetition.\n\n![Repetition control limits question-asking: with repetition control, even high question-asking settings fail to generate questions as frequently as intended.](image4)\n\nTo summarize, introducing repetition control into the generation process reduces the frequency of question-asking because common question formulations are deemed repetitive and thus suppressed, unless additional mechanisms are put in place to balance both objectives [3].\n\nIn short: Repetition control reduces the frequency of question-asking in generated text by suppressing common question bigrams, leading to fewer questions unless the control is specifically adjusted."}

Their key differences lie in how the long-term user representation (LTUR) is combined with the short-term user representation (STUR):\n\nLSTUR-ini uses the long-term user representation (from user embedding) to initialize the hidden state of the GRU network in the short-term user representation model. The GRU then processes the user's click history, and the final hidden state serves as the unified user representation[4][9]. This approach directly influences the short-term representation using long-term memory from the very start of sequence modeling.\n\nLSTUR-con, by contrast, processes the user's click history using the GRU (STUR) independently, and then concatenates the resulting short-term representation with the long-term user representation to form the final unified user vector[4][9]. Here, both types of information are retained side by side instead of one influencing the recurrent process of the other.\n\nThis distinction is clearly illustrated as follows:\n\n![LSTUR-ini initializes GRU with long-term user embedding, while LSTUR-con concatenates long- and short-term representations afterwards.](image3)\n\nIn summary: LSTUR-ini integrates long-term memory as the initial state of the GRU, influencing the modeling of short-term interests, while LSTUR-con keeps long-term and short-term representations separate until they are concatenated for the final user representation."}

After each cycle, the output is judged for completeness or relevance, and if necessary, the process iterates again until a predefined maximum number of times or satisfaction threshold is reached. This method chiefly focuses on incrementally enhancing the context provided to the model with multiple retrieval steps.\n\n![Iterative retrieval provides more context information through repeated cycles of retrieval and generation.](image5)\n\n## Recursive Retrieval\n\nRecursive retrieval takes a more hierarchical or step-by-step approach to handle complex queries. Here, after each cycle of retrieval and generation, the system may transform or decompose the query further—often breaking the problem down into sub-problems. The system continues recursively, refining or altering the query at each stage, until it reaches an acceptable solution or a maximum recursion depth.\n\n![Recursive retrieval breaks down complex problems by decomposing or transforming queries at each cycle.](image5)\n\nText evidence corroborates this: \"Recursive retrieval is often used in information retrieval and NLP to improve the depth and relevance of search results ... refining search queries based on the results ... through a feedback loop ... particularly useful in complex search scenarios ... allows for continuous learning and adaptation\" [1]. Additionally, recursive retrieval is often combined with hierarchical structured indexing and in-depth, multi-hop searching strategies [5].\n\n## Adaptive Retrieval\n\nAdaptive retrieval introduces decision points (\"judge\" steps) before both retrieval and generation phases. The system dynamically decides, based on the current state or the needs of the query, whether to retrieve, generate, or transform the query. It emphasizes flexible, active control, retrieving information only \"on demand\" and thus optimizing for efficiency and relevance rather than following a fixed schedule of retrieval and generation cycles.\n\n![Adaptive retrieval allows dynamic, on-demand control over when to retrieve or generate, introducing decision points throughout the process.](image5)\n\nSupporting text also notes: \"Adaptive retrieval methods...enable LLMs to actively determine the optimal moments and content for retrieval, thus enhancing the efficiency and relevance of the information sourced\" [2].\n\n---\n\nTo summarize:  \n- Iterative retrieval repeatedly cycles through retrieval and generation steps to enhance context.\n- Recursive retrieval decomposes complex queries step-by-step, adding depth and refinement.\n- Adaptive retrieval introduces flexible, decision-based control, retrieving information only as needed for optimal efficiency.\n\nThese approaches respectively focus on incremental enhancement, hierarchical query resolving, and flexible, on-demand querying within RAG systems."}

When gold paragraphs (relevant context) are present among distractors, models achieve much higher F1 scores because they directly access the necessary information to answer questions, even with irrelevant paragraphs present. Conversely, in open-domain settings where models rely on retrieval (often using TF-IDF), the absence or poor retrieval of gold paragraphs causes a significant drop in performance, indicating sensitivity to distractor selection and retrieval effectiveness.\n\nFor example, in a controlled distractor setting where eight TF-IDF selected distractors are paired with gold paragraphs, a single-paragraph BERT model achieves an F1 of 67.08[1]. However, in open-domain settings with 500 retrieved paragraphs (where retrieval of gold context is uncertain), the F1 drops to 39.12. When the gold paragraph is explicitly added to the retrieved set, the F1 score increases to 53.12, demonstrating the critical role of gold paragraph inclusion in driving higher performance[10]. \n\n![Inclusion of gold paragraphs substantially boosts F1 while many distractors cause steep performance drops if the gold context is missing.](image5)\n\nThis difference is further emphasized when adversarial distractors or different settings are used. While performance declines with harder or more type-matched distractors, retraining on adversarial data enables models to recover much of their original accuracy[4][2]. Specifically, evaluation on “adversarial” distractors pulls F1 from 67.08 to 46.84, but model retraining restores much of the lost accuracy (to 60.10 F1)[4].\n\n![F1 drops with adversarial or type-matched distractors, but retraining recovers much of the performance](image2)\n\nThese results imply that gold paragraph inclusion enables models—especially single-hop or shallow models—to excel even when many distractors are present. The ability of models to recover performance via retraining on more difficult distractors suggests that dataset construction, distractor choice, and retrieval quality are crucial for properly evaluating multi-hop reasoning abilities and preventing models from relying on shortcuts or shallow retrieval-based evidence[10][7][1]. Overall, performance is heavily linked to the presence of gold paragraphs and the quality of distractors, with retrieval quality serving as a major bottleneck in open-domain settings.\n\nIn conclusion: The inclusion of gold paragraphs dramatically improves F1 scores for QA models, while harder or poorly retrieved distractors expose weaknesses in reasoning and retrieval, highlighting the need for strong retrieval and challenging distractor construction to meaningfully assess multi-hop reasoning performance."}

This architecture decomposes the logical reasoning task into three main stages: Problem Formulation, Symbolic Reasoning, and Result Interpretation.\n\nFirst, in the Problem Formulation stage, the model uses a large language model (LLM) to translate a natural language problem statement and goal into a task-specific symbolic language. Here, the LLM identifies entities, facts, and rules from the text and maps them into precise symbolic forms that are suitable for logical reasoning [1][2]. This transformation leverages the LLM’s powerful natural language understanding abilities to bridge the gap between human language and machine-interpretable structures.\n\nNext, during the Symbolic Reasoning stage, the framework employs deterministic symbolic solvers—such as logic programming engines, first-order logic provers, constraint optimizers, or SMT (Satisfiability Modulo Theories) solvers—depending on the type of logical problem. These solvers operate directly on the symbolic representations to \"compute\" the answer via transparent, algorithmic steps. Since this stage is deterministic, it provides faithfulness and reduces errors that might arise from the probabilistic nature of LLMs [1][2][6].\n\nFinally, in the Result Interpretation module, either an LLM or a rule-based system reads the output from the symbolic solver and translates it back into natural language, presenting the result in a manner that is meaningful to the end user [1][2]. The framework also allows for \"self-refinement,\" where feedback from the symbolic solver (such as error messages) is used to iteratively improve the quality of the symbolic representation, increasing robustness and accuracy [2][6].\n\nThe following diagram encapsulates this multi-stage workflow:\n\n![LOGIC-LM workflow: LLM translates NL to symbolic forms, symbolic solvers infer, and the results are mapped back to language.](image5)\n\nFor example, Figure 5 shows how LOGIC-LM:\n- Extracts and converts diverse logic problems to symbolic languages (like logic programming or constraint optimization),\n- Invokes a suitable symbolic reasoner for deterministic inference,\n- Interprets the resulting answer back into natural language.\n\nIn summary, LOGIC-LM first formulates the problem symbolically via LLM, then uses a deterministic solver for faithful inference, and finally interprets the answer back to natural language, ensuring reliable and transparent logical reasoning [1][2][6].\n\nDirect answer: LOGIC-LM solves problems by converting them into symbolic language with an LLM, performing deterministic inference with a symbolic solver, and then translating the result back into natural language."}

This allows the model to capture subword information, such as morphological variations (prefixes, suffixes) and capitalization patterns, which is especially useful for handling words not seen during training or for dealing with spelling variations and inflections common in many languages [1]. For example, character-level features can help recognize that \"San\" in \"San Diego\" indicates a location, even if \"San\" has not been frequently observed.\n\nWord-level embeddings, on the other hand, provide representations for entire words, capturing their semantic meaning based on large text corpora. These embeddings allow the model to utilize word meanings and context within a sentence, supporting accurate classification based on patterns of how words are used together.\n\nThe process starts with the character-level Bi-LSTM creating embeddings for each word, which are then concatenated with the word embeddings to form comprehensive input representations.

According to the diagram and supporting text, pre-processing begins by cropping regions of the image based on bounding box proposals, ensuring that the system focuses on individual objects even if they are small or not centrally located. Following cropping, the system applies a blurring technique to the non-target areas surrounding the object of interest. This directs the attention of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to the relevant areas, enhancing their ability to correctly identify the objects during retrieval and ranking phases [4].\n\n![Cropped and blurred regions ensure objects of interest are isolated and easier to retrieve for recognition.](image2)\n\nBy isolating each object and minimizing visual distractions, pre-processing allows for more accurate embedding extraction by the image encoder.

The field began with foundational work on representing words temporally, introducing a time tensor approach with Random Indexing around 2010. This allowed each word to have a semantic vector for each time period, laying the groundwork for quantitative comparisons of word meaning across time [4].\n\nNext, the release of major diachronic corpora, especially the Google Ngrams corpus in 2011, provided large-scale data that spurred numerous studies on semantic shifts and even led to the development of ‘culturomics,’ the quantitative study of culture using digital data [9]. Shortly thereafter, techniques for word epoch disambiguation were developed, and by 2013, prediction-based models like word2vec became central for diachronic analysis [7].\n\nThe year 2014 marked a shift towards using incremental updates of embedding models (enabling nuanced temporal tracking of word meaning), and by 2015, several corpora such as the New York Times (NYT) Annotated Corpus and the Corpus of Historical American English (COHA) were being employed to trace semantic change on a yearly or decadal basis [10].\n\nFurther advances in 2016 and 2017 included the proposal and empirical examination of statistical laws of semantic change, the use of local measures for improved detection, critical assessment of existing semantic change laws, and the expansion into diachronic relations and joint learning methods [6].\n\n![Key research milestones from 2010 to 2017: from early temporal modeling, through adoption of major corpora and prediction-based models, to the development of sophisticated comparative and analytical methods.](image1)\n\nIn summary, the key milestones from 2010 to 2017 are: the introduction of temporal modeling (time tensor), deployment of large-scale corpora (Google Ngrams, NYT, COHA), adoption of prediction-based embeddings (word2vec), incremental update models, model alignment techniques, and the development and critique of statistical laws of semantic change, all contributing to a robust and diverse field for tracing diachronic semantic shifts [1][4][7][9][10]."}

This pattern is noted in the text: \"Head word supervision is particularly helpful for predicting ultra-fine labels, while entity linking improves fine label prediction\" [9].\n\nText corroborates that crowdsourced examples make \"the biggest impact,\" and head word supervision \"is particularly helpful for predicting ultra-fine labels\" [9].

The volcanoes map also uses summary points to represent individual data items, and it sits among other global point-maps (e.g., for airports or heritage sites), illustrating the flexibility of this style for different datasets:\n\n- ![Global map showing volcano locations as red dots (Volcanoes of the world)](image3)\n\nWhen comparing both:\n- Public library maps for the Netherlands offer granular, localized data with the ability to break down by administrative areas (province, postal zones), which is visually dense and specific to a small geography.\n- The volcanoes map offers a high-level global survey, showing larger-scale patterns but without administrative overlays, focusing instead on broad distribution patterns.\n\nBoth rely on red point markers on geographic backdrops to communicate the presence and density of entities—be they libraries or volcanoes—but differ in scale, context, and the level of detail provided due to the nature of the data.\n\nIn summary: Both volcanoes worldwide and Dutch public libraries are represented as red dots on digital maps, but library maps are detailed and localized within the Netherlands, while volcano maps present a global overview, each tailored to the nature of their respective datasets."}

This stage is backward-looking, raises questions, and transforms raw data into information but typically lacks deeper context or actionable insights, serving as the groundwork for analytics[1].\n\nAnalysis, by contrast, moves beyond description to prescription and prediction—it seeks to answer \"Why did it happen?\" and \"What could happen next?\" Analysis is forward-looking, provides recommendations or findings, answers the questions posed by reports, and translates data and information into actionable insights and storytelling[1]. This interpretive process enables organizations to make evidence-based decisions, thereby moving towards value creation.\n\n![Reporting transforms data into information, while analysis converts information into insight, driving action and business value.](image4)\n\nThe analytics value chain illustrates how these stages interconnect: data flows into reporting (to raise awareness), then into analysis (to provide understanding), which, in turn, drives action, ultimately delivering business value[4]. This sequence highlights that simply having reports is not enough; only when analysis leads to informed actions do organizations realize true business impact.\n\n![Reporting and analysis are distinct stages: reporting asks what happened, while analysis explores why and what’s next, bridging BI and advanced analytics.](image1)\n\nAs illustrated in the path from BI to BA, organizations mature by moving from basic reporting and descriptive intelligence (BI) to advanced analysis techniques (statistical analysis, forecasting, predictive modeling, and optimization) central to business analytics (BA).

By 2010, the share of time with family and friends dropped to 21%, while there were increases in eating out (from 10% to 17%) and time spent on the computer (net surfing rose to 4% and watching films dropped to 10%) ![Decrease in time with family/friends and rise in eating out/computer use from 2005 to 2010](image2).\n\nThis change suggests a societal shift: as time with family and friends declined, individual or screen-based activities, and perhaps education-related engagements (like online learning or lectures), grew. This is aligned with the global rise in educational participation. For instance, the training program statistics show 425 participants from 105 countries, 70,000 minutes watched online, and 2,000 clicks on lecture videos, indicating strong engagement in digital education platforms ![Global training program participation: high online engagement and international reach](image1).\n\nThese two pieces of evidence together suggest that, as people shifted from primarily social weekend activities to more individual or digital ones, there was a parallel growth in online educational participation worldwide, facilitated by global training programs and the broader adoption of remote learning.\n\nIn summary, between 2005 and 2010, weekend social time significantly declined while digital and individual pursuits increased, mirroring the global trend of rising online educational engagement and participation."}

If the conversion from MQL to SAL is only 1.50% instead of the expected 45%-75%, it suggests potential bottlenecks or misalignment between marketing and sales teams, or possibly issues with the quality of leads being passed.\n\nA text quote supports the definition of the MQL: \"When the scores reach a pre-determined threshold,the prospector lead is deemed Marketing Qualified and therefore sales-ready and transferred to the sales team.\" Thus, the MQL → SAL transition is a crucial measure of how well these leads are being accepted and actioned by sales [1].\n\nIn summary, a high MQL to SAL conversion rate (close to the 45%-75% benchmark) signals alignment between marketing and sales and good lead quality, while a very low conversion rate (1.50% in the observed data) flags significant process or quality issues requiring improvement. \n\nDirect answer:  \nThe MQL to SAL conversion rate is 1.50% in the observed dataset, much lower than the industry benchmark of 45%-75%, indicating a need for better marketing-sales alignment or improved lead quality."}
