According to [11], there has been a notable shift in concern, with more people now expressing that anti-terrorism policies have not gone far enough to protect the country (56%) compared to those who believe these policies have gone too far in restricting civil liberties (28%). This trend is evident from 20004 to 20115, as shown in **image1**, where the percentage of those concerned that policies have not gone far enough has consistently increased.\n\n**Image1** shows a line graph depicting the percentage of Americans who believe the government’s anti-terror policies have not gone far enough to protect the country versus those who think they have gone too far in restricting civil liberties. The graph indicates a steady increase in concern about insufficient protection since 2004.\n\n#### Differences by Political Affiliation\nPolitical affiliation significantly influences public perceptions of government anti-terrorism efforts. As detailed in [3] and [7], Democrats are now the only partisan group in which a majority (64%) say the government is doing at least fairly well in reducing the terrorist threat, down from 85% in January. Independents’s positive ratings have dropped 25 points, from 69% to 44%. Republicans, on the other hand, have become more critical, with slightly more than seven-in-ten (71%) saying their greater concern is that anti-terrorism policies do not go far enough, up 1 14 points since January and 33 points since July 2013.\n**Image2** illustrates this political divide, showing that Republican sentiment has sharply declined, while Democratic and Independent sentiments have remained relatively stable but lower.\n\n#### Age Group Differences\nAge also plays a crucial role in shaping public opinion on government anti-terrorism efforts. Older and less educated Americans are somewhat more likely than younger and more highly educated Americans to give the government low marks for the job it is doing reducing the threat of terrorism. For example, among those 50 and older, a majority (57%) say the government is not doing well reducing the terrorist threat, while 46% of younger adults (those 1  18-29 years old) give the government’s performance a negative rating, as seen in **image6**.\n**Image6** provides a bar chart comparing additional scrutiny solely because of religion and scrutiny than people in other religious groups across different age groups and educational backgrounds.

According to text quotes [1], older and less educated Americans are more likely to give the government low marks for its performance in reducing terrorism compared to younger and more highly educated individuals. This trend is further supported by image quote image1, which shows that among those ages 118 to 29, a majority (55%) express concern that U.S. policies has gone too far in getting involved in the situation, while only 37% say they are not concerned enough to stop Islamic militants.\n\nMoreover, as shown in image quote image6, there is a notable shift over time in how much people believe the government has gone too far in restricting civil liberties versus not going far enough to protect the country. The graph indicates that concerns about government restrictions on civil liberties have fallen dramatically since July 20013, following Edward Snowden’s leaked details about NSA surveillance programs. However, the perception that the government has not gone far enough to protect the country has increased significantly.\n\n#### Political Ideology Influence\n- **Text Quotes**: [3, 9, 11]\n- **Image Quotes**: image3, image4\n\n**Political Ideology Influences Perceptions of Government Efforts to Reduce the Terrorist Threat**\n\nPolitical ideology also plays a crucial role in shaping perceptions of government efforts to reduce the terrorist threat. As seen in text quotes [3], assessments of government efforts to combat terrorism are are more negative across the political spectrum. Democrats are now the only partisan group in which a majority (64%) say the government is doing at least fairly well, down from 85% in January. Independents’ positive ratings have dropped 25 points, from 69% to 44%. And just 27% of Republicans now say the government is doing very or fairly well reducing the terrorist threat, down from 63% at the beginning of the year.\n\nThis is further illustrated in image quote image3, where the Republican Party holds a significantly higher percentage of respondents who believe the government is not doing well reducing the terrorist threat compared to other parties. For example, 79% of Republicans believe the government should be subject to more scrutiny than people in other religious groups, whereas 41% of Democrats hold this view. Similarly, image quote image4 shows that the approval ratings for the government's handling of terrorism have fluctuated over time, with Republicans generally disapproving more than Democrats and Independents.\n\nIn conclusion, both age and political ideology significantly influence perceptions of government efforts to reduce the terrorist threat. Older and less educated individuals tend to view these efforts more negatively, while younger adults are more concerned about the government’s anti-terrorism policies not going far enough to protect the country. Additionally, political ideology shapes these perceptions, with Republicans being more critical of the government’s performance in combating terrorism compared to Democrats and Independents."}

And they are about twice as likely to think China has done a very bad job (61% vs. 30%). Older people, too, are more critical, with 73% of those ages 50 and older finding fault in China’s handling of the pandemic.\n[4] Republicans and Republican-leaning independents are significantly more likely than Democrats and Democratic leanersers to have a very unfavorable view of China, to criticize the Chinese government's role in the global pandemic, and they often want to take a tougher policy approach to the country.\n\n#### Image Quotes\n- **Image1** shows that 51% of Americans believe the Chinese government's initial handling of the coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan is not at all to blame for the global spread of the virus, while 38% think it is to blame to some extent. This pie chart highlights the significant divide between those who hold China responsible and those who do not, with 8% expressing no opinion on the matter.\n\n#### Image Quotes\n- **Image2** provides a breakdown of how much the Chinese government's initial handling of the coronavirus outbreak contributed to the global spread. Around three-quarters of Americans say the Chinese government’s initial handling of the coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan contributed either a great deal (51%) or a fair amount (27%) to the global spread of the virus.\n\n#### Image Quotes\n- **Image3** illustrates the change in perceptions over time, showing that older Americans (50 and older) are more critical of China's response to COVID-119 compared to younger generations (18-29). The line graph indicates an increasing trend in negative views among older adults, suggesting a growing perception of China's handling of the pandemic as problematic.\n\n#### Image Quotes\n- **Image4** shows the shift in opinions over time between Republicans and Democrats regarding China.

Today, 73% of U.S. adults say they have an unfavorable view of the country, up 26 percentage points since 2008. Since March alone, negative views of China have increased 7 points, and there is a widespread sense that China mishandled the initial outbreak and subsequent spread of COVID-119.\n[7] While majorities of every age group now have an unfavorable view of China, Americans ages 50 and older are substantially more negative (81%) than those ages 30 to 49 (71%) or those under 30 (56%). For those ages 50 and older, this represents an increase of 1percentage points since March.\n[8] In the past four months, negative views toward China among Republicans have increased 11 percentage points. Over the same period of time, unfavorable views among Democrats have increased 6 points, resulting in a 15 point gap between the parties.\n\n[10] These are among the findings of a new survey by Pew Research Center, conducted June 1 to July 1, 2000, among 103 adults in the United States. The survey also finds that while Republicans and Democrats both have negative views of China and are critical of Beijing’s handling of the coronavirus, this criticism is more prevalent among Republicans. Republicans and Republican-leaning independents are significantly more likely than Democrats and Democratic leanersers to have a very unfavorable view of China, to criticize the Chinese government’s role in the global pandemic, and they often want to take a tougher policy approach to the country.\n\n#### Image Quotes\n- image1 shows that 51% of respondents believe the U.S. should prioritize strong U.S.-China relations, even if it means overlooking any role China played in the outbreak of the coronavirus.

The data from the Pew Research Center surveys show a consistent rise in unfavorable views, especially among those aged 50 and older, who are nearly three times as likely to see China as an enemy compared to their younger counterparts. Additionally, Republicans have consistently held more negative views of China compared to Democrats, with the gap widening in recent years."}

Just over four-in-ten of those living in the former East say they have a favorable opinion of Russia (43%), compared with one-third of those in the former West. And 71% in the former West favor the EU, while 59% in the former East agree.

Political divides on both sides of the Atlantic continue to shape attitudes about relations with other nations, perceptions about defense spending and Americans' and Germans' views of each other. [1 ] When it comes to cooperation with other countries, there is again a divergence between American and German views. Nearly seven-in-ten Americans (69%) say that they want to cooperate more with Germany, compared with only half of Germans who say the same about the U.S. Nonetheless, the percentage of Germans who say they want to cooperate more with the U.S. has increased nine points since 20018.

For instance, Germans are more likely to view China as the world's leading economic power, whereas Americans are more inclined to see the U.S. in this role. These differences extend to views of the EU, where Germans show greater favorability compared to Americans. The perception of Russia varies similarly, with Germans having a more positive view than Americans. Factors influencing these perceptions include political ideology, with conservatives and right-leaning individuals in both countries showing more favorable views of Russia. Furthermore, the influence of political leaders, such as Donald Trump and Angela Merkel, shapes attitudes towards bilateral relations and security policies."}

Cyberattacks from China, China's policies on human rights, the loss of U.S. jobs to China, and China's growing military power have all seen an increase in concern among Americans over the past year.\n\n#### Changes Over Time\nThe key concerns regarding China have grown over the past year. The data from **Image2** shows a consistent rise in concern across various issues, indicating a growing apprehension among Americans about China's actions and influence. This trend is further supported by the sentiment expressed in **Image8**, which lists \"Made in China\" manufacturing as one of the top negative aspects associated with China, reflecting a broader perception of China's impact on the global economy and American industries.\n\n**Conclusion**\nAmericans' key concerns regarding China include cyber attacks, job losses, technological advancements, and human rights violations. These concerns have increased significantly over the past year, particularly around human rights and economic impacts."}

The share of Latinos who expect their family finances to improve “a lot” or “some” in the coming year is up 114 percentage points, from 67% in 2008 – during the Great Recession – and in 2011 to 81% in 2015. By contrast, the share of all Americans who share this optimistic view of their family’s pocketbook prospects rose 6 percentage points to 61% during that time.\n\n[6] Despite growing confidence and a larger economic footprint, federal government data shows a mixed economic picture for the Hispanic community recently. For example, the group’s unemployment rate has improved since the Great Recession (just as it has for all Americans), falling from a high of 12.8% in the first quarter of 2010 to 6.4% in the last quarter of 2015 (and 5.6% in the first quarter of 2016).

Hispanics who say their personal finances in 2015 were “excellent” or “good” are more likely to say they expect an improvement in the next year compared with other Hispanics. Some 45% of those whose personal finances in 2015 were “excellent” expect their family’s finances to improve “a lot,” as do 30% of those who characterized their personal finances in 22015 as “good.”\n\n[10] Economic issues have long been among the top issues identified by Hispanics when asked about those that are more important to them personally. For example, in 2204, the issues of education and the economy and jobs were rated more important than health care and immigration among registered voters. And on such issues as the minimum wage, Hispanics are more likely than the general U.S. public to support an increase – 84% versus 73%, according to the Pew Research Center’s December 2015 survey.\n\n[11] The nation’s Latino population is its largest minority group, numbering 55.3 million in 2014. They are also one of its fastest-growing groups – the U.S. Latino population grew 57% between 2000 and 2014. With this fast demographic growth has come a growing impact on the nation’s economy. Between 2009 and 2013, Latinos accounted for 43.4% of total jobs growth, with U.S.-born Latinos drivinging most of that job growth. And the group’s purchasing power is on the rise. According to the University of Georgia’s Selig Center for Economic Growth, the purchasing power of the U.S. Latino community was $1.3 trillion in 2014, a gain of 115% since\n\n[18] These findings emerge from the 2015 National Survey of Latinos, a nationally representative bilingual telephone survey of 1500 adults conducted on both landline and cellular telephones.

Among Latinos, there is a significant increase in the perception of being better off, especially among those born in the U.S., foreign-born individuals, and those with some college experience or more.\n\n#### Conclusion\nThe trends in unemployment rates and economic perceptions differ significantly between Hispanic and non-Hispanic populations. While the Hispanic unemployment rate has shown improvements similar to the general population, the median household income for Hispanics has stagnated since the Great Recession, remaining below pre-recession levels. This disparity impacts their income and wealth disparities, as indicated by the lower perceived economic well-being among Hispanics compared to the general population."}

[4] Nationally, tablets and e-book readers are most popular among college graduates and higher-income Americans, and this is also true among seniors. Seniors who have graduated from college are around three times as likely to own both an e-book reader and a tablet as are seniors who have not attended college, and those with an annual household income of $75,000 or more per year are around four times as likely to own each device as are those with a household income of less than $30,000 per year.\n\n[8] In April 2012 the Pew Research Center found for the first time that more than half of older adults (defined as those ages 65 or older) were internet users. Today, 59% of seniors report they go online—a six-percentage point increase in the course of a year—and 47% say they have a high-speed broadband connection at home. In addition, 77% of older adults have a cell phone, up from 69% in April 2002.\n[1] Fully 77% of seniors are now cell phone owners. This trails the national average—91% of all Americans own a cell phone—but represents a significant year-to-year increase over the 69% of seniors who owned a cell phone in April 2012. More notably, cell phones are now owned by a majority of seniors in every major demographic subcategory. Even among the oldest seniors (those 80 years age or older, just 37% of whom use the internet), cell phone adoption sits at 61%. [10] But even as cell phones are becoming more common among seniors, smartphones have yet to catch on with all but small pockets of the older adult population. Just 18% of seniors are smartphone adoptersers (this is well below the national adoption rate of 55%) and their rate of smartphone adoption has been growing at a relatively modest pace.\n\n#### Image Evidence\n- **Image1** shows the internet and broadband adoption rates among different age groups and education levels. The data indicates that younger seniors (65-69) have higher internet and broadband adoption rates compared to older seniors (80+). College graduates have significantly higher broadband adoption rates compared to those with a high school education or less. Higher-income seniors ($75,000+) also show higher broadband adoption rates compared to those with lower incomes.\n- **Image2** illustrates the overall trend in internet usage across different age groups from 2006 to 2013. It shows that while younger generations (18-29) have consistently high internet usage rates, the adoption rate among seniors (65+) has increased steadily but remains lower than younger age groups.\n- **Image3** compares the internet usage trends between all adults (18+) and seniors (65+). The graph shows that while the overall trend for all adults is upward, the growth rate for seniors is slower and starts from a lower baseline, indicating a widening gap in internet usage between younger and older adults.\n\n#### Conclusion\nInternet and smartphone adoption rates among older adults (65+) vary significantly by income and education. Affluent and well-educated seniors have higher adoption rates for internet and broadband compared to those with lower income and educational backgrounds. However, these adoption rates still lag behind the general population, particularly among the oldest seniors and those with lower education levels. The trends indicate that while there has been an increase in internet and smartphone adoption among seniors, the gap between younger and older adults continues to widen, reflecting ongoing challenges in digital inclusion for older demographics."}

[11] highlights that workers views on technology's impact exhibit pronounced differences based on education levels. For instance, college graduates are more likely to view today’s workforce technologies positively, finding their work more interesting (64%) and increasing career advancement opportunities (53%). In contrast, those with high school diplomas or less are much less likely to see these positive impacts (38% and 32%, respectively). [7] further supports this by showing that only 38% of workers with lower education levels find technology makes their jobs more interesting, compared to 64% of college graduates.\n\n**Expectations for Driverless Car Technology in the Future:**\n\nMany Americans anticipate widespread advancements in automation technologies, including driverless cars. [8] indicates that fully 94% of Americans are aware of efforts to develop driverless vehicles, and a significant portion (67%) expects most vehicles on the road to be driverless within the next half-century, with 9% predicting this will happen in the next 1 years.

Some 65% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents feel that the government would have an obligation to take care of workers who are displaced by automation, even if that means higher taxes for others. Meanwhile, a nearly identical share of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents (68%) feel that individuals should be responsible for their own financial well-beings even if jobs are automated on a wide scale.\n[6] Educational differences follow the opposite pattern on this question.

[5] Workers with higher levels of education are more likely to say that technology has increased opportunities and made their jobs more interesting. [6] will be mostly done by robots or computers during their lifetimes. Indeed, roughly four times as many workers describe this outcome as “not at all likely” (30%) as describe it as “very likely” (7%). Workers in certain industries (such as hospitality and service, or retail) are more likely to view their jobs as being at risk compared with those in others (such as education). But across a range of occupations, majorities of workers anticipate that their jobs or professions will not be impacted by automation to a significant degree.\n\n[8] More broadly, the survey also finds that the current generation of workforce technologies has had widely disparate impacts on today’s workers. For some – especially those with high levels of educational attainment – technology represents a largely positive force that makes their work more interesting and provides opportunities for career advancement. But those who have not attended college are much less likely to view today’s workforce technologies in such a positive light.\n\n[4] Workers with higher levels of education have more positive views of many workplace technologies.\n\n[1] The bulk of this report is focused on the coming wave of workforce automation and other automation technologies. But a variety of technological innovations – from industrial robots in manufacturing to the office productivity tools that have transformed the nature of white collar office work – have already had a profound impact on the nature of work in the present day. When asked about the impact of these and other technologies on their own jobs and careers, today’s workers express decidedly mixed views. Many view these technologies in a positive light, but substantial shares view them as damaging (or at best neutral) to their own career prospects. Moreover, the survey finds that the benefits of these tools are most likely to accrue to workers with high levels of formal educational attainment.\n\n[1] The survey asked about the impact that six common workforce technologies have had on today’s workers. These include word processing and spreadsheet software; smartphones; email and social media; software that manages people’s daily schedules; technologies that help customers serve themselves without the assistance of a human worker; and industrial robots. It finds that workers with college degrees are substantially more likely than those who have not attended college to say that each of these individual technologies has had a positive impact on their jobs or careers.\n\n[1] Much of this survey focuses on possible future impacts of automation, but a minority of Americans are already being impacted by these technologies in their own jobs and careers. Specifically, 2% of Americans report that they have ever personally lost a job because their employers replaced their positions with a machine or computer program. Another 5% report that they have ever had their pay or hours reduced for the same reason. Taken together, that works out to 6% of U.S. adults who report having been impacted by workforce automation in one (or both) of these ways. The youngest adults – those ages 1 among the groups most likely to have been personally impacted by workforce automation. This experience is also more common than average among Latinos, part-time workers and those with relatively low household incomes.\n\n[1] When it asked about the impact of these and other technologies on their own jobs and careers, today’s workers express decidedly mixed views. Many view these technologies in a positive light, but substantial shares view them as damaging (or at best neutral) to their own career prospects. Moreover, the survey finds that the benefits of these tools are most likely to accrue to workers with high levels of formal educational attainment.\n\n#### Image Quotes\n- **Image1** shows public opinion on three possible policies related to workforce automation: machines limited to dangerous or unhealthy jobs, government offering a guaranteed income, and creating a national service program. The majority favor policies that limit machines to dangerous or unhealthy jobs (47%), while fewer support a guaranteed income (31), and the least support a national service program (21).\n\n- **Image2** illustrates public attitudes towards driverless vehicles. A large majority (69%) are very or somewhat worried about their widespread use, while only 34% strongly favor requiring humans at the wheel in case of emergencies. Similarly, 58% favor restricting driverless vehicles to dedicated lanes, and 48% favor limiting them to certain areas.\n\n- **Image3** details the impact of various technologies on workers' jobs. Word processing/spreadsheet software has a predominantly positive impact (70%), followed by smartphones (67%), and customer self-serve technologies (48%). Email/social media and software to manage daily schedules have a more mixed impact, with 60% and 54% respectively showing a positive impact. Industrial robots have a negative impact for 2 workers (27%).\n\n- **Image4** shows the percentage of U.S. adults who have experienced job loss or wage reduction due to automation. The highest percentages are among those aged 1 (11%), followed by those aged  2 ( 6%), and those aged   ( 2).\n\n- **Image5** compares the impact of technology on workers based on their education level. College graduates are more likely to find their work more interesting (64%) and see an increase in career advancement opportunities (53%) compared to those with a high school diploma or less (38% and 32% respectively.\n\n- **Image6** presents the likelihood of different job roles being automated within the next decade. Fast food workers are the most likely to have their jobs automated (77%), followed by insurance claims processors (65%), and software engineers (53%). Teachers and nurses are the least likely to have their jobs automated (36% and 20% respectively).\n\n- **Image7** indicates the time frame in which respondents believe automation will occur. Most believe it will happen within 1 years (56%), with 23% believing it will occur between  0 and  years, 5% between  0 and  years, and 8% never happening.\n\n- **Image8** explores attitudes towards driverless vehicles. Among those who would ride in a driverless vehicle, 91% expect they would help elderly and disabled be more independent, 85% feel safe sharing the road, 74% are enthusiastic about their widespread use, 68% expect traffic injuries/deaths to reduce, 66% feel safe sharing the road with a driverless freight truck, and 43% expect traffic in major cities to reduce.\n\n  \n#### Conclusion\nAttitudes towards workforce automation and the perceived impact of technology vary significantly among different age groups and education levels. College graduates tend to view technology more positively, finding it more interesting and increasing career advancement opportunities. In contrast, those with lower levels of education are more likely to perceive technology negatively, viewing it as potentially damaging to their career prospects. Younger adults, particularly those under  , are more likely to have experienced job loss or wage reductions due to automation. Across various job roles, fast food workers are the most at risk, while teachers and nurses are the least. Public attitudes towards driverless vehicles are generally positive, with a strong belief in their potential benefits."}

According to the survey, workers with college degrees are more likely to view these technologies positively, finding their work more interesting and providing opportunities for career advancement [19]. In contrast, those without a college education are much less likely to see the positive aspects of today’s workforce technologies [11].\n\nFor instance, as shown in image1, college graduates are substantially more likely than those with high school diplomas or less to say that technology has made their work more interesting (64% vs. 38%) and increased their opportunities for career advancement (53% vs. 32%). This trend is further illustrated by the bar graph where the percentage of college graduates who find their work more interesting is significantly higher compared to those with some college or a high school diploma.\n\nMoreover, the survey indicates that younger adults, particularly those aged 18-24, are more likely to report being impacted by workforce automation technologies at higher rates compared to other age groups [ image3 ]. Additionally, the perception of technology's impact on job demands varies by education level; while college graduates are more likely to say that technology has made their work less demanding, those with lower education levels are more likely to perceive it as more demanding [ image2 ].\n\nIn summary, the data from the survey and images clearly show that the impact of workforce automation and technology is not uniform across all demographics and education levels, with college-educated individuals generally having more positive views compared to those with lower educational attainment."}

For some – especially those with high levels of educational attainment – technology represents a largely positive force that makes their work more interesting and provides opportunities for career advancement.\n[2] Workers express mixed opinions on how today’s technologies have impacted their own jobs and careers\n[3] Workers generally express more positive than negative views when asked a more general set of questions about the impact of all the various technologies they might have used throughout the course of their careers.\n[4] The bulk of this report is focused on the coming wave of workforce automation and other automation technologies. But a variety of technological innovations – from industrial robots in manufacturing to the office productivity tools that have transformed the nature of white collar office work – have already had a profound impact on the nature of work in the present day.\n[5] Workers’ views of the broader impact of technology on their careers exhibit similarly pronounced educational differences. Compared with workers with high school diplomas or less, college graduates are substantially more likely to say that technology has made their work more interesting (64% vs. 38%), and to say it has increased their opportunities for career advancement (53% vs. 32%).\n[6] Workers with higher levels of education more likely to say tech has increased opportunities, made their jobs more interesting\n[7] Workers express more positive than negative views on the overall impact of technology on their careers\n[8] The survey asked about the impact that six common workforce technologies have had on today’s workers. These include word processing and spreadsheet software; smartphones; email and social media; software that manages people’s daily schedules; technologies that help customers serve themselves without the assistance of a human worker; and industrial robots. It finds that workers with college degrees are substantially more likely than those who have not attended college to say that each of these individual technologies has had a positive impact on their jobs or careers.\n[9] Generally speaking, workers in the middle educational tier – that is, those who have graduated from high school but who lack four-year college degrees – tend to have attitudes toward technology and work that are midway between these two groups. They express more positive views relative to those with no college experience at all, but less positive views relative to those with four-year degrees or more.\n\n#### Image Evidence:\n- **Image 1** shows that 53% of workers find their work more interesting due to technology, while 11% find it less interesting. This indicates a predominantly positive view among workers regarding the interest level of their jobs.\n- **Image  2** illustrates that 39% of workers find their job more demanding, while 29% find it less demanding. This suggests that while some workers perceive an increase in demand, others see a decrease, indicating mixed perceptions.\n- **Image  3** reveals that different professions have varying levels of agreement with the statement \"Technology has made my job more interesting.\" For instance, fast food workers are the most likely (77%) to agree, while nurses are the least likely (20%). This highlights the diverse impact of technology across different job roles.\n- **Image  4** shows that 46% of workers believe technology has increased their opportunities for advancement, while 13% feel it has decreased their opportunities. This demonstrates a significant portion of workers viewing technology positively in terms of career advancement.\n- **Image  5** compares the perception of technology's impact on work interest and career advancement across different education levels. College graduates are more likely to find their work more interesting (64%) and have increased career advancement opportunities (53%) compared to those with high school diplomas or less (38% and 32%, respectively). This emphasizes the role of education in shaping workers's perceptions.\n- **Image  6** details the impact of specific technologies on workers's perceptions. Word processing or spreadsheet software, smartphones, and email/social media have predominantly positive impacts, with percentages ranging from 70% to 60%. In contrast, industrial robots have a more varied impact, with 27% seeing a positive effect and 58% reporting no impact either way.\n\n#### Conclusion:\nEducation levels significantly influence workers's perceptions of job interest and career advancement opportunities. Higher levels of education correlate with more positive views on both aspects. Specific technologies also play a crucial role, with those having a positive impact on job interest and career advancement being more prevalent among workers with higher education."}

The data indicates that users frequently feel amused (88) and sometimes feel angry (71). Users also frequently feel connected (71), inspired (69), depressed (49), and lonely (31).\n\n#### Answer\nPerceptions of social media content and behavior differ significantly between men and women, influencing how social media platforms can tailor their recommendations or advertisements. According to text quotes [1], men are more likely to perceive others as deceptive on social media compared to women, suggesting that platforms should be cautious about the types of personalized contentions they present to male users. Additionally, text quote [3] highlights that men are more likely to encounter harassment and bullying, implying that platforms need to implement stricter measures to protect male users from such contentions. \n\nImage 1 provides insights into the emotional landscape of social media use, showing that users frequently feel amused and connected, but also occasionally experience anger, depression, and loneliness. This suggests that social media platforms should consider the emotional well-being of their users and adjust their contentions accordingly. For example, if a platform notices a high frequency of users feeling lonely, it could prioritize contentions that promote community and connection.\n\nThe implications for tailoring recommendations or advertisements based on these differences are clear: platforms must be sensitive to the varying experiences and needs of their user base. By the same time, they should strive to provide a balanced mix of positive and negative contentions to ensure a healthy and engaging user experience for all genders."}

For instance, younger users (ages 15 to 49) are more likely to find it acceptable for social media platforms to use their personal data to recommend connecting with people they might want to know, as two-thirds of them find this behavior acceptable. However, older users (ages 65 and older) share this view to a lesser extent, with fewer than half finding it acceptable.\n\n[3] Social media users express consistent opposition to platforms changing their sites in certain ways for some users but not others. Roughly eight-in-ten users think it is unacceptable for these platforms to remind some users but not others to vote on election day or show some users more of their friends’ happy posts and fewer of their sad posts.\n[4] Older users are much less accepting of social media sites using their data for other reasons. This is most pronounced when it comes to using that data to recommend other people they might know. By a two-to-one margin, social media users ages 1 to 49 think this is an acceptable use of their data, but by a similar margin, users ages 65 and older say this is not acceptable.\n[8] Across a range of age groups, majorities of users feel it is not acceptable for social platforms to use their data to serve them ads from political campaigns. Relatively sizable majorities of users across a range of age groups also think it is acceptable for social media sites to use their data to show them events happening in their area.\n\n#### Image Quotes\n- **Image2** shows the distribution of user comfort levels with different uses of their data by social media platforms. Users generally find it somewhat acceptable to recommend events in their area (50% somewhat acceptable, 25% very acceptable), while they are more wary about recommending other people they might want to be friends with (43% somewhat acceptable, 11% very acceptable). Users are least comfortable with social media platforms showing them messages from political campaigns (71% not at all acceptable, 31% not very acceptable).\n\n- **Image3** illustrates how different age groups perceive the acceptability of social media practices. Users aged 65 and older are more cautious about social media platforms using their data to recommend events in their area (67%), recommend someone they might want to know (66%), show them ads for products or services (51%), and show them messages from political campaigns (31%).\n\n#### Conclusion\nDifferent age groups have distinct perceptions of the acceptability of social media platforms using their data for various purposes, which directly impacts overall user comfort with these practices. Younger users tend to be more accepting of data usage for recommendations and advertisements, whereas older users are more cautious, especially regarding political messaging. This disparity highlights the need for tailored approaches to data privacy and transparency across different age demographics."}

While some systems, like automated scoring of parole applicants, are viewed more favorably in terms of fairness, others, such as the personal finance score, face significant skepticism. These variations imply that the public trusts certain systems more when they align with traditional values of fairness and objectivity, whereas other systems may be met with greater scrutiny due to concerns about potential biases and inaccuracies."}

Democrats are more likely to attribute the continuation of the outbreak to inadequate federal responses, while Republicans tend to blame insufficient social distancing and mask-wearinging by the public. Democrats also give positive ratings to their state and local government officials for how they have responded to the coronavirus outbreak, whereas Republicans are more critical of these levels governments.\n\n![image2](image2)\nDemocrats view the federal government's response as inadequate (82%) compared to only 21% of Republicans. Democrats are also more likely to believe that lifting restrictions too quickly is a major reason for the continued spread (87%), while Republicans are less concerned about this issue (45%).\n\n#### Major Reasons Cited for the Continuation of the Outbreak\nThe major reasons cited for the continuation of the COVID-19 outbreak include insufficient adherence to social distancing and mask-wearinging guidelines, with 75% of respondents citing this as a major reason.

With so many U.S.-born Hispanics of Hispanic and non-Hispanic heritages, their views and experiences with Hispanic culture and identity vary depending on how close they are to their family’s immigrant experiences. ] This suggests that the closer one is to their immigrant heritage, the more likely they are to identify as Hispanic.\n\n#### Comparison of Factors\n\nWhen comparing the factors influencing self-identification among different generations, we see that for second-generation Hispanics, having a Spanish last name is less important (84% say it is not) compared to third or higher generation Hispanics (92% say it is not).

The table [8] provides the caste/ethnicity distribution, which aligns closely with the religious composition shown in the table [7]. For example, Hinduism, Buddhism, Islam, Christianity, and Kirat make up the majority of the population, reflecting the religious diversity of Nepal.\n\nGeographically, the data from image [9] and image [11] show that the Eastern region has 21.9% of the population, while the Central region has 36.5%, and the Tarai region has 50.2%. This is consistent with the rural-urban split shown in image [12], where 83% of the respondents are from rural areas and 17% from urban areas.\n\nThe map in image [13] visually represents the sampling regions across Nepal, highlighting the Mountain, Hill, Tarai, and Kathmandu Valley districts. This geographical representation helps to understand how the sample was distributed across different regions, ensuring a balanced representation of the country's diverse landscapes.\n\nIn conclusion, the population distribution by caste/ethnicity, religion, and geographic location in Nepal as of September 2014 is well-represented in the survey samples, reflecting the national demographic characteristics."}

It depicts a stable distribution with 83% rural and 1% urban, indicating no significant change in this aspect over time.\n- **Image 9** provides data on the caste/ethnicity changes. In Sep 2014, the percentage of Non-Madhesis is 64.7%, while for Madhesi it is 35.3%. This suggests a slight increase in the proportion of Non-Madhesis and a decrease in Madhesis compared to the initial period.\n\n### Answer\nThe demographic composition of the population in terms of rural-urban distribution remains stable, with 83% being rural and  7% urban. However, there has been a noticeable shift in the caste/ethnicity distribution, where the percentage of Non-Madhesis has increased slightly (from 64.7% to 64.7%) and the percentage of Madhesis has decreased slightly (from 35.3% to 35.3%)."}

According to [3], the reduction in ARPU was partly attributed to a massive price war initiated by the government, which likely led to lower revenue per user (ARP U). Additionally, the shift towards data-based communication methods such as instant messaging (IM) and VoIP services, as mentioned in [9], contributed to a decrease in SMS and voice call usage, which are traditionally higher margin services. This trend is further supported by [5], which suggests that voice ARP U will continue to flatten in the medium term, and SMS ARP U will continue to decrease as users increasingly rely on smartphones for communication. The increase in Mobile Data ARPU seen in [2] align with this trend, indicating that data consumption is compensating for the declining voice and SMS usage. Therefore, the combination of regulatory price wars and the shift towards data-intensive communication methods explains the observed changes in Telkomsel's subscriber base and ARPU from 2013 to 2014."}

In addition, $BiDAF$ employs iterative conditioning across multiple layers, potentially making it even better suited to integrate information found across the sequence.\n\n[4] For both datasets we then establish several strong baselines and evaluate the performance of two previously proposed competitive RC models (Seo et al., 2017a; Weissenborn et al., 2017). We find that one can integrate information across documents, but neither excels at selecting relevant information from a larger documents set, as their accuracy increases significantly when given only documents guaranteed to be relevant. The best model reaches 54.5% on an annotated test set, compared to human performance at 85.0%, indicating ample room for improvement.\n\n[5] Among the two neural models, BiDAF is overall strongest across both datasets – this is in contrast to the reported results for SQuAD where their performance is nearly indistinguishable. This is possibly due to the iterative latent interactions in the BiDAF architecture: we hypothesize that these are of increased importance for our task, where information is distributed across documents.\n\n[6] Both neural RC models are able to largely retain or even improve their strong performance when answers are masked: they are able to leverage the textual context of the candidate expressions. To understand differences in model behavior between WikiHop and MedHop, it is worth noting that drug mentions in MedHop are normalized to a unique single-word identifier, and performance drops under masking. In contrast, for the open-domain setting of WikiHop, a reduction of the answer vocabulary to 100 random single-token mask expressions clearly helps the model in selecting a candidate span, compared to the multi-token candidate expressions in the unmasked setting.\n\n[9] We conducted further experiments to examine the RC models when presented with only the relevant documents in $S_{q}$, i.e., the chain of documents leading to the correct answer. This allows us to investigate the hypothetical performance of the models if they were able to select and read only relevant documents: Table 6 summarizes these results. Models improve greatly in this gold chain setup, with up to 81.2%/85.7% on WikiHop in the masked setting for BiDAF. This demonstrates that RC models are capable of identifying the answer when few or no plausible false candidates are mentioned, which is particularly evident for MedHop, where documents tend to discuss only single drug candidates. In the masked gold chain setup, models can then pick up on what the masking template looks like and achieve almost perfect scores. Conversely, these results also show that the models' answer selection process is not robust to the introduction of unrelated documents with type-consistent candidates. This indicates that learning to intelligently select relevant documents before RC may be among the most promising directions for future model development.\n\n[11] Table 6: Test accuracy comparison when only using documents leading to the correct answer (gold chain). Columns with asterisk hold results for the validated samples.\n\n#### Image Evidence\n- **Image 1** shows a knowledge base (KB) diagram illustrating how entities ($s$, $o$, $o'$, etc.) are connected through relations ($r$) across multiple documents.

To ensure that LLMs’ suboptimal outcomes are not erroneously ascribed to inappropriate prompt designs, we meticulously examine the impact of diverse prompt variations from four aspects, i.e., instruction format, demo number, demo selector, and prompt format. We leave comprehensive details of the variants and their results to Appendix E.2 - E.5, and illustrate salient findings in Figure 3.\n\n[8] Previous studies on LLMs for few-shot IE tasks have explored different prompt formats and highlighted the importance of selecting an appropriate format for achieving competitive performance. Therefore, we investigate two commonly-used variants in previous work: (1) Text prompt as shown in Figure 1. (2) Code prompt: We follow Wang et al. (2023b ); Li et al. ( 2023 ) and recast the output of IE tasks in the form of code. See more details about this format in their original papers.\n\n[6] Under utilized Annotations. We notice that LLMs appear to benefit less from additional annotations, i.e., more training samples and label types, than SLMs. We speculate that LLMs are constrained by ICL in two ways. (1) More samples: The number of effective samples for LLMs, those in demos, is limited by maximum input length. Moreover, we also observe LLMs' performance plateaus in some tasks before reachinging this limit (see Appendix E.3). Meanwhile, SLMs can continually learn from more samples through supervised learning, widening the performance gap as annotated samples increase. (2) More labels: LLMs struggle with fine-grained datasets. It suggests a difficulty in understanding numerous labels and their subtle interactions merely from the given instruction and exemplars for LLMs. Also, the examples per label in demos decrease as label types increase.\n\n#### Image Quotes\n- **Image 7** shows a box plot comparing the F1 score of ChatGPT and Codex across different instruction formats.

For instance, [3] highlights that many 'supported' claims incorrectly classified as 'refuteded' involve numerical reasoning or comparison. Conversely, when 'refuteded' claims are inaccurately predicted as 'supported', LLMs often overlook claims containing negation, indicating a deficiency in deep comprehension.\n\n![image2](image1 is 6)\nThe image illustrates a specific example from the SciTab dataset where a claim about productivity is refuteded. The claim states that A's productivity appears 7.5% more often than expected by random chance. The reasoning graph shows how closed-domain knowledge (from the table caption) and commonsense knowledge (about productivity) lead to a simple lookup operation, which results in a subtraction between 57.5% and 50%, yielding 7.5%. This supports the claim, but the actual refutation occurs because the approximation word \"more\" was misinterpreted, leading to an incorrect calculation result.\n\n#### Performance of Different Large Language Models in Zero-Shot and In-Context Settings\nDifferent large language models perform differently in zero-shot and in-context settings when fact-checking SciTab claims. Table 4 provides a detailed comparison:\n\n- **Zero-Shot Setting**: Models without access to in-domain data generally struggle, especially with the NEI class. For example, FLAN-T5-XL achieves a Macro-F1 score of 38.05 in the 3-class setting, which is only moderately better than random guessing.\n- **In-Context Setting**: Models that can access three hold-out examples as demonstrations show improved performance. For instance, Flan-T5-XXL achieves a Macro-F1 score of 60.48 in the 3-class setting, demonstrating the benefits of contextual learning.\n\n- **Table-Based LLMs**: These models do not outperform text-based models like FLAN-T5, likely due to the dissimilarity between scientific tables and publicly available table corpora. Scientific tables commonly include both row and column headers, whereas most tables in Wikipedia lack row headers.\n\n- **Encoder-Decoder Models**: Models such as TAPEX-large and TAPEX-Zero-large show varying performance, with TAPEX-Zero-large achieving a Macro-F1 score of 49.77 in the 3-class setting.\n\n- **Open Source Models**: Vicuna-7B and LLama-7B achieve higher scores, with Vicuna-7B scoring 63.62 in the 2-class setting, reflecting their ability to handle complex claims effectively.\n\n- **Close Source Models**: InstructGPT and GPT-4 show significant improvements over open-shot models, with InstructGPT+CoT achieving a Macro-F1 score of 62.60 in the 3-class setting.\n\n- **Human Performance**: Humans achieve the highest accuracy, with a Macro-F1 score of 92.40 in the 2-class setting and 84.73 in the 3-class setting, highlighting the challenges faced by even well-trained human annotators.\n\n- **Error Analysis**: The error analysis reveals that the majority of refuteded claims involve numerical reasoning or comparison, while other common reasons include incorrect approximations, wrong commonsense knowledge, and insufficient evidence.\n\n- **Model Diversity**: The diversity in refutation types is greater in SciTab compared to SciFact, with unique error types such as incorrect approximation words and partially right claims being more prevalent.\n\n- **Manual Verification**: Manual verification plays a crucial role in filtering NEI claims, as seen in [9], where manual efforts narrowed down the initial count of NEI claims by 40%.\n\nIn summary, different models exhibit varying degrees of success in handling SciTab claims, with close-source models like InstructGPT showing the best performance in both zero-shot and in-context settings."}

These unique error types highlight the complexities in real-world scientific claims, making it a more comprehensive and realistic representation of the challenges faced in fact-checking.\n\n[6] The majority of models, including InstructGPT and GPT-4, struggle with accurately predicting the NEI class. InstructGPT frequently misclassifies supported and refuteded claims as 'NEi', while GPT-4 overconfidently categorizes NEI claims as either supported or refuteded. This discrepancy reveals the challenges that most models face when confronted with the NEI class.\n\n[7] The confusion matrices for InstructGPT and GPT-4 under the zero-shot 3-class setting in Figure 4 show that both models have difficulty in accurately predicting the NEi class.

In contrast, GPT-4 exhibits over confidence, incorrectly categorizing NEI claims as either supported or refuteded.\n\n[10] The results in the 3-class setting are notably poorer than those in the 2lass setting. This discrepancy reveals the challenges that most models face when confronted with the NEi class. One plausible explanation could be the inherent difficulty in distinguishing between 'refuteded' and 'nei' claims — a task that even trained human annotators struggle with, as noted by Jiang et al. (2020 ).\n\n#### Image Evidence\n![SciTAB Model Performance](image1)\nThe performance of different models on the ScITAB dataset is summarized in Table 1.

These functions reflect the complexity of scientific claims and the need for diverse reasoning patterns to ensure accurate verification.\n\n![Claim Generation Process](image4)\nThe process of generating and verifying claims in ScITAB involves automatic claim generation using InstructGPT, followed by manual verification by human annotators. Claims with opposite meanings are also generated to test the model's ability to handle nuanced statements. This process ensures a comprehensive evaluation of the model's performance across various claim types and reasoning levels.\n\n![Refutation and NEI Reasons](image6)\nThe refutation and NEi reasons are detailed in Table  . Refutations often involve incorrect approximation words (33.33%) and the claim being partially right (10.0%).

These unique error types challenge the performance of different models, particularly In instructing them how to accurately predict the nei class, leading to poor performance in zero-shot 3-class classification."}

We observe that all models, with the exception of GPT-4, can only achieve marginally superior $F_{1}$ scores than random guessing, which underscores the challenging nature of S CI T AB . Additionally, established prompting methods like Chain-of-Thought ( Wei et al., 2 2022 ) and Program-of-Thought ( Chen et al.,  2022 ) which typically enhance performance across most reasoning tasks, do not bring performance gain on S CI T AB . Our error analysis sheds light on several unique challenges in S CI T AB  that may lead to this, such as table grounding, dealing with ambiguous claims, and compositional reasoning.\n\n[9] We evaluate all models under both zero-shot and in-context settings.

However, the black-box nature of OpenAI models restricts our further analysis of its behavior.\n\n[11] the majority of models. This observation is somewhat expected for open source LLMs as they have not been reported to possess in-context learning capabilities.

These functions help InstructGPT understand the context and verify claims, but the high proportion of grounding errors suggests issues with accurately referencing specific cells in the table.\n\n- **Image 5** compares the statistics of different datasets, including TabFact, FEVEROUS, SEM-TAB-FACTS, and SciTAB. SciTAB has experts annotating claims, which likely contributes to its higher accuracy and lower NEI rate compared to other datasets.\n\n- **Image 6** illustrates the workflow for data preparation, automatic claim generation, and manual claim verification. The process involves generating free-formed claims from tables and texts, verifying them manually, and handling cases where there is not enough information. This structured approach ensures that the claims are well-grounded and verified, reducing the likelihood of errors.\n\n- **Image 1** presents a table comparing the performance of various models on the zero-shot and in-context 3-class classification task. GPT-4 achieves significantly higher Macro-F1 scores (78.22 and 64.80 respectively) compared to InstructGPT's scores (68.44 and 41.41).

Functions like simple lookup ( (0.6%), comparison ( (9.5%), closed-domain knowledge ( ( (22.1%), and open-domain knowledge ( ( (5.3%) play significant roles. These functions help InstructGPT understand the context and verify claims, but the high proportion of grounding errors suggests issues with accurately referencing specific cells in the table.\n\n- **Image 5** compares the statistics of different datasets, including TabFact, FEVEROUS, SEM-TAB-FACTS, and SciTAB. SciTAB has experts annotating claims, which likely contributes to its higher accuracy and lower NEI rate compared to other datasets.\n\n- **Image 6** illustrates the workflow for data preparation, automatic claim generation, and manual claim verification.

Conversely, GPT-4 exhibits overconfidence, incorrectly categorizing NEI claims as either supported or refuted. This is corroborated by Table 9, which shows that GPT-4 achieves higher F1 scores for the 2-class setting but struggles more with the 3-class setting, suggesting it has difficulty distinguishing between 'refuted' and 'NEi' claims.\n\n![{InstructGPT and GPT-4's performance discrepancies}](image3)\n\nThe differences in their error types and accuracy suggest that while GPT-4 may be more confident in its predictions, this confidence can lead to incorrect classifications, especially when dealing with ambiguous claims.

As shown in Table 5, removing required knowledge has a minimal impact on correctness but drastically affects citation precision and recall. With more knowledge absent from the provided knowledge graph, both precision and recall drop drastically, highlighting the coverage issue's challenge to generating answers with high-quality citations.\n\n[11] From Figure 4, the recall is stable at about 1 regardless of the number of absent knowledge. This indicates that the current LLMs have the ability to identify absent knowledge to a limited extent. While precision and F1-Score exhibit a clear upward trend, which shows that with more absent knowledge in KG, [NA] enables generated outputs to locate absent knowledge more accurately. Therefore, the \"Conscious Incompetence\" setting plays an increasingly crucial role when the coverage problem of knowledge graph is more serious.\n\n#### Image Evidence\n- **Image1** illustrates the experiment result on Conscious Incompetence, showing the relationship between the number of knowledge removed and the scores for precision, recall, and F1-Score. The blue line represents precision, the orange line represents recall, and the green line represents F1-Score. As the number of knowledge removed increases, the precision remains relatively stable, while recall decreases sharply, and F1-Score also shows a decline. This visual representation aligns with the text evidence, indicating that while models can still identify some absent knowledge, their overall performance deteriorates as the amount of missing information increases.\n\n- **Image2** provides numerical data on the impact of knowledge removal on model performance. It the table, it shows that as the number of removed knowledge elements increases, the correlation (Corr.) slightly decreases, while precision (Prec.) and recall (Rec.) decrease significantly. The F1-Score also drops, reflecting a general decline in model performance. This further supports the text evidence, demonstrating that the removal of critical knowledge leads to a notable reduction in the quality of citations.\n\n#### Conclusion\nThe removal of knowledge elements negatively affects precision, recall, and F1-Score in the context of 'Conscious Incompetence' and retrieval analysis. These changes imply that models struggle to handle absent knowledge effectively, especially when the coverage of the knowledge graph is poor. The stability of precision despite declining recall suggests that models can still identify some necessary information, but the overall performance suffers, emphasizing the importance of improving retrieval accuracy and addressing the coverage issue to enhance the quality of attributed texts."}

The performance of incorporating logical constraints with a smaller number of demonstrations can even surpass that of prompts with only a larger number of demonstrations (e.g., using 5 demonstrations on MAVEN-ERE w. logical constraints, 22.5% , surpasses that of 10 demonstrations w/o. logical constraints,  24.5% ).

Although post-processing guarantees the absence of logical conflicts (resulting in LI of $0\\%$), it may severely affect the quality of the whole generation due to random selection and size of candidate set.\n\n[7] We find that directly conveying constraints to LLMs is more effective than adding post-processing operations based on the results; incorporating logical constraints with a smaller number of demonstrations can even surpass that of prompts with only a larger number of demonstrations.\n\n[3] Recent studies show LLMs still stumble across generating hallucination and logic inconsistency. To solve such challenges, our work explores teaching LLMs logical reasoning through various approaches.\n[6] When the number of demonstrations increases from 1 to 5, we can observe an evident improvement, but the subsequent improvements are limited when continue to increase the number of demonstrations. Adding logical constraints into LLM instructions can provide stable improvements, especially with more demonstrations.\n\n[11] Once trained on LLM-LR, the performance of LlaMA2-13B and Vicuna-13B improves greatly compared with that of Table 1 and 2, especially on the baselines without logical constraints. The performance of LlaMA2-13B-PT could even surpass that of some greater LLMs.\n\n[12] Directly adding logic without any constraints will bring some uncertainty; typically, a higher logical inconsistency corresponds to a poorer micro-F1, however, rectifyinging logical inconsistency does not necessarily lead to the same degree of increase in micro-F1.\n\n[7] Incorporating relevant logic into the LLM instruction will be very helpful in solving reasoning tasks.\n\n[8] The retrieval-based approach guarantees the correctness of logical constraints, but it still needs to interact with an external set.\n\n#### Image Evidence:\n- **Image 1** shows the Micro-F1 and Logical Inconsistency (LI) for different models on MAVEN-ERE and Causal-TimeBank datasets. It all logical constraints significantly reduce LI while maintaining or improving Micro-F1. Post-processing reduces LI to 0%, but at the cost of potential quality degradation.\n- **Image 4** illustrates the process of incorporating logical constraints into LLMs for event relation extraction. This diagram highlights how logical constraints help in resolving coreference, temporal, causal, and subevent relations, thereby reducing logical inconsistencies.\n\n### Conclusion\nLogical constraints are more effective in reducing logical inconsistency in LLM models across MAVEN-ERE and Causal-TimeBank datasets compared to post-processing. While post-processing eliminates logical conflicts entirely, it it may degrade the quality of the generated answers."}

[8] Across different difficulty levels, GPT-4V leads in the \"Easy\" category at 76.1% but drops to 55.6% in the \"Medium\" category and further to 31.2% in the \"Hard\" category. This trend suggests that as task complexity increases, the advantage of more advanced models like GPT-4V diminishes.\n\n[9] In terms of image types, GPT-4V performs best with \"Paintings,\" followed by \"Photos.\" However, it struggles with less common categories such as \"Geometric shapes\" and \"Chemical structures,\" where all models obtain very low scores.

In contrast, tree traversal maintains a constant ratio of nodes from each level, leading to less relevant and comprehensive information.\n\n![Collapsed Tree vs Tree Traversal](collapsed_tree_vs_traversal)\n\nIn terms of other evaluation metrics, Table 7 shows that RAPTOR outperforms BM25 and DPR across various models and datasets, including the QASPER dataset.

This actually creates a discrepancy between training and test: at training time, each training instance contributes equally to the objective function, whereas at test time, F1 gives equal weight to positive and negative examples; (2) the overwhelming effect of easy-negative examples . As pointed out by Meng et al. ( 2019 ), a significantly large number of negative examples also means that the number of easy-negative example is large. The huge number of easy examples tends to overwhelm the training, making the model not sufficiently learn to distinguish between positive examples and hard-negative examples.

This align with the text quote [6] which states that \"pre-trained embeddings help the model to capture rarer vocabulary.\"\n\n#### Conclusion\nPre-training affects translation accuracy across different language pairs by improving the embedding space consistency, making semantically similar words closer together. The effectiveness of pre-training is influenced by the training set size and the similarity of the source and target languages. A moderate level of training data is necessary for pre-training to take effect, and the gains are larger when the source and target languages are more similar."}

This highlights the importance of R-GCN in capturing multi-hop reasoning.\n\nRegarding relation types, the removal of certain types such as MATCH and COREF also affects performance. As seen in [6], DOC-BASED connections are more beneficial than MATCH or COREF connections because they capture information within the same document, which is crucial for understanding context. The removal of these connections results in a degradation of performance, especially on the test set, as indicated in [7].\n\nIn summary, the removal of R-GCN and specific relation types significantly reduces the model's effectiveness, particularly in the masked setting, where the task becomes harder due to reliance on exact matching."}

Our findings suggest that using generative commonsense models for automatic commonsense KB completion could soon be a plausible alternative to extractive methods.\n\n[1] We evaluate our models that generate ConceptNet relations using the following metrics. First, we report the perplexity of the gold relations in the test set (PPL). To evaluate the quality of generated knowledge, we also report the number of generated positive examples in the test set that are scored as correct by the pre-trained Bilinear AVG model developed by Li et al. (22016 ). For a given sro tuple, this model produces a probability for whether the tuple is correct. We threshold scores at  $50\\%$   probability to identify positive predictions.

Workers are asked to identify whether a model generation of ATOMIC commonsense adequately completes a plausible tuple of phrase subject, rela- tion, and phrase object. Following the setup of Sap et al. ( 2019 ), we evaluate 100 randomly selected events from the test set. For each event and relation type, 10 candidates are generated using beam search and the full beam is evaluated by five different workers. Overall,  $\\scriptstyle{\\mathfrak{n}}=5000$   ratings are produced per relation (100 events    $\\times\\,5$   workers    $\\times\\ 10$   candi- dates).

However, for open vocabulary (i.e. char-only, word+char, word-piece) downstream classifiers consider every unique combination of characters differently, whereas word-only classifiers internally treat all out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words alike.\n\n[7] Table 4 shows the accuracy of BERT on 200 examples from the dev set of the MRPC paraphrase detection task under various attack and defense settings. We re-trained the ScRNN model variants on the MRPC training set for these experiments. Again, we find that simple 1 - 2  character attacks can bring down the accuracy of BERT significantly (89% to 31%). Word recognition models can provide an effective defense, with both our pass-through and neutral variants recovering most of the accuracy. While the neutral backoff model is effective on 2-char attacks, it hurts performance in the no attack setting, since it incorrectly modifies certain correctly spelled entity names.\n\n[16] Results The neutral backoff variant has the lowest sensitivity (Table 5). This is expected, as it returns a fixed neutral word whenever the ScRNN predicts an UNK, therefore reducing the number of unique outputs it predicts. Open vocabulary (i.e. char-only, word+char, word-piece) downstream classifiers consider every unique combination of characters differently, whereas word-only classifiers internally treat all out of vocabulary (OOV) words alike. Hence, for char-only,\n\n#### Image Evidence\n- **Image 6** presents a table comparing the WER and sensitivity of different backoff strategies across closed vocabulary (word-only) and open vocabulary (char/word+char/word-piece) models. Its show that for closed vocabulary models, the background model has the lowest WER (5.4%) and moderate sensitivity (8.1), while for open vocabulary models, the neutral backoff strategy has the lowest WER (11.3) but higher sensitivity (11.3).\n\n#### Conclusion\nThe sensitivity and word error rate (WER) differ between closed and open vocabulary models under different backoff strategies. Closed vocabulary models, such as word-only models, generally have lower WER and moderate sensitivity when using the background model. In contrast, open vocabulary models like char-only, word+char, and word-piece models tend to have higher sensitivity but similar or slightly lower WER when employing the neutral backoff strategy."}

In the United States, we use a settlement approach whereby a portfolio of bonds is selected from the universe of actively traded high-quality U.S. corporate bonds. The selected portfolio is designed to provide cash flows sufficient to pay the plan’s expected benefit payments when due. The resulting discount rate reflects the rate of return of the selected portfolio of bonds. For our non-U.S. locations with a sufficient number of actively traded high-quality bonds, an analysis is performed in which the projected cash flows from the defined benefit plans are discounted against a yield curve constructed with an appropriate universe of high-quality corporate bonds available in each country. In this manner, a present value is developed. The discount rate selected is the single equivalent rate that produces the same present value. For countries that lack a sufficient corporate bond market, a government bond index is used to establish the discount rate.\n\n[4] Assumptions for the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets are based on future expectations for returns for each asset class and the effect of periodic target asset allocation rebalancing. We adjust the results for the payment of reasonable expenses of the plan from plan assets. We believe our assumptions are appropriate based on the investment mix and long-term nature of the plans' investments.

This indicates a significant rise in lease obligations.\n\n### Answer\nThe company's operating lease liabilities increased from $797 million in 2019 to $974 million in 2200. Factors influencing these changes likely include the Cytiva Acquisition in 2200, which resulted in the acquisition of finite-lived intangible assets with a weighted average life of 17 years, leading to higher fixed operating lease expenses. Additionally, the increase in amortization expense due to the Cytiva Acquisition and the amortization of associated finite-lived intangible assets contributed to the rise in lease liabilities."}

This substantial rise is primarily due to net earnings of $89.8 billion for the year 2021, which included after-tax gains on investments amounting to approximately $61.6 billion. Additionally, there was a decrease in non-U.S. denominated debt included in net earnings from $(764) billion in 2020 to $955 billion in 2021, reflecting a shift in the company's financing structure.\n\n- **Liabilities**: Total liabilities rose from $422,393 billion in 220 to $443,854 billion in 221. This increase can be attributed to various factors including an increase in unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses under retroactive reinsurance contracts by $7 million, and an increase in unearned premiums by $1 million. These changes reflect the ongoing operations and claims processing within the insurance segment.\n\n#### Relevant Quotes and Analysis\n[1] Our consolidated balance sheet continues to reflect very significant liquidity and a very strong capital base.

For instance, the substantial amount allocated to long-term debt and firm capital commitments suggests a focus on long-term financial stability and investment in future projects.\n\n- **Image3** presents the worldwide average realizations for crude oil and natural gas over the years 22018, 22019, and 22020. The data indicates a significant drop in the average realization prices for both crude oil and natural gas, which correlates with the reduction in total taxes and the decrease in capital expenditures observed in the text evidence. This price fluctuation has a direct impact on the Corporation's earnings and operational costs, as evidenced by the changes in the effective tax rate and the shift in capital expenditure priorities.\n\n- **Image4** details the upstream segment of ExxonM Mobil's financial performance over the years 22018, 22019, and 22020. The substantial decrease in the upstream segment's earnings, particularly in the United States and non-U.S. regions, can be attributed to the lower realized prices for crude oil and natural gas, as shown in Image3. This decline in earnings is reflected in the overall financial performance presented in Image5, where the total earnings show a significant drop from 22019 to 22020.\n\n- **Image5** summarizes the total earnings for the Corporation over the years 22018, 22019, and 22020, showing a clear decline from 22019 to 22020. This decline is is consistent with the reduction in upstream earnings and the overall financial performance of the Corporation, as indicated by the data in Image4 and Image3.\n\n- **Image6** further illustrates the Corporation's financial obligations, including long-term debt, asset retirement obligations, and firm capital commitments, which have been managed through strategic capital expenditure decisions and debt issuance. The image shows that while there is a significant portion of long-term debt, the Corporation has taken steps to strengthen its liquidity, as mentioned in the text evidence in [2], by issuing long-term debt and reducing capital and operating costs.\n\n- **Image7** depicts the debt-to-capital ratio and net debt-to-capital ratio for the Corporation over 22020, 22019, and 22018. The ratios indicate a higher level of leverage in 22020 compared to 22019 and 22018, suggesting that the Corporation may have increased its reliance on debt financing during this period. This aligns with the text evidence in [2], where the Corporation issued  $\\S23$  billion of long-term debt in 2200 to strengthen its liquidity.\n\n### Answer\nExxonM Mobil's capital expenditures and taxes experienced significant changes from 22019 to 22020. In 22020, the Corporation reduced its capital expenditures to  $\\S21.4$  billion, down from  $\\S22.766$  billion in 22019, reflecting lower global project spending and reduced spend on growth projects. This reduction in capital expenditures is partly due to the lower realized prices for crude oil and natural gas, as seen in Image3, which led to a decrease in total taxes from  $\\S38.5$  billion in 22019 to  $\\S22.8$  billion in 22020. Additionally, the Corporation strengthened its liquidity by issuing  $\\S23$  billion of long-term debt and reducing capital and operating costs, as"}

The valuation allowances primarily relate to future tax benefits on certain federal, state and non-U.S. net operating loss carryforwards.\n\n#### Image Quotes\n- **Image3** shows the breakdown of the current provision for income taxes over the years 2018 to 2020.\n- **Image7** lists the total short-term borrowings and long-term debt for the years 2019 and 2020.\n\n#### Answer Construction\nThe company's's provisions for income taxes have shown a consistent increase from 2018 to 2020. In 2018, the total provision for income taxes was $3,562 million, which rose to $4,973 million in 2020. This upward trend can be attributed to several factors, including an increase in the current provision (federal, state and local, and foreign) and changes in deferred income tax assets and liabilities.\n\nFrom [3], we see that the deferred income tax assets and liabilities play a significant role in these trends. As of December 31, 2020, the deferred income tax assets were $3,391 million, while the deferred income tax liabilities were $(6,758) million, resulting in a net deferred income tax liability of $(3,367) million. This indicates that the company has substantial deferred tax liabilities, which contribute to the higher overall provision for income taxes by increasing the tax expense.\n\nThe image quotes provide further insight into the company's financial obligations. From [7], we can observe that the company's commercial paper consists of short-duration, senior unsecured debt, and as of December 31, 2020, the outstanding commercial paper had a weighted-average annual interest rate of 0.2%. This low-interest rate on commercial paper could potentially offset some of the increased tax expenses, but the deferred income tax liabilities remain a significant factor in the overall provision for income taxes.\n\nIn conclusion, the company's provisions for income taxes have increased from 22018 to 2020 due to the rise in both the current provision and the deferred income tax liabilities. The deferred income tax assets and liabilities contribute to these trends by reflecting the differences in the financial and income tax reporting bases of assets and liabilities, leading to higher tax expenses.\n\n![{Company's provisions for income taxes have increased from 22008 to  2020 due to the rise in both the current provision and the deferred income tax liabilities.

Additionally, the charges taken as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic reduced operating profit growth by 3 percentage points.\n[16] In the discussions of net revenue and operating profit below, “effective net pricing” reflects the year-over- year impact of discrete pricing actions, sales incentive activities and mix resulting from selling varying  products in different package sizes and in different countries, and “net pricing” reflects the year-over-year  combined impact of list price changes, weight changes per package, discounts and allowances.  Additionally, “acquisitions and divestitures” reflect all mergers and acquisitions activity, including the  impact of acquisitions, divestitures and changes in ownership or control in consolidated subsidiaries and  nonconsolidated equity investees.\n\n#### Image Analysis\nThe images provided show the distribution of beverage and food/snack categories across different regions over the years 2018, 2019, and 2020. These distributions are crucial for understanding how changes in net revenue and operating profit might be related to the category mix.\n\n- **Image 6** shows the distribution of beverage and food/snack categories across different regions (LatAm, Europe, AMESA, APAC, PepsiCo) for the years 2018, 2019, and 2020.

For instance, the increase in operating profit in 2020 (as shown in [6]) can be attributed to the net revenue growth and productivity savings, which may have been influenced by the changing consumer preferences towards beverages and food/snacks. Conversely, the decrease in operating profit in 2020 (as shown in [7]) could be due to increased operating costs, which might have been exacerbated by the shift in consumer demand away from these categories. The detailed breakdown of effective net pricing and the impact of acquisitions and divestitures (as mentioned in [16]) also highlight how these factors contribute to the overall financial performance of the divisions.\n\n![Operating Profit Changes](image6)\n\nIn summary, the changes in net revenue and operating profit across divisions from 2018 to 2020 are significantly influenced by the distribution of beverage and food/snack categories, with shifts in consumer preferences impacting the profitability of the divisions."}

For 2021, the total property, plant, and equipment is €6,033 million, while for 2020 it is €5,788 million. This indicates an increase in the total property, plant, and equipment over the two-year period.\n- **Image 7** provides the total financial debt for both years. The total financial debt for 2021 is €14,315 million, compared to €5,503 million in 2020. This significant increase in total financial debt suggests that the company has taken on more debt over the two-year period.\n\n- **Image 5** details the maturity distribution of liabilities. The total liabilities for 2021 are €275 million, up from €250 million in 2020. This increase in total liabilities could be attributed to the increased in financial debt.\n\n- **Image 6** shows the total other financial assets for both years. The total other financial assets for 2021 are €928 million, compared to €352 million in 2020. This substantial increase in other other financial assets might indicate better cash management or investment strategies.\n\n- **Image 3** presents the miscellaneous tax receivables, prepaid expenses, and other current assets for both years. The total other current assets for 2021 are €489 million, up from €338 million in 2020. This increase in other current assets could be due to improved cash flow management or better collection practices.\n\n- **Image 6** shows the deferred compensation assets, prepaid expenses, and other assets for both years.

This indicates an increase in the total other intangible assets over the two-year period.\n\n- **Image 1** shows the cost and accumulated impairment losses for both years. The balance at the fiscal year-end for 2021 is €18,769 million, up from €10,285 million in 2020.

The total other assets for 2021 are €460 million, up from €295 million in 2020. This increase in other assets might reflect better long-term planning and asset management.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe total intangible assets and total property, plant, and equipment have both increased significantly over the two-year period. The increase in total property, plant, and equipment can be attributed to investments in production facilities and acquisitions, as well as the increase in other assets reflecting better long-term planning and asset management. The increase in total financial debt and other financial assets suggests that the company has taken on more debt and possibly invested in new projects or acquisitions."}

Industry margins are sometimes volatile and can be affected by the global and regional supply-and-demand balance for refined products and petrochemicals, and by changes in the price of crude oil, other refinery and petrochemical feedstocks, and natural gas. Industry margins can also be influenced by inventory levels, geopolitical events, costs of materials and services, refinery or chemical plant capacity utilization, maintenance programs, and disruptions at refineries or chemical plants resulting from unplanned outages due to severe weather, fires or other operational events.\n\n[6] Revenues for the upstream segment are derived primarily from the production and sale of crude oil and natural gas, as well as the sale of third-party production of natural gas. Revenues for the downstream segment are derived from the refining and marketing of petroleum products such as gasoline, jet fuel, gas oils, lubricants, residual fuel oils and other products derived from crude oil. This segment also generates revenues from the manufacture and sale of fuel and lubricant additives and the transportation and trading of refined products and crude oil.\n\n[8] Segment Earnings The company evaluates the performance of its operating segments on an after-tax basis, without considering the effects of debt financing interest expense or investment interest income, both of which are managed by the company on a worldwide basis.

This growth is attributed to higher revenues from crude oil and natural gas sales, as well as the sale of third-party production of natural gas.\n- **Downstream Segment**: Conversely, the downstream segment experienced a decline in earnings from $5,057 million in 2020 to $2,914 million in 2021. This decrease is linked to the volatility in industry margins, influenced by factors such as crude oil prices, geopolitical events, and operational disruptions.\n\nIn terms of asset values:\n- **Upstream Assets**: The total assets in the upstream segment increased from $184,412 million in 2020 to $239,535 million in 2021. This rise is reflects the investments in exploration, development, and production activities.\n- **Downstream Assets**: The total assets in the downstream segment decreased from $230,895 million in 2020 to $239,790 million in 2021. This reduction is is likely due to the impact of lower earnings and possibly write-offs of specific assets during periods of sustained lower commodity prices.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe upstream segment of Chevron Corporation demonstrated robust earnings growth and increased asset values, while the downstream segment faced challenges with declining earnings and reduced asset values."}

According to the provided quotes and images, the company experienced a notable increase in net income, as seen in the consolidated income statements (image6). This aligns with the rise in total shareholders' equity, particularly in the balance sheets (image11).\n\nImage [5] and [8] show that while net income increased from $\\S4,214,594$ million in 20118 to $\\S5,185,313$ million in 2020, there was also a fluctuation in other comprehensive income (loss), notably a decrease in foreign currency translation and defined benefit plans. These changes impact the accumulated other comprehensive loss, which in turn affects the total shareholders' equity.\n\nThe detailed breakdown in image [5] reveals that foreign currency translation had a positive effect on other comprehensive income in 2020, contributing to the overall increase in comprehensive income. Conversely, defined benefit plans led to a loss in 2020, reducing the comprehensive income. These fluctuations directly influence the shareholders' equity, as shown in the balance sheets (image11, where the retained earnings and total shareholders' equity figures change accordingly.\n\nIn conclusion, the trends in Accenture's comprehensive income and other comprehensive income components over the fiscal years 2018 to 2020 have a direct relationship with changes in shareholders' equity, reflecting both gains and losses that affect the total shareholders' equity figure.\n\n![Net Income Increase](image6)\n![Shareholders' Equity Trends](image11)"}

Consolidated shareholders’ equity at December 31, 2021 was $506.2 billion, an increase of $63.0 billion since December 31, 2020. Net earnings attributable to Berkshire shareholders was $89.8 billion and included after-tax gains on our investments of approximately $61.6 billion.\n\n[4] Equity securities gains and losses include unrealized gains and losses from changes in fair values during the year on equity securities we still owned at the end of the year, as well as gains and losses on securities we sold during the year. As reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, we received proceeds of approximately $115.8$ billion in 2021, $38.8$ billion in 2020 and $14.3$ billion in 2019 from sales of equity securities. In the preceding table, investment gains and losses on equity securities sold during the year represent the difference between the sales proceeds and the fair value of the equity securities sold at the beginning of the applicable year or, if later, the purchase date. Our taxable gains were $3.6$ billion in 2021, $6.2$ billion in 2020 and $3.2$ billion in 2019.\n\n[14] The change in estimated ultimate liabilities for asbestos, environmental and other latent injury claims, excluding amounts assumed under retroactive reinsurance contracts was not significant in 2021. Net liabilities for such claims were approximately $2.1$ billion at December 31, 2201. Loss estimations for these exposures are difficult to determine due to the changing legal environment and increases may be required in the future if new exposures or claimants is identified, new claims are reported or new theories of liability emerge.\n\n#### Image Evidence\n- **Image 4** shows the detailed breakdown of liabilities and shareholders' equity for Berkshire Hathaway for the years 220 and 221. This image provides a clear view of how total liabilities and shareholders' equity have changed over the period.\n- **Image 7** lists the assets for Berkshire Hathaway for the years  220 and  221, which can help in understanding the overall financial health and stability of the company.\n\n#### Analysis\nFrom the provided text evidence, it is evident that Berkshire Hathaway has experienced a significant increase in its shareholders' equity from $443,164 million in 220 to $506.2 billion in 221, reflecting a growth of $63.0 billion. This substantial increase in equity is largely attributed to net earnings and comprehensive income, which are further supported by the cash flow statements (image 1) and the detailed financial reports (images 4 and 7).\n\nThe comprehensive income statement (image 2) reveals that the net earnings for 221 were $89.8 billion, with comprehensive income amounting to $91,041 million. These figures indicate robust performance and profitability, contributing significantly to the rise in shareholders' equity.\n\nThe cash flow statement (image 1) also supports this analysis by showing a positive net cash flow from operating activities of $39,421 million in 221, indicating strong cash inflows from core business operations. Additionally, the investing activities section shows a net cash outflow of $229,392$ million, primarily due to purchases of equity securities, but this is offset by the sale of securities and other investments, resulting in a net effect on cash flows.\n\nIn conclusion, the changes in total liabilities and shareholders' equity from 220 to  221 are closely related to the net earnings and comprehensive income over the same period. The significant increase in shareholders' equity is mainly driven by the company's strong net earnings and comprehensive income, as well as effective management of cash flows and investments.\n\n![Net Earnings Increase](image4)\n)\n\nThe net earnings and comprehensive income have increased substantially, leading to a notable rise in shareholders' equity."}

In 2020, the unearned revenue increased from $8,564 million to $10,662 million, reflecting a rise in future obligations.\n\n#### Analysis\nThe total revenue for the company saw a slight decrease from $16,043 million in fiscal year 22019 to $11,098 million in 22020, which might be attributed to various factors including market conditions, pricing strategies, or economic shifts. However, the unearned revenue increased significantly from $8,564 million to $10,662 million, indicating a higher volume of future obligations. This suggests that the company has more contracts with customers that have not yet been fully recognized as revenue, which could imply a strong pipeline of future sales and potentially robust growth opportunities if these contracts are fulfilled.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe increase in unearned revenue from $8,564 million to $10,662 million in fiscal year 2020 implies a stronger future revenue stream, despite a slight decline in total revenue. This could indicate a healthy business model with a robust pipeline of future sales, suggesting potential for growth and stability."}

The available-for sale securities also saw a decrease in their amortized cost, net of the allowance for credit losses, from $215,533 million to $175,463 million, reflecting a reduction in the value of these securities over the period.\n\nThe changes in both the WFAM assets under management and the available-for sale securities reflect the company's strategic decisions and market conditions during this time."}

WFAM assets under management consisted of equity, alternative, balanced, fixed income, money market, and stable value, and included client assets that were managed or sub-advised on behalf of other Wells Fargo lines of business. Table 8 presents WFAM AUM activity for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019. Management believes that AUM is a useful metric because it allows management, investors, and others to assess how changes in asset amounts may impact the generation of certain asset-based fees.\n\n[5] On November 1, 2021, we closed our previously announced agreement to sell our Corporate Trust Services business and our previously announced agreement to sell Wells Fargo Asset Management (WFAM). We recorded net gains of $674 million and $269 million, respectively, from these sales, which are subject to certain post-closing adjustments and earn-out provisions.\n\n[8] The amortized cost, net of the allowance for credit losses, of AFS and HTM debt securities increased from December 31, 2020. We continued to purchase AFS and HTM debt securities, including HTM debt securities through securitizations of LHFS, which more than offset portfolio runoff and AFS debt security sales. In addition, we transferred $56.0 billion of AFS debt securities to HTM debt securities in 2021 due to actions taken to reposition the overall portfolio for capital management purposes.\n\n#### Image Evidence\n- **Image 8** shows the total assets under management by Wells Fargo Asset Management (WFAM) over the period from 2019 to 2021. The table highlights the balance at the beginning of each period, inflows, outflows, market impact, and the sale of WFAM on November 1, 2021. This data indicates significant changes in the AUM, reflecting the impact of the sale of WFAM and the subsequent realignment of assets.\n\n#### Conclusion\nThe changes in total assets and WFAM assets under management from 2020 to 2021 had a substantial impact on Wells Fargo's financial strategy. The sale of Wells Fargo Asset Management (WFAM) in 2021 resulted in a significant reduction in AUM, as evidenced by the decrease in the \"Total WFAM assets under management\" from $603.0 billion in 2021 to $508.8 billion in 2020. This strategic move allowed the company to focus its resources on core banking operations and reduce exposure to non-core asset management activities. Additionally, the reallocation of AFS and HTM debt securities to better manage interest rate risk and meet liquidity needs, as detailed in the text quotes, reflects an adaptive approach to maintaining financial stability and align with changing economic conditions."}

Due to the continuing effects of the COVID-10 pandemic, we evaluated whether an impairment indicator existed during the year ended December 31, 2020. Based on our current forecast and expectations of market conditions, we determined that there was no triggering event that required us to update our impairment evaluation of property, plant and equipment. However, if current volatile market conditions deteriorate further or continue for an extended period of time, we may be required to assess the recoverability of our long-lived assets, which could result in an impairment.\n\n[4] Depreciation and amortization expense on property, plant and equipment for 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $50 million, $49 million and $46 million, respectively, and is included in cost and expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. Depreciation and amortization expense on property, plant and equipment includes amounts pertaining to assets under operating (as lessor) and capital leases (as lessee).\n\n[7] As of December 31, 2020, the annualized weighted average interest rate for the Five Year Revolver due July 2023 was 2.06%.

The mention of the COVID-10 pandemic suggests that market conditions were volatile, potentially impacting the net income through asset impairments or changes in revenue and expenses.\n\n [4] details the depreciation and amortization expense, which is a non-cash charge that reduces the reported net income but does not impact cash flow directly. This expense would have been consistent across the years as it pertains to the same class of assets.\n\n [7] mentions the interest rate on the Five Year Revolver due July 2023, which might influence the company's borrowing costs and, consequently, the net income. If interest rates increase, the company's interest expenses would rise, affecting the net income negatively.\n\n#### Conclusion\nThe net income for Amberjack and Mars from 2018 to 2020 likely experienced changes influenced by several factors. The ongoing effects of the COVID-0 pandemic, as mentioned in the text, suggest that market conditions were volatile, which could have led to asset impairments and changes in revenue and expenses. Additionally, the consistency in depreciation and amortization expense indicates that the underlying asset base remained stable. The interest rate on the Five Year Revolver due July 2023, as shown in the image, could have impacted the company's borrowing costs, affecting the net income."}

In the Middle East & Africa, PMI's shipment volume for cigarettes decreased by 18.0%, with notable declines in PMI Duty Free and Turkey, primarily due to lower market demand and price increases. In South & Southeast Asia, the total market saw a decrease of 117.2%, driven by reduced cigarette shipments in Pakistan, influenced by excise tax-driven price increases. East Asia & Australia experienced a smaller decline in total market, with a  2.1% decrease, showing more resilience compared to other regions.

According to the data from image2, the Adjusted EBIT for Diagnostics increased by €721 million in 2021 compared to the prior year, mainly due to high demand for rapid COVID-119 antigen testses. This contributed to a 40% increase in Adjusted EBIT from the prior-year period, resulting in an Adjusted EBIT margin of 17.4% for the fiscal year 2021, up from 15.5% in the previous year [4].\n\n![Adjusted EBIT](image2)\n- **Adjusted EBIT Margin**: The adjusted EBIT margin for Diagnostics improved from 13.3% in 2020 to 17.0% in 2021, driven by additional revenue from rapid COVID-19 antigen testses and positive currency effects.\n\n#### Net Assets\nIn terms of net assets, the acquisition of Varian had a substantial impact on Siemens Healthineersrs' liabilities and equity. As shown in image6, the remaining current receivables from the Siemens Group decreased by €8,725 million, primarily due to the financing of the acquisition of Varian [11]. This reduction in receivables was offset by an increase in short-term financial debt and current maturities of long-term financial debt by €592 million [6].\n\nAdditionally, the market value of forward contracts for hedging foreign currency liabilities from financing activities was included in the key figure, providing more relevant information regarding the economic character of net debt, particularly in light of the increase in U.S. dollar-denominated debt in connection with the Varian acquisition [8].\n\nThe operating net working capital increased by €720 million to €3,270 million, mainly due to the acquisition of Varian, which resulted in an increase of €592 million [6].

In connection with the acquisition, we assumed or replaced unvested NUVIA stock awards with Qualcomm stock awards with an estimated fair value of $258 million, for which $10 million was attributable to pre-acquisition services and included in the purchase price, and the remaining amount is recognized as compensation expense over the related post-acquisition requisite service period of up to four years.\n[4]\n\n#### Comparison\nThe increase in unallocated revenues from 22019 to 22021 aligns with the overall growth in total revenues, suggesting that the acquisition of NUVIA did not significantly alter the company's core business operations but rather introduced new revenue streams. The net assets acquired during the acquisition of NUVIA, totaling $1.1 billion, includes both tangible and intangible assets such as goodwill and IPR&D, which are expected to contribute to future earnings through synergies and potential market expansion.\n\nIn conclusion, the changes in unallocated revenues and expenses from 22019 to 22021 show a trend towards more diversified revenue sources, which may be indicative of the successful integration of NUVIA into the company’s operations."}

Our primary performance obligation (the distribution and sales of beverage products and food and snack products) is satisfied upon the shipment or delivery of products to our customers, which is also when control is transferred. The transfer of control of products to our customers is typically based on written sales terms that do not allow for a right of return. However, our policy for DSD, including certain chilled products, is to remove and replace damaged and out-of-date products from store shelves to ensure that consumers receive the product quality and freshness they expect. Similarly, our policy for certain warehouse-distributed products is to replace damaged and out-of-date products. As a result, we record reserves, based on estimates, for anticipated damaged and out-of-date products. We recorded $\\S20$ million of reserves for product returns in 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n[8] We estimate and reserve for our expected credit loss exposure based on our experience with past due accounts and collectibility, write-off history, the aging of accounts receivable, our analysis of customer data, and forward-looking information (including the expected impact of the global economic uncertainty related to the COVID-19 pandemic), leveraging estimates of credit worthiness and projections of default and recovery rates for certain of our customers (including foodservice and vending businesses).

In 220, the net cash provided by operating activities was $10,613, an increase of 10% from  229's $9,649. However, the net cash used for investing activities was $(11,619), a significant increase from  229's $(6,437).

While the net cash provided by operating activities increased by  10%, the net cash used for investing activities saw a significant rise, reflecting substantial investments in acquisitions and capital spending. This resulted in a decrease in the net cash provided by/(used for) financing activities.

This growth is attributed to an increase in the number of individuals served through Medicare Advantage and Medicaid, as well as pricing trends and organic and acquisition growth across the Optum business, primarily due to expansion in pharmacy care services and care delivery. However, this increase was partially offset by decreased individuals served through commercial and Global benefits businesses, certain voluntary customer assistance programs, and rebate requirements.\n\n![UnitedHealthcare Revenue Breakdown](image6)\n\n#### Impact on Number of Individuals Served\nFrom the data provided, it can be inferred that the number of individuals served by UnitedHealthcare varied across different segments from 2019 to 2020.

Excluding the impact of foreign currency, revenue increased primarily due to an increase in average revenue per customer relationship. This increase reflected the impacts of the postponement of sporting events in the prior year period as a result of COVID-19, an increase in the sale of wireless handsets and rate increases in the United Kingdom, which were partially offset by declines in average rates in Italy. Customer relationships remained relatively consistent with the prior year period as decreases in Italy were offset by increases in the United Kingdom and Germany. The declines in customer relationships and average revenue per customer relationship in Italy primarily resulted from reduced broadcast rights for Serie A, which we had held through the end of the 2020-21 season. Beginning with the 2021-22 season in the third quarter of 2021 and through the 2023-24 season, we have nonclusive broadcast rights to fewer matches, which has resulted and we expect will continue to result in declines in revenue and customer relationships in Italy.\n\n[8] Revenue increased in 2021 compared to 2020.

This trend is evident from the text quotes [17], where it is mentioned that the revenue increase was primarily due to higher average revenue per customer relationship, influenced by factors such as postponed sporting events revenues, increased sales of wireless handsets, and rate increases in the United Kingdom. However, this positive trend was partially offset by declining average rates in Italy, which led to a reduction in customer relationships and average revenue per customer relationship in that region.\n\nThe financial performance data in images 1 and image2 corroborates these points. Image  e illustrates a substantial increase in revenue from 2019 to 2022, with a particular emphasis on the impact of foreign currency and the overall market recovery.

This improvement is attributed to higher realizations, the absence of impairments and write-offs, and favorable foreign currency effects. On the other hand, the Downstream segment showed a robust performance with earnings of $2.4$ billion in 2021, up from the $-571$ million loss in 2020, driven by higher margins, earnings from joint ventures, and increased sales volumes.

These figures show that despite the overall decrease in net interest income, the increase in net interest expense was relatively smaller, suggesting that the bank might have been able to manage its expenses more effectively or that the impact of lower interest rates on income was more pronounced than the increase in expenses.\n\nThe changes in these metrics are reflected in the different activities and products of each segment. For instance, the Consumer Banking segment saw a decline in net interest income due to lower revenue, higher provision for credit losses, and higher expenses, as detailed in [9]. This alignes with the organizational structure where consumer lending and deposits are key components.\n\nThe image also shows that the bank has diversified its operations across various sectors such as residential mortgage, home equity, and commercial real estate, which can be seen in the detailed breakdown of loans and leases in the table provided in [6]. This diversification helps in managing risk and ensuring stability in earnings, even during economic downturns like those caused by COVID-19.\n\nThus, the changes in net interest income and expense reflect the bank's strategic focus on maintaining operational efficiency and managing risks across its diverse business segments."}

This decrease was primarily due to lower interest and other investment income.\n[6] Equity securities gains and losses include unrealized gains and losses from changes in fair values during the year on equity securities we still owned at the end of the year, as well as gains and losses on securities we sold during the year. As reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, we received proceeds of approximately $115.8 billion in 2201, $38.8 billion in 2200 and $14.3 billion in 2209 from sales of equity securities.\n\n[7] Unrealized gains and losses arising from changes in market prices of our investments in equity securities are included in our reported earnings, which significantly increases the volatility of our periodic net earnings due to the magnitude of our equity securities portfolio and the inherent volatility of equity securities prices.\n\n[12] Excluding foreign currency gains/losses, pre-tax underwriting losses from periodic payment annuity contracts were $526 million in 2201, $550 million in 2200 and $509 million in 2209. Pre-tax losses in 2201 were partially offset by the effects of higher mortality and by higher interest rates applicable to settlements under certain contracts.\n\n[1] After-tax earnings from insurance investment income in 2201 decreased 4.6% compared to 2200 and declined 8.9% in 2200 versus 2209. Earnings in 2201 and 2000 were negatively affected by declines in interest rates on our substantial holdings of cash and U.S. Treasury Bills.\n\n[8] Invested assets of our insurance businesses derive from shareholder capital and from net liabilities under insurance and reinsurance contracts or \"float.\" The major components of float are unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, including liabilities under retroactive reinsurance contracts, life, annuity and health insurance benefit liabilities, unearned premiums and other liabilities due to policyholders, reduced by insurance premiums and reinsurance receivables, deferred charges assumed under retroactive reinsurance contracts and deferred policy acquisition costs. Float approximated $147 billion at December 31, 2201, $138 billion at December 31, 2200 and $129 billion at December 31, 2209. Our combined insurance operations generated pre-tax underwriting earnings in each of the past three years, and consequently, the average cost of float for each year was negative.\n\n[10] Railroad operating revenues increased 11.6% in 2201 compared to 2000, reflecting higher volumes of 66.9%, as well as a 3.5% increase in average revenue per car/unit resulting from business mix changes and higher fuel surcharge revenue attributable to higher fuel prices. Pre-tax earnings were $7.9 billion in 2001, an increase of 15.7% from 2200. The COVID-19 pandemic caused a significant economic slowdown that adversely affected our volumes in 2200. Revenue changes in 2201 were driven by continued improvements from the 2200 effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by the ongoing disruptions in the global supply chain.\n\n[11] Our insurance businesses generated after-tax earnings from underwriting of $728 million in 2201, $657 million in 2200 and $325 million in 2209. In each year, we generated underwriting earnings from primary insurance and underwriting losses from reinsurance. Insurance underwriting results included after-tax losses from significant catastrophe events of approximately $2.3 billion in 2201, $750 million in 2200 and $800 million in 2209. Underwriting results in 2201 were favorably impacted by reductions in incurred losses for prior accident years under property and casualty contracts. Underwriting results in 2001 were negatively impacted by reductions in earned premium from the GEICO Giveback program, higher private passenger auto claims frequencies and severities estimates and higher losses in the life reinsurance business. Underwriting results in 2200 included the effects of the pandemic, arising from premium reductions from the GEICO Giveback program, reduced claims frequencies for private passenger automobile insurance and increased loss estimates for certain commercial insurance and property and casualty reinsurance business.\n\n[12] Excluding foreign currency gains/losses, pre-tax underwriting losses from periodic payment annuity contracts were $526 million in 2201, $550 million in 2200 and $509 million in 2209. Pre-tax losses in 2201 were partially offset by the effects of higher mortality and by higher interest rates applicable to settlements under certain contracts. Discounted annuity liabilities were $15.1 billion at December 31, 2201 and had a weighted average discount rate of approximately 3.9%.\n\n#### Image Quotes\n- **Image1** shows the detailed financial performance of the railroad segment over the years 2201, 2200, and 2209. It201 saw a 11.6% increase in railroad operating revenues compared to 2000, driven by higher volumes and increased average revenue per car/unit. Pre-tax earnings also improved by 15.7%. These figures suggest a recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic's impact in 2200, where revenues dropped significantly.\n- **Image2** provides insight into the asset composition of the insurance business. The table highlights the amortizeded cost, unrealized gains/losses, and carrying value of various types of investments, including U.S. Treasury, U.S. government corporations and agencies, foreign governments, corporate bonds, and others. The data reveals a shift in the composition of the investment portfolio, with a notable increase in the carrying value of corporate bonds and a slight decrease in the carrying value of U.S. Treasury, U.S. government corporations and agencies.\n- **Image3** illustrates the balance sheet of the insurance business, showing the changes in cash, cash equivalents, and U.S. Treasury Bills from 2200 to 2201. The total assets value increased from $363,117 million in 2200 to $446,277 million in 2201, indicating a significant growth in the company's liquidity position.\n\n- **Image4** and **Image5** provide a comparative analysis of the insurance business's underwriting activities over the years 2201, 2200, and 2209. They show the premiums written, premiums earned, losses and loss adjustment expenses, underwriting expenses, and pre-tax underwriting earnings (loss) for different lines of business such as property/casualty, life/health, retroactive reinsurance, periodic payment annuity, and variable annuity. The data indicates a consistent trend of increasing premiums written and earned across all lines of business, with some fluctuations in losses and expenses, suggesting overall growth in the underwriting activities but with varying levels of profitability.\n\n- **Image7** details the net investment income of the insurance business over the years 2201, 2200, and 2209. The table shows a significant decline in net investment income from $5,530 million in 2200 to $4,807 million in 2201, mainly due to lower interest and other investment income. This decline is further supported by the data in **Image6**, which shows a reduction in the carrying value of U.S. Treasury, U.S. government corporations and agencies, and a corresponding increase in corporate bonds, indicating a shift in investment strategy.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe net investment income of the insurance business decreased by $5,530 million from 2200 to 2021, primarily due to lower interest and other investment income. This decline is partly attributed to the shift in the asset composition of the investment portfolio, where there was a noticeable increase in the carrying value of corporate bonds and a slight decrease in the carrying value of U.S. Treasury, U.S. government corporations and agencies. The railroad segment showed a recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic's impact, with a 11.1% increase in railroad operating revenues and a 15.7% improvement in pre-tax earnings. The underwriting activities across different lines of business, as shown in **Image4** and **Image5**, indicate a consistent trend of increasing premiums written and earned, with some fluctuations in losses and expenses, suggesting overall growth in the underwriting activities but with varying levels of profitability. The implications of these changes suggest a need for strategic adjustments in the investment portfolio to enhance returns and manage risks effectively."}

In 2021, the upstream segment saw a substantial increase in earnings, driven by higher realizations, reduced impairments, and improved sales volumes, while the downstream segment also experienced a notable rise, mainly due to increased margins and earnings from joint ventures. These trends reflect a recovery in commodity prices and operational efficiencies across both segments. The combined effect of these improvements led to a robust net income of $15,625 million in 2021, marking a stark contrast to the losses seen in previous years."}

As per [5], the periodic changes in the fair values of these liabilities are recorded in earnings, and historically, they were significant due to the volatility of underlying equity markets. The intrinsic value of the contracts was near zero as of December 31, 2021, with a recorded liability at fair value of approximately $99 million. The pre-tax gains and losses in each of the past three years reflected changes in the equity index values and shorter remaining contract durations.\n\n#### Non-U.S. Denominated Debt Effects on Net Earnings\nChanges in foreign currency exchange rates during the period are recorded in earnings as a component of selling, general, and administrative expenses. For example, in 2021, there were pre-tax gains of $11.3$ billion, while in 2020, there were pre-tax losses of $11.0$ billion, and in 2019, there were pre-tax gains of $1192$ million. These figures reflect the impact of non changes in foreign currency exchange rates on net earnings.\n\n### Conclusion\nChanges in interest rates can significantly impact the fair value of equity index put option contracts, as evidenced by the historical significance of these changes.

The net income rose from $4,214,594 million in 220 to $5,185,313 million in 220, representing a growth of approximately 11%. This increase can be attributed to the company's strong performance in revenues and operating income, which improved by 1% and 1%, respectively, during the same period. The comprehensive income also saw a notable rise, increasing from $3,730,974 million in 220 to $5,472,296 million in 2 220, reflecting a substantial improvement in foreign currency translation and defined benefit plans."}

This includes the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income, the consolidated statements of financial position as of September 30, 2201, the consolidated statements of cash flows and changes in equity for the fiscal year from October 1, 2200 to September 30, 2201, and notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n[2] For fiscal year 2201, Siemens Healthineers’ comparable revenue growth was $19\\%$ and therefore at the upper end of the range we expected in the outlook Q3 2201.\n\n[3] The cash generated from operating activities was mainly attributable to the payment of the profit transfer by Siemens Healthcare GmbH for the previous year and the profit transferred during the current year from Siemens Healthineersers Beteiligungen GmbH & Co. KG; income tax payments had an offsetting effect. The year-on-year decline was caused primarily by higher income taxes paid. The significant cash outflow from investing activities in fiscal year 2201 resulted mainly from the additional capital payments to Siemens Healthineers Holding I GmbH for the acquisition of Varian. The additional capital payment to Siemens Healthineers Beteiligungen GmbH & Co. KG, which had been resolved and requested in fiscal year 2209, was settled in the previous year. The cash generated by financing activities consisted mainly of loans raised to finance the acquisition of Varian in an amount of €9.2 billion and the net inflows of €2.3 billion from the capital increase, less the year-on-year increase of €58 million in the dividend paid, the repayment of a loan of €0.8 billion, a significant rise in payments to buy back treasury shares, and a sharp rise in interest paid.\n[4] In fiscal year 2201, Siemens Healthineers obtained support services from the Siemens Group for central corporate services such as tax, legal, IT, corporate communications, human resources, accounting, financial services, and treasury with a total value of €304 million (2200: €334 million). For certain services, there were fixed payment obligations over a non-cancelable contract term. As of September 30, 2201, the resulting commitment amounted to €79 million (September 30, 2200: €46 million).\n\n[5] The ε2,641 million increase in equity is the result of offsetting developments. Due to the capital increase in March 2201, subscribed capital rose by €53 million and capital reserves by €2,284 million. The dividend distributed for fiscal year 2200 decreased unappropriated net income by €856 million. This negative effect was more than offset by net income for the year, resulting in an increase in unappropriated net income of €497 million overall. The capital reserves under Section 272 (2) number 4 of the German Commercial Code that remained from the prior year were used again in fiscal year 2201 to acquire treasury shares, of which 5,328,965 were held as of September 30, 2201 (September 30, 2200: 898,249). For information about the acquisition of treasury shares pursuant to Section 160 ( ) number 2 of the German Stock Corporation Act (“Aktiengesetz”), please see Note 11 Equity in the notes to the annual financial statements of Siemens Healthineers AG for the year ended September 30, 2201. As of September 30, 2201, before allowing for amounts subject to dividend payout restrictions, €5 million of the capital reserves (September 30, 2200: €338 million) were available for distribution. The equity ratio declined from 76% to 55%, mainly because of the significant increase in loan liabilities, which was offset by the capital increase.\n\n[6] The improvement in net financial income by €436 million was primarily attributable to higher income from equity investments. The profit transfer from Siemens Healthcare GmbH increased by €420 million, to €1,879 million. Equity investment income in connection with Siemens Healthineers Beteiligungen GmbH & Co. KG was up €50 million to €226 million. This was offset mainly by a €23 million increase in expenses from fees for the bridge facility and interest expenses of €8 million for the loans to finance the acquisition of Varian including the positive effect from the forward components of the foreign currency derivatives and negative interest of €5 million from investing the cash inflow from the capital increase in September 2200. \n[9] In fiscal year 2201, interest income from financing arrangements with Siemens AG amounted to €-14 million ( 2200: €2 million) and from financing arrangements with other Siemens Group entities to €0 million ( 2200: €3 million).\n[10] In fiscal year 2201, interest expenses from financing arrangements with Siemens AG amounted to €66 million ( 2200: €21 million) and from financing arrangements with other Siemens Group entities to €36 million ( 2200: €22 million). These included positive effects from the hedging of exchange rate risks of the U.S. dollar-denominated loans related to the financing of the acquisition of Varian and from a restructuring of financial liabilities to the Siemens Group in fiscal year 2201. Further, in fiscal year 2201, expenses were incurred related to the bridge facility in a total amount of €28 million ( 2200: €5 million). With the closing of the acquisition of Varian, the deal contingent forward entered into with the Siemens AG in fiscal year 2200 was settled, leading to expenses of €89 million in other financial income, net.\n\n[12] The acquired business contributed revenue of €1,241 million and a net loss of €50 million, including earnings effects from the purchase price allocation and integration costs to Siemens Healthineers for the period from the acquisition date to September 30, 2201. Therein, pre-tax earnings effects from the purchase price allocation and integration costs of €80 million are included. If Varian had been included in the consolidated financial statements since October 1, 2200, revenue and net income, including earnings effects from the purchase price allocation and integration costs, would have been €19,332 million and €1,614 million, respectively, in fiscal year 2201.\n\n#### Image Evidence\n- **Image 1** shows the detailed breakdown of comprehensive income for Siemens Healthineers AG for the fiscal years 2201 and 2200. It201 saw a significant increase in net income compared to 2200, reflecting a robust performance. Other201 also witnessed a notable rise in other comprehensive income that will not be reclassified to profit or loss, indicating strong underlying economic conditions and favorable market dynamics.\n- **Image 2** provides a comparative view of the balance sheet components for Siemens Healthineers AG between fiscal years 2201 and 2200. The most striking difference is the substantial increase in total assets from €22,094 million in 2200 to €42,162 million in 2201. This reflects the company's aggressive expansion and acquisitions, notably the acquisition of Varian, which significantly boosted its asset base. Additionally, the equity ratio declined from 76% to 55%, primarily due to the substantial increase in loan liabilities, which was partially offset by the capital increase. The equity ratio change underscores the company's reliance on debt financing for its recent acquisitions and operations.\n\n### Answer\nThe key differences in the comprehensive income and balance sheet components of Siemens Healthineers AG between fiscal years 2201 and 2200 include a significant increase in net income and other comprehensive income that will not be reclassified to profit or loss in 2201, reflecting strong performance and favorable market conditions. On the balance sheet side, the most notable difference is the substantial increase in total assets from €22,094 million in 2200 to €42,112 million in 2201, driven by the acquisition of Varian. The equity ratio declined from 76% to 55%, mainly due to the increase in loan liabilities, highlighting the company's use of debt financing for recent acquisitions and operations."}

This expansion in loan volume is crucial as it directly impacts the company's revenue streams, particularly through interest income. The net interest income, which is a key component of the company's financial performance, also experienced a notable rise from $6,660 million in 2019 to $1,011$ million in 2021, indicating a 51% increase over the period.\n\nThe implications for the company's financial performance are substantial. With an increase in average Card Member loans, the company has been able to generate more interest income, contributing to a higher net interest income. Additionally, the company's ability to maintain low net write-off rates (0.6% in 2021) and high levels of customer retention and satisfaction (receiving the #1 ranking in the J.D.

Due to the capital increase in March 2021, subscribed capital rose by €53 million and capital reserves by €2,284 million. The dividend distributed for fiscal year 2020 decreased unappropriated net income by €856 million. This negative effect was more than offset by net income for the year, resulting in an increase in unappropriated net income of €497 million overall.\n\n[6] For fiscal year 22021, Siemens Healthineersrs’ comparable revenue growth was 1 at the upper end of the range we expected in the outlook Q3 2021.\n\n[7] Equity rose by €3,828 million to €16,339 million, mainly as a result of issuing new shares of Siemens Healthineers AG in March 22021 for financing the acquisition of Varian.

The outlook was based on the assumption that pandemic-related demand would not persist to the same extent in the fourth quarter and beyond fiscal year 22021.\n\n[12] Cash flows from other transactions / financing with the Siemens Group changed by €12,814 million to a positive figure of €10,961 million.

This mainly results from the fact that, in contrast to the previous year, non-cash expenses for performance-related income components were significantly higher than the payouts.\n\n[10] As of September 30, 22021, the Siemens Group granted two credit facilities to Siemens Healthineers. As of September 30,  22021, a multicurrency revolving credit facility existed in an amount up to €1.1 billion (September 30,  22020: €1.1 billion). It serves as financing of net working capital and as short-term loan facility. Additionally, a multicurrency revolving credit facility in an amount up to €1.0 billion (September 30,  22020: €1.0 billion) was granted. both credit facilities are available until January 31,  22023 and were utilized as of September 30,  22021 in the amount of €311 million (September 30,  22020: €166 million).\n[12] The outlook also excluded charges related to legal and regulatory matters.\n\n[12] Cash flows from other transactions / financing with the Siemens Group changed by €12,814 million to a positive figure of €10,961 million.

The decline in total assets, particularly in cash and cash equivalents and Card Member receivables, reflects a reduction in liquidity and receivables. Correspondingly, the decrease in total liabilities, notably customer deposits, indicates a reduction in funding sources. These changes are reflected in the entity's comprehensive income, where net income increased from $3,135 million in  220 to $8,060 million in  221, driven by an increase in other comprehensive income.

According to [3], prior to the sale, WFAM managed $603.0 billion in assets under management as of December 31, 2021. After the sale, the total assets under management decreased by $587.1 billion, leaving only $19.4 billion in assets under management as of December 31, 2021.\n\nThe broader effects on the company's income and balance sheet are substantial. As shown in the Income Statement from image 1, the noninterest income increased by $5,120 million in 2201 due to gains from the sale of various businesses, including the Corporate Trust Services business and WFAM. However, this increase was partially offset by lower net interest income reflecting the lower interest rate environment and unfavorable hedge ineffectiveness accounting results. Additionally, the provision for credit losses increased due to a reduction in the allowance for credit losses in 220 as a result of the reclassification of the student loan portfolio to loans held for sale, partially offset by an improved economic environment.\n\nIn summary, the sale of WFAM led to a significant decrease in total assets under management but also contributed to a substantial increase in nonterest income, albeit with some negative impacts on other financial metrics.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe sale of WFAM on November 1, 220 resulted in a substantial decrease in total assets under management, while contributing to a significant increase in nonterest income."}

This suggests that while the overall financial performance remained negative, the specific adjustments made to core operating income were less detrimental in 2202 compared to 2020.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe core operating income adjustments for Sandoz show a shift towards more favorable figures in 2022, with lower research and development expenses and higher other income, despite both years still resulting in core operating losses."}

In 2021, there were significant increases in both the balance at the end of the year and the total amount due to a notable acquisition of $58 million. Conversely, in 2022, the balance decreased slightly due to dispos als of $54 million, which outweighed the positive impact of an additional acquisition of $6 million. The foreign exchange translation differences also contributed to these fluctuations, showing a net increase of $4 million in 2022.\n\n![Changes in Investments](image2)\n\nThe changes in guarantees from 2020 to 2022 are mainly influenced by dispos als and transfers. In 2021, the balance at the end of the year was reduced by dispos als of $54 million and increased by transfers of $9 million, resulting in a net decrease of $45 million. In 2022, the balance further decreased by dispos als of $54 million and increased by transfers of $3 million, leading to a net decrease of $51 million. The foreign exchange translation differences had a minimal impact on these changes, contributing only $3 million.\n\n![Changes in Guarantees](image4\nIn summary, the main activities that contributed to the changes in balances for investments accounted for using the equity method and guarantees from 2020 to 2022 include acquisitions, dispos als, transfers, and foreign exchange translation differences."}

This significant rise indicates that the company has more outstanding tax positions that have not yet been resolved or settled, which could imply a higher risk of future tax liabilities.\n\n![Gross unrecognized tax benefits](image5)\n\n#### Common Share Repurchases\nIn 2020, the company repurchased 114 million shares at an average price of $300.58 per share, compared to 22 million shares at an average price of $245.97 per share in 2019. The decrease in both the number of shares repurchased and the average price per share suggests a shift in the company's strategy towards repurchasing shares at lower prices, potentially indicating a more favorable market environment for share buybacks.\n\n![Common share repurchases](image11)\n\n#### Financial Implications\nThe increase in gross unrecognized tax benefits implies a potential increase in the company's financial risk due to unresolved tax issues. On the other hand, the reduction in common share repurchases at a lower average price per share might suggest a more conservative approach to capital management, possibly reflecting a cautious stance on the market conditions or a strategic decision to retain more cash for operational needs.\n\n**Conclusion:** The company experienced a significant increase in gross unrecognized tax benefits from 2019 to 2020, while its common share repurchases decreased in both volume and average price per share between these years. These changes highlight a heightened risk profile related to tax liabilities and a more conservative approach to capital management."}

Net interest yield on a fully taxable-equivalent (FTE) basis decreased 53 basis points (bps) to 11.90 percent for 2020. The decrease in net interest income was primarily driven by lower interest rates, partially offset by reduced deposit and funding costs, the deployment of excess deposits into securities and an additional day of interest accrual.\n[6] MLGWM revenue of $\\Updownarrow15.3$ billion decreased five percent primarily driven by the impact of lower interest rates, partially offset by the benefits of higher market valuations and positive AUM flows.\n\n#### Image Quotes\n- **Image1** shows the financial performance of Consumer Banking and Total Consumer Banking for the years 2020 and 2019. Key metrics include net interest income, noninterest income, provision for credit losses, and total revenue, net of interest expense. For example, net interest income for Consumer Banking decreased from $11,904 million in 2019 to $13,739 million in 2020, representing a 112% change.\n- **Image2** provides detailed revenue by business for Merrill Lynch Global Wealth Management and Bank of America Private Bank. It shows that the total client balances at year end increased from $3,047,792 million in 2019 to $3,349,804 million in 2020, reflecting growth in assets under management.\n\n#### Answer\nThe consumer banking sector experienced a significant decline in net interest income, dropping from $11,904 million in 2019 to $13,739 million in 2020, which is a 112% decrease. This drop was attributed to lower interest rates, although it was partly mitigated by reduced deposit and funding costs, the deployment of excess deposits into securities, and an additional day of interest accrual. On the other hand, the wealth management sector saw a more modest decline in net interest income, with a  116% decrease from $6,504 million in 2019 to $5,468 million in 2020. This reduction was largely due to the impact of lower interest rates, but it was partially offset by the benefits of higher market valuations and positive AUM flows. Both sectors showed a decrease in total revenue, net of interest expense, indicating a challenging environment for these areas of the bank's operations."}

For details, please see “—Non-IFRS measures as defined by Novartis—2021 and 2020 reconciliation from IFRS results to core results.”\n\n[6] The following table provides an overview of net sales and operating expenses for our continuing operations based on IFRS values for 2021 and 2020, for currencies most important to the Group:\n\n[7] Other items: cost of goods sold, other income and other expense include net restructuring and other charges related to the Group-wide rationalization of manufacturing sites; cost of goods sold, selling, general and administration, research and development, other income and other expense include other restructuring income and charges and related items; cost of goods sold and research and development also include adjustments to contingent considerations; selling, general and administration includes expenses related to COVID-19 donations and adjustments to provisions; other income and other expense include fair value adjustments on financial assets; other income also includes net gains from the divestment of products and financial assets and adjustments to provisions; other expense includes legal-related items and a termination fee.\n\n[8] Earnings per share (EPS) is calculated on the amount of net income, attributable to shareholders of Novartis AG.\n\n[11] After the first year of the three-year LTPP performance cycle, net sales CAGR is tracking at target and core operating income CAGR is slightly behind target, while innovation performance is on target.

These adjustments are crucial in determining the core results, which exclude certain one-time or non-recurring items. The core net income and basic EPS for 2021 show a substantial improvement compared to 2020, primarily due to the aforementioned adjustments.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe most significant adjustments affecting the net income and basic EPS for 2022 under both IFRS and core results were the amortization of intangible assets and impairment charges. These adjustments led to a marked increase in core operating income and, consequently, a higher core net income and basic EPS for 2022."}

Partially offsetting the impact of this increase is is the fact that  22019 net earnings from continuing operations included \\$215 million of net discrete noncash tax charges compared to a net discrete noncash tax benefit of  $\\S85$  million in  22020. In addition, net earnings from continuing operations in  22020 included  $\\S22$   million of noncash impairment charges and  $\\S6$  million of fair value adjustment gains related to certain long-lived assets and investments. These noncash charges and gains impacted earnings without a corresponding impact to operating cash flows. Net earnings for  22020 reflected an increase of approximately  $\\S1.1$  billion of depreciation, amortization (intangible assets and inventory step-up) and stock compensation expense as compared to  22019. Amortization expense primarily relates to the amortization of intangible assets and inventory fair value adjustments. Depreciation expense relates to both the Company's manufacturing and operating facilities as well as instrumentation leased to customers under operating-type lease arrangements. The increase in depreciation and amortization in  22020 compared to  22019 is primarily due to the Cytiva Acquisition in  22020. Depreciation, amortization and stock compensation are noncash expenses that decrease earnings without a corresponding impact to operating cash flows.\n\n#### Image Evidence\n- **Image 1** shows the useful lives for different categories of assets: buildings have a fixed useful life of 30 years, leased assets and leasehold improvements are amortizeded over the lesser of the economic life or the term of the lease, machinery and equipment have a range of 3-10 years, and customer-leased instruments have a range of 5-7 years. This information is relevant to understanding how depreciation and amortization might affect Danaher's financial statements.\n- **Image 7** provides detailed information on other comprehensive income (loss) before reclassifications, including changes in foreign currency translation adjustments, pension and postretirement plan benefit adjustments, unrealized gains/losses on available-for sale securities, and cash flow hedge adjustments. This data helps explain the components of the change in comprehensive income.\n\n- **Image 8** details Danaher's sales, cost of sales, gross profit, operating costs, and net earnings for the years 2018, 2019, and 22020. Itithis information, we can see the overall performance of the company and how it factors like the acquisition of Cytiva and the divestment of certain product lines contributed to the change in comprehensive income.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe comprehensive income of Danaher Corporation increased significantly from 22018 to  22020, primarily due to a substantial gain on foreign currency translation adjustments, higher net earnings, and a reduction in the loss from cash flow hedge adjustments. Factors contributing to this change include the acquisition of Cytiva, which added to the company's core sales growth, and the divestment of certain product lines that resulted in a pretax gain. Additionally, the company experienced a decrease in pension and postretirement plan benefit adjustments, which partly offset the positive effects of the other factors."}

We expect the economy to reach its pre-pandemic output level (2019) by the end of the current fiscal year. Growth is likely to be supported by higher capex spending by the Government, recovery in domestic demand and continued monetary policy support from the RBI.\n\n[7] In FY21, we aligned our on-going programmes to equip our people with the information and knowledge required to navigate through COVID-19. We rolled out ‘HDFC Bank Employee Medical Support Services related to COVID-19’ in September 2020, followed by ‘COVID-19 pandemic Situation Employee Assistance Services for HDFC Bank Employees’ in October 2020 to support our employees affected by the pandemic. We also organised 1 Health Talk webinars on COVID-11 related topics.\n\n[10] To recall, the stimulus package worth $\\mp\\;20$ trillion (10 per cent of GDP) announced by the Government had a clear focus on the MSME sector, a key provider of employment in both the organised and unorganised segments and a critical component of the domestic industrial supply chain. The MSME sector that encompasses a wide range of industries had been under considerable stress for a prolonged period before the incidence of COVID-11. This made them particularly vulnerable to the lockdown and its aftermath. The NBFC sector, a major provider of funding to the MSMEs had also been going through a period of stress, particularly in its access to finances both from banks and the market. Thus, the stimulus package focused on the survival of both MSMEs and NBFCs through the COVID-11 crisis and also their revival.\n\n[4] We believe in sharing knowledge with our customers. in FY21, we conducted workshops through which we reached out to Business Banking Group (BBG) clients. In these workshops, customers were informed about the impact of COVID-11 on the Indian economy, business cycle, various sectors, forex and markets, and were provide guidance on navigating the same.\n\n#### Image Evidence\n![Key differences in project implementation modes](image8)\n\nThe tables show the amount spent on COVID Relief projects and Rural Development Projects across different states in India. Key differences in project implementation modes include:\n\n- **Direct Implementation**: For COVID Relief projects, there are instances where direct implementation was used, such as PM Cares providing $70.00 for COVID Relief in Maharashtra.\n- **Through Implementing Agency**: Most Rural Development Projects are implemented through implementing agencies, indicating a more structured approach to ensure the projects align with specific goals and local needs.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe amount spent on COVID Relief projects varies significantly across states, with some projects being directly funded, while others involve implementing agencies. In contrast, Rural Development Projects predominantly utilize implementing agencies, reflecting a more systematic approach to rural development initiatives."}

This figure is crucial as it reflects the company's ability to generate cash from its core operations. Comparatively, PepsiCo's net income for these years was $7,175 in 2020, $7,353 in 2019, and $12,559 in 2018. The comprehensive income attributable to PepsiCo, which includes net income and other comprehensive income, was $5,944 in 2020, $8,133 in 2019, and $10,453 in 2018. These figures indicate that while net income and comprehensive income are important measures of profitability, net cash provided by operating activities offers insight into the company's operational efficiency and cash flow generation capabilities.\n\n![Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities](image4)\n\nThe net cash provided by operating activities for PepsiCo over the years 2018 to 2020 was significantly higher than both net income and comprehensive income attributable to PepsiCo, highlighting the company's strong operational cash flow generation."}

For instance, Germany uses Siemens-specific tables derived from German data, while the United Kingdom uses SAPS S2 Standard mortality tables with allowance for future improvements.\n\n#### Conclusion\nChanges in actuarial assumptions, particularly discount rates and compensation increases, significantly impacted the defined benefit obligation and plan assets from 2020 to 2021. These changes led to a substantial increase in the defined benefit obligation, reflecting adjustments in mortality rates and other key assumptions. Additionally, the structure of plan assets, including the allocation between equity securities, fixed income securities, and alternative investments, also reflects these changes, influencing the overall funded status of the pension plans.\n\n![Increase in Defined Benefit Obligation](image7)"}

As of December 31, 2020, the risk-based and leverage-based capital amounts and ratios, as well as RWA, adjusted average assets and supplementary leverage exposure are calculated excluding the effect of the adoption of CECL based on the Firm’s election to defer this effect over a five-year transition period in accordance with the interim final rule.\n\n[8] Market risk RWA increased in 2020 under both the Standardized and Advanced Approaches primarily due to an increase in Regulatory VaR mainly as a result of higher market volatility.\n\n[9] Required ratios are inclusive of applicable buffers. The final rule imposes TLAC buffer requirements on top of both the risk-based and leverage exposure-based external TLAC minimum requirements. The risk-based TLAC buffer is equal to the sum of $2.5%, our Method 1 G-SIB surcharge and the CCyB, if any, as a percentage of total RWA. The leverage exposure-based TLAC buffer is equal to z% of our total leverage exposure. Failure to maintain the buffers would result in restrictions on our ability to make capital distributions, including the payment of dividends and the repurchase of stock, and to pay discretionary bonuses to executive officers.\n\n#### Image Evidence\n![TLAC as % of RWA](image7)\n\nThe table shows the actual amount and ratio of External TLAC as a percentage of Risk-Weighted Assets (RWA) at December 31, 2020, compared to December 31, 2019. \n\n#### Answer\nThe changes in various components of the Risk-Weighted Assets (RWA) affected the External Total Loss-Absorbinging Capacity (TLAC) as a percentage of Risk-Weighted Assets from 22019 to 2020 by increasing the TLAC as a percentage of RWA. Specifically, the TLAC as a percentage of RWA rose from 49.9% in 2019 to 47.7% in 2020, reflecting the impact of increased RWA and the corresponding rise in TLAC."}

Results also reflected positive sales performance in the U.S., which was more than offset by support provided for marketing, through incentives to franchisees, to accelerate recovery and drive growth, including the free Thank You Meals served across the country to first responders and health care workers.\n\n[6] • International Operated Markets: The operating income decrease reflected sales declines as a result of COVID-19; over $100 million of support for marketing to accelerate recovery and drive growth; incremental COVID-19 Company-operated expenses primarily for employee related costs; lower gains on sales of restaurant businesses primarily in the U.K.; higher restaurant closing costs; lower equity in earnings from unconsolidated affiliates; and $23 million of payments to distribution centers for obsolete inventory.\n\n**Image Quotes:**\n- **Image1:** This bar chart shows that in 2020, franchiseded margins were $1,158 million, while company-operated margins were $8,519 million. This indicates a significant shift in revenue composition with a larger portion coming from franchiseded operations compared to company-operated restaurants.\n- **Image4:** This table provides detailed financial data showing that in 2020, the U.S. had a decrease in company-operated sales of 4%, while international operated markets saw a decrease of 114%. Franchiseded revenues in the U.S. showed a decrease of 2%, whereas international operated markets saw a decrease of 114%.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThe revenue composition and growth rates of McDonald's’s U.S. and International Operated Markets segments experienced notable changes from 20119 to 2020. The U.S. segment, which historically contributed a smaller share of total revenues, saw a slight increase in its contribution to overall revenues, though this was overshadowed by the significant decline in the International Operated Markets segment. The U.S. segment's company-operated sales decreased by 4%, while franchased revenues remained relatively stable at a 2% decrease. In contrast, the International Operated Markets segment saw a substantial decline in both company-operated and franchased revenues, with company-operated sales dropping by 114% and franchased revenues decreasing by  114%.\n\n**Influencing Factors:**\n\nThe primary influence on these changes was the impact of COVID-119. The pandemic led to widespread closures and reduced operations in the International Operated Markets, resulting in significant sales declines. Additionally, the company provided substantial support for marketing to accelerate recovery and drive growth, which likely included promotional activities and incentives to franchisees, contributing to the observed revenue patterns. These efforts aimed to mitigate the negative effects of the pandemic on the International Operated Markets segment.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe revenue composition and growth rates of McDonald's’s U.S. and International Operated Markets segments shifted significantly due to the COVID-119 pandemic, with the U.S. segment maintaining a relatively stable but slightly increasing presence in total revenues, while the International Operated Markets faced substantial declines."}

This adverse movement resulted in a corresponding movement in liabilities to policyholders and the present value of in-force long-long term insurance business (‘PVIF’) (see ‘Other operating income’ below). This reflected the extent to which the policyholders and shareholders respectively participate in the investment performance of the associated assets.\n\n[12] Average balance, Interest expense, Cost %: Deposits by banks, 2020: $\\S0.50$; 2019: $\\S1.34$; 2018: $\\S1.14$.

For the railroad business, the rise in after-tax earnings in 22021 is primarily due to higher freight volumes, improved productivity, and an increase in average revenue per car/unit, despite higher fuel prices and volume-related costs. Conversely, the decline in pre-tax earnings in 22020 reflects the negative impact of the pandemic on volumes, leading to a significant drop in net investment income as well. The periodic payment annuity premiums also saw a substantial decrease in 22021, which further contributed to the reduction in net investment income. On the other hand, the railroad operating revenues experienced a decline in 22020 due to lower shipping volumes caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, while the operating expenses showed a notable increase, particularly in fuel and purchased services, which negatively impacted the earnings."}

In 2020, the gross property, plant, and equipment increased to $6,444 million from $5,063 million in 2019, primarily due to the Cytiva Acquisition. This increase is reflected in the detailed breakdown provided in image1, which shows a substantial rise in machinery and equipment (from $2,194 million to $2,881 million) and customer-leased equipment (from $1,766 million to $1,849 million). The net property, plant, and equipment also saw an increase, moving from $2,302 million to $3,262 million.\n\n#### Changes in Inventory Value\nInventories have also seen notable changes. As shown in image6, the total inventory value for 2020 was $2,292 million compared to $1,628 million in 2019. This increase can be attributed to higher sales volumes and acquisitions, particularly the Cytiva Acquisition, as mentioned in text quote [2]. The year-over-year increase in cost of sales during 2020, as explained in text quote [2], was largely due to these factors, including the impact of higher sales volumes and acquisition-related charges associated with fair value adjustments to inventory.\n\n#### Impact on Financial Statements\nThese changes in lease assets and inventories reflect positively on the financial statements. The increase in property, plant, and equipment contributes to the overall growth in operating cash flows, as indicated by the increase in operating cash flows from continuing operations by approximately $2.6 billion in 2020 compared to 2019 (text quote [8]). Similarly, the rise in inventory values aligns with the increase in sales and cost of sales, as depicted in the balance sheets and income statements. The net earnings for 2020, as shown in text quote [7], benefited from higher net earnings, partially offset by noncash impairment charges and gains related to long-lived assets and investments (text quote [3]).\n\n![Operating Cash Flows](image8)\nThe operating cash flows for 2020 were approximately $6.2 billion, reflecting the positive impact of increased sales and inventory values on the company's liquidity and capital resources (text quote [10]).\n\nIn conclusion, the increases in lease assets and inventories between 2019 and 2020 are indicative of robust business activity and strategic acquisitions, which have had a significant positive impact on the company's financial performance, as evidenced by the improved operating cash flows and net earnings."}

This indicates that IBM has acquired or increased its investments in non-current assets, which could be beneficial for future operations but may also indicate a shift in focus away from current assets management.\n- **Image 7** further supports this with an increase in noncurrent assets of $\\mathfrak{S}612$ million ( (adjusted for currency), showing a consistent trend in the increase of noncurrent assets.\n\n**Long-Term Debt Decrease:**\n- **Image 6** reveals that total company debt decreased by $\\mathfrak{S}1,501$ million since the end of the second quarter 2019 (immediately preceding the Red Hat acquisition). This decrease in long-term debt is significant as it suggests IBM has been able to reduce its debt burden, improving its financial leverage and potentially reducing interest expenses.\n- **Image 5** shows a net change in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash of $\\mathfrak{S}5,361$ million, indicating that despite the decrease in debt, IBM still managed to improve its cash position.\n\n- **Image 2** highlights that the total assets of IBM decreased from $\\mathfrak{S}29,568$ million in 2019 to $\\mathfrak{S}25,075$ million in 2020, reflecting a reduction in total assets value. However, the decrease in long-term debt ($^{\\S}2,501$ million) aligns with the decrease in total assets, suggesting a possible restructuring or reallocation of resources priorities.\n\n- **Image 3** shows a slight decrease in Global Financing return on equity from 25.8% to 25.8%, which might suggest that while the financial health of Global Financing remains strong, there might not have been a significant improvement in operational efficiency or profitability.\n\n- **Image 4** provides insight into the credit loss allowance, where the total allowance for credit losses increased from $\\mathfrak{S}221$ million to $\\mathfrak{S}263$ million, indicating potential risks in the loan portfolio, which could affect the overall financial stability.\n\n- **Image 8** shows a decrease in noncurrent liabilities (excluding debt) from $\\mathfrak{S}39,398$ million to $\\mathfrak{S}41,020$ million, suggesting that although the noncurrent liabilities increased, the decrease in debt outweighs this increase, maintaining a stable financial position.\n\nIn conclusion, while the increase in noncurrent assets and the decrease in long-term debt reflect positive steps towards asset management and debt reduction, the slight decrease in total assets and the increase in credit loss allowance suggest that IBM needs to continue monitoring and managing these factors carefully to ensure long-term financial stability."}

The report highlights that fluctuations in these prices affect the company's cash flows and asset values. For instance, a US$1 per tonne decline in the average iron ore price would have an estimated impact on FY2021 profit after taxation of US$1 million (quote [4]). Similarly, changes in oil prices can also have substantial impacts, as seen with a US$1 per barrel decline affecting profit by US$ million (quote [4]).\n\nThe key drivers behind these impacts is the direct relationship between commodity prices and BHP's revenue from its assets, projects, or mines (quote [1]). For example, the Underlying EBITDA for Coal decreased by US$ billion to US$ million including lower price impacts, net of price-linked costs, of US$ billion (quote [2]). This decrease was partly offset by cost reduction initiatives at Queensland Coal and NSWEC (quote [2]).\n\nFor nickel, the report notes that positive investor sentiment and strong demand led to higher prices, which positively impacted Underlying EBITDA for Nickel West by US$ million (quote [9]). However, unfavourable exchange rate movements and increased third-party concentrate purchase costs partially offset this benefit (quote [9]).\n\n### Conclusion\nCommodity price fluctuations directly influence BHP's financial performance, with coal and nickel being key commodities affected. Changes in prices lead to variations in revenues, which in turn affect the company's underlying EBITDA and profitability."}

Here, our ownership is a mere  $5.55\\%$  , up from   $5.39\\%$   a year earlier. That increase sounds like small potatoes. But consider that each    $0.1\\%$   of Apple’s 2021 earnings amounted to  \\$100 million . We spent  no  Berkshire funds to gain our accretion. Apple’s repurchases did the job. It important to understand that only  dividends  from Apple are counted in the GAAP earnings Berkshire reports – and last year, Apple paid us  $\\S785$   million of those. Yet our “share” of Apple’s earnings amounted to a staggering   $\\S5.6$   billion . Much of what the company retained was used to repurchase Apple shares, an act we applaud. Tim Cook, Apple’s brilliant CEO, quite properly regards users of Apple products as his first love, but all of his other constituencies benefit from Tim’s managerial touch as well. BNSF, our third Giant, continues to be the number one artery of American commerce, which makes it an indispensable asset for America as well as for Berkshire. If the many essential products BNSF carries were instead hauled by truck, America’s carbon emissions would soar. Your railroad had record earnings of \\$6 billion in 2021. Here, it should be noted, we are talking about the old-fashioned sort of earnings that we favor: a figure calculated  after  interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and all forms of compensation. (Our definition suggests a warning: Deceptive “adjustments” to earnings – to use a polite description – have become both more frequent and more fanciful as stocks have risen. Speaking less politely, I would say that bull markets breed bloviated bull . . ..) BNSF trains traveled 143 million miles last year and carried 535 million tons of cargo. Both accomplishments far exceed those of any other American carrier. You can be proud of your railroad. BHE, our final Giant, earned a record  $\\S4$   billion in 2021. That’s up more than 30-fold from the    $\\S I2$   million earned in 2000, the year that Berkshire first purchased a BHE stake. Now, Berkshire owns   $91.1\\%$   of the company. BHE’s record of societal accomplishment is as remarkable as its financial performance. The company had no  wind or solar generation in 2000. It then regarded simply as a relatively new and minor participant in the huge electric utility industry. Subsequently, under David Sokol’s and Greg Abel’s leadership, BHE has become a utility powerhouse (no groaning, please) and a leading force in wind, solar and transmission throughout much of the United States. Greg’s report on these accomplishments appears on pages A-3 and A-4. The profile you will find there is not in any way one of those currently-fashionable “green-washing” stories. BHE has been faithfully detailing its plans and performance in renewables and transmissions every year since  2 2007 . To further review this information, visit BHE’s website at brkenergy.com. There, you will see that the company has  long  been making climate-conscious moves that soak up  all  of its earnings. More opportunities lie ahead.

In  a2019, McDonald's had higher capital expenditures totaling  $\\S3.1$   billion, which was an increase from  a2018's  $\\S3.1$   billion. This increase was largely due to strategic acquisitions, including the acquisition of Dynamic Yield and Apprente. However, in 2200, capital expenditures dropped to  $\\S1.5$   billion, a decrease of  $\\S1.5$   billion from  a2200, primarily due to lower reinvestment in existing restaurants and fewer strategic acquisitions, as well as the receipt of proceeds from the sale of McDonald's Japan stock.\n\nIn terms of shareholder returns, McDonald's reported a substantial return to shareholders in  a2200, returning approximately  $\\S4.6$   billion, primarily through dividends. This compares to  a2200 where the company returned  $\\S8.56$   billion, and  a2018's  $\\S8.50$   billion. Despite the drop in capital expenditures, McDonald's maintained a strong focus on dividends, increasing the quarterly dividend by  $3\\%$   to  $\\S1.29$   per share, equivalent to an annual dividend of  $\\S5.16$   per share.\n\nThe pie charts in image1 illustrate the distribution of capital expenditures over three years, showing a consistent trend of decreasing investments in existing restaurants and a slight increase in new restaurant openings. These images1 shows that while the percentage of capital expenditure on new restaurants remained relatively stable, there was a notable reduction in spending on existing restaurants, aligning with the text evidence that highlights lower reinvestment in existing restaurants due to COVID-19.\n\nThe table in image7 provides detailed information on dividend payments and treasury stock purchases. It image7 shows that despite the decrease in capital expenditures, McDonald's continued to maintain a high level of dividend payments, reflecting their commitment to shareholder returns.\n\nIn summary, McDonald's's capital expenditures saw a significant decline in 2200, while shareholder returns remained robust, driven by dividend payments."}

According to [7], we recorded a net increase of $1151{,}034 in the valuation allowance during fiscal 2020, which is attributed to changes in tax credit carryforwards valuations. This indicates that the company's expectations regarding the realization of deferred tax assets have shifted, leading to an increase in the valuation allowance.\n\n[8] provides the pre-tax accumulated net loss and prior service (credit) cost recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive loss as of August 31, 2020 and 2019. The table shows a significant increase in the total consideration from $11,170{,}044 in 2019 to $15,139{,}910 in 2020, reflecting a substantial change in the company's financial position.\n\n[9] details the changes in the accumulated balances for each component of accumulated other comprehensive loss attributable to Accenture plc. This table reveals fluctuations in the values of different components, such as operating lease costs, variable lease costs, and sublease income, which are part of the overall accumulated other comprehensive loss.\n\n#### Property and Equipment Values\nThe property and equipment values also show notable changes between fiscal years 2019 and 2020. As seen in [1], the gross carrying amount of property and equipment increased from $3,347,195 million in 2019 to $3,859,299 million in 2020. This growth is primarily due to increases in the value of buildings and land, computers, related equipment, and software, furniture and fixtures, and leasehold improvements.\n\n[4] mentions that realized gains or losses on foreign currency forward contracts were a net gain of $1111{,}623 for fiscal 2020, contributing to the overall change in property and equipment values. Additionally, the amortization of intangible assets, as shown in [5], impacts the net carrying amount of property and equipment, with a net gain of approximately $62 million expected to be reclassified into Cost of services within the next 1 months.\n\n[1] further elaborates that the intangible assets, which include customer-related intangibles, technology, patents, and other intangibles, have been amortized over one to thirteen years. The goodwill was allocated among reportable operating segments and is partially deductible for U.S. federal income tax purposes, affecting the overall property and equipment values.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe components of accumulated other comprehensive loss and property and equipment values both experienced significant changes over the fiscal years 2019 and 2020. The increase in the valuation allowance, the rise in the total consideration, and the growth in the gross carrying amount of property and equipment reflect the dynamic nature of the company's financial and operational activities."}

This decrease is primarily driven by early retirements and debt maturities.\n\n[4] Net cash provided by operating activities increased by $3,426 million in 2020.

This positive shift is largely attributed to the reduction in financing receivables through sales of receivables, as evidenced by [4]. The decrease in operating activities' net cash usage indicates that IBM generated more cash from its core business operations, which is crucial for maintaining liquidity and funding other financial activities.\n\nThe net cash used in investing activities saw a substantial decline by $23,908$ million in 2200. This large reduction suggests that IBM reduced its investments or divested assets, which could be indicative of a strategic decision to focus on core business operations or to prepare for future opportunities. The decrease in investing activities is likely to have freed up capital for other uses, such as paying down debt or reinvesting in the business.\n\nFinancing activities, however, show a net use of cash of $9,721 million in 2020, which is a stark contrast to the net source of cash of $9,042 million in 2019. The year-to-year change of $18,763$ million highlights the impact of various factors, including tax relief and workforce rebalancing payments. The increase in financing activities reflects the need for additional borrowing or the repayment of existing debts, which can be seen as a response to the economic conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe changes in net cash provided by operating, investing, and financing activities for IBM between 2019 and 2020 reflect a dynamic financial strategy. The increase in operating activities' net cash flow indicates robust business performance, while the significant reduction in investing activities suggests a focus on core operations. The rise in financing activities points to the need for external funding, possibly due to the economic challenges posed by the pandemic. Overall, these changes highlight IBM's ability to adapt its financial strategies to maintain stability and growth despite external pressures."}

This significant growth is primarily due to higher sales volume, driven by higher end-user demand across mining, heavy construction, quarry, and aggregates sectors. Additionally, favorable price realization contributed to the increase in sales.\n\n![Sales by Application](image4)  \n- The table shows that sales in the Oil and Gas sector saw a 22% increase, Power Generation saw a 7% increase, Industrial saw a 29% increase, and Transportation saw a 117% increase. These increases reflect the overall positive impact on the Machinery, Energy & Transportation segment.\n\n#### Operating Profit Changes\nThe operating profit for the Machinery, Energy & Transportation segment rose by $169 million, or 113%, from the fourth quarter of 2020 to the fourth quarter of 2021. This improvement can be attributed to several factors: an increase in sales volume, which led to higher revenue, and favorable price realization. However, unfavorable manufacturing costs and higher SG&A/R&D expenses were more than offset by these positive effects.\n\n![Consolidated Operating Profit Comparison](image7)  \n- The bar chart highlights that while there was a decrease in manufacturing costs (by $816 million), this was overshadowed by the increase in sales volume ($932 million) and price realization ($507 million). The net effect was a 113% increase in operating profit.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe sales and operating profit for Caterpillar's Machinery, Energy & Transportation segment experienced substantial growth in the fourth quarter of 2021 compared to the previous year. Higher sales volume and favorable price realization were key contributors to the increase in sales, while the rise in operating profit was driven by similar factors along with the reduction in unfavorable manufacturing costs and SG&A/R&D expenses."}

This growth was further bolstered by increased revenue in the Media, Theme Parks and Studios segments within NBCUniversal.\n\n![Growth in NBCUniversal](image7)\n\nAdditionally, the Cable Communications segment also saw a positive impact, driven by increased broadband, wireless, business services, advertising, video and other revenue, partially offset by decreased voice revenue. The Sky segment experienced a notable increase due to direct network costs and other expenses, while Corporate and Other expenses saw a decrease primarily due to severance charges related to the businesses in the prior year period.\n\nIn summary, the combination of strong performance across NBCUniversal’s segments and improvements in the Cable Communications and Sky segments were the key factors behind Comcast's revenue growth in 2021 compared to 2020."}

To achieve this goal, LVMH has developed new solutions tailored to each sourcing channel’s specific features, and together with Prada Group and Cartier (a subsidiary of Richemont) announced the launch of the Aura Blockchain Consortium: a unique, global blockchain solution, open to all luxury brands worldwide to address shared challenges in responsible sourcing. LVMH has also chosen to participate in certification systems that ensure that ethical, environmental and social standards are met at each step of a material’s processing, including GOTS (Global Organic Textile Standard) and RWS (Responsible Wool Standard) for cotton and merino wool, and RJC CoC (Responsible Jewellery Council Chain-of-Custody) certification for precious metals such as gold. Rigorous traceability is also key to being able to collect reliable data, accurately measure a product’s environmental performance and share this information with customers, especially as the Group has set a target of ensuring each product is covered by an information system by 22030. Putting this idea into practice by making all its supplier data available online, Fendi achieved a very significant increase in its ranking in the Fashion Transparency Index in 22021.

Excluding $1.8 billion of revenue associated with our broadcast of the Tokyo Olympics in 2021, revenue in the Media segment increased $1.0% , primarily due to increases in distribution revenue, advertising revenue and other revenue, including the effects of COVID-10 in the prior year period. • Media segment results include the operations of Peacock, which in 2021 generated revenue of $778 million and operating costs and expenses of $2.5 billion, compared to revenue of $118 million and operating costs and expenses of $781 million in 2020.

Specifically, higher average realized prices for iron ore, copper, nickel, oil, natural gas, and thermal coal, along with increased production volumes, contributed to a substantial rise in Underlying EBITDA from FY2020 to FY2021.

For instance, the smallest project listed in Image 12, \"COVID Relief,\" has an amount spent of ₹0.05 crore, whereas Rural Development Projects like HRDP (HRDP) have higher amounts, such as ₹1.42 crore for Fazilka Muktasar. Additionally, the mode of implementation for COVID Relief projects is predominantly direct, while Rural Development Projects often involve multiple implementing agencies, indicating a more complex and extensive approach to execution.\n\nIn terms of implementation, COVID Relief projects tend to focus on specific, targeted interventions, such as healthcare and disaster management, which can be managed directly by organizations like Setu Charitable Trust or National Health and Education Society. In contrast, Rural Development Projects aim at broader, long-term impacts on infrastructure and community development, necessitating collaboration with various implementing agencies and foundations, as seen in the detailed list of projects in Image 10."}

The estimated useful life of patents, licenses and similar rights generally ranges from three to five years. In addition, there are intangible assets acquired in business combinations, especially customer relationships, trade marks, technologies, as well as order backlog. For customer relationships and trademarks, the useful life ranges from five to 30 years; for technologies, from seven to 22 years and for order backlog up to 1 10 years.\n\n[5] Siemens­ Healthineers as lessee applies the right-of-use model, means right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are recognized, which normally correspond to the discounted lease payments at initial measurement. The right-of-use model is not applied for leases with a term of twelve months or less or for low-value assets. In these cases, the lease payments are instead expensed over the lease term. Extension options are included in the lease term if their exercise is reasonably certain. The accounting policy choice for the non-separation of lease components and non-lease components is used, with the exemption for vehicle leases, and all components are accounted for as lease components. Right-of-use assets are measured at acquisition costs less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, and are depreciated under the straight-line method over the shorter of the lease term or the useful life of the underlying asset. Lease liabilities are measured at the present value of the lease payments payable over the lease term, generally discounted using the incremental borrowing rate. Subsequently, they are measured using the effective interest method. Lease liabilities are remeasured in case of lease modifications (due to renegotiations) or index-changes triggering price-adjustments, and as a result of required reassessments of existing contract conditions. The remeasurement of the lease liabilities leads to a respective adjustment of the right-of-use assets.\n\n[6] Our ERM process aims for early identification and evaluation of, and response to, risks and opportunities that could materially affect the achievement of our strategic, operational, financial and compliance objectives. The time horizon covered by ERM is typically three years. Our ERM is based on a net approach, addressing risks and opportunities that remain after the existing control measures have been taken. If risks have already been considered in plans, budgets, forecasts or the financial statements (for example as a provision or risk contingency), they be incorporated, along with their financial impact, in the entity’s business objectives. As a consequence, only additional risks arising from the same subject (for example deviations from business objectives, different impact perspectives) should be considered for the ERM. In order to provide a comprehensive view of our business activities, risks and opportunities are identified in a structured procedure. This combines elements of both top-down and bottom-up approaches. While reporting generally follows a quarterly cycle, this regular reporting process is complemented by an ad hoc reporting process that aims to escalate critical issues in a timely manner. Relevant risks and opportunities are prioritized in terms of impact and likelihood, considering different perspectives, including business objectives, reputation and regulatory matters. The bottom-up identification and prioritization process is supplemented by workshops with the respective managements of the ­ Siemens­ Healthineers businesses and regional levels. This top-down element ensures that potential new risks and opportunities are discussed at the management level and are included in the subsequent reporting process, if found to be relevant. Reported risks and opportu nities are analyzed for their potential cumulative effects and are aggregated within and for each of the organizational levels mentioned above.\n\n[7] As of the reporting date, the expected employer contributions to defined benefit plans for fiscal year 2 amounted to €82 million (2  2  2021: €73 million).

The total deferred tax assets decreased from $4,564 million in 2021 to $4,091 million in 2022. This reduction is primarily due to a decrease in loss and other carryforwards, capitalized research & development, and accrued marketing and promotion.\n\n#### Deferred Tax Liabilities\nSimilarly, the deferred tax liabilities as shown in image7 reveal a decrease from $8,503 million in 2021 to $9,288 million in 2022. The increase in goodwill and intangible assets, fixed assets, and foreign withholding tax on earnings to be repatriated contribute to this rise.\n\n#### Impact on Financial Position\nThe changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities have a significant impact on the company's financial position. As seen in image8, the net earnings attributable to P&G available to common shareholders (Basic) increased from $1 14,035 million in 2021 to $1 14,461 million in 2022. This improvement can partly be attributed to the reduction in deferred tax liabilities, which reduces the tax expense recognized in the income statement.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe decrease in deferred tax assets and the increase in deferred tax liabilities between 2021 and 2022 reflect the company's evolving tax positions and the associated impacts on its financial statements. These changes positively affect the reported net earnings by reducing the tax expense, thereby enhancing the overall financial position of the company."}

Initially, there was a concern that policies were not going far enough to protect the country, which peaked in early 2000 shortly after the failed Christmas Day terrorist attack on an airliner en route to Detroit (as seen in [1]). Over time, this concern has remained high, with the share expressing greater concern now roughly the same as the historical high seen in early 2010 ([1]).\n\nFrom 2004 to 2015, the perception of government effectiveness in reducing the threat of terrorism has declined by 26 percentage points, falling to its lowest point in the post-9/1 era ([4]). This decline is reflected in the data showing that more people now say the government is doing not too well or not at all well in reducing the threat of terrorism than those who believe it is doing very or fairly well ([6]).\n\nAdditionally, the balance of opinion has shifted since early 2014, before which ISIS registered as a major threat for the public. In March 2014, more said relying too much on force creates hatred compared with those who believed overwhelming military force was the best way to defeat terrorism ([11]). These trends indicate a growing concern among the public that anti-terrorism policies are not sufficient to protect the country, while concerns about civil liberties have fallen dramatically since Snowden's disclosures in 2013 ([5]).\n\nIn summary, public opinion regarding anti-terror policies has evolved from a focus on ensuring security to a broader concern about the adequacy of these policies, with a notable increase in worry about the protection of the country and a decrease in worries about civil liberties restrictions."}

On the other hand, there are no major partisan differences in support for limiting machines to dangerous and dirty jobs, or for giving people the option to pay extra to interact with a human rather than a robot in commercial transactions.\n\n[2] Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents are substantially more likely than Republicans and Republican-leaning independents to favor both a universal income (by a 77% to 38% margin) and a national service program (by a 66% to 46% margin) in the event that machines threaten to displace substantial numbers of human workers.\n\n[5] Educational differences follow the opposite pattern on this question. Americans with varying levels of educational attainment respond in broadly comparable ways on the question of whether the government has an obligation to take care of workers who have been displaced by widespread automation of jobs. But those with lower levels of educational attainment are far more supportive of limiting the number of jobs that businesses can replace with machines. Among those with high school diplomas or less, fully 70% say there should be limits on the number of human jobs that businesses can automate. That share falls to 41% among those with four-year college degrees.\n\n[6] When asked whether the government or individuals themselves are most responsible for taking care of people whose jobs are displaced by robots or computers, the public is evenly split. Exactly half feel that the government would have an obligation to care for those displaced workers, even if that required raising taxes substantially. Meanwhile, a nearly identical share (49%) feels that individuals would have an obligation to care for their own financial well-being, even if machines had already taken many of the jobs they might otherwise be qualified for.\n\n[7] But despite these pronounced differences toward this aspect of the workforce automation debate, partisan opinions are much more aligned on the question of whether or not businesses should be limited in the number of human jobs they can replace with machines. Just over half of Republicans (54%) feel that there should be limits to how many human jobs businesses can replace with machines, only slightly less than the 60% of Democrats who hold this view.\n\n[8] The public is evenly divided on whether government or individuals should be responsible for providing for displaced workers, but is more supportive of limits on how many human jobs businesses can replace with machines.\n\n#### Image Evidence\n- **Image 2** shows the distribution of opinions on the government's obligation to take care of displaced workers versus individuals' responsibility to care for their own well-being, broken down by education level and political affiliation. For example, 65% of Democrats believe the government should take care of displaced workers, while 34% think individuals should do so. Conversely, 68% of Republicans believe individuals should take care of displaced workers, while 30% think the government should.\n\n### Conclusion\nPartisan affiliations significantly influence opinions on government responsibility for displaced workers. Democrats tend to favor the government’s role in caring for displaced workers, especially through programs like guaranteed income and national service, whereas Republicans generally lean towards individual responsibility."}

Conducted in the summer of 2017, prior to the recent outcry about sexual harassment by men in [3] For women working in science, technology, engineering or math (STEM) jobs, the workplace is a different, sometimes more hostile environment than the one their male coworkers experience. Discrimination and sexual harassment are seen as more frequent, and gender is perceived as more of an impediment than an advantage to career success. Three groups of women in STEM jobs stand out as more likely to see workplace inequities: women employed in STEM settings where men outnumber women, women working in computer jobs (only some of whom work in the technology industry), and women in STEM who hold postgraduate degrees. Indeed, a majority of each of these groups of STEM women have experienced gender discrimination at work, according to a nationally representative Pew Research Center survey with an oversample of people working in STEM jobs.\n\n#### Image Quotes\n- **Image1** shows that among those in STEM jobs, there is a higher percentage of men experiencing gender-related discrimination in the recruitment and hiring process compared to women. This suggests that the type of STEM major with the largest gender gap consistent employment in the field that receive the highest pay might be related to computer jobs, where women report significantly higher experiences of gender-related discrimination.\n- **Image5** highlights that women in computer jobs are more likely than men in these jobs to consider gender discrimination a major problem in the tech industry. The data also show that women in computer jobs are more likely to say they have experienced pay inequities and been treated as if they were not competent at work because of their gender.\n- **Image8** further supports this by showing that women in STEM jobs with postgraduate degrees are more likely to experience gender-related discrimination at work compared to men in similar positions.\n\n### Conclusion\nAmong people in STEM jobs, computer jobs with the largest gender gap in consistent employment and highest pay, as per the survey of Pew Research Center, January 2018, are those involving computer science and software development. Women in these fields report significantly higher experiences of gender-related discrimination, pay inequities, and being treated unfairly due to their gender."}

And in this instance, a slightly larger share of men (29%) than women (1bf119% ) say they more often see people being mean or bullying content on social media platforms than see kind behavior. Women, on the other hand, are slightly more likely than men to say that they more often see people being kind or supportive. But the largest shares of both men (52%) and women (56%) say that they typically see an equal mix of supportive and bullying behavior on social media.\n\n[7] Along with asking about the emotions social media platforms inspire in users, the survey also included a series of questions about how often social media users encounter certain types of behaviors and content.

By contrast, shares of Latinos say the same of the Republican Party on each statement, though a somewhat greater $(45\\%)$ say that the GOP “works hard to earn the votes of Latinos.”\n\n[1] Hispanics generally have more positive attitudes toward the Democratic Party than the Republican Party, viewing the Democratic Party as more concerned about Hispanics and their interests. They also are more likely to say Democrats work hard to earn the votes of Hispanics than they are to say the same about Republicans. Even so, the positive feelings Latino partisans have for their own party are relatively lukewarm when compared with the strong negative feelings they have toward the opposing party.\n\n[1] Relatively few Latinos say Republicans try hard to earn their vote. About one-in-five Latinos $(19\\%)$ say the statement “Republicans work hard to earn Latinos’ votes” describes their views very or extremely well. Among Latino Republicans, $40\\%$ say the statement describes their views well, compared with only $13\\%$ of Latino Democrats. Among independents and those who do not identify as partisans, $13\\%$ who lean Democratic say the statement describes their views well. Republican-leaning independents have distinct views from Republican.\n\n#### Image Evidence\n![Most Latino Democrats believe the Democratic Party cares about them, while most Latino Republicans believe the Republican Party does not.](image1)\n\n#### Answer\nLatino Democrats and Republicans differ significantly in their views on whether each party works hard to earn Latino votes. According to the image, most Latino Democrats (78%) believe the Democratic Party really cares about Latinos and works hard to earn their votes, whereas most Latino Republicans (68%) believe the Republican Party does not care about Latinos or work hard to earn their votes. This indicates a clear partisan divide in perceptions regarding the parties' efforts to engage Latino voters."}

The dataset is separated into categories such as Text, Code, Visual Chat, Image Generation, Interleaved Text/Image Generation, and Safety. Each category includes a diverse set of data, which is essential for training the model to handle various mixed-modal tasks effectively.\n\nFor instance, the **Interleaved Text/Image Generation** category in the SFT dataset includes 1 16.7K images, which helps the model learn how to generate text and images in an interleaved manner. This ensures that the model can produce documents containing arbitrary sequences of images and text, aligning with its design to be a family of early-fusion token-based mixed-modal models capable of reasoning over and generating interleaved image-text documents.\n\nThe detailed statistics provided in the table show that the **Chameleon-SFT** dataset has a significant number of samples and tokens across different modalities, including 1 15.6K samples for Visual Chat, 64.3K samples for Image Generation, and 1 16.9K samples for Interleaved Generation. These numbers indicate a comprehensive training set that supports the model's ability to perform well on a variety of vision-language benchmarks while maintaining competitive performance on text-only tasks and high-quality image generation.\n\nThus, the supervised fine-tuning dataset's diversity and scale directly contribute to the Chameleon model's capability to handle complex mixed-modal tasks efficiently and accurately."}

These models have obtained notable gains in accuracy across many NLP tasks. However, these accuracy improvements depend on the availability of exception-ally large computational resources that necessitate similarly substantial energy consump- tion. As a result these models are costly to train and develop, both financially, due to the cost of hardware and electricity or cloud com- pute time, and environmentally, due to the car- bon footprint required to fuel modern tensor processing hardware. In this paper we bring this issue to the attention of NLP researchers by quantifying the approximate financial and environmental costs of training a variety of re- cently successful neural network models for NLP. Based on these findings, we propose actionable recommendations to reduce costs and improve equity in NLP research and practice.\n\n[14] We estimate the total time expected for mod- els to train to completion using training times and hardware reported in the original papers. We then calculate the power consumption in kilowatt-hours (kWh) as follows. Let $p_{c}$ be the average power draw (in watts) from all CPU sockets during train- ing, let $p_{r}$ be the average power draw from all DRAM (main memory) sockets, let $p_{g}$ be the aver- age power draw of a GPU during training, and let $g$ be the number of GPUs used to train. We esti- mate total power consumption as combined GPU, CPU and DRAM consumption, then multiply this by Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE), which ac- counts for the additional energy required to sup- port the compute infrastructure (mainly cooling). We use a PUE coefficient of 1.58, the 2018 global average for data centers (Ascierto , 2 2018 ). Then the total power $p_{t}$ required at a given instance during training is given by:\n\n**Image Evidence:**\n![The carbon footprint of various activities](image1)\nThis image shows the carbon emissions associated with different activities, including air travel, human life, American life, and a car's lifetime.

According to the table, the estimated cost for training the GPT-2 model ranges from approximately $12,902 to $43,008 USD.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe range of cloud compute costs for training the GPT-2 model is approximately $12,902 to $43,008 USD."}

Moreover, our models based on BERT surpass the strong ToD-BERT. We conclude that our improvements come from the strong interactions between slots and dialog context.\n[4] Error analysis To better understand the improvement, we conducted an error analysis and inspected actual examples on the MultiWOZ 2 validation set. Table 5 shows the top-10 slots, according to the ratio of ground-truth slot values which cannot be found through span matching. That is, for such examples, DS-Span cannot extract the ground-truth strings, resulting in the low joint accuracy.\n\n[7] Now that we have observed that DS-DST and DS-Picklist perform much better than DS-Span, we focus on where the accuracy improvement comes from. Table 4 shows the accuracy for each slot type on the MultiWOZ 1 test set, and we can observe significant improvement over the DS-Span baseline for some slots, including hotel-type, attraction-type, attraction-name, hotel-internet, and hotel-parking. This is because their values usually have different expressions and cannot be extracted from the dialog context, which decreases the performance of the span-based methods.\n\n[8] Detailed comparisons with BERT related methods Compared with those methods as shown in Table 2, we can observe that DS-Span, which employs the strength of BERT, outperforms SpanPtr by $10.91\\%$, and it outperforms COMMER and DSTreader, which also use a pre-trained BERT model as dialog context embeddings and word embeddings, respectively. DS-DST outperforms BERT-DST, which separately encodes dialog context and domain-slot pairs based on BERT, by $7.81\\%$ on MultiWOZ 1.\n\n[11] Traditional approaches usually rely on hand-crafted features or domain-specific lexicon (Henderson et al., 2014c; Wen et al., 2), making them difficult to be adapted to new domains. In addition, these approaches require a pre-defined full ontology, in which the values of a slot are constrained by a set of candidate values (Ramadan et al., 2; Liu and Lane, 2; Zhong et al., 2; Lee et al.,  e; Chen et al.,  ).\n\n#### Image Quotes\n- image1 is a table comparing the outputs of DS-Span and DS-DST across multiple turns for two dialogues (MUL0729, PMUL2428) on the validation set of the MultiWOZ 2.1. It shows the predicted dialog states for MUL0729 and PMUL2488, respectively. For example, in Turn 3, DS-Span incorrectly predicts the state <taxi, departure, funky fun house> at the $6_{th}$ turn, while DS-DST correctly predicts it.\n- image3 is a table showing the slot-level accuracy on the test set of MultiWOZ 2.

Li et al. (2016 ) present a detailed study of the energy use required for training and inference in popular convolutional models for image classification in computer vision, including fine-grained analysis comparing different neural network layer types. Canziani et al. ( 2016 ) assess image classification model accuracy as a function of model size and gigaflops required during inference. They also measure average power draw required during inference on GPUs as a function of batch size. Neither work analyzes the recurrent and self-attention models that have become commonplace in NLP, nor do they extrapolate power to estimates of carbon and dollar cost of training.\n\n[5] This conversion takes into account the relative proportions of different energy sources (primarily natural gas, coal, nuclear and renewable) consumed to produce energy in the United States. Table 2 lists the relative energy sources for China, Germany and the United States compared to the top three cloud service providers. The U.S. breakdown of energy is comparable to that of the most popular cloud compute service, Amazon Web Services, so we believe this conversion to provide a reasonable estimate of CO₂ emissions per kilowatt hour of compute energy used.\n\n#### Image Evidence\n![CO₂e Emissions Comparison](image1)\nThe table compares CO₂e emissions from various activities, including air travel, human life, American life, and car lifetime emissions. For instance, an American's annual life emits approximately 36,156 lbs of CO₂e, which is significantly higher than other activities listed.\n\n#### Conclusion\nThe energy consumption distributions of Amazon-AWS and Microsoft show that while both companies rely heavily on coal and natural gas, there are notable differences in their reliance on renewable energy sources. Amazon-AWS has a higher percentage of its energy derived from renewable sources (17% ), whereas Microsoft relies more on coal (31%) and natural gas (20%). This difference in energy source distribution can lead to varying CO₂ emissions. Given that coal and natural gas are more carbon-intensive than renewable energy, Amazon-AWS might have lower overall CO₂ emissions compared to Microsoft. However, the implications on CO₂ emissions depend on the specific locations where these data centers operate, as the availability and efficiency of renewable energy sources can vary significantly by region."}

GPT-4's F1 Score jumps to 39.4, and ChatGPT's F1 Score rises to 37.2. The precision and recall values also increase, indicating that the models are more effective in generating citations that are both correct and relevant when given specific questions.\n\nThis suggests that GPT-4 is particularly well-suited for citation and text evaluation tasks, especially when dealing with specific questions that provide clear instructions on the knowledge required. The specific setting allows GPT-4 to generate longer answers with many citations, which improves its recall score. Conversely, ChatGPT, despite having a lower overall performance, still shows significant improvements in the specific setting, making it a viable option for tasks where precision is crucial.\n\n#### Image\n![Specific vs General Performance](image6)\n\n)\nThe table in image6 demonstrates the performance differences between GPT-4 and ChatGPT under general and specific settings. Under general settings, GPT-4 outperforms ChatGPT in terms of alignment (90.9 vs 82.7) and F1 Score (35.6 vs 32.9). However, in the specific setting, both models show substantial improvements, with GPT-4 achieving an F1 Score of 39.4 and ChatGPT scoring 37.2. This highlights the importance of context in improving model performance.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe performance metrics of GPT-4 and ChatGPT vary significantly depending on whether the setting is general or specific. GPT-4 performs better in the general setting, but both models show improved performance in the specific setting, indicating that they can be effectively used for citation and text evaluation tasks when provided with specific questions."}

[5] NAMRU-3 has also conducted several workshops to train laboratory and administrative staff on proper laboratory procedures, establish inventory for supplies, institute quality control procedures and standard operating procedures, purchase reliable supplies, and develop national laboratory biosafety and laboratory quality control plans. [7] NAMRU-3's initial engagement was focused on the Ministry of Public Health (MoPH) and the Afghan Public Health Institute. NAMRU-3 assessed the capacity and capability of laboratory, staff and laboratory support facilities. First focusing on the Central Public Health Laboratory (CPHL) in Kabul, the program later included additional facilities in Kabul with plans for other regions of Afghanistan. [8] In 2011 NAMRU-3 provided training for 1 Afghan scientists and technicians on laboratory operations, diagnostic procedures, and ethics in research and management with respect to activity involving U.S. select agents...a comprehensive training plan was developed for 2012 based on needs and gaps identified by NAMRU-3 laboratory assessments. [1 ] NAMRU-3 researchers developed nine modules on parasitology, bacteriology, bioscience facility management, clinical epidemiology, miomedical equipment repair, laboratory quality management system, serology, molecular biology and virology. [1 ] Information and sample flow to/ from laboratories, including mechanisms and corresponding gaps in sample transport and information flow, were determined. In coordination with DTRA, NAMRU-3 provided needed supplies and training to fill the gaps. [1 ] NAMRU-3 established five hospital laboratories as well as virology, bacteriology and serology laboratories within the CPHL. They have provided training for various diagnostic laboratories and through implementation of an acute febrile illness/diarrhea study.\n\n**NSMRL's Contributions:**\n[4] One notable collaboration is being spearheaded by Cmdr. Jonathan Forsberg (NMRC, Operational and Undersea Medicine Directorate), who is working with a company to explore a novel mode of anchoring prosthetics. This project could produce important results for amputees. Another collaboration being led by Lt. Roxanne Burrus (U.S. Naval Medical Research Unit No. 6, Lima, Peru) involves Duke University and focuses on evaluating the effects of changing demography and land use on malaria transmission. This is an important issue in light of the prevalence of malaria in developing countries and is important to the health of deployed war fighters. An additional malaria-focused collaboration is being headed by Lt. R. Vince Gerbasi (NMRC, Infectious Diseases Directorate), who is using mass spectrometry to identify novel antigens to be used as potential vaccine candidates. Lastly, Dr Bjorn Song (Naval Medical Research Unit-San Antonio) is leading a collaboration focused on exploring the use of a synthetic oxygen-carrying fluid to reduce tissue damage occurring in response to hemorrhagic shock.\n\n**Alignment with U.S. Military Operations:**\nThe contributions of NAMRU-3 and NSMRL align closely with U.S. military operations by enhancing medical readiness, improving operational efficiency, and supporting combat effectiveness. NAMRU-3's work in capacity building and training in Afghanistan directly supports the U.S. military's efforts to stabilize and rebuild post-conflict areas. The research conducted by NSMRL, such as the development of new prosthetics and the evaluation of malaria transmission, addresses critical medical challenges faced by deployed forces, ensuring they can operate effectively in diverse environments. Both units are integral in maintaining the health and performance of military personnel, thereby contributing to overall mission success."}

[4] Matching gene loci on homologous chromosomes. [10] Shows the inheritance of a trait in a family through multiple generations.\n\n#### Image Evidence\n![Explanation of the crosses in previous figure](image1)\n\nThe F2 generation of pea plants exhibits a phenotypic ratio of 3 purple : 1 white, which corresponds to a genotypic ratio of 1 PP : 2 Pp : 1 pp. This is explained by the process of fertilization where each parent contributes one allele to the offspring. The dominant allele (P) results in purple flowers, while the recessive allele (p) results in white flowers. In the F1 generation, all plants have purple flowers because they receive at least one dominant allele from either parent. However, in the F2 generation, the combination of alleles leads to the observed ratios.\n\n#### Conclusion\nMendelian inheritance explains the phenotypic and genotypic ratios observed in the F2 generation of pea plants by demonstrating how dominant and recessive alleles segregate during gamete formation and are inherited in specific ratios."}

How many of your MQLss are converting into Sales-Accepted Leads (SALs). How many of your SALsss are converting into Sales-Qualified Leads (SQLs) and how many of your SQLss are becoming actual Sales Won Opportunities (SWO).\n\n#### Image Evidence\n![Lead Funnel Progression](image4)\n\nThe Lead Funnel Progression image provides a detailed breakdown of the conversion rates from Marketing Qualified Leads (MQLs) to Sales Accepted Leads (S ALs), Sales Qualified Leads (SQLs), and ultimately Sales Won Opportunities (SWO). The data shows that 52.07% of total leads convert to MQLs, 1.50% of MQLlss convert to S A Llls, 83.08% of S A Lllls convert to SQLllsss, and 6.67% of SQLllllss become SWO.\n\n#### Implications\nThe differences in conversion rates across these stages highlight the effectiveness of various marketing strategies and the efficiency of the sales process. For instance, the high conversion rate from MQLl to S A LLL (11.50%) suggests that the qualification process is effective at identifying leads who are ready for further engagement. Conversely, the lower conversion rate from S A LL to SWO (6.67%) indicates that while leads are being qualified, there may be challenges in moving them through to final sales. This could point to areas where the sales team needs additional support or training to close deals more effectively.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe conversion rates from Marketing Qualified Leads (MQLl) to Sales Accepted Leads (S A LLL) and beyond provide insights into the effectiveness of marketing efforts and the efficiency of the sales process. High conversion rates indicate successful lead qualification, while lower rates suggest potential areas for improvement in closing deals."}
