Views are more divided among those ages 50 and older, with half (50%) saying Muslims should be subject to more scrutiny [1].\n\n![A bar chart shows that younger age groups and racial/ethnic minorities are more likely to perceive additional scrutiny based on religion, while political affiliation and religious groups also show varied perceptions of scrutiny.](image2)\n\nRacial and ethnic minorities are also more likely than whites to reject the idea of scrutinizing Muslims based on religion, with 74% of blacks and 66% of Hispanics opposing it, compared with a narrower majority (57%) of whites [10]. Among religious groups, majorities in most say Muslims should not face more scrutiny, though white evangelicals are an exception and are divided (50% favor more scrutiny, 43% oppose) [7].\n\nThe differing views on scrutinizing Muslims correlate with the perceived importance of terrorism as a national issue, which also shows partisan divides [4].\n\n![A table shows that Republicans prioritize Defense/National Security, Terrorism, and ISIS significantly more than Democrats and Independents do.](image4)\n\nFour-in-ten (41%) Republicans mention terrorism, defense issues and national security, or ISIS as the most important problem facing the nation, while fewer independents (28%) and Democrats (23%) cite these issues [4]. The perceived importance of terrorism and national security issues saw a significant increase between 2014 and 2015 [image5], coinciding with these discussions. The group most likely to prioritize terrorism as a national problem (Republicans, particularly conservatives) is also the group most likely to support greater scrutiny of Muslims.\n\nPerceptions of scrutiny of Muslims differ significantly by political party, age, and race, with Republicans (especially conservatives), older individuals, and whites more likely to support or perceive greater scrutiny, while Democrats, younger people, and minorities are less likely to support it. This aligns with Republicans prioritizing terrorism and national security issues more highly than Democrats and Independents."}

This stark divergence is clearly illustrated in the provided data, showing 60% of the U.S. public in favor compared to only 34% of the German public. ![U.S. and German opinions diverge sharply on whether their country should defend a NATO ally.](image1)\n\nBeyond specific treaty obligations, Americans are generally more inclined than Germans to view the use of military force as necessary to maintain global order [6]. Roughly eight-in-ten Americans feel force is sometimes necessary, whereas only about half of Germans agree [6]. This broader difference in perspective is reflected in another survey comparison, where 78% of U.S. respondents agreed with a statement, compared to only 47% of German respondents. ![A higher percentage of Americans than Germans agree with an unspecified statement or question.](image3) Ideologically, those on the right in both nations are more likely to find military force necessary, but the percentage among American conservatives (nine-in-ten) is higher than that among German adults on the right (nearly six-in-ten) [4].\n\nRegarding the U.S. military presence in Germany, Americans perceive the bases as considerably more important to U.S. security interests (85%) than Germans view them as important to German national security (about half) [3, 5].\n\nDifferences also emerge concerning defense spending [2]. Fewer Americans now feel their European allies need to increase national defense spending compared to 2017 [2, 8]. In 2019, half of Americans thought allies' spending levels should remain the same [2]. This represents a shift from 2017, when 45% felt allies should dedicate more resources [2]. Republican support for increased European allied defense budgets has fallen by 14 percentage points between 2017 and 2019 [7]. ![Americans' support for increased European allied defense spending has decreased since 2017, while their preference for keeping it the same has increased.](image4) This trend is mirrored across U.S. political affiliations, though Republicans remain more likely to favor increases than Democrats [7]. ![Support for increasing European allied defense spending has declined among both Republican and Democrat affiliations in the U.S. between 2017 and 2019.](image5) Germans, on the other hand, are divided on whether their *own* country's defense spending should increase or stay the same, with about four-in-ten holding each view in 2019 [8, 10]. This is a change from 2017 when about half were content with spending levels and about a third felt it should increase [10]. ![Germans are divided on whether their national defense spending should increase or stay the same, a shift from 2017 when maintaining levels was preferred by a majority.](image4)\n\nIn summary, Americans are more inclined than Germans to support defending NATO allies, view military force as necessary, and see U.S. bases in Germany as crucial for U.S. security, while opinions on defense spending differ, with fewer Americans prioritizing allied increases and Germans being divided on their own spending levels."}

Overall, only 24% of respondents reported doing promotions to customers over Wi-Fi, with General Merchandise & Specialty being the most active sector at 31% using this method, compared to Food, Drug, Conv, Mass (11%) and Hospitality (15%). `![The horizontal bar chart displays the percentage of respondents across overall sectors and specific sectors (General Merchandise & Specialty, Food, Drug, Conv, Mass, and Hospitality) who answer Yes or No to doing promotions over Wi-Fi.](image4)` This usage can impact customer experience [7] and potentially lend itself to customer loyalty and increases in sales [5]. Wi-Fi can also potentially feed information into systems like POS, CRM, and loyalty programs [3].\n\nTo understand and leverage Wi-Fi usage, analytics are crucial [2]. Stores commonly track various metrics regarding in-store Wi-Fi usage. The most frequently used analytics include traffic counting (56%), guest Wi-Fi session duration (49%), and the types of devices customers use (49%). Other common analytics involve identifying hotspots in the store (41%), monitoring loyalty/repeat visits (39%), tracking time spent in the store (39%), social media conversions (37%), times of use (32%), sales conversion by Wi-Fi (27%), and demographics (17%). `![The bar chart illustrates the percentage of respondents using in-store Wi-Fi for various analytics purposes, listing metrics such as traffic counting, session duration, device usage, hotspots, loyalty, time in store, social media conversions, times of use, sales conversion, and demographics.](image3)` Beyond these general metrics, stores may also gain a full understanding of bandwidth usage at the application level for each location [9].\n\nDifferent sectors vary in their provision of customer Wi-Fi access and the use of promotions over Wi-Fi, while common analytics used to assess Wi-Fi usage include traffic counting, session duration, and device usage."}

While Data ARPU was expected to eventually rise as users consumed more data on their smartphones, it initially fell in the short term during this transition period [2]. The market had also previously experienced a massive price war, initiated by the government [9] and influenced by CDMA operators forcing GSM operators to reduce tariffs [3], which had already driven tariffs down [10], contributing to the overall lower ARPU environment.\n\nBetween 2013 and 2014, Telkomsel and XL saw an increase in smartphone users, while ARPU trends generally declined, primarily due to the shift from traditional Voice/SMS to data-based communication and the lingering effects of price competition."}

By combining retrieved paragraphs from all steps guided by the reasoning program, it outperforms one-step retrieval on all datasets, with a significant improvement of 37.1% on HOVER 4-hop [5].

Notably, no syntactic errors were found, indicating that the program generator (Codex) is effective at producing executable programs through few-shot in-context learning [7]. Errors are primarily categorized as semantic errors or incorrect execution [2]. Semantic errors, which include issues with arguments, structure, and sub-task calls, and incorrect execution contribute to prediction failures [2]. As the complexity of the claims increases (from 2-hop to 4-hop), the proportion of semantic errors rises significantly, especially structural errors, highlighting the difficulty in generating appropriate step-by-step reasoning strategies for claims requiring long-chain reasoning [8]. Conversely, the proportion of incorrect execution errors decreases as claim complexity increases, as seen in the error breakdown table [Image1]. For instance, semantic errors jump from 29% for 2-hop to 77% for 4-hop, while incorrect execution drops from 71% to 23% over the same range ![A table detailing the proportion of different error types (Syntax, Semantic including Token, Structure, Subtask, and Incorrect Execution) for ProgramFC on 2-hop, 3-hop, and 4-hop fact-checking tasks.](image1).\n\nAn example of a predicted program for a complex claim illustrates the sequence of answer and fact verification steps that are analyzed for such errors ![A table showing a complex claim and the step-by-step predicted program with verification steps and a final label prediction.](image2).

However, semantic errors, which include issues with arguments, structure, and subtask calls, rise sharply with complexity. Specifically, semantic errors constitute 29% of errors for 2-hop claims, increasing to 38% for 3-hop, and reaching 77% for 4-hop claims [Image 3]. Within semantic errors, structural errors, where the model fails to generate the appropriate step-by-step reasoning or parse the claim correctly, become particularly prevalent for 4-hop claims [5, Image 3]. Conversely, incorrect execution, where the generated program is correct but fails during the execution step, is the dominant error type for 2-hop claims (71%), decreasing to 62% for 3-hop, and significantly dropping to 23% for 4-hop claims [2, Image 3].

Generally, both open-source encoder-decoder and decoder-only LLMs do not achieve very promising results on SciTab, showing a large gap from human performance [3].

Comparing Llama 2 base models to other open-source models like Llama 1, MPT, and Falcon on standard academic benchmarks [8], the Llama 2 models generally show improved performance. For instance, Llama 2 70B improves results on MMLU and BBH compared to Llama 1 65B by approximately 5 and 8 points, respectively [1]. Llama 2 7B and 30B models surpass MPT models of similar size on all categories except code benchmarks, and outperform Falcon models of corresponding sizes on all categories [1].\n\n![The table compares MPT, Falcon, LLaMA 1, and LLaMA 2 models by size and performance across various benchmarks like Code, Commonsense Reasoning, World Knowledge, and aggregated scores for MMLU, BBH, and AGI Eval.](image5)\n\nAcross all open-source models evaluated, the Llama 2 70B model demonstrates superior performance [1]. In addition to open-source models, comparisons were made against closed-source models [3]. On a series of helpfulness and safety benchmarks using human evaluations [10], Llama 2-Chat models typically perform better than existing open-source models and appear to be on par with some closed-source models [2, 4].\n\n![The table presents a comparison of GPT-3.5, GPT-4, PaLM, PaLM-2-L, and LLaMA 2 on benchmarks including MMLU, TriviaQA, Natural Questions, GSM8K, HumanEval (coding), and BIG-Bench Hard with specific performance scores for each.](image2)\n\nSpecifically, the Llama 2 70B model is close to GPT-3.5 and PaLM (540B) on benchmarks like MMLU and GSM8K [3, Image 2]. For example, Llama 2 scored 68.9 on MMLU (5-shot) compared to GPT-3.5's 70.0 and PaLM's 69.3, and 56.8 on GSM8K (8-shot) compared to GPT-3.5's 57.1 and PaLM's 56.5 [Image 2]. Llama 2 70B results are on par with or better than PaLM (540B) on almost all benchmarks listed in Table 4 [3]. However, there is a notable gap on coding benchmarks (like HumanEval), where Llama 2 scored 29.9 compared to GPT-3.5's 48.1 and GPT-4's 67.0 [3, Image 2]. Furthermore, Llama 2 70B still shows a large performance gap compared to top models like GPT-4 and PaLM-2-L [3, 4, Image 2]. Llama 2-Chat also shows significant improvements in safety metrics. Fine-tuned Llama 2-Chat drastically improves over the pretrained model in terms of truthfulness and toxicity, achieving the lowest toxicity level among all compared models [6].

The F1-Score also exhibits an upward trend [5]. This behavior implies that the LLMs, aided by the 'Conscious Incompetence' setting, have some ability to identify absent knowledge, leading to more accurate localization of missing information as coverage worsens [5]. This setting becomes increasingly crucial when the knowledge graph coverage problem is more serious [3], [5].\n\nShifting focus to 'Retrieval Analysis', experiments simulate decreasing retrieval accuracy by replacing correct knowledge graphs with irrelevant ones [1]. The results for citation quality are evaluated across varying levels of accuracy [1].\n\n![Line graph showing Precision, Recall, F1, and Correctness decreasing as retrieval accuracy drops.](image5)\n\nAs retrieval accuracy drops, all metrics including precision, recall, and F1 score show clear downward trends [10]. The impact of poor retrieval quality is notably more significant on recall compared to precision [10]. This suggests that models have some capacity to filter out incorrect knowledge retrieved (less impact on precision), but recall is heavily dependent on the availability of the correct, relevant knowledge, which is lost when retrieval accuracy is low [10]. The ability to retrieve accurate information plays a crucial role in generating high-quality attributed texts [3].\n\nIn summary, in the 'Conscious Incompetence' setting, precision increases and recall remains stable as knowledge is removed, indicating the model's ability to identify missing information; in 'Retrieval Analysis', precision, recall, and F1 all decrease as retrieval accuracy drops, showing the critical dependence on providing correct knowledge for accurate citation."}

This highlights a fundamental challenge in their reasoning abilities [8]. A promising approach to mitigate this is to explicitly provide LLMs with logical constraints [8]. Incorporating relevant logic is particularly helpful for improving performance on reasoning tasks [3]. Conversely, introducing irrelevant logic can lead to unstable or fluctuating results [3, 6].\n\nStrategies to integrate logic include retrieval-based methods, which obtain relevant logic from a pre-defined set of constraints [1]. These constraints can be incorporated iteratively in multi-turn conversations, which has been shown to gradually decrease logical inconsistency [2]. Generative-based approaches, which encourage LLMs to produce logical constraints during reasoning, have also led to significant performance improvements [4]. Additionally, pre-training LLMs on datasets specifically designed for complex logical reasoning based on logical constraints can greatly enhance their performance, especially compared to baselines without such constraints [5, 9].\n\nEvaluations on datasets like MAVEN-ERE and Causal-TimeBank show the quantitative impact of logical constraints.\n![The table shows Micro-F1 and Logical Inconsistency scores for various models on MAVEN-ERE, Causal-TimeBank, and ProofWriter, indicating performance changes with different configurations including logical constraints.](image1)\nComparing performance metrics across different configurations reveals that models often achieve higher Micro-F1 scores and lower Logical Inconsistency when logical constraints are applied, whether using all or retrieved constraints [image3]. Pre-trained models like Vicuna-13B-PT and Llama2-13B-PT, when utilizing logical constraints alongside techniques like Chain-of-Thought (CoT), show marked improvements over configurations using only vanilla ICL or CoT [image5].\n\nBeyond just logical constraints, the number of demonstration samples provided to the model also influences performance [7]. As the number of demonstrations increases, there is typically an improvement in Micro-F1 scores [7].\n![The graph shows that for MAVEN-ERE and CTB datasets, Micro-F1 performance increases with more demonstration samples, and adding logical constraints provides a further boost.](image4)\nCrucially, the addition of logical constraints provides stable improvements in performance across varying numbers of demonstration samples [7, image4]. In some cases, combining logical constraints with a smaller number of demonstrations can even surpass the performance achieved with a larger number of demonstrations alone, without logical constraints [7]. This synergy suggests that providing LLMs with both illustrative examples (\"What\") and the underlying logical rules (\"How\") is effective for enhancing their reasoning capabilities on tasks like MAVEN-ERE and Causal-TimeBank [7].\n\nThe use of logical constraints and demonstration samples positively affects model performance on the MAVEN-ERE and Causal-TimeBank datasets, leading to improved Micro-F1 and reduced logical inconsistency, with logical constraints offering stable benefits and enhancing the effectiveness of demonstrations."}

Addressing this challenge involves teaching LLMs logical reasoning through various approaches [10]. This study investigates strategies like incorporating logical constraints and applying post-processing to improve consistency in tasks such as event relation extraction [3, 4].\n\nWhen evaluating LLMs on datasets like MAVEN-ERE and Causal-TimeBank, incorporating logical constraints into instructions can provide stable improvements [2]. Specifically, a retrieval-based approach to obtain and incorporate logical constraints into LLM instructions greatly reduces the logical inconsistency of the answers and improves overall performance on both tasks [8]. For instance, iterative retrieval, which incorporates logical constraints iteratively, shows that logical inconsistency of answers gradually decreases with more iterations, although overall performance might remain stable due to potential overthinking [7]. This reduction in logical inconsistency using logical constraints is evident in performance metrics [7]. ![The graph shows that logical inconsistency decreases with the number of iterations when using iterative retrieval with logical constraints, while Micro-F1 remains relatively stable.](image5)\n\nHowever, post-processing offers a more definitive solution for eliminating logical inconsistencies. As demonstrated in evaluation tables, when post-processing is applied, the logical inconsistency (LI) percentage consistently drops to 0% across various models like Turbo, Davinci, GPT-4, Vicuna, and Llama2, on both MAVEN-ERE and Causal-TimeBank datasets [8]. ![The table shows that post-processing consistently achieves 0% Logical Inconsistency (LI) for various models on the MAVEN-ERE and Causal-TimeBank datasets, while methods involving logical constraints show reduced but non-zero LI.](image1) This is further confirmed when evaluating pre-trained models like Vicuna-13B-PT and Llama2-13B-PT; post-processing also results in a 0% LI on these datasets [9]. ![The table shows the performance of pre-trained models (Vicuna-13B-PT, Llama2-13B-PT) on MAVEN-ERE and Causal-TimeBank, highlighting that post-processing consistently achieves 0% Logical Inconsistency (LI).](image3) While post-processing guarantees the absence of logical conflicts, resulting in 0% LI, it may severely affect the quality of the whole generation or require further operations [8].\n\nIn summary, while incorporating logical constraints significantly reduces logical inconsistency compared to baseline LLMs, post-processing is the most effective method for reducing logical inconsistency to zero in different LLM models across the MAVEN-ERE and Causal-TimeBank datasets."}

This includes refining indexing techniques using methods like a sliding window approach, fine-grained segmentation, and incorporating metadata [1].

Moreover, RAPTOR with GPT-4 sets a new benchmark on QASPER with its 55.7% F-1 score [3]. The method's ability to use higher-level summary nodes helps it outperform methods relying only on top-k raw text chunks [4].\n\nFor the QuALITY dataset, RAPTOR also demonstrates superior accuracy [5].

Blurring non-target areas helps direct the model's focus towards the relevant objects [8].\n\nAfter pre-processing, an image encoder processes these cropped and resized regions to obtain image embeddings [8]. Instead of image-to-image retrieval, the system utilizes CLIP's inherent image-text interaction capabilities for image-to-text retrieval in the object detection task [6]. The image embedding is used to query a large multimodal external memory [3], Memory $\\mathcal{M}$ [1], which stores multimodal embeddings and is optimized for retrieval speed through index construction [3]. This retrieval step identifies the top-$k$ category names with the highest similarity to the object [6, 10].\n\nThe retrieved top-$k$ candidate category labels are then integrated with the image embedding and sent to Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for ranking [5]. The MLLMs leverage their substantial knowledge from pre-training and analyze the contextual appropriateness of each retrieved class name with the input image, going beyond the initial retrieval order [2, 4]. This ranking process helps refine the candidates [9], addressing limitations in distinguishing subtle differences, particularly for fine-grained items [2]. Fine-tuning can be applied to improve the MLLMs' ranking ability and ensure they follow the required format for results [7]. The MLLMs then make the final prediction of the object category based on this ranking [5]. ![The image is a table showcasing the process of reranking class names for zero-shot object recognition, comparing initially Retrieved names with Reranked names to show correct identification.](image2) demonstrates how this reranking clarifies correct labels like \"earring\" or \"short_pants\" from initially retrieved lists.\n\nThe system processes and ranks objects for recognition in detection datasets by pre-processing object regions, generating embeddings, retrieving candidate labels using image-to-text retrieval, and finally ranking these candidates with MLLMs to determine the final prediction."}

Step-Back + RAG is able to convert 15.4% of wrong baseline predictions into correct ones [3], [10].

Similarly, for Question Answering tasks on SQuAD and QuoRef datasets, both Exact Match (EM) and F1 scores are reported [8].\n\nComparing the baseline models on these tasks, XLNet generally shows higher F1 scores than BERT. For instance, on QQP, XLNet has an F1 of 91.8 compared to BERT's 91.3, and on MRPC, XLNet is 89.2 while BERT is 88.0.

This indicates that the DSC loss enhances the models' ability to optimize for F1 in question answering tasks.\n\nFurthermore, DSC consistently performs the best across all evaluated datasets [2]. This is particularly evident on more imbalanced datasets where DSC tends to provide greater benefits [2]. The cross-entropy objective, often used in baselines, is argued to be accuracy-oriented, whereas the proposed losses act as a soft version of the F1 score [4].\n\n![Accuracy results for BERT with different objectives (CE, DL, DSC) on SST-2 and SST-5 sentiment analysis datasets.](image1)\n\nThis distinction is highlighted when considering accuracy-oriented tasks like sentiment classification on SST datasets.

This verifies that the dice losses are not designed for accuracy optimization and should not be used for such tasks [10].\n\nInsights from these comparisons suggest that while XLNet generally provides a stronger baseline than BERT for F1-sensitive tasks, incorporating the proposed dice-based losses, especially DSC, is highly effective in further boosting F1 performance across diverse datasets, particularly benefiting from its alignment with F1 optimization. This effectiveness, however, appears task-specific, as these losses are less suitable for accuracy-oriented evaluations.\n\nIn summary, XLNet generally outperforms BERT on F1-centric tasks, and adding the DSC loss significantly improves F1 scores for both models across various datasets, while performing less favorably on accuracy-oriented tasks compared to Cross-Entropy."}

One such technique involved using negative training examples as templates to generate an augmented training set containing 79% negative examples [5]. Training on the original QQP dataset is compared to training on these manipulated datasets. Experiments showed that training on the \"+ positive\" dataset (which created a balanced set) generally outperformed training on the original QQP set, while training on the \"+ negative\" dataset (which created a more imbalanced set) generally underperformed the original set [6].\n\n![The table shows the performance of different BERT variants (BERT, BERT+FL, BERT+DL, BERT+DSC) across various QQP data configurations (Original, +Positive, +Negative, -Negative, +Positive & Negative), measured by F1 score.](image5)\n\nThe effect of these data configurations is measured by metrics like the F1 score [3], [6]. For example, training on the +negative dataset, BERT with the standard objective performed worse than on the original dataset. However, using objectives like Dice Loss (DL) and particularly Dynamic Softmax-Cross Entropy (DSC) can significantly improve performance on these imbalanced datasets. DSC consistently performs the best across various datasets, including the more imbalanced +negative QQP dataset, showing significant improvements over DL, especially where imbalance is higher [3]. This is because DSC incorporates a dynamic weighting strategy to alleviate the dominating effect of easy-negative examples, a problem exacerbated by imbalanced data [9].\n\nThe impact of different objectives and data handling strategies is measured across various NLP tasks using task-appropriate metrics. For accuracy-oriented tasks like text classification on SST-2 and SST-5 sentiment datasets, accuracy is used [1], [8].\n\n![The table shows accuracy results for BERT models using Cross-Entropy (CE), Dice Loss (DL), and Dynamic Softmax-Cross Entropy (DSC) objectives on SST-2 and SST-5 sentiment datasets, with BERT+CE achieving the highest accuracy.](image1)\n\nResults on sentiment analysis tasks show that DL and DSC perform slightly worse than the standard Cross-Entropy (CE) objective, indicating they are not primarily accuracy-oriented and less suitable for such tasks [1].

Studies on Chinese NER datasets use F1 and show that DSC outperforms baseline models and other losses like Focal Loss (FL) and DL [10].

When considering different data augmentation strategies, augmenting with positive examples (+ Positive) generally outperforms the original configuration, while augmenting with negative examples (+ Negative) tends to underperform relative to the original results [4]. For instance, the negative sampling involved in the -negative approach reduces the number of training data, leading to inferior performances despite creating a balanced dataset [4]. One augmentation strategy involves down-sampling negative examples to create a balanced dataset with 269,165 examples, split 50% positive and 50% negative (-Negative) [2]. Another method augments the original data with additional positive and negative examples, resulting in a dataset of 458,477 examples, also balanced at 50% positive and 50% negative (+Positive & Negative) [2].\n\nWhen comparing different loss functions, BERT with the Dice Loss (DL) and especially the Decoupled Softmax and Dice Loss (DSC) show performance improvements over the base BERT model across various augmentation techniques [image1]. The DSC loss often achieves the highest F1 score across datasets and augmentation methods compared to DL and the baseline [6].

For time-related slots like `taxi-leave at`, both methods can struggle without span matching in the context, but DS-Picklist can further reduce error rates when the ontology is accessible, as its predicted values can be found in the candidate-value lists [3], reflected in image5 where DS-Picklist has 53.00% accuracy compared to DS-DST's 50.33%.\n\nOverall, DS-Picklist performs slightly better than DS-DST on the MultiWOZ 2.1 dataset, particularly benefiting slots where values are better handled as categorical or found in an ontology."}

In contrast, while DS-Span's joint accuracy isn't directly shown in this table, the text indicates that DS-DST, which jointly uses non-categorical and categorical approaches, is significantly better than DS-Span [1]. Furthermore, DS-DST outperforms BERT-DST by 7.81% on MultiWOZ 2.1, indicating the effectiveness of the model design based on BERT with strong interactions between dialog context and domain-slot pairs, which DS-Span also utilizes but without the categorical slot handling [5].\n\nOn a slot-level basis, DS-Picklist and DS-DST also demonstrate superior performance compared to DS-Span, especially for certain slot types.

Significant improvements over the DS-Span baseline are observed for slots like `hotel-type`, `attraction-type`, `attraction-name`, `hotel-internet`, and `hotel-parking` [4]. These are slots where values often have different expressions or are not explicitly extractable via span-based methods, reducing DS-Span's effectiveness [4], [6].\n\nFor these challenging slots, treating them as categorical (as in DS-DST and DS-Picklist) or having access to candidate value lists (as in DS-Picklist) allows for better prediction [4], [6]. Error analysis confirms that DS-DST and DS-Picklist dramatically reduce errors for slots such as `attraction-type`, `hotel-internet`, and `hotel-parking` compared to DS-Span, which struggles when the ground truth values cannot be found through span matching [6]. ![{The table shows statistics for different slot names across DS-Span, DS-DST, and DS-Picklist, indicating the number of unfound values for DS-Span and success rates for the others.](image3) For example, in conversations about internet or parking, users might not explicitly say 'yes' or 'no', causing DS-Span to fail span extraction, whereas DS-DST and DS-Picklist can handle such cases better [7]. Similarly, formatting issues can cause span extraction failures for time-related slots, where DS-Picklist can perform better if the value is in the candidate list [6], [7].\n\nOverall, DS-Picklist performs better than DS-DST, which performs better than DS-Span, in both joint accuracy and slot accuracy, particularly excelling on categorical slots where span-based extraction is unreliable."}

Both tasks are challenging, with imperfect human performance noted, indicating inherent ambiguity [5]. A large gap exists between human performance and current methods [5].

In contrast, previous methods like CHAPLOT 18 and MISRA 17 reportedly fail to learn reasonable manipulation behavior on CHAI [7]. Despite OA showing some level of performance, the overall manipulation accuracy remains relatively low compared to potential perfect execution. Indeed, all models perform poorly on CHAI, especially concerning manipulation (MA) [7]. The complexity of this domain is high; even with access to oracle goals, the model completely fails to learn a reasonable manipulation behavior for CHAI, highlighting the inherent planning challenges [1]. This contrasts sharply with human performance on CHAI, where the manipulation accuracy is 100% [10], demonstrating a considerable gap between current automated methods and human ability on this task [10]. The difficulty stems partly from instructions that might include constraints on the execution or trajectory itself, which the current model architecture might struggle to reason about as it relies solely on the predicted goal for action generation [8].\n\nInsights drawn from this comparison indicate that while the proposed approach successfully pushes the state of the art in navigation and task completion for simpler scenarios like LANI, complex manipulation tasks like those in CHAI remain a significant hurdle. The low manipulation accuracy across all evaluated models, including the proposed one, underscores the difficulty of this domain and the need for models capable of handling intricate planning and execution constraints beyond simply reaching a final goal [8].\n\nOur approach demonstrates improved task completion for LANI compared to baselines and previous methods, while manipulation accuracy for CHAI remains low across all evaluated models, highlighting the significant challenge of the CHAI task."}

On CHAI, where instructions include navigation actions only, our approach yields a stop distance (SD) of 3.24, a 17% error reduction, which is significantly better than the 8% reduction over the entire corpus when compared to the STOP baseline of 3.91 SD [2].

The model separates goal prediction and action generation, with examples shown such as predicting the area around cabinets for the instruction \"walk over to the cabinets and open the cabinet doors up\" ![{Examples of heat map goal predictions for given instructions}](image2).\n\nSeveral factors influence the performance. The tasks themselves present inherent ambiguity, as demonstrated by imperfect human performance on LANI (SD 5.2, TC 63%) and CHAI (SD 1.34, MA 100%) [6]. The gap to human performance remains large, indicating these are largely open problems [6]. The model's architecture, while providing an interpretable goal representation, has potential limitations such as cascading errors, where action generation relies completely on the predicted goal and is not exposed to the language otherwise [4]. This also suggests difficulty in reasoning about instructions that include constraints on the execution itself or intermediate trajectory constraints [4]. The presence or absence of certain linguistic categories, such as Temporal coordination and Co-reference, can have a statistically significant impact on performance metrics [Image 1]. Evaluating execution quality with rigid goals can be insufficient [8], and automated metrics may fail to capture much of the ambiguity [10]. Human evaluation results show that while humans have a mean rating of 4.38 on a Likert scale for LANI, our approach's mean rating is 3.78, indicating a performance gap perceived by human raters [8] ![{Histogram comparing human and our approach ratings on LANI}](image3). Access to oracle goals significantly improves navigation performance but fails to address the planning complexity of manipulation behavior for CHAI [10].\n\nOur approach generally performs better than baselines and previous methods on SD and TC/MA across LANI and CHAI datasets, but performance is limited by inherent task ambiguity, model architecture limitations like cascading errors and difficulty with trajectory constraints, and challenges in automated evaluation."}

Investigating how much pretraining benefits from larger corpora and how the domain of the data influences end-task performance is crucial [10]. Generally, more data for pretraining improves performance [4]. Figure 3 shows that more training data can significantly increase accuracy, suggesting that performance would likely continue to improve with even more data beyond 18B tokens [7, 8].\n\n![The image is a line graph depicting the relationship between the amount of Common Crawl data (measured in tokens) used for pretraining and the average GLUE score achieved.](image4)\n\nBeyond just quantity, the structure and domain of the data matter. Pretraining on corpora that retains paragraph structure performs better than individual sentences [4]. For example, Common Crawl data, which averages several sentences or 50 words per example, generally performs better than News Crawl, which consists of individual sentences averaging 23 words [5]. This difference is particularly notable on tasks like RTE, where there's a significant accuracy gap [5]. Multi-sentence training examples are crucial for many tasks based on sentence pairs [5, 8].

However, the impact of this alignment appears to differ based on the system type.\n\nIn bilingual translation tasks, the alignment of word embeddings was somewhat surprisingly not beneficial for training, with gains or losses essentially being insignificant across all languages [8]. For example, comparing unaligned and aligned scores for various language pairs such as GL→EN, PT→EN, AZ→EN, TR→EN, BE→EN, and RU→EN shows changes in BLEU scores that are close to zero or slightly negative in most cases [![Table comparing unaligned and aligned BLEU scores for various language pairs.](image3)].\n\nIn contrast, when considering multilingual systems, applying pre-trained embeddings and aligning them appears beneficial [7]. For multilingual training setups like GL + PT evaluated on GL, AZ + TR evaluated on AZ, and BE + RU evaluated on BE, the alignment metric consistently shows the highest scores compared to other methods [![Table comparing evaluation metrics for different multilingual training setups including an alignment metric.](image2)]. This benefit in multilingual settings is attributed to the single encoder used for multiple source languages, which learns more effectively when their word embeddings are in similar vector spaces [7].\n\nWord embedding alignment did not significantly impact BLEU scores in bilingual tasks but was beneficial in multilingual systems."}

Gains in translation quality, measured by BLEU score, are highest when the training set size is small and decrease as more data becomes available. `![The graphs show that pre-training (dashed lines) generally results in higher BLEU scores than standard training (solid lines), with the gain from pre-training being largest at smaller training set sizes.](image5)` There appears to be a sweet spot where pre-trained embeddings are most effective: with sufficient data to establish a basic system, but not so much that standard training converges to similar performance [4, 9].\n\nLanguage similarity also plays a role, although its effect can differ based on the training setup. In multilingual translation systems that share an encoder, pre-training, coupled with embedding alignment, helps place the embeddings of different source languages into similar vector spaces, facilitating learning [3, 6]. In this context, the gains from applying pre-trained embeddings are generally larger for more similar translation pairs [3]. `![The table compares multilingual translation performance (bi, std, pre, align) for different language pairs, showing improvements from pre-training (pre) and alignment (align), with the most similar pair (GL+PT) seeing a gain from pre-training, while the least similar (BE+RU) sees a decrease.](image3)`\n\nHowever, in bilingual scenarios (e.g., single source to target translation), while it's hypothesized that more similar language pairs would see larger gains [10], results can vary. For translation pairs into Portuguese from various source languages, pre-training consistently provided improvements [5]. `![The table lists source languages translated to Portuguese, their language families, and shows significant 'pre' metric improvements for all pairs, including similar Romance languages (ES, FR, IT), a less similar Indo-European (RU), and a language with no common family (HE).](image1)` Some less similar language pairs might show large absolute gains, potentially because their lower baseline scores offer more room for improvement, fitting the pattern observed where systems with poor but not extremely poor baselines benefit most [8, 9]. Pre-training generally improves translation accuracy, with the largest gains observed in low-resource settings and often for linguistically similar language pairs, though languages with lower baseline performance can also see substantial improvements."}

While independent embeddings are often used, the hypothesis is that having consistent embedding spaces across languages may be beneficial for NMT systems to learn correspondences more easily [3]. However, the effects of aligning embedding spaces differ depending on whether the system is bilingual or multilingual [5].\n\nFor bilingual systems (trained on a single source-target pair), *a priori* alignment of embeddings may not be necessary [5]. Looking at the results for bilingual translation into English, aligning embeddings does not consistently improve scores and can even lead to small decreases, as seen for GL→EN and PT→EN pairs, while others show minimal change or small increases [image4: The table shows that aligning word embeddings for bilingual pairs into English results in small changes in scores, often negative].\n\nIn contrast, for multilingual translation systems that share an encoder or decoder between multiple languages [10], aligning the word embeddings helps to increase BLEU scores for all tasks tested [7], as shown in the table evaluating multilingual translation into English, where the 'align' score is generally higher than 'pre' [image3: The table shows that evaluation scores for multilingual training setups on low-resource languages increase significantly when using aligned embeddings compared to just pre-trained or standard methods]. This benefit in multilingual settings is intuitive because a single encoder processes multiple source languages, and alignment ensures their embeddings are in similar vector spaces, aiding the model's learning process [7].\n\nPre-training word embeddings helps improve the accuracy of translation across the entire vocabulary, with a particularly significant effect on words that are of low frequency in the training corpus [8].\n![The bar chart shows that pre-training ('pre') generally improves F-measure scores for target words compared to the standard method ('std'), with noticeable gains across various frequency ranges, especially for lower-frequency words.](image2)\nThis improvement in handling lower-frequency words demonstrates the usefulness of pre-trained embeddings in providing better representations for less frequent concepts [4]. A qualitative analysis supports this, showing that pre-training with alignment in a multilingual system can successfully translate difficult elements like proper names and multi-word phrases that a standard bilingual system might fail to capture correctly [4].\n![The table compares translations from a source text, showing that the multilingual system with pre-training and alignment ('multi:pre-align') produces a translation closer to the reference and better captures specific terms compared to a standard bilingual system ('bi:std').](image1)\nComparing specific word/phrase translations across different systems highlights how the multilingual system with pre-training and alignment improves the capture of rare or multi-word expressions [image5: The table presents scores or counts for word and phrase translations across different systems, indicating that the multilingual system with pre-training and alignment captures certain expressions that standard or just pre-trained bilingual systems do not].\n\nIn summary, aligning word embeddings is particularly helpful for performance in multilingual translation systems but shows limited or no benefit in bilingual systems, while pre-training (which can be done before alignment) significantly improves F-measure, especially for low-frequency words."}

For instance, using GloVe embeddings, replacing ELMo, but keeping the R-GCN component (GloVe with R-GCN) yields a system that ranks significantly above baselines, even without accessing context [2]. However, if the R-GCN is then removed (GloVe w/o R-GCN), performance drops substantially, indicating the importance of the R-GCN in updating mention representations based on their relations [2]. When using the stronger ELMo encoder, removing R-GCN ('No R-GCN') results in accuracy of 62.4% in the unmasked setting and 63.2% in the masked setting, suggesting that multi-hop inference provided by R-GCN is genuinely required, as the best model is significantly more accurate than this local model [4].\n\n![The table shows the performance metrics (unmasked and masked accuracy) for different model configurations, including ablations of components like R-GCN, relation types, and specific relation types.](image1)\n\nWhen the model is fully connected without distinguishing edge types ('No relation types'), there are only marginal improvements compared to removing R-GCN entirely ('No R-GCN') [9]. This suggests that a naive entity graph without informative edge types does not add much value to the task [9]. The table shows 'No relation types' achieving 62.7% unmasked and 63.9% masked accuracy [image1].\n\nAblating specific relation types reveals varying impacts. Removing connections for mentions that co-occur in the same document ('No DOC-BASED') seems to remove important information, as the model is unaware they appear closely [1]. Performance without DOC-BASED connections is 62.9% unmasked and 65.8% masked [image1]. The model appears to make better use of DOC-BASED connections than MATCH or COREF connections [1]. Coreference links ('No COREF') and complement edges ('No COMPLEMENT') seem to play a more marginal role, likely because the MATCH heuristic captures easier coreference cases, and the external coreference system may not be reliable for others [1]. Performance is 64.8% unmasked without COREF and 64.1% unmasked and 70.3% masked without COMPLEMENT [image1]. Removing mentions matching exactly ('No MATCH') results in 64.3% unmasked and 67.4% masked accuracy [image1]. Although the impact varies, modeling all these different relations together gives the Entity-GCN a clear advantage [1]. Performance can even degrade on the test set when using coreference, possibly because test documents are harder for the coreference system [1].\n\nRemoving R-GCN, specific relation types, or failing to distinguish between relation types negatively impacts model performance, particularly the R-GCN component and DOC-BASED relations."}

In the masked setting, coreferenced mentions are already linked by design, using the same unique surface form (e.g., MASK1) across documents [2]. This means that the exact match heuristic (`MATCH`) becomes highly effective in capturing these coreference links [10], reducing the need for a separate coreference resolution system [6]. As a result, explicitly adding coreference links via an external system seems to play a more marginal role in the masked setting [6].\n\nIn the unmasked setting, where mentions can differ in surface form (e.g., \"US\" vs \"United States\"), identifying coreference is more challenging [2]. While the model includes coreference edges, ablating them ('No COREF') shows only a slight decrease in unmasked performance (64.8 accuracy) compared to the full single model (65.1 accuracy) [Image2], suggesting these links play a marginal role [6]. This could be partly because the `MATCH` heuristic handles the easier coreference cases [6]. Furthermore, using an out-of-domain coreference system might not be reliable for the remaining, harder cases [6]. Surprisingly, on the test set, the single Entity-GCN model *without* coreference (67.6 accuracy) performs better than the single model *with* coreference (66.4 accuracy) [Image4]. This performance degradation with coreference on the test set suggests the external coreference system may be less reliable on that specific data [6].\n\nThe inclusion of coreference information, when derived from an external system, has a marginal impact in the unmasked setting and may even degrade performance on the test set, while the masked setting inherently handles coreference more effectively through exact mention matching."}

On these datasets, DyGIE significantly improves upon the state of the art, achieving Entity F1 scores of 84.7 on ACE04-O, 82.9 on ACE05-O, and 76.2 on GENIA, demonstrating its effectiveness for overlapping entities across different domains [2], [image3 is described as: The table presents the performance of different systems on various datasets, measured by the Entity F1 score. The datasets listed are ACE04-O, ACE05-O, and GENIA. The DyGIE system achieves the highest Entity F1 score across all datasets.]. It improves by 11.6% and 11.3% on ACE04-O and ACE05-O respectively, and by 1.5% on GENIA [2]. For this specific task on these datasets, relation annotations were not available, so the coreference propagation layer was included, but not the relation layer [4]; for ACE05, OntoNotes annotations were used to train the coreference layer parameters [10].\n\nWhen considering the impact of different model components, specifically coreference propagation (CorefProp) and relation propagation (RelProp), their effects vary depending on the dataset and task. For a dataset like ACE05, coreference propagation is mainly helpful for entities but appears to slightly reduce relation extraction performance [9]. As shown by ACE05 results, the full DyGIE model has an Entity F1 of 87.1, which decreases to 85.7 when CorefProp is removed, while its Relation F1 of 58.4 increases to 60.2 without CorefProp [image1 is described as: The table provides performance metrics of different models on entity and relation extraction tasks. For entities and relations, it presents precision (P), recall (R), and F1 scores. The models compared include: DyGIE, DyGIE without Coreference Propagation (−CorefProp), DyGIE without Relation Propagation (−RelProp), and Base. For ACE05, DyGIE shows the highest F1 score for entities (87.1), while −CorefProp scores best for relations (60.2).]. Relation propagation, conversely, significantly benefits both entity and relation extraction [9]. On ACE05, the full DyGIE model (with RelProp) achieves Entity F1 of 87.1 and Relation F1 of 58.4, compared to 86.9 and 58.0 respectively without RelProp [image1 is described as: The table provides performance metrics of different models on entity and relation extraction tasks. For entities and relations, it presents precision (P), recall (R), and F1 scores. The models compared include: DyGIE, DyGIE without Coreference Propagation (−CorefProp), DyGIE without Relation Propagation (−RelProp), and Base. For ACE05, DyGIE shows the highest F1 score for entities (87.1), while −CorefProp scores best for relations (60.2).], suggesting a positive impact.\n\nOn the SciIE (likely referring to SciERC) dataset, CorefProp has a smaller effect on entity F1 compared to ACE05 [7], giving only a small benefit on both tasks [9]. This is potentially due to the uniform assignment of a 'Generic' label to pronouns in the SciERC dataset [6]. As seen in SciIE results, the full DyGIE model has an Entity F1 of 68.2, slightly improving from 68.0 without CorefProp, and a Relation F1 of 42.0, slightly improving from 41.2 without CorefProp [image4 is described as: The table presents the performance metrics for different models on entity recognition and relation extraction tasks, including DyGIE, DyGIE without CorefProp, DyGIE without RelProp, and a Base model, reporting Precision, Recall, and F1 scores. For SciIE, DyGIE Entity F1 is 68.2, Relation F1 is 42.0; without CorefProp, Entity F1 is 68.0, Relation F1 is 41.2; without RelProp, Entity F1 is 67.5, Relation F1 is 40.4; Base Entity F1 is 68.1, Relation F1 is 39.5.]. Relation propagation significantly benefits both entity and relation extraction on SciIE as well [9], with the full DyGIE model (Entity F1 68.2, Relation F1 42.0) outperforming the model without RelProp (Entity F1 67.5, Relation F1 40.4) and the Base model (Entity F1 68.1, Relation F1 39.5) [image4 is described as: The table presents the performance metrics for different models on entity recognition and relation extraction tasks, including DyGIE, DyGIE without CorefProp, DyGIE without RelProp, and a Base model, reporting Precision, Recall, and F1 scores. For SciIE, DyGIE Entity F1 is 68.2, Relation F1 is 42.0; without CorefProp, Entity F1 is 68.0, Relation F1 is 41.2; without RelProp, Entity F1 is 67.5, Relation F1 is 40.4; Base Entity F1 is 68.1, Relation F1 is 39.5.]. Relation propagation is particularly helpful in sentences with more entities [3] or a large portion of sentences with multiple relation instances [9], scenarios common in ACE05 and SciERC [9]. The propagation processes involve iterations, and performance metrics like F1 scores for both entity and relation extraction can vary with the number of iterations [image2 is described as: The image shows two line graphs comparing the performance of entity and relation extraction F1 scores with different numbers of iterations for CorefProp and RelProp. The Entity F1 graph peaks at two iterations for CorefProp, and the Relation F1 graph peaks at two iterations for RelProp, indicating the intended impact of iterative processes on F1 scores.]. Overall, the addition of coreference and relation propagation adds minimal computational cost and significantly improves performance across different IE tasks [8].\n\nThe DyGIE model achieves state-of-the-art performance on overlapping entity extraction across multiple domains and shows varied performance impacts from coreference and relation propagation on standard entity and relation extraction tasks depending on the dataset characteristics."}

This coreference propagation layer is specifically included in models for overlapping entity extraction tasks on datasets like ACE2004, ACE2005, and GENIA, particularly when relation annotations are not available for these datasets [7]. The use of graph propagation, including coreference, is shown to affect prediction accuracy [1].\n![DyGIE without coreference propagation shows a lower Entity F1 score (85.7) compared to the full DyGIE model (87.1)](image1).\nThe influence of coreference annotations is particularly evident in datasets where pronoun disambiguation is challenging and requires reasoning with cross-sentence contexts [10].\n![The table details overlapping entity datasets ACE04-O, ACE05-O, and GENIA, showing their domain, document count, entity types, overlap percentage, and presence of coreference annotations](image4).\nFor instance, ACE05 presents such a challenge, and the coreference layer in DyGIE helps with the entity categorization of pronouns, resulting in a notable 6.6% improvement on pronoun performance in that dataset [10]. Conversely, in datasets like SciERC, where pronouns are uniformly labeled, the coreference propagation layer does not have as much effect on entity extraction performance [9]. The effectiveness also depends on the number of iterations for coreference propagation [6].\n![Entity F1 peaks at two coreference propagation iterations](image5).\nAcross datasets like ACE04-O, ACE05-O, and GENIA, where the coreference propagation layer was utilized [7], DyGIE demonstrates significant improvements on overlapping entity extraction, achieving state-of-the-art results [4].\n![DyGIE achieves state-of-the-art Entity F1 scores on overlapping entity datasets ACE04-O, ACE05-O, and GENIA](image3).\nThe presence of complex coreference annotations and the need for cross-sentence context heavily influence the beneficial impact of the coreference propagation layer on DyGIE's entity recognition performance."}

For entity extraction, the F1 score is shown to improve as the number of CorefProp iterations increases, reaching its best performance at the second iteration [2]. Similarly, for the relation extraction task, the optimal performance, as measured by the F1 score, is achieved with two iterations of relation propagation [4].\n\n![The image shows line graphs illustrating that Entity F1 peaks at 2 CorefProp iterations and Relation F1 peaks at 2 RelProp iterations.](image5)\n\nRemoving either coreference propagation (setting the number of iterations, N, to 0) or relation propagation (setting M to 0) from the D Y GIE model generally results in lower F1 scores compared to models that include propagation [5]. Specifically, the base model without any propagation and models without CorefProp or RelProp propagation layers show varying F1 scores compared to the full DyGIE model [Image 2], indicating that propagation, when optimized, provides a benefit.\n\nIn contrast, the number of entities present in a sentence has a different effect on the relation extraction F1 score. As the number of entities within a sentence increases, the relation F1 score tends to decrease [Image 4]. Sentences with only two entities generally yield the highest relation F1 scores, while sentences containing a large number of entities (e.g., 12 or more) show significantly lower relation extraction performance [Image 4]. This indicates that the complexity introduced by a higher density of entities makes the relation extraction task more challenging.\n\nThe number of iterations for CorefProp and RelProp affects performance by finding an optimal point for iterative refinement [10], typically around two iterations, beyond which the F1 score might not improve or could decrease [Image 5]. The number of entities in a sentence, however, affects relation F1 by influencing the inherent complexity of the input, with higher entity counts leading to lower F1 scores [Image 4].\n\nThe F1 scores for entity and relation extraction tasks are optimized at two iterations for CorefProp and RelProp respectively, while relation extraction F1 scores decrease as the number of entities in a sentence increases."}

For example, the SWEM-concat model even outperformed a deep 29-layer CNN model when predicting topics [7]. When investigating sentence matching tasks, including natural language inference, answer sentence selection, and paraphrase identification, SWEM also shows competitive or best results on most datasets [1].\n\n![The table compares SWEM variants, CNN, and LSTM on sentence matching tasks like SNLI, WikiQA, and Quora, showing competitive performance for SWEM models, often achieving bolded high scores.](image2)\n\nHowever, the effectiveness of SWEM can vary depending on the task and text length. SWEM generally yields inferior accuracies on short sentence sentiment analysis datasets compared to CNN/LSTM [10]. This suggests that for shorter texts, where semantic information from word embeddings alone is limited, word-order features become more important [10]. The proposed hierarchical pooling operation in SWEM-hier manages to abstract spatial information, which is beneficial for performance in sentiment analysis tasks [4] and Chinese text classification, where it achieves performance comparable to CNN and LSTM [8].\n\nIn terms of model complexity and parameter efficiency, subspace training analysis indicates that SWEM is more parameter-efficient than CNN, particularly at lower subspace dimensions [3, 9].\n\n![The graph shows SWEM achieving high accuracy at lower subspace dimensions compared to CNN on AG News.](image1)\n\n![The graph illustrates SWEM reaching high accuracy with fewer parameters at low dimensions on another dataset.](image5)\n\nWhile SWEM exhibits a lower intrinsic dimension needed to achieve a decent solution than CNN on tasks like AG News, CNN can leverage more trainable parameters to achieve higher accuracy when the dimension is large on some datasets like Yelp P.

To address this, researchers explored transferring knowledge from document-level data, which is less expensive to acquire [6]. Two approaches investigated were pretraining (PRET) and multi-task learning (MULT) [4]. Experiments demonstrated that attention-based LSTM networks, commonly used for aspect-level classification, benefit from incorporating document-level knowledge [6].\n\nOne analysis looked at how transferring different layers of a pretrained model affects performance on the aspect-level task [7]. The study examined transferring the embedding layer, LSTM layer, and output layer [7]. Transferring knowledge was found to be helpful in all settings, showing improvements even when only a single layer was transferred [7]. Overall, transferring the LSTM and embedding layers proved more useful than the output layer, as the latter is typically more task-specific [7]. For datasets D3 and D4, which have extremely unbalanced label distributions with very few negative and neutral examples in the test sets ![The table contains information about datasets labeled D1 to D4, indicating the number of positive (Pos), negative (Neg), and neutral (Neu) entries for both training and test sets.](image1)[2], transferring the embedding layer was particularly helpful [7].

The results showed that increasing the number of document-level examples led to stable improvements in accuracy across all four datasets [5]. For Macro-F1 scores, improvements were stable on D1 and D2, while D3 and D4 saw sharp increases when changing the percentage of document examples from 0 to 0.4 [5].

TRADE achieved a joint goal accuracy of 48.62% and a slot accuracy of 96.92% on the full MultiWOZ dataset, which is reported as state-of-the-art [3, 6, 8].

This capability is demonstrated through simulations of zero-shot dialogue state tracking for unseen domains [3]. In this zero-shot setting, where the model is tested on a domain it hasn't been trained on, TRADE still achieves notable results. For example, in one of the zero-shot domains (specifically Taxi), it attained a joint goal accuracy of 60.58% [3, image3]. While trained single-domain models generally perform better within their specific domain, the zero-shot results show the model's ability to generalize.

The text notes that performance differences with models like SpanPtr stem from the limitations of index-based copying, and models like MDBT, GLAD, and GCE are hindered by needing a predefined domain ontology [10].\n\nIn domain adaptation scenarios involving domain expansion, where the model is pre-trained on several domains and fine-tuned on a new held-out domain [8], TRADE also shows effectiveness. Experiments exclude one domain, pre-train on the remaining four, and then fine-tune using 1% of the data from the excluded domain [6]. ![{The table presents results from an evaluation of a Base Model (BM) trained on four domains and its fine-tuning on a new domain.](image3)\nFine-tuning from the base model generally achieves better results on the new domain compared to training from scratch with the same limited data [6, 8].

In contrast, GEM retains a small number of samples from the source domains and applies a constraint on the gradient during training on the new domain to prevent the loss on the stored samples from increasing [8].\n\nExperiments show that fine-tuning a base model pre-trained on four domains generally achieves better results on a new domain compared to training from scratch on the new domain using the same limited data [2, 6, 9].\n![The table presents results comparing a Base Model trained on four domains and its fine-tuning on a new domain using Naive, EWC, and GEM strategies, evaluating performance on both the original four domains and the new domain.](image3)\nWhen evaluating performance on the original four domains after fine-tuning on a new domain with 1% data, GEM consistently outperforms naive and EWC fine-tuning in mitigating catastrophic forgetting [6, 9].

Previous work has explored different methods for handling slot features, including sharing parameters across slots or using slot-specific modules [4]. The relationships and similarities between slots can influence how well knowledge transfers.\n![The image is a heatmap showing the cosine similarity between embeddings for different slots in the MultiWOZ dataset, where darker colors indicate higher similarity between pairs of slots.](image5)\nAnalyzing zero-shot scenarios (transfer without new domain data) provides insight into which slot knowledge transfers successfully.

An example illustrates this; translating \"The janitor does not like the baker because she always messes up the kitchen\" into Spanish resulted in \"el panadero\" (male baker), failing to match the female pronoun \"she\" [image3]. Adding a stereotypical adjective like \"pretty\" (\"The janitor does not like the pretty baker...\") resulted in the corrected translation \"la panadera bonita\" (female baker), matching the pronoun [image3]. This suggests that introducing stronger, albeit stereotypical, gender cues can influence the translation towards the correct gender, demonstrating the system's reliance on such signals [8].\n\nAn experiment where stereotypical adjectives (\"handsome\" or \"pretty\") were prepended to entities showed that this could improve performance and significantly reduce bias in some languages [8].

While not a practical solution for debiasing, this confirms that manipulating stereotypical associations can indeed affect gender translation accuracy [8]. The difference in performance between pro-stereotypical and anti-stereotypical assignments (ΔS) is a key metric indicating the strength of this bias across languages and systems [10, image5].\n\nIn conclusion, stereotype-based adjustments in machine translation negatively impact accuracy by favoring stereotypical gender roles over non-stereotypical ones, although explicitly adding stereotypical cues can sometimes improve gender accuracy in specific languages."}

For instance, a single-paragraph BERT model achieves an F1 of 67.08 in a standard distractor setting, but this drops to 38.40 in an open-domain setting with 10 paragraphs and slightly increases to 39.12 with 500 paragraphs ![F1 scores for different evaluation settings including distractor and open-domain](image2). This performance degradation in open-domain is largely attributed to the difficulty in retrieving the necessary \"gold\" paragraphs [5]. Indeed, providing the two gold paragraphs in the open-domain setting dramatically improves the single-paragraph BERT's F1 to 53.12 ![F1 scores for different evaluation settings including distractor and open-domain](image2).\n\nThe type of distractors used in evaluation also affects F1 scores. When evaluating with adversarial distractors, a model trained on original data sees its F1 score drop from 67.08 to 46.84 [9]. Further filtering these adversarial distractors by entity type [6] leads to an even greater decline, down to 40.73 F1 for the original model ![A table showing F1 scores for models trained on original or adversarial data and evaluated on original, adversarial, or type-filtered adversarial data](image4). However, training the model on adversarial distractors can mitigate these drops, allowing it to recover significant accuracy when tested on adversarial distractors (60.10 F1) [9] and even on type-filtered adversarial distractors (58.42 F1) [6], ![A table showing F1 scores for models trained on original or adversarial data and evaluated on original, adversarial, or type-filtered adversarial data](image4). This suggests that training strategies, specifically adversarial training, can build robustness against more challenging evaluation scenarios, while evaluation strategies, such as using adversarial distractors or open-domain settings without effective retrieval, can highlight model limitations.\n\nDifferent training and evaluation strategies significantly affect F1 scores, with adversarial training improving robustness to challenging evaluations and open-domain evaluation highlighting retrieval shortcomings."}

This level was surprisingly close to the average untrained human baseline [8]. However, this performance is entirely accounted for by the exploitation of these cues [8].\n\nTo address this, an adversarial dataset is constructed based on the logical relationship $R \\wedge A \\to \\lnot C$ [2, 3]. For each data point, an adversarial example is created by negating the claim ($C$) and inverting the original label [2]. This process essentially mirrors the distribution of statistical cues over both labels, thereby eliminating the reliance on these superficial patterns [2, 3].\n\n![This image is a diagram illustrating the architecture of a BERT model used for processing input data. It shows how claims, reasons, and warrants are tokenized and input into the BERT model. The tokens are labeled and encoded, going through various layers marked by interconnected nodes representing the deep connections within BERT. The different sections are separated by special tokens like [CLS] and [SEP] to signify classification and separation tasks in natural language processing.](image2)\n\nFor example, an original claim like \"Google is not a harmful monopoly\" with a reason and warrant might be transformed into an adversarial example by negating the claim to \"Google is a harmful monopoly\" and inverting the label, along with adjusting supporting details like the warrant [3].\n![The table presents a comparison between \"Original\" and \"Adversarial\" viewpoints concerning whether Google is a harmful monopoly.](image3)\n\nWhen models are trained and evaluated on this adversarial dataset, their performance drops drastically [6]. On the original dataset, BERT showed a maximum performance of 77% [8], with a mean of 0.671 and median of 0.712 on the test set [image5].\n![The table presents test performance metrics (Mean, Median, and Max) for different models and configurations.](image5)\nIn contrast, when trained and evaluated on the adversarial dataset, BERT's peak performance reduces to 53% [3, 6], with mean and median scores hovering around 50% [6].\n![The table presents a comparison of the performance metrics for different BERT models, namely \"BERT\", \"BERT (W)\", \"BERT (R, W)\", and \"BERT (C, W)\", based on their test performance.](image4)\nThis level of performance is essentially random [3, 6, 8].\n\nThis dramatic decrease in performance demonstrates that on the original dataset, BERT was primarily exploiting statistical regularities rather than genuinely understanding the underlying arguments [7, 8]. While BERT is a strong learner capable of exploiting subtle cues [5], its success on the original ARCT dataset was not indicative of argument comprehension [7]. The adversarial dataset successfully eliminates the reliance on these cues [6].\n\nThe adversarial dataset setup forces models to rely on genuine understanding rather than spurious correlations, leading to a random performance level for BERT [3, 6]. This result better aligns with the intuition that significant understanding of the arguments is required for good performance [6]. It highlights that BERT, in its standard application, learned nothing about argument comprehension from the original ARCT data [7]. Therefore, the adversarial dataset provides a more robust evaluation and should be adopted as the standard for future work on ARCT [3, 8, 10].\n\nThe adversarial data setup reveals that BERT's high performance on the original ARCT dataset was due to exploiting statistical cues, not genuine argument comprehension, causing its accuracy to fall to random levels on the adversarial data."}

The effectiveness of different decoding algorithms plays a role in the quality of generated knowledge. Notably, using greedy decoding to produce knowledge tuples on the ATOMIC test set results in only a 10% relative performance gap compared to human evaluation [7]. This suggests that the knowledge generated by the model using this method is quite close to what humans would produce.\n\n![The table presents the performance of different decoding methods used in the COMET framework for generating commonsense inferences, evaluated against a human baseline on the ATOMIC dataset.](image1)\nAs shown in the table, when evaluating performance across various relation types on the ATOMIC dataset, greedy decoding achieves an average score of 77.53. While this is the highest among the tested automated decoding methods (including various beam search and random sampling approaches), it still falls short of the human validation average of 86.18. Other decoding methods like beam search with 2 beams (average 63.29) and random sampling (average 53.27 for Top-5) perform significantly lower than greedy decoding and human validation. The findings also indicate that generating more total candidates, such as with larger beam sizes (e.g., beam search with 10 beams averaging 56.45), can lower overall quality [7].\n\nRegarding the impact of training data volume, studies show that COMET can learn effectively even with limited data [8].\n![This table displays the results of different training data percentages on model performance metrics.](image3)\nThe results indicate that perplexity (PPL) decreases and BLEU-2 scores generally increase as the percentage of training data increases from 1% to FULL, suggesting improved model confidence and generation quality [8]. For example, PPL drops from 23.81 at 1% data to 11.13 at FULL training data, while BLEU-2 increases from 5.08 to 14.34. Interestingly, novelty metrics (N/T° and N/U°) show strong performance even at 10% training data (9.54 and 58.34 respectively), sometimes even exceeding performance with 50% or FULL data without pre-training [8]. However, using only 1% of the training data clearly diminishes the quality and novelty of the produced generations [8].\n\nIn essence, greedy decoding for COMET approaches human performance in commonsense inference generation, outperforming other automated methods, although still demonstrating a gap compared to human validation, while model performance metrics such as perplexity, BLEU-2, and novelty are significantly affected by the amount of training data, with sufficient data leading to better results."}

Specifically, COMET achieves a lower perplexity (4.32), indicating higher confidence in its predictions, and a high classifier score (95.25%), suggesting generated tuples are frequently judged as correct by an automated model [10]. Human evaluation further validates this, with 91.7% of greedily decoded tuples for ConceptNet relations being scored as correct [7, 10]. This high precision approaches human performance levels for these resources [3].\n\nIn terms of novelty, COMET demonstrates a strong ability to generate new knowledge [1]. The table shows COMET achieving high N/T\\(_{sro}\\) (77.20) and N/T\\(_{o}\\) (25.82) scores compared to baselines, indicating a significant portion of generated tuples and objects are novel [1].

These strategies, such as Pass-through, Neutral, and Background, help handle rare and unseen words, especially critical in adversarial settings [3]. Two key metrics for evaluating these models are Word Error Rate (WER) and sensitivity [5]. Lower WER is generally desired, but low sensitivity is also crucial for robustness, quantifying how many unique outputs a word recognition model might produce for different perturbations, thus limiting an attacker's degrees of freedom [5], [7].\n\nThe performance, measured by WER under various attacks, varies depending on the vocabulary handling of the model (closed vs. open) and the backoff strategy employed.\n![Table showing Word Error Rates for Closed and Open Vocabulary models with different backoff strategies under various attack types](image2)\nAs shown, the Neutral backoff variant achieves the lowest overall WER (11.3) averaged across attack types for both Closed Vocabulary (word-only) and Open Vocabulary models (char/word+char/word-piece) [9]. The Background variant shows slightly higher WERs (13.1 for Closed, 14.7 for Open) in this context, while the Pass-through variant has significantly higher WER for Open Vocabulary models (30.3) compared to Closed Vocabulary models (11.3) [9].\n\nSensitivity, however, shows more distinct differences between closed and open vocabulary models based on the backoff strategy.\n![Scatter plot showing the relationship between sensitivity, Word Error Rate, and robustness for word-only and char-only models with different backoff strategies](image4)\nFor word-only (closed) models, the sensitivity values for Pass-through, Background, and Neutral variants are relatively close, ranging from about 11.4 to 12.7 [4], [8]. The Neutral backoff is expected to have low sensitivity as it maps UNK predictions to a fixed neutral word [4], [7]. In contrast, for char-only (open) models, sensitivity varies widely [4]. The Neutral backoff maintains low sensitivity (~12), while the Background (~10) is also low, but the Pass-through variant is significantly more sensitive (~30) [8]. This difference arises because open vocabulary models treat every unique character combination differently, making Pass-through (which passes words as is) more sensitive, whereas word-only models treat all out-of-vocabulary combinations alike [4], [8]. While low WER is necessary, low sensitivity is particularly important for defense, and there is often a trade-off between the two [10].\n\nIn summary, under different backoff strategies, Word Error Rate tends to be lowest for the Neutral variant in both closed and open vocabulary models under attack, while sensitivity varies considerably, with open vocabulary models showing much higher sensitivity for the Pass-through variant compared to closed vocabulary models and other backoff strategies."}

This decline in net income was related to a decrease in operating income [2]. Operating income decreased by 19% in 2020 [2], and factors such as government regulations impacting revenue due to COVID-19 resurgences were expected to have a negative impact [1]. However, the 2020 results included $268 million of net strategic gains, primarily from the sale of McDonald's Japan stock, which reduced the Company's ownership by about 6% [7]. In contrast, 2019 results included $74 million of net strategic charges [2].\n\nThe change in total other comprehensive income (loss) also contributed to the difference in comprehensive income. Total other comprehensive income shifted from a gain of $126.8 million in 2019 to a loss of ($104.1) million in 2020 ![A table showing Net Income, Other Comprehensive Income components, and Comprehensive Income for 2020, 2019, and 2018](image5). This swing was mainly influenced by changes in cash flow hedges, which resulted in a loss of ($123.3) million in 2020 compared to a loss of ($20.4) million in 2019, and foreign currency translation adjustments, which resulted in a gain of $63.1 million in 2020 compared to a gain of $174.3 million in 2019 ![A table showing Net Income, Other Comprehensive Income components, and Comprehensive Income for 2020, 2019, and 2018](image5). Foreign exchange rates also impacted total assets in 2020 [4].\n\nOverall, McDonald's comprehensive income in 2020 was lower than in the previous two years, primarily due to a decrease in net income partly offset by strategic gains, and a negative shift in other comprehensive income."}

Quaker Foods North America (QFNA) had relatively stable net revenue, with operating profit showing a slight decline in 2020. PepsiCo Beverages North America (PBNA) saw a modest increase in net revenue but a decrease in operating profit in 2020 compared to 2019. Internationally, Latin America (LatAm) had fluctuating net revenue and a decrease in operating profit in 2020, while Europe, Africa, Middle East, South Asia (AMESA), and Asia Pacific (APAC) all demonstrated increases in both net revenue and operating profit over the period, with particularly strong profit growth in 2020 for Europe, AMESA, and APAC.\n\n![The table presents the percentage distribution of beverage and food/snack categories across various regions and PepsiCo for the years 2020, 2019, and 2018](image3)\n\nLooking at the composition of net revenue by category, LatAm, AMESA, and APAC divisions are significantly weighted towards food and snack products, representing 90%, 70%, and 75% respectively of revenue in 2020. Europe has a more balanced split, with beverage contributing 55% and food/snack 45% in 2020. The consolidated PepsiCo figure shows a 45% beverage and 55% food/snack split. The performance trends across these divisions do not show a clear correlation solely based on their beverage or food/snack focus, as divisions heavily weighted to food/snack (AMESA, APAC) showed strong growth, while another (LatAm) saw profit decline in 2020, and Europe (more balanced) also grew strongly.\n\nOperating profit changes are influenced by various factors beyond just net revenue growth. An increase in operating profit can reflect net revenue growth and productivity savings, while decreases can be driven by operating cost increases and higher advertising and marketing expenses [6], [9]. Additionally, effective net pricing and the mix of products sold also impact net revenue [4].\n\nSpecifically for 2020, operating profit includes certain pre-tax charges related to the COVID-19 pandemic [1].\n\n![The table presents financial data for different regions of a company in 2020, detailing COVID-19 related charges such as allowances for expected credit losses, upfront payments to customers, inventory write-downs, employee compensation, employee protection costs, and other items](image2)\n\nThese charges, detailed by division, impacted 2020 performance. PBNA had the highest total charge ($304 million), followed by FLNA ($229 million), LatAm ($102 million), and Europe ($88 million). These significant charges in 2020 partially explain the profit declines in PBNA and LatAm, despite revenue changes, and likely reduced the extent of profit increases in other divisions compared to what they would have been otherwise. The changing retail landscape, including e-commerce growth and consolidation, and the importance of major customers like Walmart, which represented approximately 14% of consolidated net revenue in 2020 and impacts divisions like FLNA, QFNA, and PBNA, also factor into divisional performance [10].\n\nChanges in net revenue and operating profit across divisions from 2018 to 2020 varied significantly and do not appear to be solely dictated by the beverage versus food/snack distribution, but were influenced by factors including revenue growth, productivity, costs, pricing, mix, retail landscape changes, and specific charges incurred in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic."}

Additionally, cash outflows also increased by €117 million for additions to intangible assets and property, plant, and equipment, largely due to investments aimed at capacity expansions [6]. The table showing additions to intangible assets and property, plant, and equipment confirms this increase, showing €674 million in 2021 versus €557 million in 2020 ![The table displays cash flow data focusing on operating activities, additions to long-term assets, and free cash flow for fiscal years 2021 and 2020.](image2).\n\nIn contrast, cash flows from financing activities experienced a dramatic shift, changing by €12,087 million to a positive figure of €11,839 million in 2021, strongly influenced by the financing of the Varian acquisition [5]. This is evident in the reported cash flows from financing activities of €11,839 million in 2021, compared to an outflow of -€249 million in 2020 ![The table shows key cash flow data for fiscal years 2021 and 2020, highlighting significant changes in investing and financing activities.](image4). The positive figure includes significant inflows from borrowings totaling US$10.0 billion and an additional €850 million financing from the Siemens Group in 2021, both aimed at financing the Varian acquisition [8]. The acquisition was also financed by issuing new shares, which resulted in equity rising substantially and increased issued capital and capital reserve [3]. The equity details table shows the increase in issued capital from €1,075 million in 2020 to €1,128 million in 2021 and capital reserve from €13,476 million to €15,818 million ![The table details the composition of equity for Siemens Healthineers AG as of September 30 for 2021 and 2020, showing increases in issued capital and capital reserve.](image3). These large inflows were partly offset by cash outflows from the repayment of matured loans and increased share repurchases (€203 million increase in treasury shares in 2021), primarily to fulfill share-based payment programs based on Siemens Healthineers AG shares [8, 7]. Further outflows resulted from dividends paid to shareholders, amounting to €856 million in 2021 [9].\n\nSiemens Healthineers' cash flows from investing activities saw a significant increase in outflows primarily due to the Varian acquisition and higher capital expenditures, while cash flows from financing activities shifted from an outflow to a large inflow mainly driven by financing the Varian acquisition through borrowings and share issuance."}

These changes in financial assumptions, including discount rates, and other remeasurements like actuarial gains and losses, are recognized in other comprehensive income [5].\n\nChanges in financial assumptions led to actuarial losses of €26 million in 2021 and gains of €72 million in 2020, directly impacting the total actuarial gains and losses reported."}

The shift from a foreign tax benefit to a provision indicates that specific tax events or positions favorable in 2019 likely did not recur or were reversed in subsequent years, coupled with the increased profitability leading to higher taxable income. This trend could influence the company's financial strategy by potentially increasing focus on international markets for growth while also highlighting the importance of managing complex foreign tax regulations and risks, such as navigating refund claims in Korea [1], maintaining compliance with requirements for tax incentives like those in Singapore [4], and considering potential withholding taxes on undistributed foreign earnings [7].\n\nBetween 2019 and 2021, foreign income before taxes and the foreign tax provision both saw significant increases, with the provision shifting from a benefit to an expense as foreign profitability grew."}

This balance represented client assets managed or sub-advised across various categories like equity, fixed income, and money market funds [9].\n\n![The table shows the activity and balances of WFAM assets under management over three years, including the impact of the sale in 2021.](image1)\n\nThe activity during the year ended December 31, 2021, included inflows of $69.3 billion, outflows of $96.8 billion, and a positive market impact of $11.6 billion. However, the sale of WFAM on November 1, 2021, accounted for a significant reduction of $(587.1) billion [image1], effectively transferring the majority of these assets out of Wells Fargo's management.\n\nRegarding available-for-sale (AFS) debt securities, the portfolio saw a decrease in amortized cost and a notable reduction in net unrealized gains. The amortized cost, net of the allowance for credit losses, of AFS and held-to-maturity (HTM) debt securities combined increased, driven by continued purchases and HTM securitizations, which offset portfolio runoff and AFS sales [3]. However, looking specifically at AFS securities, the amortized cost net at December 31, 2021, was $175,463 million, down from $215,533 million at December 31, 2020 [image4].\n\n![The table compares the amortized cost, net unrealized gains, and fair value for Available-for-sale and Held-to-maturity securities at December 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020.](image4)\n\nFurthermore, $56.0 billion of AFS debt securities were transferred to HTM debt securities in 2021 for capital management purposes [3].

This overall change reflects movements in various balance sheet components [3], including loans and investment securities. Commercial loans saw an increase, predominantly in the commercial and industrial portfolio, driven by higher demand and originations [1]. Conversely, consumer loans decreased, mainly due to paydowns in the residential mortgage portfolio and the transfer of loans to held for sale, though partially offset by new originations [1]. Overall total loans showed an increase of $7,757$ million from the prior year-end [image4]. The portfolio of available-for-sale (AFS) and held-to-maturity (HTM) debt securities is actively managed for liquidity and interest rate risk [8]. The amortized cost of these securities increased from December 31, 2020, as purchases more than offset runoff and sales, including a transfer of $56.0$ billion of AFS securities to HTM in 2021 for capital management purposes [9]. The net unrealized gains on these securities decreased due to higher interest rates [2], but $98\\%$ of the combined portfolio was rated AA- or above at December 31, 2021 [7]. The management of the AFS and HTM portfolios allows the Company to rebalance its interest rate risk profile in response to market conditions [8].\n\nIn contrast to the active management of the loan and securities portfolios, a major strategic shift occurred with Wells Fargo Asset Management (WFAM). An agreement to sell WFAM was announced in February 2021, and the business was moved to Corporate [6]. The sale closed on November 1, 2021 [6, 10]. Prior to the sale, WFAM generated fees from managing assets [10], and management considered AUM a useful metric for assessing the impact on asset-based fees [4]. The sale significantly impacted the WFAM assets under management balance, as shown in `![The table shows WFAM assets under management activity, including the impact of the sale in 2021.](image5)`.\n\nThe changes in total assets and WFAM assets under management indicate a financial strategy focused on active management of the core banking balance sheet, including loans and investment securities for liquidity and risk objectives, alongside a strategic decision to exit the asset management business through the sale of WFAM."}

For the Euro area, which includes Germany, the discount rate was 1.0% in fiscal year 2021 and 0.9% in 2020. For the U.S. dollar area, the rate was higher, standing at 2.7% in 2021 and 2.4% in 2020 ![{The table presents percentage rates for different financial indicators as of September 30 for the years 2021 and 2020, including discount rates for Euro and U.S. dollar.}](image4).\n\nRegarding pension progression, the assumption for Germany was 1.5% for both 2021 and 2020 ![{The table provides data on compensation increases and pension progression rates for two different years, 2021 and 2020, including pension progression for Germany.}](image1).

This overall increase was primarily driven by an increase in commercial loans, which grew from $478,417 million to $513,120 million [Image 5]. Specifically, the commercial and industrial loan portfolio saw growth due to higher demand, leading to increased originations and draws [1]. Conversely, consumer loans decreased during the same period, falling from $409,220 million to $382,274 million [Image 5]. This decline in consumer loans was largely attributed to a decrease in the residential mortgage – first lien portfolio, resulting from loan paydowns driven by the low interest rate environment and the transfer of $17.8 billion of these loans to loans held for sale [1].\n\nTotal deposits increased by 6% from December 31, 2020, to December 31, 2021, reaching $1,482,479 million from $1,404,381 million ![The table shows a breakdown of deposits by type and their amounts for December 31, 2021, and 2020, highlighting the percentage composition and year-over-year changes.](image1). The increase in total deposits [5] included a significant 13% rise in noninterest-bearing demand deposits and a 9% increase in savings deposits [Image 1]. However, time deposits saw a substantial 41% decrease, and interest-bearing deposits in non-U.S. offices declined by 44% [Image 1]. These decreases in certain deposit categories, specifically time deposits and interest-bearing deposits in non-U.S. offices, were a result of actions taken to manage under the asset cap [10].\n\nBased on these changes, the financial entity appears to have strategically focused on growing its commercial loan portfolio while reducing its exposure to certain consumer loan types, particularly residential mortgages, potentially through sales [1]. On the funding side, despite an overall increase in deposits, the entity actively managed its liabilities by reducing higher-cost or potentially restricted deposit types, such as time deposits and non-U.S. deposits, likely influenced by regulatory constraints like the asset cap [10, Image 1]. This suggests a strategy aimed at optimizing the balance sheet structure within regulatory parameters, favoring growth in commercial lending and relying more on stable, lower-cost deposit types like noninterest-bearing demand and savings deposits.\n\nFrom December 31, 2020, to December 31, 2021, loans increased slightly driven by commercial loan growth offset by a decrease in consumer loans, while total deposits increased significantly with a notable shift away from time and non-U.S. interest-bearing deposits towards demand and savings deposits, indicating a strategic focus on commercial lending growth and deposit mix optimization influenced by asset cap management."}

Notably, performance in Global Markets was achieved with a decrease in Risk Weighted Assets (RWAs) and no increase in trading value at risk (VaR), contributing to gross RWA reductions of $37bn globally [4].\n\nFor the Corporate Centre, there was a change in allocation in 2020, where revenue and expenses relating to Markets Treasury, the funding costs of HSBC Holdings debt, and impacts of hyperinflation in Argentina were allocated to global businesses from 1 January 2020, with all comparatives restated accordingly [3, 9]. This included certain funding costs that were retained in Corporate Centre during 2019 but allocated out in 2020 [9]. The management view of adjusted revenue for categories typically related to the Corporate Centre showed net operating income increased by $392 million (60%) from -$654m in 2019 to -$262m in 2020, driven by improvements in Other and Legacy portfolios revenue, while Central Treasury revenue decreased ![Management view of adjusted revenue showed improvements in net operating income for Central Treasury, Legacy portfolios, and Other](image2). For a segment likely representing the Corporate Centre, the adjusted financial results showed significant improvements in 2020 compared to 2019: Net operating income increased by $392 million (60%) to $(262) million, and profit before tax increased by $387 million (42%) to $1,311 million ![Adjusted financial results for a segment showed increases in profit before tax and net operating income](image3).

The primary driver for this decline was a significant decrease in interest and other investment income, which fell by $470 million (44.4%) from 2020 to 2021 [2]. This decline was mainly due to lower income generated from short-term investments and fixed maturity securities, a consequence of low interest rates that persisted throughout 2021 [2, 3].

The division also managed Risk Weighted Assets, delivering around $37 billion of RWA reductions globally in 2020 [1], [7].\n\nFrom 2019 to 2020, the Global Banking and Markets division saw its net operating income increase due to strong Global Markets performance, while its profit before tax decreased primarily because of significantly higher expected credit losses, partly offset by lower operating expenses."}

While recognizing that gender diversity has been an issue, particularly at Toyota Motor Corporation in Japan [3], the company has committed to continuing initiatives that promote women's participation and advancement so that the percentage of positions held by women, from initial hiring to executive levels, will consistently increase across its operations [10]. Toyota aims to enhance company competitiveness by placing the right person in the right position regardless of factors like gender or nationality [5].\n\nInitiatives began at Toyota Motor Corporation in Japan in 2002, centered on expanding and establishing measures to support women balancing work and childcare, followed by a focus in 2012 on creating a work environment supporting women's motivation and participation, especially the development of female managers [4]. Globally, efforts to promote female employee participation include various regional initiatives. `![Initiatives to promote female employee participation at major global Toyota operations](image1)` For example, in Europe, activities range from International Women's Day events and workshops to support for working couples (like home-working and part-time regimes), female career development through mentorship, networking for gender diversity, training in unconscious bias, and setting employment and management targets. In China, lactating female employees are allowed a breastfeeding break of up to one hour each day. In South Africa, leadership workshops are held to ensure the acceptance and promotion of women in the workplace, along with setting employment targets [image1]. These initiatives contribute to increasing the representation of women across the company.\n\nThe current state of female participation varies across regions and roles, as shown by recent data. `![Data on percentage of women in various employment categories and average period of employment globally](image2)` Globally, women constitute 28.7% of people hired, 16.6% of full-time employees, 15.1% of managerial positions, and 11.8% of director positions [image2]. These figures differ significantly by location, highlighting the areas where further progress is needed [image2]. Toyota also focuses on ensuring diversity in recruitment by emphasizing empathy and passion, and has increased mid-career hires to introduce external knowledge and promote the reexamination of work processes and workstyles [6].\n\nToyota supports female employee participation and diversity through global initiatives, specific regional programs, and targeted recruitment efforts aimed at increasing representation and creating a supportive environment."}

An increase in the discount rate decreases the present value of future obligations, which can lead to an actuarial gain and improve the funded status of the plan [4]. The expected return on plan assets assumption affects the defined benefit expense recognized in the net periodic benefit cost, particularly since many plans are partially funded [1]. However, the funded status, or net amount recognized on the balance sheet, is primarily influenced by changes in benefit obligations (significantly impacted by discount rates) and the actual return on plan assets ![{This table shows the change in benefit obligation and plan assets, as well as the funded status for Pension and Other Retiree Benefits for 2022 and 2021}](image3).\n\nThe net amount recognized on the balance sheet represents the funded status of the plans ![{This table presents the net amount recognized for Pension Benefits and Other Retiree Benefits on the balance sheet as of June 30, 2022 and 2021}](image5).

This increase in the net asset position is also primarily due to the higher discount rate, although partially offset by other factors such as unfavorable medical claim experience in 2022 [4]. While the expected return assumption impacts periodic expense [1], the notable improvement in the net amount recognized (funded status) from 2021 to 2022 for both plan types appears predominantly driven by the increase in discount rates.\n\nFrom 2021 to 2022, pension discount rates increased by 2.0% and OPRB discount rates increased by 1.8%, while the pension expected return decreased by 1.0% and the OPRB expected return remained flat, with the increase in discount rates being the primary driver behind the significant improvement in the net amount recognized (funded status) for both plans."}

A major transaction impacting equity in 2021 was the acquisition of treasury shares, which led to a substantial decrease in the Treasury Shares component (from RMB (134) million to RMB (3,660) million) [Image1]. Transactions involving non-controlling interests also impacted equity, with contributions from non-controlling interests increasing their share and acquisitions of non-controlling interests affecting Additional Paid-in Capital and the Non-Controlling Interests balance [Image3, Image1]. For instance, the company acquired 100% equity interest in Shenzhen Lanren in March 2021 [4], which could involve adjustments to non-controlling interests depending on the structure.\n\nThe main drivers of equity changes were profit for the year, comprehensive income components (fair value changes, currency translation), share-based compensation, exercise of share awards, the acquisition of treasury shares, and transactions with non-controlling interests.\n\nThe major transactions affecting equity components over 2020 and 2021 were primarily the generation of profit, fluctuations in fair value and currency exchange rates, share-based compensation and option exercises, the acquisition of treasury shares, and transactions with non-controlling interests."}

The Media segment saw revenue increase by 20.3% to $22.8 billion, or 11.0% excluding the 2021 Tokyo Olympics broadcast revenue, primarily due to increases in distribution revenue, advertising revenue, and other revenue, influenced by the effects of COVID-19 in the prior year [1]. However, despite this revenue growth, the Media segment's Adjusted EBITDA decreased by 18.0%, also impacted by the Olympics broadcast in 2021 [1]. Within Media, Peacock generated significant revenue, growing from $118 million in 2020 to $778 million in 2021, reflecting investment in content and customer base growth [1], [9]. While growing its customer base [1], the Media segment anticipates a decline in network subscribers and audience ratings due to competition and changing consumption patterns [9].\n\nThe Studios segment experienced a 16.2% increase in revenue to $9.4 billion, driven by increases in content licensing, theatrical revenue, and home entertainment and other revenue as production operations returned to full capacity [1]. This revenue growth contributed positively to the segment's financial performance.\n\nThe Theme Parks segment showed a dramatic recovery, with revenue increasing 141.2% to $5.1 billion and Adjusted EBITDA improving from a loss of $(0.5) billion to a gain of $1.3 billion [1]. This massive improvement reflects the return to operation compared to temporary closures and capacity restrictions due to COVID-19 in the prior period, along with the opening of the Beijing park [1]. The return of customers to the parks directly fueled this significant financial turnaround.\n\nOverall, NBCUniversal's financial performance was impacted by revenue growth in Media (offset by Olympic costs and Peacock investment), strong revenue recovery and associated EBITDA improvement in Theme Parks as customers returned, and revenue growth in Studios from increased content creation and licensing."}

This suggests significant cost reductions or other non-volume/revenue benefits outweighed the negative impact of the volume decline on profitability.\n\nOverall cash flow activities at the company level were also affected by regional events. Net cash used in investing activities decreased, partially due to the 2019 deconsolidation of RBH [1]. Net cash provided by operating activities saw a slight decrease, influenced by higher working capital requirements, including inventory build-up related to the pandemic and excise tax timing [5, 7], and higher cash payments for asset impairment and exit costs related to manufacturing optimization in various locations, including Argentina and Colombia [3, 7]. ![Consolidated net cash provided by operating activities decreased slightly from $10,090 million in 2019 to $9,812 million in 2020](image5).\n\nChanges in shipment volumes, notably the overall decline despite HTU growth, directly led to lower net revenues in Latin America & Canada, but significant favorable cost/other factors drove a substantial increase in operating income for the segment from 2019 to 2020, while region-specific events like the RBH deconsolidation and asset impairment impacted overall cash flow."}

Net income for the segment fluctuated considerably over this period, reporting $8,872 million in 2019, a loss of $(1,671) million in 2020, and rebounding to $7,720 million in 2021.\n\n![The table shows net income, revenue, expenses, and other financial figures for different business segments of a company over three years (2019, 2020, and 2021), including Consumer Banking and Lending.](image3)\n\nThe overall financial performance in 2021 compared to 2020 showed increased total revenue due to higher gains from equity securities and mortgage banking income, partially offset by lower net interest income [6]. Noninterest income included higher mortgage banking income [8], higher card fees driven by increased purchase and transaction volumes [8], and higher deposit-related fees reflecting higher consumer transaction volumes after the economic slowdown in 2020 [8]. However, lower net interest income in 2021 compared to 2020 reflected factors like lower interest rates, lower loan balances, elevated prepayments and refinancing, and the sale of the student loan portfolio [7].\n\nSelected balance sheet data provides further insight into the segment's activity. Total average loans for the Consumer Banking and Lending businesses, which include Home Lending, Auto, Credit Card, Small Business, and Personal Lending [10], decreased from 2019 through 2021. Average loans were $597.5 billion in 2019, $580.5 billion in 2020, and $531.3 billion in 2021.\n\n![The table contains average and period-end balance sheet data, including loans by line of business (Home Lending, Auto, Credit Card, Small Business, Personal Lending) and total deposits, for the years ending December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019.](image4)\n\nThis decrease in loans was attributed to paydowns exceeding originations [9]. Specific factors impacting loan balances included lower loan balances reflecting lower demand, elevated prepayments and refinancing activity, and the sale of the student loan portfolio in the first half of 2021 [7]. Additionally, Home Lending balances were impacted by temporary curtailment of certain non-conforming originations and suspension of home equity originations in 2020, while Small Business balances saw a decline in PPP loans [9].\n\nConversely, total average deposits for the Consumer Banking and Lending segment increased significantly over the same period. Average deposits grew from $769.0 billion in 2019 to $909.0 billion in 2020 and further to $1,100.0 billion in 2021. This increase was driven by higher levels of liquidity and savings for consumer customers, reflecting government stimulus programs, payment deferral programs, and continued economic uncertainty associated with the COVID-19 pandemic [3]. While deposits grew, net interest income was partially offset by a lower deposit spread [1].\n\n![The table is a financial summary including categories like Net interest income, Noninterest income (Deposit-related fees, Card fees, Mortgage banking), Total revenue, and Selected Metrics for the years 2021, 2020, and 2019.](image1)\n\nKey changes in loans involved a notable decrease driven by various factors including lower demand, prepayments, and specific portfolio actions, while deposits saw a substantial increase primarily due to external economic and governmental factors.\n\nFrom 2019 to 2021, net income for Consumer Banking and Lending shifted from a strong profit in 2019 to a loss in 2020, recovering significantly in 2021, while average loans decreased and average deposits substantially increased over the period."}

However, lower cost of funds also contributed to the increase in Net Interest Income [10].\n\nTotal revenues net of interest expense showed significant growth, increasing from $10,619 million in 2020 to $12,500 million in 2021, reflecting double-digit growth across all non-interest revenue lines [6], [image1]. This increase was primarily driven by higher Discount revenue, which grew 21 percent primarily due to an increase in commercial billed business [3], [5], and Net card fees, which increased due to growth in premium card portfolios, new acquisitions, and high retention [3], [6], [8]. Billed business overall increased by 21% from 2020 to 2021 [image4].\n\nA major positive impact on financial performance came from Provisions for credit losses, which decreased significantly, resulting in a net benefit of $438 million in 2021 compared to a provision of $1,493 million in 2020 [2], [9], [image1]. This reserve release was largely due to improved portfolio quality and macroeconomic outlook, including improvement in unemployment rate projections, and lower net write-offs [2], [9]. Despite the increase in outstanding balances of loans and receivables, reserve releases were a primary driver of the improvement in credit loss provisions [2], [9]. Net write-off rates on Card Member Receivables decreased substantially from 2019 to 2021 [image3].\n\nOperating expenses increased, including marketing, business development, and Card Member rewards and services expenses [4], [image1]. Increased marketing investments aimed to build growth momentum, while higher billed business and redemptions in travel-related categories drove up rewards expense [4]. Salaries and employee benefits also increased [1].\n\nThe combination of strong revenue growth (particularly non-interest revenues), significantly reduced provisions for credit losses (resulting in a net benefit), partially offset by increased operating expenses, led to a substantial increase in pretax segment income from $936 million in 2020 to $2,928 million in 2021 [image1].\n\nFrom 2019 to 2021, Average Card Member loans and Net Interest Income both increased, and while higher paydown rates affected yields, overall revenues grew significantly, and a substantial reduction in credit loss provisions contributed heavily to improved financial performance."}

Similar to the EU, this region experienced lower cigarette shipment volume, decreasing by 7.1% [image1 shows cigarette volume declining from 100,644 to 93,462 million units]. This decline in cigarette volume, mainly in Russia and Ukraine, was primarily due to a lower total market and lower cigarette market share [7].\n\nThis decline was offset by a substantial increase in heated tobacco unit shipment volume across Eastern Europe, which rose by 55.3% [image1 shows HTU volume increasing from 13,453 to 20,898 million units]. This growth was notable in Russia and Ukraine [7, 9], and in Russia specifically, heated tobacco units drove a higher overall market share [8]. The favorable pricing variance also contributed to revenues in Russia and Ukraine [4].\n\nFrom 2019 to 2020, cigarette shipment volumes decreased significantly in both the European Union and Eastern Europe, while heated tobacco unit shipment volumes increased substantially in both regions, driving market share gains for heated tobacco units."}

This increase in comprehensive income in 2020 compared to 2019 was approximately $3.6 billion [1]. A primary driver for this change was a gain on foreign currency translation adjustments in 2020, amounting to approximately $2.9 billion, contrasting sharply with a translation loss of $75 million in 2019 [1] ![The table summarizes comprehensive income and its components for 2018, 2019, and 2020, showing net earnings and other comprehensive income items.](image1).\n\nHigher net earnings also contributed to the rise in comprehensive income [1]. Net earnings from continuing operations were approximately $3.6 billion for 2020, compared to approximately $2.4 billion for 2019 [6]. This increase in net earnings in 2020 stemmed from higher sales in existing businesses and net earnings generated by the Cytiva acquisition [6], which contributed 18.0% to the sales increase in 2020 [4]. Additionally, a pretax gain of $455 million from the sale of certain product lines in the second quarter of 2020 boosted net earnings [3, 9]. Non-cash items like increased depreciation, amortization, and stock compensation expense also influenced the reconciliation between net earnings and cash flow [8], with the increase in depreciation and amortization primarily attributed to the Cytiva Acquisition [8].\n\nOther factors impacting comprehensive income included a decrease in the loss from cash flow hedge adjustments in 2020 compared to 2019 [1] ![The table summarizes comprehensive income and its components for 2018, 2019, and 2020, showing net earnings and other comprehensive income items.](image1).

The company continued to hold substantial balances of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term U.S. Treasury Bills [2], which amounted to $90,688 thousand at the end of 2021 compared to $67,082 thousand at the end of 2020 ![{The table shows balances of cash, cash equivalents, U.S. Treasury Bills, equity securities, and fixed maturity securities for 2021 and 2020.}](image5), but the low rates earned on these assets contributed to the reduced interest income [2].\n\nIn contrast, railroad operating earnings experienced a substantial increase from 2020 to 2021, rising from $7,042 million to $8,756 million. ![{The table displays railroad operating revenues, operating expenses, and earnings for 2021, 2020, and 2019.}](image1) This increase reflects a recovery from the significant economic slowdown caused by the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, which had adversely affected volumes [7]. Railroad operating revenues increased 11.6% in 2021 compared to 2020 [7], largely due to a 6.9% increase in total volume [7, image3]. Specific categories like coal saw a 8.9% volume increase contributing to a 21.5% revenue increase [5, image3], and agricultural products saw a 2.9% volume increase leading to a 5.8% revenue increase [10, image3]. Additionally, average revenue per car/unit increased by 3.5% in 2021 [7], driven by business mix changes and higher fuel surcharge revenue attributable to higher fuel prices [7]. While railroad operating expenses also increased by $1.3 billion (10.2%) in 2021 compared to 2020 due to higher volumes and higher average fuel prices [4], the growth in revenues outpaced expenses. This strong revenue growth, driven by volume recovery and higher prices, resulted in the significant increase in railroad operating earnings.\n\nNet investment income decreased from 2020 to 2021 primarily due to lower interest income, while railroad operating earnings increased significantly due to volume recovery and higher revenues following the pandemic impact in 2020."}

While total deferred tax assets before the valuation allowance slightly decreased from $662 million in 2019 to $645 million in 2020, primarily due to reductions in deferred loss and tax credit carryforwards, accrued expenses, stock compensation, and inventories, the valuation allowance remained relatively stable, decreasing by $1 million in 2020 [8]. The major driver of the increase in the net deferred tax asset was the substantial decrease in total deferred tax liabilities, which fell from $363 million in 2019 to $213 million in 2020.\n\nA significant factor impacting tax positions and, consequently, deferred taxes, was the change in liabilities for uncertain tax positions. The balance of these liabilities decreased dramatically from $303 million as of December 31, 2019, to $89 million as of December 31, 2020. ![{The table tracks the changes in uncertain tax position balances from 2018 to 2020, showing a sharp decrease in the balance at December 31, 2020.}](image4) This reduction was largely driven by reductions for tax positions of prior years, including a $249 million tax benefit recorded for the effective settlement of a depreciation-related uncertain tax position in 2020 [3]. If recognized, uncertain tax positions are typically comprised of positions that would lower the effective tax rate [3]. The impact of changes in uncertain tax positions on the effective tax rate contributed (4.0)% in 2020, a notable change compared to previous years. ![{The table shows components of the effective tax rate, including the impact of changes in uncertain tax positions.}](image1) Related to the settled uncertain tax position, accrued interest of $46 million was reversed and included in other income and expense (OI&E) [3]. Image 4 shows interest payable related to uncertain tax positions decreased from $44 million to $8 million during 2020, and interest income recognized was $39 million. These changes in uncertain tax positions and the related benefit significantly influenced the deferred tax provision, contributing to a U.S. federal deferred tax benefit of ($122) million in 2020, compared to a $25 million expense in 2019. ![{The table details current and deferred tax provisions by jurisdiction for 2020, 2019, and 2018.}](image5) The decrease in uncertain tax position liabilities and the related tax benefit recognized in 2020, coupled with the decrease in other deferred tax liabilities like those related to property, plant, equipment, and acquisition-related intangibles, were the primary factors increasing the net deferred tax asset.\n\nChanges in tax positions and related settlements, particularly the effective settlement of a depreciation-related uncertain tax position resulting in a significant tax benefit, substantially decreased deferred tax liabilities and contributed to the increase in the net deferred tax asset between 2019 and 2020."}

A significant contributor to the decrease in total debt was the Global Financing segment, where debt decreased by $3,560 million, or $3,905 million adjusting for currency, falling from $24,727 million to $21,167 million [6, image4]. This reduction in Global Financing debt was linked to lower funding requirements due to a decline in financing assets, consistent with the company's portfolio management strategy [6]. These financing assets predominantly support external clients and assets under contract by other IBM units [3]. The decline in financing receivables also contributed to a decrease of $6,245 million in cash provided by net non-operating finance receivables, driven by the wind down of OEM IT commercial financing operations [8]. This shift in underlying financing assets and associated debt significantly impacted cash flow from financing activities, which transitioned from a net source of $9,042 million in 2019 to a net use of $9,721 million in 2020, representing an $18,763 million year-to-year change [10, image3]. Meanwhile, total equity decreased by $258 million, mainly due to dividends paid, partially offset by net income [7]. ![The table shows total company debt and Global Financing segment debt decreased from 2019 to 2020.](image4) ![The table shows that financing activities were a net source of cash in 2019 but became a net use of cash in 2020.](image3) The Global Financing segment, measured as a stand-alone entity, includes interest expense related to its debt [1], and its return on equity remained stable at 25.8% in both 2019 and 2020, despite a decrease in average equity [image1]. The provision for expected credit losses for Global Financing increased in 2020 compared to a release in 2019 [2], with the ending balance of $263 million in 2020 reflecting $32 million in additions during the year [image5]. ![The table shows noncurrent assets and long-term debt increased slightly from 2019 to 2020.](image2)\n\nThe increase in noncurrent assets and long-term debt occurred alongside a decrease in total debt, reflecting a strategic reduction in Global Financing debt tied to winding down certain financing operations, which significantly impacted the cash flow profile from financing activities."}

Outstanding balances in the credit card portfolio also decreased, falling by $18.9 billion to $78.7 billion, a change attributed to lower retail spending and higher payments [4]. This is further supported by the overall Total Credit Card Purchase Volumes metric decreasing from $277,852 million in 2019 to $251,599 million in 2020, alongside a significant drop in new credit card accounts from 4,320 thousand to 2,505 thousand in the same period. ![Image showing Total Credit Card metrics including decreasing purchase volumes and decreasing new accounts from 2019 to 2020.](image2). Interestingly, net charge-offs and past due credit card loans decreased, which was linked to government stimulus benefits and payment deferrals [4].\n\nHome equity production also experienced a decrease, falling by $3.0 billion in 2020, driven primarily by a decline in applications [5].

Future revenues from assets, projects, or mines are partially based on the market price of minerals, metals, or petroleum, which can vary significantly and, if materially adverse, impact the feasibility or continuation of operations [4]. The estimated impact of commodity price changes on financial measures illustrates this sensitivity, with differing levels of impact across various commodities on both profit after taxation and underlying EBITDA.\n\n![The table shows the financial impact of changes in commodity prices on profit after taxation and underlying EBITDA for oil, copper, iron ore, metallurgical coal, energy coal, and nickel, quantified per unit price increase.](image1)\n\nFor Coal, Underlying EBITDA saw a significant decrease of US$1.3 billion to US$288 million [2]. This decline was primarily attributed to lower price impacts, net of price-linked costs, accounting for US$0.7 billion of the decrease, alongside lower volumes [2]. Historical data supports this, showing average realised prices for Metallurgical Coal falling from $130.97 per tonne in FY2020 to $106.64 per tonne in FY2021, and Hard Coking Coal prices decreasing from $143.65 to $112.72 per tonne over the same period. ![This table presents financial and production data for a company for the years ended June 30, 2021, and 2020, showing decreases in revenue, underlying EBITDA, and average realised prices for coal.](image2) Controllable cash costs also increased, driven by higher maintenance costs and increased stripping volumes, although cost reduction initiatives provided some offset [2]. This cost increase is reflected in the higher cost per tonne for both Queensland Coal and NSWEC between FY2020 and FY2021. ![The table compares the financial and operational performance of Queensland Coal and NSWEC over fiscal years 2020 and 2021, showing decreases in revenue and EBITDA and increases in cost per tonne for both segments.](image5) Expected unit costs for Queensland Coal in FY2022 are also forecast to be higher due to anticipated increased diesel prices [6].\n\nIn contrast, Underlying EBITDA for Nickel West increased by US$296 million to US$259 million in FY2021, reflecting higher prices and volumes [1]. The average realised sales price for nickel rose significantly from US$13,860 per tonne in FY2020 to US\\$16,250 per tonne in FY2021 [10]. Key drivers behind the higher nickel price included positive investor sentiment, a strong rebound in end-use demand across different regions, multi-region supply disruptions, and falling London Metal Exchange stocks, despite a brief correction following an announcement by a major producer regarding conversion of nickel pig iron to nickel matte [10]. The positive impact of higher prices was partially offset by unfavourable exchange rate movements and increased third-party concentrate purchase costs, which rose due to the stronger nickel price [1].\n\nChanges in commodity prices significantly impact BHP's financial results, with lower coal prices and increased costs negatively affecting Coal's EBITDA, while higher nickel prices, driven by market demand and supply factors, positively impacted Nickel West's EBITDA."}

A comprehensive overview of these changes is presented in the consolidated statements of changes in equity [2].\n\n![The table details changes in equity components over time for Siemens Healthineers AG](image5). This table shows that **Issued Capital** increased from €1,000 million on October 1, 2019, to €1,128 million by September 30, 2021. This increase is primarily due to two capital increases. In September 2020, 75,000,000 new shares were issued [5]. Subsequently, in March 2021, the issued capital was increased by €53,000,000 from €1,075,000,000 to €1,128,000,000 through the issuance of 53,000,000 new shares, partially utilizing the Authorized Capital 2021 [4]. Each share has a notional value of €1.00 [3].\n\nA notably significant change occurred in the **Capital Reserve**, which saw a substantial increase from €7,308 million on October 1, 2019, to €12,257 million by September 30, 2021. This rise is largely attributable to the premiums received from the aforementioned share issuances. The March 2021 capital increase alone resulted in a €2,284 million increase in capital reserves [9], alongside the €53 million increase in subscribed capital [9]. Similarly, the September 2020 issuance significantly contributed to the capital reserve due to the placement price being well above the notional value per share [5].\n\n**Retained Earnings** showed a more modest net increase over the period, moving from €3,040 million to €3,248 million. This account is influenced by net income and dividend distributions. Net income was €1,423 million in 2020 and €1,746 million in 2021 [![The table displays comprehensive income data for two fiscal years, 2021 and 2020, in millions of euros (€)](image1). However, a dividend distribution for fiscal year 2020 decreased unappropriated net income by €856 million [9].\n\nThe value of **Treasury Shares at Cost** significantly increased in magnitude (as a deduction from equity) from €0 million on October 1, 2019, to -€1,793 million by September 30, 2021. This indicates substantial share buybacks during the period [9].\n\nOther components of equity, including currency translation differences, cash flow hedges, and reserves for equity instruments, also fluctuated, resulting in a net increase in the **Other Components of Equity** line item in Image 5 from €1,121 million to €1,728 million over the two years.\n\nOverall, the **Total Equity Attributable to Shareholders** saw a substantial increase from €12,469 million on October 1, 2019, to €16,568 million on September 30, 2021. Total equity rose by €3,828 million to €16,339 million as of September 30, 2021, mainly driven by the new share issuances used to finance the acquisition of Varian [6].\n\nThe significant changes in equity components from October 1, 2019, to September 30, 2021, include substantial increases in Issued Capital, Capital Reserve, and Treasury Shares, leading to an overall increase in total equity attributable to shareholders."}

This increase was due to higher realizations, the absence of 2020 impairments and write-offs of $1.2 billion, higher sales volumes, and higher asset sales gains [9]. Similarly, International upstream earnings shifted from a loss of $825 million in 2020 to earnings of $8.5 billion in 2021, largely due to higher realizations of $7.6 billion and the absence of 2020 impairments and write-offs of $3.6 billion and severance charges, partially offset by other factors like higher tax charges [6]. U.S. downstream also contributed to the positive shift, reporting earnings of $2.4 billion in 2021 compared to a loss of $571 million in 2020, mainly due to higher margins on refined product sales, higher earnings from equity affiliates like CPChem, and higher sales volumes [8]. International downstream earnings decreased slightly from 2020 to 2021, primarily due to lower margins and higher operating expenses, though partially offset by favorable foreign currency effects [10].

This recovery in fiscal 2021 also reflected a substantial increase in cash provided by operations, primarily due to the recovery of business operations from the impact of COVID-19 [4].\n\nOther factors also influenced income before income taxes and net income. For instance, foreign currency translation and related gains and losses included in Other (income) expense, net, had an unfavorable impact of $97 million and $91 million in 2019 and 2020, respectively, but a favorable impact of $19 million in 2021 [2, 3]. Furthermore, the company recognized expected net losses related to the Argentina, Chile, and Uruguay transaction within Other (income) expense, net, totaling $358 million as of May 31, 2021, with an initial expected loss of $405 million recognized in fiscal 2020 [8]. Interest income from investments also decreased from $82 million in 2019 to $34 million in 2021 [6]. These items are components contributing to the final net income figures presented alongside other comprehensive income items [![Net income and comprehensive income are shown.](image3)]. Sales-related reserves [5] and income tax expense [9] are also factors in determining net income.\n\nNet income decreased from $4,029 million in 2019 to $2,539 million in 2020, and then increased to $5,727 million in 2021."}

The increase in net finance costs, partly attributable to premiums of US$395 million paid as part of the value accretive multi-currency hybrid debt repurchase programs, also contributed to the financial results [1]. This ability to manage debt and increase shareholder returns was supported by strong operating cash inflows, which increased by US$11.5 billion to US$27.2 billion in FY2021 due to stronger commodity prices and operational performance [8].

As seen for translations into English, pre-training consistently increases BLEU scores across various pairs like Galician, Portuguese, Azerbaijani, Turkish, Belarusian, and Russian [![Table comparing BLEU scores for different language pairs translating to English under standard and pre-trained conditions](image4)]. For higher-resource languages, gains are modest but consistent, around 3 BLEU points, whereas for extremely low-resource languages, gains can be quite small (Azerbaijani and Belarusian) or very large, as demonstrated by a gain of up to 11 BLEU points for Galician [1]. This suggests pre-trained embeddings are particularly beneficial for bootstrapping models that are on the verge of producing reasonable translations [1].\n\nThe effectiveness of pre-training is also related to the training data size; its benefits are more pronounced when training data is limited and decrease as the dataset size grows, as illustrated by the BLEU gain curves for Portuguese, Turkish, and Russian translating into English [![Graphs showing BLEU scores and gain from pre-training versus training set size for PT, TR, RU to EN translations](image2)]. This aligns with findings that pre-training is most effective when the baseline system is poor but not excessively so, typically with baseline BLEU scores between 3-4 [4]. Languages with very low baseline scores, such as Russian and Hebrew translating into Portuguese, tend to show larger gains from pre-training, likely because they have more room for improvement compared to languages more similar to Portuguese like French or Italian [9].\n\nQualitative analysis indicates that pre-training not only improves overall translation accuracy but also helps capture rarer vocabulary and produces more grammatically sound sentences [2, 8]. The primary source of this improvement appears to stem from a better encoding of the source sentence when using pre-trained source language embeddings [6].\n\nPre-training generally increases BLEU scores, with the largest gains observed for low-resource languages and those with moderately poor baseline translation performance."}

Depending on when the correction occurs, methods are categorized into Training-Time Correction, Generation-Time Correction, and Post-hoc Correction [3].\n\nTraining-time correction aims to rectify model behavior during the training phase, ideally before deployment [7]. This approach directly uses collected feedback to optimize model parameters [7]. Figure 2, illustrated here: ![The image illustrates three strategies for training-time correction: Direct Optimizing Human Feedback, Reward Modeling and Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), and Self-Training.](image4) shows three typical strategies: Direct Optimization with Human Feedback, Reward Modeling and Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), and Self-Training [4]. Direct Optimization can involve fine-tuning on outputs receiving positive or mixed feedback [5]. RLHF utilizes a reward model trained on human evaluations [7], and Self-Training trains the model on its own high-quality output filtered by a critic model [7].\n\nGeneration-time correction utilizes automated feedback to guide the LLM during the generation process itself [6]. This is particularly relevant for colossal LLMs that are inaccessible or too large for continuous post-processing [2]. The two main strategies are Generate-then-Rank and Feedback-Guided Decoding [2, 9]. Figure 3, shown here: ![The image shows two generation-time correction strategies: Generate-then-Rank, where multiple outputs are evaluated by a critic model to select the best, and Feedback-Guided Decoding, which uses iterative feedback loops from a critic model to refine outputs.](image3) illustrates these two approaches, showing how a critic model evaluates or guides the generation process [9].\n\nPost-hoc correction refines the model output after it has been fully generated [8]. This method does not require updating the model parameters and often involves an iterative cycle of generation, feedback, and refinement [8]. Post-hoc correction offers greater flexibility and facilitates the use of more informative natural language feedback, leading to a more transparent self-correction process [8]. The effectiveness of this approach allows for diverse natural language feedback, ranging from diagnostic reports to writing suggestions [1]. Figure 4, shown here: ![The image illustrates three post-hoc correction strategies: Self-Correction, Correction with External Feedback utilizing external models/tools, and Multi-Agent Debate between language models.](image2) outlines the key post-hoc correction strategies: Self-Correction, Correction with External Feedback, and Multi-Agent Debate [1].

It functions by creating and storing multimodal embeddings for visual images and text descriptions in an external memory ($\\mathcal{M}$) [1, 6, 8, 9]. The retriever is responsible for efficiently encoding and storing a large volume of embeddings for quick and accurate retrieval [8].

To handle large datasets efficiently, an index system using algorithms like HNSW is implemented, which aids in dimensionality reduction and speeds up the retrieval process [7, 8]. During the inference stage, this retriever queries the memory using techniques like k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) to find the top-$k$ class names or categories most similar to an input image [1, 9, image3, image5].\n\n![The diagram illustrates a two-part pipeline for RAR, showing the Multimodal Retriever that encodes, indexes, and retrieves embeddings from memory, and the Retrieving & Ranking part where MLLMs use retrieved candidates for final prediction.](image3)\n\nFor specific tasks like object detection, images undergo pre-processing steps such as cropping regions based on bounding boxes, resizing, and blurring non-target areas before embedding extraction to help MLLMs focus on the objects of interest [3].\n\n![The diagram illustrates pre-processing steps including cropping and resizing before embedding and retrieving objects from detection datasets.](image5)\n\nThe second main component is the Retrieving & Ranking process, which utilizes MLLMs [2, 9].

Its core architecture is surprisingly simple, comprising a standard CNN backbone, a transformer encoder-decoder, and a final feed forward network (FFN) [2].\n\nWithin this framework, the transformer decoder plays a crucial role and relies on what are termed 'object queries' [3, 5]. These are a fixed, small set of learned positional embeddings that serve as the input to the decoder [5, 7, image3]. Functionally, they are also referred to as output positional encoding [3]. The decoder is designed to decode N objects in parallel, unlike autoregressive models [5]. Because the decoder is permutation-invariant, these N input embeddings (object queries) must be distinct to allow the model to produce differentiated results [5].\n\n![The DETR model architecture uses a CNN backbone, a transformer encoder-decoder, and an FFN to predict a set of objects or 'no object'.](image3)\n\nThe decoder takes these object queries, along with the memory from the transformer encoder (which has processed the image features), and processes them through multiple layers of multi-head self-attention and decoder-encoder attention [3, 5]. Positional encodings, including the object queries, are added to the input of each attention layer in the decoder [3, 5]. The decoder's self- and encoder-decoder attention mechanisms operating on these embeddings allow the model to globally reason about all potential objects simultaneously, considering their pairwise relationships and the full image context [5, 7].\n\n![The DETR architecture takes an image, processes it with a CNN, uses a transformer encoder-decoder with learned positional encodings (object queries) to output box predictions, which are matched to ground truth boxes using bipartite matching during training.](image2)\n\nThe output of the decoder, based on the transformed object queries, consists of N embeddings [5].

A key aspect of the representation is the Relation ($r_t$) and the Parent Entity ($p_t$), which together describe why a particular entity is mentioned in the context of the surrounding text and the evolving local knowledge graph [2, 4, 6, 10]. For instance, a relation like \"pub date\" connects the token \"1989\" to the entity \"04-21-1989\", with \"Super Mario Land\" serving as the parent entity [2].

A novel strategy that incorporates these criteria, including identifying hard-to-contrast data using pseudo-labels rather than requiring ground truth annotations, has been devised [2, 8].

The first few choices in active learning are critical, defining the efficacy and efficiency of the subsequent learning process [2]. The strong positive correlation observed between performance at the initial cycle (e.g., AUC with 20 labeled images) and performance at later cycles (e.g., AUC with 50 labeled images) underscores the importance of selecting a superior initial query [1, 3, 7, 10, 4].\n\nThe 'Hard-to-Contrast' querying strategy significantly outperforms other initial query selection strategies in terms of AUC across different numbers of labeled images, implying that selecting hard-to-contrast data points for the initial query is a practical and effective way to address the cold start problem and improve subsequent active learning performance."}

This involves identifying key entities, facts, and rules from the problem statement [2]. This stage can leverage in-context learning [10] and self-refinement using error messages from the solver to improve the generated symbolic form [2, 6]. Different symbolic formulations are used for various problem types, such as Logical Programming for deductive reasoning or First-Order Logic for entailment [5], examples of which are shown here: ![This table presents an overview of different problem types and their corresponding formulations in the context of logic and reasoning, along with examples, solvers used, and datasets associated with each problem type.](image4).\n\nNext, the generated symbolic representation is passed to the Symbolic Reasoning stage [2]. Here, a deterministic symbolic solver performs inference on the formulated problem [1, 6]. The specific solver used depends on the symbolic formulation, for example, Pyke for Logic Programming or Z3 for Satisfiability Testing [image4, 5]. Since deterministic algorithms are used, the reasoning is guaranteed to be faithful provided the formulation is correct [1]. This module takes the symbolic representation (rules, facts, queries) and outputs a symbolic answer based on the logic or constraints applied [image5].\n\nFinally, the Result Interpreter stage translates the symbolic answer obtained from the solver back into natural language [1, 2]. This can be done using an LLM or a rule-based system [1]. The interpreter explains the output and maps it to the correct answer for the original natural language query [2]. This sequential process allows the framework to exploit the natural language understanding capabilities of LLMs for representation while relying on symbolic solvers for faithful and transparent reasoning [2]. ![The image is a diagram outlining the structure of the LOGIC-LM model, which is composed of three main modules: Problem Formulator, Symbolic Reasoner, and Result Interpreter.](image5).\n\nThe LOGIC-LM model solves a problem by first using an LLM to translate the natural language problem into a symbolic representation, then employing a deterministic symbolic solver to perform inference, and finally using an interpreter to translate the symbolic result back into a natural language answer."}

Neural models have become prominent for these tasks [4].

Table 1 presents the results of various CRF-based models utilizing different character and word sequence representations on several benchmarks, including NER [7]. Models based on Word LSTM consistently outperform those based on Word CNN [5]. State-of-the-art models frequently employ a Word LSTM-CRF framework enhanced with character features encoded by either LSTM or CNN, corresponding to the \"CLSTM+WLSTM+CRF\" and \"CCNN+WLSTM+CRF\" models evaluated [5]. According to the results presented in Table 1, the model structure \"CCNN+WLSTM+CRF\" achieves the highest F1-value for the NER task [image3: The table shows performance metrics for various models on NER, Chunking, and POS tagging tasks, indicating CCNN+WLSTM+CRF has the highest NER F1.]. This specific model structure also demonstrates better performance than baseline or human-engineered features when automatic features like CCNN are included [image2: The table compares the performance of baseline, human, and automatic features, showing automatic features like CCNN improve F1 scores.]. Further investigations, such as nbest Viterbi decoding on NER datasets, specifically use this \"CCNN+WLSTM+CRF\" model as it is identified as the best model [2], and its performance improves with increased nbest size [image5: The graph shows that Oracle scores, including Entity F1-value, increase as the nbest value increases.]. The toolkit used for these experiments, NCRF++, supports configurable neural representation layers and can achieve state-of-the-art results efficiently [8], leveraging batch calculation which improves speed [image4: The bar chart shows that both training and decoding speeds increase with batch size.].

Diachronic word embeddings, also known by various terms like temporal or dynamic embeddings depending on the research community, have become a widely used input representation for this task, with many papers published after 2011 [2]. This field is highly heterogeneous, involving natural language processing, information retrieval, and political science [2].\n\nA timeline highlights the key events that have shaped this research area over the period from 2010 to 2017 [1, 2].\n![The image is a timeline chart that illustrates key milestones in the field of distributional models aimed at tracing diachronic semantic shifts from 2010 to 2017.](image1)\nIn 2010, the concept of a \"Time tensor with Random Indexing\" was introduced [image1]. The release of the Google Books Ngrams corpus in 2011 played an important role, spurring work like detecting differences in word usage across time spans and comparing word meanings, achieving good correlation with human judgments [9]. While Google Ngrams is limited, its usage continued as a source of diachronic data [9, 10]. By 2012, research explored \"Word epoch disambiguation\" [image1].\n\nA seminal development occurred in 2013 with advancements in \"Prediction-based models\" [image1]. This approach was arguably first employed to trace diachronic semantic shifts by Kim et al. (2014), specifically using incremental updates and Continuous Skipgram with negative sampling (SGNS) [7]. The use of \"Word embeddings\" like \"word2vec\" became prominent by 2014 [image1]. Research in 2015 focused on \"Models alignment\" [image1]. That year, Dubossarsky et al. experimented with K-means clustering on SGNS embeddings and proposed the \"law of prototypicality,\" suggesting the likelihood of semantic shift correlates with the degree of prototypicality [8]. Kulkarni et al. (2015) showed that methods could be applied to time spans less than a decade using datasets beyond Google Ngrams, such as Amazon Movie Reviews and Twitter data [10].\n\nIn 2016, analyses using corpora like the \"NYT corpus\" and \"COHA corpus\" were noted [image1]. The New-York Times Annotated Corpus and the Corpus of Historical American were indeed used to trace semantic shifts during this period [10]. Hamilton et al. (2016a) showed the superiority of SGNS over explicit PPMI-based models in semantic shift analysis using corpora like COHA and Google Ngrams [7, 10]. By 2017, several insights emerged, including \"Laws of semantic change,\" that \"Local measures better for cultural shifts,\" the use of the \"Gigaword corpus,\" analyses of \"Diachronic relations,\" and \"Criticism of semantic change laws\" [image1]. Joint learning across time spans was also a noted development in 2017 [image1]. The English Gigaword corpus began to be employed in analyzing semantic drift related to armed conflicts [10].\n\nThe key milestones in tracing diachronic semantic shifts from 2010 to 2017 include the introduction of time tensors, exploration with large corpora like Google Ngrams, advancements in prediction-based word embedding models, models alignment techniques, and the application of these methods to various large corpora, leading to insights into the laws and nature of semantic change."}

Slots like 'taxi-leave at' and 'train-arrive by' are treated as non-categorical, or span-based, slots in DS-DST [10]. While span-based methods perform similarly to categorical methods when values are explicitly mentioned and can be found via span matching [1], they struggle with time-related slots when the exact string is not present or due to formatting variations in the context [4], [10]. In such cases, DS-Span and DS-DST often cannot correctly extract the intended value, sometimes only predicting 'none' or 'dontcare' accurately [10].\n\nWhen a full ontology or candidate value list is accessible, the DS-Picklist method can perform better [3]. This is because it can select values directly from the candidate list rather than relying solely on finding an exact span match in the dialogue history [4], [10]. This capability allows DS-Picklist to reduce errors and predict values correctly even when span matching fails due to lack of explicit mention or formatting issues [10].\n\n![The table shows slot names and their performance metrics for DS-Span, DS-DST, and DS-Picklist, allowing direct comparison for specific slots like 'taxi-leave at' and 'train-arrive by'.](image4)\n\nLooking at the performance metrics for 'taxi-leave at' and 'train-arrive by' in the table above, DS-DST shows an accuracy of 74.4% for 'taxi-leave at' and 77.8% for 'train-arrive by'.

The tree traversal method navigates the tree layer-by-layer, selecting the most relevant nodes at each level [8, image5 A]. In contrast, the collapsed tree method flattens the tree and evaluates nodes collectively across all layers, considering all nodes simultaneously to find the most relevant ones [5, image5 B]. Both methods utilize cosine similarity to the query embedding for selecting nodes [4, 8].\n\nWhen comparing the performance of these two querying mechanisms on the QASPER dataset, results demonstrate that the collapsed tree approach consistently performs better than tree traversal [6].\n![The graph shows the F1 scores of collapsed tree and tree traversal methods across different context lengths, indicating that the collapsed tree consistently achieves higher F1 scores and peaks around 2000 tokens.](image3)\nAs shown in the graph, the collapsed tree's F1 score generally remains higher and peaks around a context length of 2000 tokens before slightly decreasing, while the tree traversal method's F1 score increases with context length but stays notably lower [6, image3]. This superior performance is attributed to the collapsed tree's greater flexibility, allowing it to retrieve information at the appropriate level of granularity for a given question by searching through all nodes simultaneously, unlike the more rigid layer-by-layer selection of tree traversal [6]. Based on these results, the collapsed tree approach is the preferred querying method [10].\n\nIn terms of F1 score across different context lengths on the QASPER dataset, the collapsed tree method consistently outperforms the tree traversal method."}

The minimum input low voltage (VIL) is specified as -0.5V, while the maximum is 0.8V. The minimum input high voltage (VIH) is 2.0V, extending up to VCC+0.5V [![Input and output voltage specifications for various microcontroller models including VIL, VIH, VOL, and VOH.](image1)]. This applies universally across the 8751H, 8751H-8, 8751BH, and 8752BH.\n\nFor output voltages, the maximum output low voltage (VOL) is 0.45V when sinking 1.6mA, a specification shared by all these models [![Input and output voltage specifications for various microcontroller models including VIL, VIH, VOL, and VOH.](image1)]. The minimum output high voltage (VOH) shows some differences depending on the output current load (IOH). For the 8751H and 8751H-8, VOH is guaranteed to be at least 2.4V when sourcing -25µA, and VCC-0.3V when sourcing -100µA [![Input and output voltage specifications for various microcontroller models including VIL, VIH, VOL, and VOH.](image1)]. The 8751BH and 8752BH also guarantee VOH of at least 2.4V at -25µA but guarantee VCC-0.6V when sourcing a higher current of -205µA, indicating potential differences in their high-level output drive capability at higher currents [![Input and output voltage specifications for various microcontroller models including VIL, VIH, VOL, and VOH.](image1)].\n\nRegarding absolute maximum ratings, the voltage allowed on the EA/VPP pin relative to VSS differs significantly [9]. For the 8751H, this range is -0.5V to +21.5V, whereas for the 8751BH/8752BH, it is -0.5V to +13.0V [9]. This difference primarily relates to the programming voltage (Vpp) required, which is noted to be lower (12.75V) for the 875XBH models compared to 21V [6]. For all other pins, the voltage range relative to VSS is the same across models, limited to -0.5V to +7V [9].\n\nThe input and output voltage specifications are largely similar for standard logic levels (VIL, VIH, VOL) across the 8751H and related models, but differ in VOH at higher output current loads and in the absolute maximum voltage allowed on the EA/VPP pin."}

These partnerships are often facilitated through agreements like Cooperative Research and Development Agreements (CRADAs), with the NMRC enterprise executing numerous such agreements, sometimes also reviewing them for naval hospitals [10].\n\nThese collaborations extend to specific research areas like malaria. For instance, NMRC researchers partner with institutions such as Duke University to study malaria transmission [9]. The head of the Malaria Department at NMRC also lectures at universities like Notre Dame [4]. Research into malaria, such as identifying novel antigens for potential vaccines, is crucial for deployed warfighters but also has significant potential relevance for the general population given the disease's prevalence globally [9], [5]. This kind of research often involves detailed study of the immune response at a cellular level ![[A graphic illustrating the immune response to malaria in a liver cell, relevant to vaccine development.](image1)] which can inform broader vaccine strategies.\n\nFurthermore, the work of teams like the Joint Combat Casualty Research Team (JC2RT) exemplifies the practical application and data collection crucial for medical advances [8]. Deployed during combat operations, the JC2RT systematically records, collects, validates, and analyzes data related to combat injuries [1], [8]. Historically, medical advances are accelerated during wartime, and this collected data holds great potential for decreasing morbidity and mortality associated with combat injuries [8]. While focused on the warfighter, the knowledge gained and medical advances developed from this rigorous data collection and analysis often translate to improvements in civilian trauma care and critical care [8].\n\nExamples of collaborations with potential dual benefit include work on novel modes of anchoring prosthetics with a company, important for military amputees but also civilian patients, and exploring synthetic oxygen-carrying fluids to reduce tissue damage from hemorrhagic shock, a condition relevant in both combat and civilian trauma scenarios [9]. These efforts underscore how NMRC’s focus on military health drives innovations and partnerships that contribute to broader civilian healthcare advancements through technology transfer and shared knowledge [5].\n\nNMRC's efforts effectively bridge military and civilian medical advancements by strategically fostering collaborations, leveraging public and private sector expertise, and ensuring that innovations developed for the warfighter have the potential to benefit the general population."}

These genes exist at specific locations, or gene loci [10], on homologous chromosomes [3], and variations of these genes are called alleles, which can be dominant or recessive [6]. `![A chromosome with different alleles labeled P, a, and B, indicating a dominant allele is present.](image1)` Examples of genotypes resulting from different allele combinations include homozygous dominant (PP), homozygous recessive (aa), and heterozygous (Bb) [image3].\n\nIn a monohybrid cross, such as crossing true-breeding purple-flowered plants with true-breeding white-flowered plants, the parental generation (P) produces an F₁ generation where all plants display the dominant trait, purple flowers [5]. This occurs because the F₁ plants are heterozygous, carrying both the dominant allele for purple and the recessive allele for white. When the F₁ plants are allowed to self-pollinate, the recessive trait reappears in the F₂ generation [5]. `![A genetic cross diagram shows the inheritance pattern from P to F1 to F2 generations in pea plants, illustrating how Punnett squares predict genotypic ratios (1:2:1 PP:Pp:pp) and resulting phenotypic ratios (3:1 purple:white).](image4)` Mendel's principles explain this by proposing that during gamete formation, the alleles for each trait segregate, so each gamete receives only one allele [7]. When these gametes combine in the F₂ generation, the different allele combinations result in a predictable pattern of genotypes and phenotypes. `![The image shows a monohybrid cross where purple and white parent plants produce all purple F1 offspring, which then produce ¾ purple and ¼ white F2 offspring, illustrating the segregation of traits.](image5)`\n\nSpecifically, crossing two F₁ heterozygotes (Pp x Pp) results in an F₂ generation with a genotypic ratio of 1 PP (homozygous dominant) : 2 Pp (heterozygous) : 1 pp (homozygous recessive). Because the dominant allele (P) masks the recessive allele (p), both PP and Pp genotypes express the purple phenotype, while only the pp genotype expresses the white phenotype [5]. This leads to the observed phenotypic ratio of 3 purple : 1 white in the F₂ generation [5]. Mendelian inheritance explains why one trait disappeared in the F₁ and reappeared in a specific proportion in the F₂ [5].\n\nMendelian inheritance explains the observed 1:2:1 genotypic ratio (homozygous dominant:heterozygous:homozygous recessive) and 3:1 phenotypic ratio (dominant:recessive) in the F2 generation of a monohybrid cross through the principles of segregation of alleles and dominance."}

The question itself prompts a look into these obstacles [1]. A primary barrier is the siloed approach, which is considered the greatest impediment to adopting a customer management approach [3]. This is strongly supported by data showing that a lack of single ownership leading to siloed approaches and misaligned goals is a challenge for 52% of respondents, and being too siloed by business line, product, or brand is a challenge for 46% `![Challenges include siloed approaches and lack of ownership](image1)`.\n\nAdoption barriers are highlighted as relating more to management and culture rather than solely data and technology issues [2]. Specific problems acting as barriers include using the wrong metrics, such as focusing too much on reach rather than engagement, and drowning in excessive data that isn't insightful or actionable [6]. A significant hurdle is the lack of a 360-degree view, where marketers look at tactical metrics in isolation instead of a complete picture of activities and customer behavior [6]. There's also often too much focus on quantitative data at the expense of qualitative data like satisfaction [6]. Operational issues like not utilizing a consistent digital marketing taxonomy, lack of processes, unclear roles and responsibilities, and a lack of skilled resources are also cited barriers [6]. Furthermore, lacking the resources (36%) and technical infrastructure (28%) to support the integrated approach are notable challenges `![Challenges include siloed approaches and lack of ownership](image1)`. The inability to measure the influence of activities on customer behavior is also a barrier [6], reported by 27% of respondents `![Challenges include siloed approaches and lack of ownership](image1)`, underscoring that measurement itself can be difficult [2].\n\nThe major barriers preventing the adoption of an integrated customer management approach are primarily related to siloed organizational structures, management and cultural issues, lack of resources and infrastructure, and specific problems with metrics, data utilization, and measurement capabilities."}

In a specific scenario like a competition, external factors can lead to a dramatic increase in utility, even at a point where utility is typically negative, such as gaining +5000 utility for consuming a 64th hot dog to tie a competitor [image5].\n\n![A table shows diminishing utility with hot dogs, but a large jump in utility at 64 hot dogs related to a competition, alongside an image of someone with a large tray of hot dogs.](image5)\n\nThis implies that consumption behavior is influenced not only by the inherent pleasure or utility from the item itself but also by the context, goals, or external rewards associated with the consumption act.\n\nUtility generally decreases with each additional hot dog consumed due to diminishing marginal utility, implying consumers may seek variety unless external factors provide overriding positive utility."}

Serving dishes and lids should be positioned on the side of the racks to avoid blocking the rotation of the top spray arm [3]. Plates placed in front of the detergent dispenser should have a maximum diameter of 19 cm to ensure the dispenser can open freely [3].

Enterprise-Wide Clinical Information Sharing and Clinical Data Repositories also saw slight decreases in percentage [image2]. In contrast, Digital Picture Archiving (PACS) saw a significant increase in adoption, jumping from 26% in 2005 to 42% in 2006 [image2]. Overall, while some core systems like EMR saw marginal growth, others like CPOE experienced a slight dip, suggesting mixed progress in widespread adoption across all critical areas during this specific timeframe. Healthcare was noted as being significantly behind other industries in adopting IT [8], partly due to issues like fragmented patient information and redundant efforts [4].\n\n![The bar chart illustrates the percentage of various significant barriers to implementing IT, comparing 2005 and 2006 survey results.](image3)\n\nThese adoption trends occurred alongside a set of significant barriers to implementing IT [10]. The lack of financial support increased slightly from 18% to 20% between 2005 and 2006 [image3]. A notable rise was seen in the vendor's inability to effectively deliver product, increasing from 12% to 18% [image3]. Concurrently, barriers such as difficulty achieving end-user acceptance decreased from 11% to 8%, and lack of staffing resources also decreased from 17% to 13% [image3]. Laws prohibiting technology sharing emerged as a barrier in 2006 at 4% after being 0% in 2005 [image3].\n\n![The bar chart compares the percentage of various security concerns related to IT and data security between 2005 and 2006.](image1)\n\nSecurity concerns also presented barriers [3]. While internal and external breaches of security saw decreases, inadequate business continuity/disaster recovery remained a concern, though 2006 data wasn't available for comparison [image1]. HIPAA compliance concerns saw a significant drop from 35% to 18%, indicating potentially better handling of regulations, yet patients' lack of confidence slightly increased from 8% to 10% [image1].\n\nIn summary, from 2005 to 2006, the adoption of healthcare IT applications like EMR saw slow growth while some, such as CPOE, saw slight decreases; this happened in a landscape where key implementation barriers like lack of financial support and vendor capability issues increased, although some challenges like end-user acceptance became less prominent, and certain security concerns decreased."}

These principles, rooted in Gestalt psychology [4], aim to understand how we acquire and maintain meaningful perceptions [4]. A key tenet is that when the human mind perceives a form, the whole has a reality of its own, independent of the parts [10]. This allows us to perceive objects as being whole even when they are not complete, a principle known as Closure [3]. These foundational ideas allowed the development of several Gestalt Laws of Grouping [1], which suggest how we perceptually group elements. For example, elements are perceptually grouped together if they form a pattern that is regular, simple, and orderly [5], helping us eliminate complexity [5]. Another law indicates that elements are integrated into perceptual wholes if they are aligned within an object [7]. Visual representations often demonstrate these concepts `![Visual examples demonstrating Segregation, Closure, Proximity, Continuity, Similarity, Pregnância, and Unity using the letters GESTALT.](image2)`.
