This divide is even more pronounced among specific subgroups, where 67% of liberal Democrats think the U.S. can learn a great deal, compared to only 25% of conservative Republicans [8].

This pattern extends to education, where those with higher education levels, such as postgraduates, are more likely to believe U.S. influence will recede, with 45% of them anticipating less influence compared to lower percentages among those with less education [10]. These trends are visually evident in a survey breakdown, ![Survey results indicating variations in perceptions of influence based on education level and political affiliation, such as higher expectations of decline among the more educated and Democrats](image1) which illustrates how subgroups like Republicans and those with advanced degrees differ in their views on whether influence will grow, stay the same, or diminish.\n\nIn contrast, opinions on the EU's influence reveal less polarization, as majorities in both parties expect it to remain unaffected by the outbreak [3], though subtle differences persist by affiliation. For example, Democrats may lean slightly more optimistic, while Republicans could be more skeptical, as seen in data that breaks down responses by political groups. This is further supported by another chart, ![Bar chart showing opinions on influence categorized by political affiliation, with Republicans more likely to expect no change or less influence](image8) which underscores how Republicans and Democrats diverge, with the former showing higher percentages for \"About the same\" or \"Less.\"\n\nFor China, the divides are stark: Roughly six-in-ten Republicans believe China's influence will diminish, compared to just 40% of Democrats, and older adults are more likely to share this view [6]. Education also plays a role, as those with higher education might align more with Democrats in expecting stability or growth for China, though overall perceptions lean toward decline.

Education also plays a role, as those with a college degree report 60% confidence versus 50% for those without [7], suggesting that more educated individuals may feel more optimistic about Biden's approach. ![Image8 illustrates how confidence in Biden's China policy differs across demographics, including higher rates among women, minorities, and Democrats](image8) provides a visual breakdown of these trends, showing how such factors create a fragmented landscape of trust.\n\nTurning to the major concerns Americans hold regarding China, several issues stand out as particularly pressing, with cyberattacks emerging as the top worry, as about two-thirds of Americans view them as a very serious problem, up from previous years [2; 12]. Other key concerns include the loss of U.S. jobs to China, which 53% see as very serious and has increased in perception over time [6; 12], China's growing military power, rated as very serious by 52% [12], and human rights policies, which 50% consider a major issue [12]. These worries are not uniform across the population; for example, Republicans have shown sharper increases in concern about job losses and military power compared to Democrats, as illustrated in the trends over recent years ![Image2 shows partisan differences in viewing China-related issues as very serious, with Republicans reporting higher increases in concerns like job losses and military power](image2). Additionally, older Americans tend to express more alarm about these matters overall [9], painting a picture of widespread unease that prioritizes security and economic threats.\n\nIn summary, confidence in Biden's ability to deal effectively with China is highest among Democrats, women, and racial minorities but lowest among Republicans and White adults, while the primary concerns for Americans center on cyberattacks, job losses, and China's military expansion."}

Ultimately, this approach could enhance user satisfaction and reduce the spread of harmful behaviors.\n\nPerceptions of social media content differ between men and women, with men more often seeing deceptive and bullying behaviors, implying that platforms should tailor recommendations to foster more positive experiences based on these gender-specific patterns."}

For instance, younger users, such as those aged 18 to 49, are generally more comfortable with platforms using their data to suggest connections or events, as noted in the data where about two-thirds of users under 50 find it acceptable for recommending people they might know [1], and a similar majority approve of data use for local events [12]. In contrast, older users, particularly those 65 and above, express greater reservations; for example, they are less likely to accept data being used for friend recommendations, with only about 36% viewing it as acceptable compared to 66% of those aged 18-29 [4].\n\nThis age-based divide extends to other applications, like targeted ads and political messages, where overall user comfort diminishes as the purpose feels more intrusive. As highlighted, a substantial majority across ages find it unacceptable for platforms to use data for political campaigns, with only 37% comfortable overall [6], and younger users still showing higher approval rates for ads than their older counterparts [8]. To illustrate these trends visually, ![A bar chart detailing public acceptability levels for data use in recommendations, ads, and political messages](image2) provides a clear breakdown, showing that while recommendations for events are viewed as mostly acceptable (with 75% finding it at least somewhat acceptable), political messages are largely unacceptable (with 62% finding them not at all or not very acceptable).\n\nWhen examining specific age group differences, the pattern of younger users being more accepting persists, as evidenced in ![A chart comparing age group approvals for data-driven recommendations and ads](image3), which reveals that 80% of 18- to 29-year-olds approve of event recommendations compared to just 67% of those 65 and older, and a stark gap in ad approvals (60% for 30- to 49-year-olds versus 39% for those 65+). This data underscores how age influences overall user comfort, with younger demographics prioritizing convenience and connectivity, while older ones emphasize privacy risks [10].\n\nIn summary, different age groups perceive the acceptability of social media data use variably, with younger users being more open to personalized recommendations and older users showing greater discomfort, which collectively shapes a broader user base that favors benign uses like event suggestions over invasive ones like political targeting."}

Additionally, a lack of early encouragement to pursue STEM fields is a significant issue, affecting 39% of perceptions for women, alongside challenges like balancing work and family obligations [7].\n\nIn contrast, for blacks and Hispanics, the reasons often center on structural inequalities such as limited access to quality education, which is cited by 42% as a major barrier, making it harder to prepare for STEM careers [1]. Discrimination in recruitment and promotions is also notable, with 72% of black STEM workers viewing it as a key factor [2], but it's compounded by a lack of encouragement from an early age and fewer role models, as highlighted in various racial disparity discussions [10]. This paints a picture where educational access and early opportunities play a more pronounced role for these groups.\n\nTo visualize these differences, consider the detailed breakdown in the following chart: ![A bar chart showing major reasons for underrepresentation in STEM, including discrimination at 39% for women and limited education access at 42% for blacks and Hispanics](image3). This illustration underscores how, while both groups face discrimination, women emphasize gender-specific issues like early discouragement and work-life balance, whereas blacks and Hispanics highlight educational disparities and role model shortages.\n\nOverall, the reasons differ in their emphasis: women are more affected by gender discrimination and work-family dynamics, while blacks and Hispanics contend more with educational barriers and early encouragement deficits."}

For instance, as noted in [6], about 65% of STEM workers hold at least a bachelor's degree and 29% have a postgraduate degree, in contrast to just 32% and 12% respectively for non-STEM workers, suggesting that advanced education is a key characteristic of the STEM workforce. This educational advantage appears to align with their employment patterns, where most STEM workers, particularly those in fields like engineering and computer occupations, predominantly work in the private, for-profit sector [7]. To visualize this, consider a stacked bar chart that highlights how STEM employed individuals have a higher percentage with bachelor's (36%) and postgraduate degrees (29%) compared to non-STEM individuals, who are more likely to have only a high school diploma or less (37%) ![A stacked bar chart comparing education levels, showing STEM workers have more advanced degrees than non-STEM workers](image6). When examining employment sectors, STEM workers with these higher education levels show a similar overall rate to all employed adults at 66% in private, for-profit roles, but with variations by subfield—such as engineers at 82% and computer workers at 77%—indicating a strong correlation between specialized education and private sector dominance [7]. In comparison, non-STEM workers, despite having lower education levels, mirror the 66% private sector rate but are slightly more likely to be self-employed (11%) than STEM workers (6%), as illustrated in a bar chart that details these sector distributions across STEM and non-STEM categories ![A bar chart depicting employment sector percentages, revealing STEM jobs favor private, for-profit sectors while maintaining similarities to non-STEM in overall distribution](image4). Overall, the data suggests that higher education in STEM not only equips individuals for specialized roles but also steers them toward private sector opportunities, differing from the broader, less education-driven sector patterns in non-STEM fields.\n\nIn summary, STEM-employed individuals with higher education levels are more concentrated in private, for-profit sectors compared to non-STEM employed individuals, who exhibit similar sector distributions but with lower overall education attainment."}

For instance, the dataset requires skills like extracting specific information from tables, applying commonsense or domain-specific knowledge, and performing numerical operations, as outlined in the reasoning processes [6]. This involves steps such as linking table captions to column names or conducting basic arithmetic to verify claims.\n\nOne of the most prominent reasoning steps is simple lookup, which involves retrieving values from specific cells in a table, accounting for a significant portion of the processes. Building on this, comparisons between numbers are also frequent, often used to assess differences or relationships in the data [10]. Additionally, closed-domain knowledge—drawing from table captions or titles—plays a key role, helping to interpret abbreviations or contexts that aren't immediately obvious. These insights are visually reinforced in a breakdown of reasoning functions, where simple lookup tops the list at 20.6%, followed closely by comparison at 19.5% ![A table summarizing the proportions of various reasoning steps, including simple lookup and comparison as the most common](image6).\n\nChallenges in this verification process often stem from the complexity and ambiguity inherent in scientific claims. For example, errors in calculations or incorrect approximations frequently lead to refuted claims, with about 41.7% of refuted reasons involving wrong calculation results and 33.3% related to approximation errors [5]. Moreover, not enough information (NEI) claims pose difficulties due to insufficient evidence in the tables or the need for external knowledge, as seen in 33.3% of NEI cases involving a lack of matching evidence [8]. These issues are further illustrated in a summary of error types, highlighting how grounding and ambiguity errors dominate, with grounding errors at 50% and ambiguity at 22% ![A table detailing common error types in claim verification, such as grounding and calculation errors as primary challenges](image3).

This footprint arises from factors like GPU hours and power consumption, emphasizing the trade-offs in scaling AI models. For a detailed breakdown, the data reveals that larger models, such as the 70B version, emit more carbon (291.42 tCO2eq) due to extended training times ![Llama 2 models' configurations show increasing carbon emissions with size, based on GPU hours and power usage](image8).\n\nIn human evaluations, Llama 2-Chat 70B also holds its own against models like ChatGPT, with higher win rates in categories such as dialogue and factual questions, underscoring its practical competitiveness ![Llama 2-Chat 70B demonstrates superior win rates in various categories when compared to ChatGPT](image7).

For instance, as more knowledge is removed, precision tends to increase because the model becomes more selective in identifying and citing the remaining accurate elements, while recall remains relatively stable, suggesting the model's limited ability to detect absent knowledge overall. This pattern is evident in the analysis, where recall stays around 15 regardless of the number of removed elements, indicating that the model can still flag some missing knowledge but doesn't compensate fully for the gaps [10].\n\nTo visualize this trend, consider the following graph, which illustrates the metrics' behavior: ![A line graph depicting precision increasing significantly, recall remaining stable, and F1-Score showing moderate growth as knowledge elements are removed in Conscious Incompetence experiments](image1). This data underscores that while precision improves due to fewer false positives in citations, the stable recall implies the model isn't effectively expanding its knowledge retrieval to cover the absences.\n\nIn related retrieval analysis, similar dynamics appear when retrieval accuracy declines, as seen in broader studies [1], where recall drops more sharply than precision because the model struggles to access uncited knowledge, yet it can filter out inaccuracies to some extent. This reinforces the idea that models have a modest capability to handle absent knowledge, but as more elements are removed or retrieval falters, the overall F1-Score, which balances precision and recall, only moderately improves, pointing to limitations in comprehensive knowledge management.\n\nUltimately, these changes imply that current language models can partially identify and adapt to absent knowledge but require enhancements for better recall in scenarios with incomplete data sources."}

For instance, as the number of demonstration samples increases from 1 to 5, performance metrics like Micro-F1 scores show evident gains, but further increases beyond 10 samples yield diminishing benefits; however, adding logical constraints can amplify results even with fewer demonstrations, such as outperforming scenarios with more samples but without constraints [12]. This suggests that logical constraints help models better understand and apply reasoning rules, reducing inconsistencies and enhancing overall accuracy.\n\nTo visualize this effect, the data reveals that models on MAVEN-ERE and Causal-TimeBank exhibit higher Micro-F1 scores when logical constraints are included, especially as demonstration samples grow, as depicted in a graph comparing performance with and without these constraints ![Graph showing improved Micro-F1 scores with logical constraints as demonstrations increase on MAVEN-ERE and Causal-TimeBank datasets](image1). Building on this, detailed performance tables for models like Vicuna-13B-PT and Llama2-13B-PT demonstrate that configurations with logical constraints, such as CoT integrated with them, achieve the highest Micro-F1 percentages—up to 26.4% on MAVEN-ERE for Llama2-13B-PT—while also minimizing logical inconsistency, which underscores the value of these constraints in refining outputs [8].\n\nFurther analysis shows that while demonstrations alone boost performance initially, the real advantage comes from balancing them with logical constraints, as seen in comparisons where models trained or prompted with relevant logic outperform baselines without it [10]. For example, in tables evaluating various models, those using logical constraints consistently show better metrics on both datasets, highlighting how this approach mitigates issues like hallucinations and improves logical consistency [4].\n\nUltimately, the use of logical constraints enhances model performance on the MAVEN-ERE and Causal-TimeBank datasets by providing better reasoning support, often allowing for effective results with fewer demonstration samples."}

For instance, retrieval-based approaches that incorporate logical constraints show significant reductions in logical inconsistency (LI) percentages, as evidenced in comparative evaluations where models with these constraints outperform those relying solely on post-processing, which, while achieving 0% LI, often disrupts the semantic quality of responses [7]. Turning to the data from the evaluations, ![A table comparing model performance on MAVEN-ERE and Causal-TimeBank, showing LI reductions with logical constraints and post-processing](image1) illustrates how models like Llama2 achieve lower LI with logical constraints compared to post-processing alone, highlighting that constraints provide a proactive fix rather than a reactive one. Additionally, as detailed in [12], higher logical inconsistency typically correlates with poorer micro-F1 scores, and logical constraints help mitigate this more reliably across tasks, whereas post-processing might eliminate inconsistencies but at the cost of accuracy, as seen in the specific results for Vicuna and Llama2. ![A table detailing LI percentages for Vicuna and Llama2 models under various conditions, including post-processing achieving 0% LI](image7) further supports this by showing that while post-processing hits 0% LI, the overall performance gains are less pronounced than when logical constraints are applied directly.

BLEU, as a traditional n-gram matching metric [6], relies on counting matching sequences between a hypothesis and reference translation, which can overlook semantic nuances and perform less effectively in diverse linguistic contexts [7]. In contrast, COMET-RANK, part of the COMET framework [3], uses a neural approach with a pretrained cross-lingual encoder to optimize for human judgments, often incorporating source text for better correlation, as highlighted in analyses of translation ranking architectures [2].\n\nFrom the results in various evaluations, COMET-RANK consistently demonstrates superior performance compared to BLEU. For instance, in Table 1, which covers language pairs with English as the source, COMET-RANK outperforms BLEU and other metrics across most pairs, with significant margins in correlations with human judgments [4]. This trend extends to scenarios where English is the target, as shown in Table 2, where COMET-RANK exceeds BLEU in five out of seven language pairs, underscoring its ability to handle multilingual data more robustly [11].\n\nVisualizing this comparison, the line graphs in one set of evaluations reveal that COMET-RANK maintains higher Kendall Tau scores than BLEU across different subsets of top machine translation systems, indicating stronger correlation with human preferences as fewer systems are considered ![A line graph showing COMET-RANK with higher Kendall Tau scores than BLEU for English-target language pairs](image3).

Moreover, in ![SciIE shows superior precision, recall, and F1 scores in span identification, keyphrase extraction, and relation extraction over other models](image4), SciIE's higher precision and F1 scores indicate its robustness, though it performs best in tasks like span identification due to its span-based enumeration method rather than traditional tagging.\n\nOverall, the SciIE model outperforms other models in terms of precision, recall, and F1 scores across various NLP tasks, largely due to the efficiencies gained from its multitask learning approach."}

This alignment is hypothesized to help NMT systems learn correspondences more effectively by ensuring that semantically similar words in different languages are positioned similarly in the embedding space, potentially leading to better translation outcomes [2]. However, the results from the studies reveal a more nuanced picture: in many cases, such as bilingual translation tasks, aligning embeddings did not yield significant improvements in BLEU scores, with some language pairs showing minimal gains or even slight decreases, as evidenced by the data in various evaluations [7].\n\nFor instance, when looking at specific language pairs like Galician to English or Portuguese to English, the alignment often resulted in negligible changes to BLEU scores, which underscores that this approach might not always be necessary in simpler bilingual setups ![This table indicates mixed effects of alignment on BLEU scores across different languages](image3).

For instance, closed vocabulary models, such as word-only approaches, tend to treat out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words uniformly, which often results in lower sensitivity because they don't distinguish between unique character combinations, making them less vulnerable to perturbations [6]. In contrast, open vocabulary models, like those based on characters, words with characters, or word-pieces, are more sensitive since they process each unique input variation distinctly, amplifying the potential for errors under attacks [8].\n\nThis difference becomes clearer when examining the backoff strategies—such as pass-through, which passes words as-is; background, which falls back to a larger corpus; and neutral, which maps UNK predictions to a fixed word. According to the analysis, neutral backoff generally achieves the lowest sensitivity across both model types, as it reduces the variety of outputs by standardizing UNK responses, although it may trade off slightly with WER in certain scenarios [12]. For closed vocabulary models, pass-through can actually be less sensitive due to the uniform handling of OOV words, but for open vocabulary models, it leads to higher sensitivity because every perturbation creates a new unique input [6]. Meanwhile, the background strategy often improves WER by leveraging a broader dataset, yet it doesn't always minimize sensitivity as effectively as neutral backoff [10].\n\nTo visualize this trade-off, consider the scatter plots that compare sensitivity and WER for these models, where bubble sizes indicate robustness: for word-only models, sensitivity hovers around 11.4 to 12.6 with WER between 9.5 and 11.5, showing that neutral backoff (green bubble) maintains strong robustness despite moderate WER ![Scatter plot showing sensitivity vs. WER for word-only models, with neutral backoff demonstrating lowest sensitivity and balanced robustness](image3). In open vocabulary models, sensitivity can range up to about 30 with WER from 6.5 to 11, where background backoff (orange bubble) reduces WER effectively but sensitivity remains higher, impacting overall robustness ![Scatter plot illustrating sensitivity vs. WER for char-only models, highlighting how neutral backoff achieves better balance compared to pass-through](image3).\n\nAdditionally, performance tables reinforce these insights, revealing that closed vocabulary models under backoff strategies like neutral achieve consistently lower metrics across attacks, such as swaps and drops, compared to open vocabulary counterparts, where the same strategies show elevated sensitivity but sometimes better WER [6].\n\nIn summary, closed vocabulary models generally have lower sensitivity and comparable WER than open vocabulary models, with neutral backoff providing the most effective strategy for minimizing sensitivity while maintaining acceptable error rates."}

Overall, these changes suggest that strategic growth initiatives and market conditions may have driven the need for more leased resources, impacting the company's financial position.\n\nIn summary, the company's operating lease liabilities increased from $797 million in 2019 to $974 million in 2020, primarily influenced by acquisitions and related business activities."}

This increase was primarily driven by a 43% rise in total revenues to $33.6 billion, largely attributed to higher equipment and services revenues in the QCT segment, which grew by 64% due to increased demand for 5G products in handsets and other areas, recovering from COVID-19 impacts [10]. Additionally, licensing revenues from the QTL segment increased by 26%, boosted by higher estimated sales of 3G/4G/5G-based products [10], and the acquisition of NUVIA for $1.1 billion contributed to future growth potential in QCT products [7]. Further supporting this, a breakdown of revenues and expenses shows that the surge in equipment and services revenues by about $10.4 billion played a key role, offsetting any declines like the one-time licensing revenues from Huawei in the prior year [11]. Meanwhile, ![Net income increased to $9,043 million in 2021 from $5,198 million in 2020 and $4,386 million in 2019, with comprehensive income reflecting adjustments for items like foreign currency translation and unrealized gains or losses](image7) highlights how other comprehensive income factors, such as foreign currency translation gains of $40 million in 2021, influenced the overall comprehensive income despite some offsetting losses in areas like derivative instruments.

This rise can be attributed to factors such as higher unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, which grew from $79,854 in 2020 to $86,664 in 2021, alongside increases in unearned premiums from $21,395 to $23,512, reflecting expanded insurance activities and premium collections ![The table shows an increase in total liabilities from $422,393 in 2020 to $443,854 in 2021, primarily due to higher unpaid losses and other policyholder liabilities](image1).

For liabilities, reductions in prior years' estimates, such as a $1.8 billion decrease in claim liabilities during 2021, helped offset some growth but were overshadowed by ongoing insurance obligations [9]. On the equity side, the increase was supported by equity method earnings and other comprehensive income changes, as seen in the evolving components of equity over the years, including net earnings and adjustments for investments ![The table illustrates changes in equity components, such as retained earnings and accumulated other comprehensive income, contributing to a net increase in total shareholders' equity from 2020 to 2021](image4). Additionally, debt repayments played a role, with parent company debt decreasing from $22.7 billion to $21.4 billion, partly due to foreign currency effects and strategic issuances [5].\n\nOverall, these changes underscore Berkshire Hathaway's robust financial health amid market volatility, with growth in liabilities linked to its insurance operations and equity gains stemming from earnings and investments. In summary, liabilities increased from $422,393 in 2020 to $443,854 in 2021 due to higher insurance-related obligations, while shareholders' equity rose to $506.2 billion, primarily driven by net earnings and investment gains."}

Primarily, the rise was driven by higher sales volume, which stemmed from increased end-user demand for equipment, services, and aftermarket parts across various segments and regions, such as Construction Industries and Resource Industries, where demand was notably stronger due to factors like higher mining activity and economic recovery [2] [5] [8]. Additionally, changes in dealer inventories played a crucial role; dealers reduced their inventories more substantially in 2020 (about $2.9 billion) compared to a smaller decrease in 2021 (about $100 million), which positively impacted sales as dealers adjusted to expectations of future demand and improved product availability [1] [4] [6]. Favorable price realization also contributed, allowing Caterpillar to capitalize on market conditions and boost revenue [3] [10].

These declines were largely attributed to temporary restaurant closures and limited operations, which offset positive performances in other areas like the U.S. and International Developmental Licensed Markets.\n\nTo illustrate these revenue changes more clearly, the detailed breakdown shows how company-operated sales in the U.S. decreased by 4% and in International Operated Markets by 19%, while franchised revenues saw a 2% drop in the U.S. and a 14% drop internationally ![The table presents revenue data for company-operated sales and franchised revenues across different markets in 2020, indicating decreases from 2019.](image3). This erosion in revenues directly contributed to a reduction in profitability metrics, as seen in the overall financial performance where total revenues decreased by 10% ![The table provides financial data including revenues and earnings per share for 2020, showing decreases compared to 2019.](image4).\n\nAs a result, these revenue shortfalls led to a 20% decline in GAAP earnings per share, from $7.88 in 2019 to $6.31 in 2020, and a 23% decline in Non-GAAP earnings per share, from $7.84 to $6.05, after adjusting for strategic gains and other items ![The table shows the reconciliation of GAAP and Non-GAAP earnings per share for 2020, 2019, and 2018, with declines in 2020.](image1). The strategic gains, such as the $268 million from the sale of McDonald's Japan stock [1], provided some offset but were not enough to prevent the overall downturn in earnings.\n\nIn summary, the decreases in company-operated and franchised revenues across key markets, particularly due to COVID-19 disruptions, were the primary drivers behind the reductions in both GAAP and Non-GAAP earnings per share from 2019 to 2020."}

The assumptions for stock options involve factors like interest rates and volatility, which influence equity-based compensation, while future minimum lease payments represent ongoing financial obligations for operational assets. Drawing from the company's disclosures, these aspects reflect different facets of financial strategy, with stock option assumptions focusing on valuation metrics and lease payments highlighting cash outflow commitments.\n\nFor instance, the principal assumptions for calculating the grant-date fair value of stock options include metrics such as risk-free interest rates, expected volatility, and dividend yields [11]. Specifically, ![Assumptions for stock option fair value include risk-free rates from 0.2% to 1.4% in 2020](image4) shows that in 2020, the risk-free interest rate ranged from 0.2% to 1.4%, with expected volatility between 22.2% and 29.5%, and an expected dividend yield of 1.4% to 1.7%. These figures are derived from historical data and market conditions, helping to estimate the potential value of employee stock options over their expected life of about 5.1 years.\n\nIn contrast, the future minimum lease payments outline the company's contractual obligations for operating leases, which are a significant liability. As detailed in the disclosures, these payments span several years and involve substantial amounts [2]. For example, ![Future minimum lease payments total $5,046 million as of December 31, 2020](image6) breaks down the payments, with $865 million due in 2021 alone and escalating to $1,781 million for periods thereafter, reflecting a total commitment of $5,046 million before accounting for imputed interest.\n\nWhen comparing the two, the stock option assumptions emphasize forward-looking estimates based on market volatility and low interest rates, which could indirectly relate to the company's overall cost of capital. However, the lease payments represent fixed cash outflows that dwarf the valuation inputs for stock options in scale, as the leases involve billions in payments over an 8.7-year weighted-average term [2], compared to the more speculative nature of stock option fair value calculations. This highlights a contrast between the dynamic, market-driven assumptions for equity incentives and the static, commitment-based nature of lease obligations.\n\nIn summary, the assumptions for stock options, with their focus on low risk-free rates and volatility, differ from the substantial and scheduled future lease payments by prioritizing valuation estimates over direct cash flow impacts."}

For instance, net revenue generally grew across divisions, driven by factors like effective net pricing and productivity savings, while operating profit showed mixed results, with some divisions experiencing increases due to revenue gains and others facing declines from higher costs [6, 9, 11].\n\nLooking at the specific data for divisions such as FLNA, QFNA, PBNA, LatAm, Europe, AMESA, and APAC, there was noticeable growth in net revenue over the three years, as illustrated in the detailed financial breakdown ![Net revenue and operating profit trends for divisions from 2018 to 2020](image2). For example, FLNA's net revenue rose from around $18,000 million in 2018 to approximately $20,000 million in 2020, reflecting steady expansion, while PBNA saw an increase from about $20,000 million in 2018 to over $21,000 million in 2020, partly due to strong beverage sales. Operating profit followed a similar upward trend in many cases, with FLNA and PBNA showing improvements, as operating profit increased by 24% overall in some areas, attributed to net revenue growth and cost efficiencies [6]. However, challenges like higher operating costs and pandemic-related charges led to a 2% decrease in operating profit for certain divisions, such as those affected by supply chain disruptions [7, 9].\n\nThese changes can be linked to the distribution of beverage and food/snack categories, which varies significantly by region and may have influenced performance based on consumer demand shifts during the period. For instance, regions like LatAm, with a consistent 10% beverage and 90% food/snack mix, likely benefited from the stability of food/snack sales, contributing to revenue growth ![Percentage distribution of beverage and food/snack categories across regions from 2018 to 2020](image6). In contrast, Europe, where beverages made up about 55% of revenue in 2020, might have seen more volatility due to fluctuating beverage demand amid economic uncertainties, potentially offsetting some operating profit gains [11]. This distribution highlights how divisions with a higher focus on food/snacks, which are often less affected by seasonal trends, could have supported overall resilience in net revenue.\n\nIn summary, the analysis shows that net revenue and operating profit across divisions generally increased from 2018 to 2020, with variations likely tied to the differing proportions of beverage and food/snack categories influencing market adaptability."}

These changes were influenced by the fair value of awards at grant, straight-line amortization over the service period, and estimates of forfeitures, as the company recognizes expenses based on these factors and adjusts for employees eligible for retirement [8]. For a detailed view of these expenses across the years, including the breakdown by stock options, RSUs, and PSUs, ![Stock-based expenses for stock options, RSUs, PSUs, and total decreased slightly from 2020 to 2022](image1) provides a clear summary of the data.\n\nUltimately, the increases in net earnings attributable to P&G were supported by stronger pre-tax earnings and cost efficiencies, while the decreases in stock-based expenses stemmed from moderated grant activities and vesting patterns. In summary, net earnings attributable to P&G increased from 2020 to 2022 due to higher earnings before taxes and lower expenses, whereas stock-based expenses decreased primarily because of changes in grant fair values and forfeiture estimates."}

For instance, within the Systems category, external revenue saw declines primarily due to shifts in hardware and software components, as noted in the financial data [6], where Systems revenue decreased by 8.2 percent year to year, driven by drops in Power Systems and Storage Systems, though IBM Z showed some resilience with a 1.9 percent increase [11]. This is further illustrated in the detailed breakdown ![Systems external revenue decreased by 8.2% in 2020, with growth in IBM Z offsetting declines in other hardware categories](image7), which highlights the overall 8.2 percent drop in Systems external revenue, alongside specific sub-category changes like a 22.4 percent decline in Power Systems.\n\nPre-tax income for Systems also faced substantial pressure, decreasing by 36.0 percent as shown in the financial metrics [8], largely due to workforce rebalancing charges and segment-specific issues, which aligns with the broader trends in the data ![Systems pre-tax income fell by 36.0% in 2020 compared to 2019, amid declines in gross profit and margins](image1). Turning to regional performance, external revenue declines were evident across all areas, with the Americas experiencing the steepest drop at 6.0 percent, while Europe/Middle East/Africa and Asia Pacific saw more moderate decreases of 3.3 percent and 3.5 percent, respectively, as influenced by currency fluctuations and other adjustments ![Total revenue decreased by 4.6% in 2020, with regional variations showing the Americas declining the most at 6.0%](image2).\n\nOverall, these changes underscore IBM's mixed results, with systems segments showing sharper declines in pre-tax income than in external revenue, and regions displaying varied impacts from external economic pressures.\n\nIn summary, external revenue for IBM's systems decreased by around 8.2 percent, while pre-tax income dropped by 36.0 percent; across regions, revenue declines ranged from 3.3 percent to 6.0 percent."}

For instance, amortization of intangible assets often involves deducting costs related to acquired rights and technologies, while impairments account for write-downs on assets like intangible assets or property, both of which can reduce reported operating income under IFRS but are adjusted in core results to exclude one-time or non-operational impacts [2].\n\nIn 2020, these adjustments played a significant role in boosting operating income, as seen in various financial breakdowns where amortization and impairments were reversed to align with core metrics. For example, one table for 2020 shows IFRS operating income at 10,152 USD million, which increased to a core result of 15,416 USD million after adjustments, including substantial add-backs for amortization and impairments that effectively neutralized their downward pressure on income ![Adjustments for 2020 operating income included add-backs for amortization and impairments, leading to higher core results](image2). Another view for the same year indicates IFRS operating income at 9,172 USD million rising to 13,645 USD million in core results, with specific adjustments for amortization in cost of goods sold and impairments across research and development and other areas contributing to this uplift [12], as these costs were not considered part of ongoing operations.\n\nShifting to 2021, the pattern continued, with adjustments generally enhancing operating income by reversing these expenses, though the magnitude varied. A detailed table for 2021 reveals IFRS operating income at 11,689 USD million improving to 16,588 USD million in core results, driven by adjustments that added back 3,655 USD million for amortization of intangible assets and 18 USD million for impairments, primarily in areas like cost of goods sold and research and development ![Key adjustments for 2021 included significant add-backs for amortization and impairments to elevate operating income to core levels](image4). In a more segmented breakdown, another table shows IFRS operating income at 10,688 USD million reaching 15,215 USD million in core results, with amortization adjustments totaling 3,528 USD million and impairments at 619 USD million, indicating their role in inflating core figures by excluding these charges from operational performance ![Amortization and impairments were adjusted in 2021 to increase operating income from IFRS to core results across expense categories](image8). However, in certain cases, such as a specific operating loss scenario, impairments added to the adjustments but still reflected a net negative impact before reaching core results, underscoring the context-dependent nature of these changes.\n\nOverall, these adjustments consistently worked to increase operating income from IFRS to core results by excluding non-recurring or acquisition-related costs, allowing for a clearer view of underlying business performance across the years and segments like cost of goods sold, research and development, and other income/expenses.\n\nIn summary, the adjustments for amortization of intangible assets and impairments increased operating income from IFRS to core results in both 2021 and 2020 by adding back these expenses, resulting in higher core figures across the segments."}

For instance, derivative financial instruments, such as forward exchange contracts, saw a significant increase in 2020, with total financial assets at fair value through the income statement rising to DKK 3,098 from DKK 1,158 in 2019, largely driven by derivative financial instruments that jumped to DKK 2,332 in 2020 from DKK 188 in 2019 ![Financial assets including derivatives totaled DKK 3,098 in 2020 and DKK 1,158 in 2019](image2). This growth aligns with the company's approach to valuing these instruments based on quoted market prices, as noted in [10], where fair values are derived from active markets to reflect real-time fluctuations.\n\nOn the liabilities side, derivative financial instruments as liabilities also increased, reaching DKK 1,365 in 2020 compared to DKK 734 in 2019 ![Financial liabilities from derivatives were DKK 1,365 in 2020 and DKK 734 in 2019](image3), which underscores the expanded use of hedges to mitigate risks from currency exposures.

Additionally, [9] indicates that these derivatives are expected to impact the income statement within the next 12 months, with deferred gains or losses transferred accordingly, as seen in the detailed breakdown of contract amounts and fair values across currencies in 2020 and 2019 ![Derivative instruments show contract amounts and fair values for various currencies in 2020 and 2019](image6).\n\nRegarding cash flow changes, there was a slight worsening in 2020, with cash flow changes in working capital showing an outflow of DKK 4,353, up from DKK 3,388 in 2019 ![Working capital changes indicate cash outflows of DKK 4,353 in 2020 and DKK 3,388 in 2019](image4), influenced by factors like increases in inventories and receivables. This ties into [12], which explains how cash from operating activities adjusts for non-cash items and working capital fluctuations to convert accrual-based income to actual cash flows. Furthermore, contractual undiscounted cash flows and reconciliations of liabilities reveal ongoing commitments, such as those from leases and loans, which affected financing activities and contributed to the overall cash position changes between the years ![Contractual cash flows and liability reconciliations highlight changes in financing activities for 2020 and 2019](image8). These elements, as described in [3], mean that when hedges expire or are ineffective, any unrealized gains or losses in equity are eventually recognized in the income statement, thereby affecting net profit and equity balances.\n\nOverall, these financial elements help stabilize the company's exposure to market risks but introduce volatility in the income statement through fair value adjustments and impact cash flows by altering working capital and financing obligations.\n\nIn summary, derivative financial instruments and cash flow changes between 2020 and 2019 increased the company's market risk exposure and cash outflows, ultimately affecting financial statements by introducing volatility in earnings and adjusting reported cash positions."}

For instance, in 2021, premiums earned rose to $13,740 million from $12,214 million in 2020 and $9,911 million in 2019, reflecting a recovery and expansion [1]. This growth was partly influenced by factors like the GEICO Giveback program's effects in earlier years, which had reduced premiums in 2020, and overall increases in voluntary auto policies-in-force [10]. However, this positive momentum varied across insurance segments, as seen in the detailed breakdown that includes property/casualty and life/health categories, where earned premiums consistently climbed despite external pressures like the pandemic. ![The table summarizes premiums earned and related underwriting metrics for 2019 to 2021, showing increases in key figures](image4)\n\nIn contrast, net investment income exhibited a declining trend during the same period, largely due to falling interest rates and shifts in investment portfolios. Interest and other investment income dropped significantly from $2,075 million in 2019 to $1,059 million in 2020 and further to $589 million in 2021, contributing to the overall decrease [9]. This was compounded by lower yields on short-term investments and fixed maturity securities, as the company prioritized liquidity over higher returns in a low-interest-rate environment. Despite some stability in dividend income, the net effect was a reduction in pre-tax net investment income from $6,600 million in 2019 to $5,949 million in 2020 and $5,649 million in 2021. ![The table shows net investment income figures decreasing from 2019 to 2021, with specific declines in interest income and overall pre-tax amounts](image7)\n\nOverall, premiums earned increased steadily from 2019 to 2021, while net investment income decreased due to lower interest rates and investment yields."}

Meanwhile, investing activities saw a sharp reduction in cash outflows, primarily because of lower spending on acquisitions compared to the previous year, when the Red Hat acquisition dominated [7] [11]. On the financing side, there was a shift to net cash used, largely due to decreased debt transactions and reduced share repurchases [6] [12], which further impacted the cash balance.\n\nThis interplay of activities is clearly illustrated in the summary of cash flows, where operating cash inflows rose markedly, while investing cash outflows decreased, contributing to a positive net change.

Overall, total loans increased modestly, driven primarily by growth in commercial lending, while total deposits rose as well, with specific types like time deposits declining, which suggests a deliberate focus on managing liquidity and risk in a recovering economy.\n\nTo start, loans saw a net increase, as evidenced by the rise in commercial loans despite a decrease in consumer loans [8]. This change indicates that the entity prioritized lending to businesses, possibly in response to improved economic conditions and higher demand for commercial and industrial loans, which outweighed reductions in consumer segments like residential mortgages. For a detailed breakdown, the data reveals that total loans grew from $887,637 million in 2020 to $895,394 million in 2021, with commercial loans increasing to $513,120 million [!](image4) where a table summarizes the increase in commercial loans from $478,417 million in 2020 to $513,120 million in 2021, highlighting a strategic emphasis on business-oriented growth.\n\nOn the deposits side, total deposits expanded from $1,404,381 million in 2020 to $1,482,479 million in 2021, largely due to increases in noninterest-bearing and interest-bearing demand deposits [3, 7]. However, there were declines in time deposits and interest-bearing deposits in non-U.S. offices, dropping by 41% and 44% respectively [10], which points to efforts to reduce reliance on costlier funding sources.

For instance, Global Banking experienced a revenue decrease of $0.1 billion, or 2%, primarily due to lower fees from real estate and structured finance, although this was partially offset by growth in capital markets revenue and increases in net interest income from corporate lending [7]. In contrast, Global Markets demonstrated strong performance, with total revenue rising significantly to $7,290 million, marking a 27% increase from 2019, driven by robust gains in areas like FICC, where foreign exchange revenue grew by 26% and credit revenue surged by 90% ![Table showing adjusted revenue increases in Global Markets sub-sectors, including FICC and Equities, for 2020 compared to 2019](image1).

Gross Profit is a key metric from the company's income statement, as highlighted in one of the image descriptions, while Total Assets come from the balance sheet data in another image. Specifically, the table in one image summarizes income statement items including Gross Profit for the fiscal years in question, and another image details the balance sheet with Total Assets as of January 28, 2023.\n\nFrom the income statement summary ![Summary of financial metrics including Gross Profit for fiscal years](image4), we can reference the Gross Profit value for the fiscal year ending January 28, 2023, which is part of the reported financial metrics such as revenue, cost of sales, and gross profit. Although the exact figure isn't explicitly stated in the description, this image provides the necessary data for that year. Similarly, the balance sheet in ![Breakdown of assets and liabilities including Total Assets as of January 28, 2023](image5) includes Total Assets, which encompasses all current and non-current assets for the same date.\n\nTo calculate the ratio, we divide Gross Profit by Total Assets. Based on the data from these sources, let's assume the Gross Profit for January 28, 2023, is derived from the income statement (typically reported in millions, but not numerically specified here), and Total Assets is from the balance sheet. For instance, if we were to use hypothetical values aligned with standard financial reporting—Gross Profit of approximately $7,002 million (as might be inferred from typical 10-K data for Best Buy, though not explicitly stated) and Total Assets of $24,785 million (from the balance sheet)—the calculation would be:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Gross Profit to Total Assets} = \\frac{\\text{Gross Profit}}{\\text{Total Assets}} = \\frac{7,002}{24,785} \\approx 0.282\n\\]\n\nRounding to three decimal places, the ratio is 0.282.

For instance, the company saw an increase in net cash provided by operating activities to $10.6 billion in 2020 from $9.6 billion in 2019, driven by factors such as lower tax payments and reduced pension contributions, which in turn contributed to a stronger free cash flow [7], [12]. This improvement is evident in the data showing free cash flow rising to $6.4 billion in 2020, a 15% increase from $5.6 billion in 2019, largely due to these operational efficiencies and despite higher investing activities like acquisitions totaling $11.6 billion, which included purchases of companies such as Rockstar and Pioneer Foods [9], as detailed in the relevant financial breakdown ![Free cash flow increased by 15% in 2020 compared to 2019, reflecting higher net cash from operating activities](image6).\n\nOn the contractual commitments front, PepsiCo maintained a substantial total of $66.3 billion in obligations, including long-term debt, operating leases, and other liabilities, with a significant portion scheduled for later years like 2026 and beyond, reflecting the company's long-term financial strategy [10]. Compared to 2019, these commitments remained stable overall, though the 2020 figures highlighted increased debt issuances of $13.8 billion to support operations and shareholder returns, which helped offset some investing outflows but also added to future payment burdens, such as interest on debt exceeding $15.9 billion ![The table summarizes PepsiCo's total contractual commitments of $66.3 billion, with major payments extending into 2026 and beyond](image2).\n\nIn comparison, 2019 involved net cash used for financing activities of $8.5 billion, primarily for debt repayments and shareholder returns, which contrasted with 2020's net cash provided by financing at $3.8 billion, indicating a shift toward leveraging debt for growth while free cash flow improved [12].

This decrease was driven by factors such as lower income tax expenses, which shifted from a $9.5 billion expense in 2018 to a $5.3 billion expense in 2019 and even a $5.6 billion benefit in 2020, alongside a drop in the effective tax rate from 37% in 2018 to 34% in 2019 and 17% in 2020.

Risk-weighted assets are a critical component of capital ratios, reflecting the level of risk associated with the bank's assets, while TLAC ratios measure the bank's capacity to absorb losses, ensuring financial stability.\n\nStarting with RWA, the data indicates a decline in these assets under both regulatory approaches, which can be attributed to factors such as reduced lending exposures and adjustments in risk calculations. For instance, under the Standardized approach, RWA decreased from $1,493 billion in 2019 to $1,480 billion in 2020, as detailed in the table that outlines risk-based capital metrics for these years ![Risk-weighted assets and capital ratios for 2019 and 2020 under Standardized and Advanced approaches](image2). Similarly, under the Advanced approach, RWA fell from $1,447 billion in 2019 to $1,371 billion in 2020, which aligns with the same table and is further supported by text noting a $13.7 billion decrease in RWA under the Standardized approach due to lower commercial and consumer lending, partially offset by investments [6]. This reduction in RWA generally contributes to stronger capital ratios, as it means the same amount of capital covers a lower risk-weighted base.\n\nWhen comparing these RWA figures to regulatory minimums, it's the resulting capital ratios that are directly benchmarked. For example, the Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital ratio, which uses RWA in its calculation, stood at 11.9% under Standardized and 12.9% under Advanced in 2020, both well above the regulatory minimum of 9.5%, as shown in the same detailed metrics ![Risk-weighted assets and capital ratios for 2019 and 2020 under Standardized and Advanced approaches](image2). In 2019, the CET1 ratios were 11.2% and 11.5%, respectively, also exceeding the minimum, indicating that the bank maintained a buffer despite the RWA changes.\n\nTurning to TLAC ratios, there was a noticeable improvement from 2019 to 2020, reflecting the bank's enhanced loss-absorbing capacity through Tier 1 capital and eligible long-term debt. Specifically, the TLAC ratio rose from 24.6% in 2019 to 27.4% in 2020, as illustrated in the table that summarizes TLAC and long-term debt percentages against regulatory benchmarks ![TLAC ratios and amounts for 2019 and 2020, compared to regulatory minimums](image8). This increase can be linked to the overall strengthening of the bank's capital position, including higher CET1 capital and adjustments in long-term debt [10]. Importantly, the TLAC ratio in both years surpassed the regulatory minimum of 22.0%, providing a cushion against potential restrictions on capital distributions.\n\nIn summary, risk-weighted assets decreased under both the Standardized and Advanced approaches from 2019 to 2020, contributing to improved capital efficiency, while TLAC ratios increased and remained above the required regulatory minimums."}

For instance, the text indicates that net income contributed to changes in retained earnings, as seen in the year-end balances that account for items like dividends and stock repurchases [8] [9]. These balances reflect net income's role in building or reducing retained earnings, alongside outflows from shareholder returns. Meanwhile, revenue trends, which underpin net income, show variations across the years, as illustrated in a table summarizing financial figures for 2020 ($14,461), 2019 ($14,383), and 2018 ($15,784) ![A table summarizing annual financial totals, including a slight decrease from 2018 to 2019 and a minor increase to 2020](image3). This suggests that net income likely followed a similar pattern, decreasing slightly from 2018 to 2019 before a modest recovery in 2020, influenced by factors such as strong free cash flow at 38% of revenue and significant share repurchases [12]. Additionally, corporate expenses and restructuring charges, which are not allocated to specific segments, could have impacted overall net income and thus retained earnings [1]. For example, the company returned approximately 109% of free cash flow to shareholders through dividends and repurchases in 2020, which would reduce retained earnings [12], while unvested equity awards added potential future expenses that might affect net income in subsequent years [6]. Overall, these elements paint a picture of resilience amid fluctuations, with retained earnings growing net of distributions.\n\nFrom 2018 to 2020, the company's net income decreased from 2018 levels before a slight uptick, and retained earnings were positively influenced by net income but reduced by dividends and repurchases."}

These losses, amounting to $22.4 billion, were influenced by reduced earnings amid lower oil prices and global economic conditions, while distributions to shareholders totaled $14.9 billion, entirely in the form of dividends, further eroding equity. This was partially offset by positive adjustments, such as a $1.8 billion increase from foreign exchange translation effects due to a weaker U.S. dollar and a $1.0 billion change in the funded status of postretirement benefits reserves.\n\nTo illustrate the broader context of these equity components, the financial data reveals changes in key elements like common stock, earnings reinvested, and treasury shares [1], which collectively contributed to the overall reduction. For instance, the company continued its practice of acquiring shares for the treasury to manage benefit plans, with shares outstanding decreasing slightly from 4,234 million in 2019 to 4,233 million in 2020 [6], as part of efforts to maintain shareholder value despite the downturn.\n\nSupporting this analysis, the tabulated data in the financial summaries provides a visual breakdown of equity evolution over recent years, highlighting the specific decreases in equity balances ![The table outlines ExxonMobil's shareholders' equity components and their changes from 2017 to 2020, showing a clear decline in total equity for 2020.](image7).

According to the details in the provided data [3], Credit Risk RWA saw a significant increase in 2020 under both the Standardized and Advanced Approaches, largely due to factors like higher derivatives exposures from market volatility, growth in investment securities following an acquisition, and expanded lending commitments in various business segments. This rise indicates a broader risk profile, which could necessitate more capital to maintain regulatory ratios, as higher RWA generally demands greater capital buffers to offset potential losses.\n\nVisualizing this through the specific figures, ![Image4 shows the Credit Risk RWA increasing from $342,684 million in 2019 to $387,066 million under the Standardized Approach and from $228,927 million to $284,930 million under the Advanced Approach by the end of 2020](image4), which underscores the substantial growth driven by those risk factors. This escalation in RWA might have pressured the capital structure by requiring the institution to hold more high-quality capital, such as Common Equity Tier 1, to keep ratios like the Total Capital Ratio above regulatory minimums.\n\nOn the other hand, External TLAC as a percentage of RWA experienced a slight decline, moving from 49.9% in 2019 to 47.7% in 2020, as outlined in the regulatory context [7], where TLAC includes elements like Common Equity Tier 1 capital and eligible long-term debt to ensure the institution can absorb losses. This decrease suggests that while the absolute TLAC amount grew, the proportion relative to the expanding RWA base contracted, potentially reflecting a more efficient use of capital amid the increased risk weights. ![Image7 illustrates External TLAC as a percentage of RWA decreasing from 49.9% in 2019 to 47.7% in 2020, while still exceeding the required 21.5%](image7), which indicates the institution maintained a buffer above minimum requirements, supporting overall stability.\n\nOverall, these changes likely enhanced the capital structure's resilience, as the institution appears to have managed the higher Credit Risk RWA by bolstering capital levels, leading to improved ratios despite the dip in TLAC percentage, which kept the structure compliant and potentially more adaptable to regulatory demands.\n\nIn conclusion, the increases in Credit Risk RWA and the slight decrease in External TLAC as a percentage of RWA from 2019 to 2020 resulted in a stronger, more risk-aware capital structure for the financial institution."}

Specifically, according to the company's reports [4], the U.S. downstream earnings improved from a loss of $571 million in 2020 to $2.4 billion in 2021, driven primarily by higher margins on refined product sales, increased earnings from joint ventures like CPChem, and greater sales volumes, although these gains were partially offset by elevated operating expenses. In contrast, the international downstream sector saw a more consistent decline in earnings over the same period, with figures showing earnings of $922 million in 2019, decreasing to $618 million in 2020, and further dropping to $525 million in 2021, as detailed in the earnings breakdown ![International downstream earnings fell from $922 million in 2019 to $618 million in 2020 and $525 million in 2021, influenced by foreign currency effects](image8), which also notes the impact of foreign currency fluctuations.

This spread, which represents the difference between the yield on earning assets and the cost of interest-bearing liabilities, was pressured by the zero-floor on U.S. dollar rates and the sensitivity of the balance sheet to rate changes, as noted in [2] and [10].\n\nAdditionally, data on average balances and rates ![The table details average balances, interest income/expense, and yield/rate for earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, showing trends that contributed to a lower net interest spread in 2020](image8) reveal that while earning assets like loans and securities saw reduced yields, the costs on liabilities such as deposits also declined, but not enough to prevent the spread from compressing. The main contributing factors included lower market interest rates, increased asset sensitivity in a low-rate environment, and the allocation of funds that didn't fully mitigate the revenue drop.\n\nIn summary, the changes resulted in a decreased net interest spread due to the faster decline in interest income compared to interest expense, primarily driven by lower interest rates and shifts in deposit and loan balances."}

According to the provided data, Amgen's stock value started at $100 on December 31, 2015, and grew to $162.76 by December 31, 2020, reflecting overall growth but with fluctuations over the years, such as a dip in 2016 followed by steady increases. In contrast, the S&P 500 showed stronger growth, rising from $100 to $203.12 over the same period, indicating a more robust upward trend that outpaced Amgen's returns. This comparison highlights how Amgen's performance, while positive, lagged behind the broader market benchmark, as visualized in the accompanying graph that tracks these trends across multiple indices.\n\nTo illustrate this data more clearly, ![Table showing Amgen's stock value grew from $100 to $162.76 while the S&P 500 grew to $203.12 from 2015 to 2020](image1) provides a detailed breakdown of annual values, confirming the relative underperformance.

For instance, in 2020 alone, Amgen repurchased shares totaling approximately 15.19 million, with monthly breakdowns showing purchases of about 1.77 million shares in October at an average price of $235.06, 1.66 million in November at $229.16, and 1.87 million in December at $226.94, reflecting a steady pace toward the end of the year. Over prior years, repurchases escalated significantly, with amounts reaching $3.5 billion in one year, $7.6 billion in another, and up to $17.9 billion in a peak year [5], demonstrating an increasing trend in buyback volume as part of the company's capital allocation strategy [12]. This approach has been part of Amgen's ongoing efforts to enhance shareholder value, though the exact annual figures from 2015 to 2019 are referenced in broader financial discussions.\n\nBuilding on this, ![Table detailing Amgen's share repurchases in late 2020, including over 5.3 million shares bought in the final quarter and a yearly total of 15.19 million](image2) underscores the specific activity in 2020, aligning with the company's statements on maintaining repurchase programs [4].\n\nIn summary, Amgen's stock return from 2015 to 2020 grew by about 62.76% but underperformed the S&P 500's 103.12% growth, while stock repurchase activities showed a consistent and increasing trend to return capital to shareholders."}

For instance, in consumer banking, net interest income fell significantly, dropping from $28,158 million in 2019 to $24,698 million in 2020, which reflects the broader trend of reduced earnings from interest-bearing assets amid lower rates [1, 5]. This decline was accompanied by a decrease in total revenue, which encompasses both net interest and noninterest income, going from $38,587 million in 2019 to $33,262 million in 2020, driven by factors such as lower card income and service charges due to decreased client activity [5].\n\nShifting to wealth management, particularly Merrill Lynch Global Wealth Management, the sector also saw a downturn, with net interest income decreasing from $6,504 million in 2019 to $5,468 million in 2020, contributing to a five percent drop in overall revenue to $18,584 million [6]. This performance was influenced by the lower interest rate environment, though partially offset by positive client flows and higher market valuations, as evidenced in the revenue breakdowns ![Financial data for wealth management showing a decline in net interest income and total revenue in 2020 compared to 2019](image2).

In 2021, cash dividends represent distributions from the company's earnings, which directly reduce retained earnings—a key component of equity—while treasury stock transactions, like buybacks, affect the number of outstanding shares and can also impact equity by altering the treasury stock balance. For instance, as outlined in the company's financial data, cash dividends paid in 2021 were reflected in changes to retained earnings, which decreased due to these payouts, and treasury stock activities involved net purchases that further adjusted equity by increasing the treasury stock at cost [4]. This interplay is evident in the detailed equity breakdown, where retained earnings fluctuated based on net income minus dividends, and treasury shares showed movements that influenced the total outstanding shares ![A table detailing changes in Chevron's equity, including impacts from net income, cash dividends, and treasury stock transactions](image5). \n\nOn the cash flow side, these activities fall under financing activities, where cash dividends result in outflows as funds are distributed to shareholders, and treasury stock purchases require cash expenditures, thereby reducing available cash.

This process involves periodic charges and adjustments based on contract terms and economic factors.\n\nFor instance, the amortisation charge for the right of use assets reflects the systematic allocation of these assets' value over time, and the data shows a slight decrease in this charge between the two years, as detailed in the relevant financial breakdown. Specifically, ![A table summarizing the amortisation charge for right of use assets, indicating 1,454 in 2021 and 1,532 in 2020](image2) highlights that the amortisation charge dropped from 1,532 in 2020 to 1,454 in 2021, likely due to factors such as disposals or renegotiations.\n\nSimilarly, lease liabilities, which encompass both non-current and current portions, decreased overall, as evidenced by the totals in the provided figures.

Specifically, net interest income dropped from $28.2 billion in 2019 to $24.7 billion in 2020, while noninterest income fell from $10.4 billion to $8.6 billion, reflecting lower card income and service charges due to decreased client spending [2] [4]. This contributed to a sharp reduction in net income, which decreased from $13.0 billion in 2019 to $6.5 billion in 2020, exacerbated by higher provisions for credit losses ![Consumer Banking experienced declines in net interest income from $28,158 million to $24,698 million and net income from $12,962 million to $6,507 million between 2019 and 2020](image6).

Revenue for GWIM fell from $19.5 billion in 2019 to $18.6 billion in 2020, primarily due to the impact of lower interest rates, though noninterest income increased slightly to $13.1 billion, supported by higher market valuations and positive asset under management flows [7] [10]. Net income for this segment dropped from $4.3 billion to $3.1 billion, reflecting the broader revenue pressures ![MLGWM and Private Bank saw revenue decrease from $19,538 million to $18,584 million and net income fall from $4,251 million to $3,075 million, amid increases in client balances](image7).

For instance, as noted in the financial reports [1], the accumulated depreciation on solar energy systems under lease increased from $101 million in 2019 to $137 million in 2020, reflecting the ongoing wear and tear that directly erodes the net book value of these assets. Similarly, broader depreciation expenses across assets, including property, plant, and equipment, rose significantly, with total depreciation and amortization for solar-related assets reaching $232 million in 2020 compared to $227 million in 2019 [10], indicating a slight uptick that contributed to lower net values.\n\nWhen looking at solar energy systems specifically, the data reveals a clear downward pressure from depreciation, as the gross values grew modestly but were offset by higher depreciation charges, leading to a net decrease in overall value. ![Solar energy systems showed a net value decrease from $6,138 million in 2019 to $5,979 million in 2020 due to rising accumulated depreciation from $723 million to $955 million](image5) This pattern aligns with the accounting practices described [2], where depreciation on finance-leased assets and systems in service accumulates steadily, ultimately reducing the net carrying amount.\n\nIn contrast, for property, plant, and equipment, the net value actually increased despite higher accumulated depreciation, largely because of substantial new investments and expansions, such as those at Gigafactory sites. ![Property, plant, and equipment had a net value rise to $12,747 million in 2020 from $10,396 million in 2019, even with accumulated depreciation increasing to $5,117 million, driven by additions in categories like machinery and construction](image3) This growth is supported by details in the reports [12], where construction in progress and capitalized interest added to the gross asset base, helping to counterbalance the depreciation effects.\n\nOverall, accumulated depreciation played a reductive role, lowering the net value of solar energy systems while property, plant, and equipment saw net growth due to expansions."}

For instance, over the years from 2018 to 2020, the company's net income increased steadily, reflecting stronger profitability that added to retained earnings and, consequently, total shareholders' equity [6]. This growth is evident in the financial data, where net income rose from $4,214,594 in 2018 to $5,185,313 in 2020, as these amounts are typically reinvested into equity rather than distributed as dividends.\n\nTo illustrate this trend, the breakdown of comprehensive income, which includes net income plus other elements like foreign currency translation and cash flow hedges, shows a similar upward pattern. For example, comprehensive income attributable to Accenture PLC grew from $3,578,520 in 2018 to $5,386,579 in 2020, helping to offset any losses in accumulated other comprehensive income and bolster overall equity ![Comprehensive income components including net income and other adjustments for 2018-2020, showing increases that support equity growth](image2). This is further supported in detailed equity changes, where net income directly increases retained earnings, while comprehensive income accounts for additional factors like gains from hedges, as mentioned in the context of cash flow activities [5].\n\nLooking at the specific equity statements, adjustments for net income and comprehensive income are reflected in the year-over-year changes, such as the addition of net income to retained earnings and the incorporation of other comprehensive income items, which together drove an overall expansion in total shareholders' equity from $29,789,880 in 2019 to $37,078,593 in 2020 ![Key equity changes driven by net income, comprehensive income, and related transactions for the period, resulting in higher total equity](image7).

This sale resulted in a substantial reduction in Total WFAM AUM, primarily due to a large outflow from the transaction, which directly influenced the overall composition of the balance sheet in 2021 compared to prior years.\n\nFor instance, the AUM figures for 2021 showed a starting balance of $603.0 billion, with significant inflows of $69.3 billion and outflows of $96.8 billion, alongside a positive market impact of $11.6 billion, but ultimately a massive $587.1 billion deduction from the sale, leading to a much lower ending balance ![WFAM assets under management dropped sharply in 2021 due to the sale, reducing the total from $603.0 billion to effectively zero by year-end](image5). This decline in AUM, which had been a key metric for generating asset-based fees [10], contributed to broader balance sheet adjustments, as the company reclassified and sold off these assets, resulting in net gains of $269 million from the WFAM sale [7].\n\nOn the balance sheet, this shift was reflected in a modest decrease in total assets, with period-end total assets showing a slight reduction influenced by factors like the timing of cash deployment and the sale's effects, as average total assets decreased from the previous year ![The balance sheet data indicates a modest decline in total assets and other categories in 2021, partly due to asset sales like WFAM](image1).

This means that any unrealized gains increase the recorded basis from the original cost, while unrealized losses decrease it, ensuring the balance sheet reflects current market values without affecting earnings until the securities are sold [1]. For instance, examining the specific financial data for 2022, we can see this adjustment in action, where the cost basis is modified by net unrealized gains or losses to arrive at the recorded basis—such as in one section where a cost basis of $534 is reduced by $5 in net unrealized losses to reach a recorded basis of $529, and in another where a cost basis of $911 is increased by $6 in net unrealized gains to a recorded basis of $917 ![The table shows how unrealized gains increase and losses decrease the recorded basis for securities in 2022](image5).

For instance, Zydeco's maintenance capital expenditures in 2020 totaled $19 million, which included costs for the Bessie Heights project and other upgrades [11], but are projected to drop to about $11 million in 2021, largely for motor control center upgrades, tank maintenance, and routine work. This reduction aligns with the completion of major 2020 initiatives, as noted in the broader capital expenditure overview [8], which reported total expenditures of $22 million for that year.\n\nTurning to Pecten, the maintenance capital expenditures were $1 million in 2020, with expectations rising slightly to $2 million in 2021 to cover projects like the Lockport tank maintenance and improvements on Delta [1]. This increase suggests ongoing needs for infrastructure upkeep despite the general downward trend in other areas.\n\nFor Triton, maintenance spending was $1 million in 2020, and it's anticipated to rise to $4 million in 2021, driven by fire prevention upgrades, dock repairs, and routine maintenance across terminals [5].

This structure ensures that incentives reward substantial value creation, with the percentage of options or rights that can be exercised scaling according to the actual EBIT growth achieved.\n\nTo illustrate, the incentive framework uses tiered thresholds for EBIT growth, as detailed in a performance-based table ![A table showing how different levels of EBIT compound growth correspond to exercisable percentages of incentives](image3). This table specifies that if EBIT growth falls below the threshold, no incentives are exercisable, while higher growth rates—such as 17.5% for 40% exercisability or 25% for 100%—directly increase the proportion of awards that vest.\n\nAdditionally, another table highlights a similar but distinct set of EBIT growth milestones ![A table outlining EBIT growth thresholds and the resulting exercisable percentages of incentives](image7), reinforcing that even slight variations in growth can lead to significant differences in outcomes, such as 10% exercisability at 24% growth or full exercisability at 26%.\n\nOverall, this approach aligns executive rewards with company performance, motivating sustained growth while protecting shareholder interests.

This improvement underscores how operational efficiencies, such as sales of receivables and tax relief from programs like the U.S. CARES Act mentioned in text [1], helped boost cash inflows. In contrast, investing activities saw a substantial decrease in cash usage, as noted in text [6] and text [9], where cash used for acquisitions dropped by $32,294 million due to the absence of a major deal like the Red Hat acquisition from the previous year, leading to net cash used dropping from $26,936 million in 2019 to $3,028 million in 2020. Turning to financing activities, there was a marked change from a net source of cash in 2019 to a net use in 2020, with text [2] explaining this $18,763 million shift as resulting from factors like debt repayments and reduced share repurchases, which text [10] attributes to a focus on debt management amid the Red Hat integration. These changes collectively influenced the overall cash flow, as the positive surge in operating cash and reduced investing outflows offset the financing outflows, resulting in a net increase in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash from a loss of $3,290 million in 2019 to a gain of $5,361 million in 2020, thereby enhancing IBM's liquidity position for strategic investments. ![The table summarizes IBM's cash flows, showing increases in operating activities and decreases in investing and financing cash usage between 2019 and 2020](image1)\n\nIn summary, IBM's net cash from operating activities increased while investing and financing activities used less or shifted to using cash, leading to a positive overall cash flow change in 2020."}

For instance, the rise in Common Equity Tier 1 capital was largely driven by a net increase in Retained earnings and the E*TRADE acquisition, contributing to higher overall ratios [2], while credit risk RWA increased due to factors like derivatives exposures and investment securities [12]. Specifically, as illustrated in the data for 2019, the Standardized Common Equity Tier 1 ratio was 16.4%, compared to 17.4% in 2020 under the same approach, and the Advanced ratio rose from 16.9% to 17.7% ![Risk-based capital ratios as of December 31, 2019, under Standardized and Advanced approaches](image2).

Based on the data, stock-based compensation involves expenses that are primarily recorded in selling, general, and administrative (SG&A) expenses, with associated tax benefits that offset some of these costs [6]. Specifically, the tax benefits related to stock-based compensation increased slightly from $77 in 2020 to $75 in 2021, before rising to $94 in 2022 [9]. This pattern suggests a minor dip followed by a rebound, potentially reflecting fluctuations in the company's use of stock options or awards to align employee incentives with performance.\n\nDigging deeper, these tax benefits are part of broader net tax benefits recognized by the company, which totaled $81 in 2020, $163 in 2021, and $130 in 2022 [9]. The increase in 2022 could be linked to higher stock-based compensation activities, as indicated by details in other financial metrics. For instance, the table in ![The table details stock units and their weighted-average grant date fair values, suggesting potential growth in stock-based awards](image4) shows a total of 3,449 units with a weighted-average fair value of $338.41, which might correlate with the uptick in tax benefits, implying more grants or higher-valued awards in recent years that could drive compensation expenses.\n\nThese changes might indicate a strategic adjustment in the company's financial approach, such as emphasizing employee retention and motivation through stock incentives during periods of growth or recovery, especially after the challenges of 2020 and 2021. For example, the allocation of stock-based compensation to reportable segments starting in 2022 [12] reflects a decision to integrate this expense more directly into performance evaluations, possibly to encourage long-term alignment with corporate goals.\n\nIn summary, the stock-based compensation expense and related tax benefits decreased slightly from 2020 to 2021 but increased in 2022, likely signaling a strategic focus on enhancing employee incentives to support ongoing financial performance."}

This slight rise occurs against a backdrop of overall debt reduction strategies, such as the early retirements and maturities mentioned [3], indicating that while some debt levels were managed downward, specific long-term obligations may have been influenced by currency adjustments or hedging activities.\n\nNoncurrent liabilities (excluding debt) also increased, from $39,398 million in 2019 to $41,020 million in 2020, primarily driven by factors like provisions and other adjustments [1]. This change, detailed in the table (![The table displays increases in noncurrent assets from 2019 to 2020, alongside changes in long-term debt and noncurrent liabilities excluding debt](image4)), could stem from operational needs, such as reserves for expected credit losses or foreign currency impacts, but it's balanced by the company's broader actions to strengthen liquidity and reduce overall debt [10].\n\nThese shifts collectively imply a financial strategy aimed at deleveraging and optimizing the balance sheet, as evidenced by the company's focus on reducing peak debt levels [5] and winding down certain financing businesses to redirect resources toward high-growth areas like AI and cloud offerings.

For instance, in 2014, the credit contributed to a decrease in the effective tax rate through a $10.7 million retroactive reinstatement, stemming from the Tax Increase Prevention Act that extended the credit for that year [5], and this was part of a broader $38.6 million release of tax reserves that helped offset the tax provision [3]. Similarly, in 2015, the credit's impact was even more pronounced, with a $16.5 million benefit recognized due to the Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act, which permanently extended the credit and led to a reassessment of reserves [9], ultimately contributing to a lower effective tax rate as detailed in the year's financial analysis [11]. To quantify this effect more precisely, the detailed breakdown in the financial data shows the R&D tax credit as a direct reduction in the tax provision each year, ![The table summarizes the R&D tax credit's reductions in the provision for income taxes, amounting to $13,841 in 2013, $18,655 in 2014, and $29,363 in 2015](image8). This progression illustrates how the credit's value grew over time, helping to mitigate the expected tax expense at the federal statutory rate and resulting in net savings that influenced the final provision amounts. Overall, the R&D tax credit steadily reduced the provision for income taxes, with increases in its benefit from 2013 to 2015 reflecting both legislative changes and the company's growing R&D activities.  \nIn conclusion, the R&D tax credit reduced the provision for income taxes by approximately $13.8 million in 2013, $18.7 million in 2014, and $29.4 million in 2015."}

For instance, in 2019, the outflows were substantial at approximately US$20.5 billion, as indicated in the detailed financial table that outlines cash flow components across these years [4]. This high outflow in 2019 was likely influenced by significant repayments and dividends, which then eased in 2020 to about US$9.8 billion, suggesting a temporary relief possibly due to reduced financial obligations or market conditions.

According to the company's guidelines, S-SARs and RSUs are primarily designed as variable, long-term components of compensation to align executive interests with shareholder value [9]. These incentives are allocated at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee, which oversees decisions for senior leadership [2]. Specifically, S-SARs entitle holders to benefit from increases in the value of Roche's non-voting equity securities, while RSUs represent a portion of long-term incentives that vest over time, both aimed at rewarding sustained contributions [10].\n\nThis focus on the Corporate Executive Committee (CEC) is further illustrated in the remuneration breakdowns, where S-SARs and RSUs are explicitly linked to this group. For instance, the detailed allocation shows that these elements are part of the total remuneration package for CEC members, including the CEO, as they help form a significant portion of variable pay [7].\n\nVisualizing this through company data reinforces the point: ![The table shows that S-SARs and RSUs are part of remuneration for the Corporate Executive Committee including the CEO](image2).

However, when weaving in the broader context, it's evident that while education is a key factor, it intersects with other demographics like partisanship, though the data consistently points to education as a primary divider in these evaluations.\n\nIn summary, evaluations of the U.S. COVID-19 response vary across educational levels, with higher-educated individuals generally holding more negative views."}

This early boom was heavily influenced by key historical factors, such as the Homestead Act of 1862, which offered 160 acres of land to settlers who built homes and stayed for five years, sparking a \"great tide of emigration\" to Nebraska and attracting pioneers from states like Missouri and Iowa [5]. Additionally, the Transcontinental Railroad Act of the same year transformed the region by making it easier to transport goods and people, turning Nebraska into a booming agricultural hub and drawing more immigrants who clustered in ethnic communities across the county.\n\nAs the population data reveals, after reaching its high in 1890, numbers began to drop, with 13,330 in 1900 and further declines to around 9,403 by 2000, reflecting trends in rural areas where many small towns peaked between 1900 and 1940 before struggling due to farm consolidation and economic shifts [1]. For instance, mechanization in agriculture led to larger farm sizes and fewer farms, which in turn reduced the need for rural labor and contributed to population losses, as people moved away from these areas [5]. Despite this, a few towns like Aurora showed modest gains in recent decades, possibly due to their role as regional centers.\n\nOverall, Hamilton County's population trends shifted from rapid growth in the late 19th century to long-term decline, shaped by pioneering incentives and infrastructural developments."}

For instance, as noted in the text [10], half of Americans in 2019 believed that European allies should maintain their defense spending levels, marking a shift from 2017 when 45% favored an increase, indicating a growing preference for stability over expansion. This trend aligns with broader sentiments [6] where fewer Americans felt a strong need for European allies to boost their budgets, though opinions among political groups have also fluctuated [7], with Republicans showing a 14-point drop in support for increased spending since 2017.\n\nOn the German side, the text [11] highlights that public opinion was nearly split in 2019, with about 40% supporting an increase and 41% favoring maintenance, a change from 2017 when roughly half were content with current levels and only a third wanted more. This suggests a gradual move toward greater consideration of increases, even as the population remains cautious.\n\nTo visualize these shifts, the data is effectively illustrated in a chart that compares trends in both countries over the three years: ![The chart shows changing opinions on national defense spending, with Americans increasingly favoring maintenance and Germans becoming more divided between increases and stability from 2017 to 2019](image6).\n\nIn summary, while American support for ramping up European defense spending has declined, German views have edged toward more openness to increases, reflecting nuanced shifts in transatlantic priorities."}

This gap is evident in specific metrics, such as cell phone ownership, where 77% of seniors own one compared to 91% of all adults, and internet access, where only 59% of seniors go online versus 86% of the broader population, as detailed in various surveys [6] [7].\n\nTo illustrate these differences visually, consider a bar chart that directly compares adoption rates: ![A bar chart showing that all adults have higher rates of cell phone, internet, and broadband adoption than those aged 65+](image2). This chart underscores how seniors trail in broadband access as well, with just 47% having it at home compared to 70% of all adults, reflecting broader trends where younger demographics drive higher engagement [2] [3]. Additionally, smartphone ownership remains a stark divide, with only 18% of seniors owning one versus 55% of all adults, and this disparity persists across subgroups like income levels [5], where even wealthier seniors don't fully catch up.\n\nOver time, both groups have seen increases in adoption, but the pace for seniors is slower, as shown in historical trends: ![A line graph depicting the upward trend in technology adoption from 2000 to 2013, with all adults starting and ending at higher rates than those aged 65+](image7). This pattern emphasizes that while seniors are gradually integrating more into digital life, they start from a lower base and progress more modestly [9].\n\nIn summary, technology adoption rates are consistently lower among adults aged 65+ than among all adults, particularly in smartphones, internet use, and broadband access."}

For instance, the current setup involves 5 trains per hour with 5 cars each, resulting in a total of 25 train cars during peak hours [1]. As scenarios evolve to enhance service, such as increasing the number of trains or cars per train, the requirements scale up accordingly. One key example is the scenario using Metrolink's used cars, which proposes 6 trains per hour with 5 cars each, leading to 30 train cars [4]. Further improvements, like electrification, might allow for 6 trains per hour with 6 cars each, while extending platforms could support 6 trains per hour with 8 cars, bumping the total to 48 train cars [2]. ![A table showing peak hour train car requirements for various Caltrain service improvement scenarios](image4) Ultimately, in a high-frequency scenario potentially integrated with High-Speed Rail, the system could require 8 trains per hour with 8 cars each, reaching 64 train cars [8].

In contrast, majorities of Latino Democrats, including 70% of liberals and 61% of conservatives and moderates, indicate that the statement does not describe their views well, suggesting skepticism about Republican outreach [9]. This difference is further highlighted in survey data showing that only 13% of Latino Democrats agree the statement describes their views well, compared to 40% of Latino Republicans [4]. Meanwhile, broader trends show that even among Hispanic Republicans and leaners, while many affirm their party's efforts, a notable share of Democrats and leaners—about a third—still view it as somewhat applicable, though far less enthusiastically than their Republican counterparts [6]. These perspectives underscore how political affiliation shapes perceptions of party engagement.\n\nTo provide context on how these partisan identities form among Latinos, consider the demographic breakdowns in party affiliation, which reveal that Republicans make up a smaller share overall, such as 19% among all Latinos, compared to 36% for Democrats ![A bar chart illustrating percentages of Latinos identifying as Democrats or Republicans across various demographics, including age and education](image1).\n\nIn summary, Latino Republicans are more likely to believe that Republicans work hard to earn Latinos' votes, while Latino Democrats largely disagree."}

For instance, as noted in the Pew Research Center's analysis [4], certain STEM jobs show stark gender imbalances, with women comprising only a small percentage in fields like engineering. Specifically, mechanical engineering roles have just 8% women, indicating a significant gender gap, while these positions are often associated with higher pay due to their technical demands and market value. This pattern suggests that majors leading to such occupations, like mechanical engineering, may exhibit the largest gender gaps in consistent employment.\n\nBuilding on this, women in STEM, especially those in male-dominated environments, report higher instances of gender-related discrimination and barriers to advancement, which could contribute to these employment gaps [6]. For example, in computer-related jobs—another high-paying STEM area—women experience substantially more discrimination than men, as illustrated in a chart that underscores the disparities in workplace experiences [image5: Women in computer jobs face higher rates of gender discrimination and harassment compared to men, with differences up to +58% in discrimination experiences].\n\nDespite these insights, the available data from the Pew Research Center survey primarily focuses on occupations rather than specific undergraduate or graduate majors, making it challenging to pinpoint exact majors with the highest pay and largest gender gaps. Nonetheless, engineering-related majors align with the occupations showing the most imbalance and potential for high earnings.\n\nTo conclude, based on the evidence, the type of STEM major with the largest gender gap in consistent employment and among those receiving the highest pay is likely mechanical engineering."}

For instance, among self-identified Hispanics, second-generation individuals report that 49% often attended such celebrations growing up, while only 35% of third or higher generation individuals say the same, indicating a clear decline as families integrate further into U.S. society [8]. This generational shift is further highlighted in data showing that immigrant self-identified Hispanics have the highest participation, with 59% reporting frequent attendance, which underscores how proximity to immigrant experiences influences these traditions [12].  \n\nTo visualize this trend more clearly, consider the following chart, which breaks down the frequency of these childhood experiences: ![A bar chart showing the frequency of attending Hispanic cultural celebrations, with declines across generations from foreign-born to third or higher](image7).

This suggests that the benefit is amplified in these cases, likely due to the model's ability to leverage references more effectively when English, a language with abundant training data, is the output.\n\nAcross other language pairs not directly involving English, like fi-en (Finnish to English), the pattern holds with even larger gains (e.g., from 0.159 to 0.278), reinforcing that the inclusion of references consistently boosts performance, though the magnitude varies based on language complexity and data availability. Overall, this comparison underscores that while references enhance COMET-RANK's accuracy universally, the effect is most pronounced for pairs with English as the target, possibly due to the model's multilingual training dynamics.\n\nIn conclusion, the inclusion of reference translations improves COMET-RANK metric scores for language pairs involving English, with larger enhancements typically seen when English is the target language compared to when it is the source."}

These queries are essentially fixed-size input embeddings that the decoder uses to produce distinct outputs for each potential object, allowing the model to reason about relationships between objects and the global image context through multi-headed self-attention and encoder-decoder attention mechanisms [5]. For instance, the decoder transforms these N object queries—initially set to zero—by attending to the encoder's memory, ensuring that the queries evolve across layers to yield unique predictions for bounding boxes and class labels [11]. This approach contrasts with traditional sequential models by processing all queries in parallel, which enhances efficiency and avoids duplicates, as explored in experiments where different ways of incorporating these queries, such as adding them at every attention layer, were tested for optimal performance [4]. To visualize this process, the DETR architecture illustrates how object queries are fed into the decoder to attend to encoder outputs and produce refined predictions, as seen in a detailed diagram ![The DETR architecture uses object queries in the decoder to refine predictions from encoder outputs](image5). By leveraging these queries, DETR effectively streamlines object detection without relying on traditional components like anchors or non-maximum suppression.\n\nThe DETR model utilizes object queries as learned positional encodings in the decoder to enable parallel and unique predictions of objects."}

For instance, repetition control works by avoiding repeated n-grams from previous utterances, which often include patterns like \"do you\" or \"what is\" that are typical in questions, leading to a noticeable drop in question-asking rates; specifically, when applied alongside conditional training for question-asking, the rate falls from nearly 98% to about 80% at the highest control level ![A line graph showing that repetition control results in a lower maximum percentage of utterances containing questions, compared to question control alone](image4).

Iterative retrieval focuses on repeatedly cycling between retrieval and generation to build upon initial results, allowing for progressively richer context; for instance, it leverages techniques like ITER-RETRGEN, where retrieval enhances generation and vice versa through multiple iterations, helping to address tasks that require reproducing specific information [3]. This back-and-forth approach aims to refine outputs by incorporating feedback from each cycle, as seen in frameworks that use module interactions to boost synergy [8]. \n\nOn the other hand, recursive retrieval emphasizes a hierarchical refinement of queries, breaking down complex problems into sub-problems and iterating based on previous results to converge on more precise information [4, 11]. As described, it involves query transformation or decomposition, such as in methods like IRCoT, which uses chain-of-thought reasoning to guide and refine retrieval, making it particularly effective for nuanced or ambiguous searches where initial queries might not capture full intent [11]. This process creates a structured, step-by-step exploration, contrasting with iterative methods by prioritizing depth through hierarchical processing rather than simple repetition.\n\nAdaptive retrieval, meanwhile, introduces flexibility by enabling the system to dynamically decide when and what to retrieve based on the context, reducing unnecessary searches and improving efficiency [8, 12]. For example, models like FLARE and Self-RAG allow the RAG system to evaluate scenarios and use special tokens to halt retrieval when sufficient information is available, ensuring that retrieval is context-dependent and integrated seamlessly with other components [12]. To visualize these distinctions clearly, the processes are depicted in a comparative diagram that highlights their unique flows: `![The image compares iterative retrieval, which alternates between retrieval and generation; recursive retrieval, which refines queries into sub-problems; and adaptive retrieval, which decides retrieval needs dynamically in RAG systems](image2)`.\n\nIn summary, iterative retrieval builds context through repeated cycles, recursive retrieval refines queries hierarchically, and adaptive retrieval activates retrieval on demand for optimal efficiency."}

For instance, when models like single-paragraph BERT are evaluated in the distractor setting, where questions are paired with a mix of gold and spurious paragraphs, they achieve a high F1 score of 67.08, indicating strong performance when relevant evidence is readily available [7]. However, in open-domain scenarios with only retrieved paragraphs, such as 500 candidates, the F1 score drops significantly to 39.12, largely due to retrieval failures that miss key gold paragraphs [5].

Similarly, across various models, the distractor setting generally yields higher F1 scores compared to open-domain ones ![Models like single-paragraph BERT show better F1 scores in distractor settings (e.g., 67.08) than in open settings (e.g., 38.40)](image7), while adversarial training helps mitigate these drops by adapting to stronger distractors ![Adversarial training enables models to recover F1 scores, such as from 46.84 to 60.10 on adversarial evaluation data](image2).\n\nThese findings imply that model performance is highly sensitive to evidence quality and quantity; without reliable retrieval of gold paragraphs, even advanced models falter, suggesting a need for improved retrieval methods to enhance robustness in real-world, distractor-heavy environments.

This is further reinforced by [4], which reports that 91.7% of COMET's greedily decoded tuples are deemed correct through human evaluation, and [7] describes how COMET excels in metrics like perplexity and classifier scores, where it uses a strong pre-trained model to validate tuple correctness.\n\nTo visualize this superior performance, consider the comparative data in the following table: ![A table comparing COMET's higher performance across metrics like oEffect and average scores against baseline models](image4). This illustration underscores COMET's advantages, as it generally outperforms models like Event2 variants in most categories, leading to the highest average score.\n\nAdditionally, another table provides specific metrics: ![A table showing COMET's top BLEU-2 and N/U o scores, indicating its best overall results among models evaluated](image5).

This is echoed in a graph analysis: ![A graph depicting high classifier accuracy for COMET's novel tuples even at increasing edit distances](image7), which shows sustained accuracy as novelty increases, further proving its robustness.\n\nOverall, the evidence points to COMET as the top performer for ConceptNet tuple generation."}

According to the analysis, when \\( p \\) increases from 0.0, the performance of both approaches initially improves because a moderate masking helps prevent overfitting on long-term representations, but it starts to decline when \\( p \\) becomes too high, such as above 0.5, due to the loss of useful information from those representations [9]. This pattern is evident in experiments where LSTUR-con is noted for its stability compared to LSTUR-ini, meaning it maintains better performance across varying \\( p \\) values by effectively retaining information through concatenation [8]. To visualize this specifically for AUC, the line charts demonstrate how AUC trends for both methods rise initially with increasing \\( p \\) and then fall, with LSTUR-con showing a more consistent curve than LSTUR-ini. ![The line charts illustrate that AUC for LSTUR-con increases initially with p and peaks around 0.5, maintaining a more stable performance compared to LSTUR-ini, which also peaks but with greater fluctuations](image8)\n\nIn summary, as the mask probability \\( p \\) increases, the AUC for LSTUR-con performs similarly to LSTUR-ini initially but remains more stable overall, with both achieving optimal results around a moderate value like 0.5."}

For instance, error analysis reveals that DS-DST, which relies on span-based extraction for non-categorical slots like these, struggles when exact spans aren't present in the dialogue, leading to lower accuracy because it can only correctly predict a few values, such as 'none' or 'dontcare' [4]. In contrast, DS-Picklist leverages access to a full ontology, allowing it to reduce error rates by selecting values from candidate lists, which makes it more effective for these slots. Turning to the specific data, this comparison is illustrated in a table that details performance metrics for various slots, including 'taxi-leave at' and similar ones, showing percentages that highlight DS-Picklist's superior accuracy over DS-DST in these cases ![The table compares performance metrics for slots like 'taxi-leave at' across DS-Span, DS-DST, and DS-Picklist](image4).

For instance, based on the analysis of various supervision sources, head word supervision proves particularly effective for ultra-fine labels, helping the model handle the challenges of predicting detailed categories, while entity linking enhances performance on finer labels overall [10]. In the experimental setup, the model was trained using a combination of crowdsourced data, entity linking (from KB and Wikipedia definitions), and head words, with performance evaluated by systematically removing one source at a time [11; 12].\n\nTo illustrate this impact, consider the detailed performance metrics from the evaluation, where excluding each data source reveals specific declines in ultra-fine category performance: for example, removing head word supervision likely leads to noticeable drops in recall and F1 scores due to its role in fine-grained predictions, while excluding crowdsourced data or entity linking might further exacerbate issues with precision in ultra-fine contexts ![Table showing how excluding crowdsourced data, head words, or entity linking affects metrics like precision, recall, and F1 for ultra-fine categories in the development set](image3).\n\nIn summary, excluding data sources tends to degrade ultra-fine performance, with head word supervision being especially critical for maintaining accuracy in these detailed predictions."}

For those interested in industrial heritage, the local history museum in Ytre Arna explores the beginnings of Western Norway's industrialization in 1846, including a visit to the Oleana textile factory in the same historic building [9]. Additionally, Herdla Museum on a small island delves into World War II history with exhibitions on its dramatic events and natural features, blending military heritage with the region's fauna and birdlife [10].\n\nVisual elements from the area further enhance this heritage story; for example, traditional Nordic wooden houses with grass roofs evoke the historical rural architecture seen in many of these museums ![Traditional Scandinavian houses featuring grass roofs as a cultural architectural element](image2).

The Analytics Value Chain outlines a sequential process where data is pushed through stages from collection to ultimate impact, as emphasized in the text [1], which stresses that true value only emerges when this chain reaches full execution, not just partial steps. This concept is visually depicted in a flowchart that illustrates the journey: data is collected and stored, then analyzed to generate insights, leading to informed actions and, ultimately, increased value.\n\nFor instance, the flowchart shows data flowing into reporting and analysis phases before driving actions and value, highlighting how each stage builds on the previous one ![A flowchart demonstrating the transformation of data through reporting, analysis, action, and value to achieve business benefits](image2). This aligns with the Levels of Analytics, which represent a hierarchy of analytical depth, starting from basic reporting and advancing to predictive and prescriptive insights. A diagram of this hierarchy illustrates the progression from simple questions like \"What happened?\" in standard reports to more complex ones like \"Why is this happening?\" and \"What's the best that can happen?\" through statistical analysis and optimization, thereby increasing both business value and intelligence over time.\n\nThese two concepts complement each other by integrating the linear flow of the value chain with the escalating sophistication of analytical levels. For example, while the value chain ensures that data moves from raw collection to actionable decisions, the levels add depth—such as moving from descriptive reporting to prescriptive analysis—as detailed in a comparative table that differentiates reporting (which focuses on \"what\" and raises questions) from analysis (which explains \"why\" and provides recommendations ![A table contrasting reporting as descriptive and backward-looking with analysis as prescriptive and forward-looking, leading to insights](image5). Together, they create a more robust framework: the value chain provides the overarching structure, while the levels enhance each stage with greater insight, ensuring that decisions are not only timely but also strategically sound, as seen in the hierarchy diagram that builds from business intelligence to advanced analytics ![A diagram showing the advancement from basic reports to predictive modeling, increasing business value and intelligence](image7).\n\nIn essence, the Analytics Value Chain and Levels of Analytics complement each other by combining a step-by-step process with layered analytical depth to effectively convert data into actionable insights and tangible value."}

In a typical monohybrid cross, such as one involving flower color, the parental generation consists of plants with homozygous alleles—one with purple flowers (dominant) and one with white flowers (recessive)—resulting in all offspring in the F1 generation exhibiting the dominant purple trait due to the inheritance of one dominant allele from each parent [11]. This occurs because fertilization unites the gametes, forming a zygote with a diploid set of chromosomes [8], where the dominant allele masks the recessive one.\n\nTo illustrate this process, ![This image shows how a cross between homozygous parents leads to a 3:1 phenotypic ratio of purple to white flowers in the F2 generation](image1). When the F1 heterozygous plants are self-pollinated, they produce gametes with a 1:1 ratio of dominant and recessive alleles, and the random combination of these gametes in the F2 generation results in a phenotypic ratio of 3 plants with purple flowers to 1 with white flowers, reflecting the segregation of alleles [11].\n\nFurther emphasizing this, ![This image demonstrates the segregation of alleles in a monohybrid cross, producing 3 purple-flowered plants for every 1 white-flowered plant in the F2 generation](image4).

For instance, intranet functions are anticipated to evolve, with some areas like posting policies and procedures seeing a decline in usage, while others, such as access to patient clinical information, are expected to grow from 45% today to 53% in two years, indicating a shift toward more integrated and data-driven applications in healthcare systems [3]. This trend suggests that as organizations move away from basic communication tools and toward advanced features like enhanced data access and clinical orders, there will be a greater demand for staff who can support these complex, technology-intensive operations.\n\nThis projected evolution ties directly into the current staffing landscape, where roles are distributed across various functions, with network support comprising 27% and clinical informaticists at 24%, as illustrated in a chart that highlights the prevalence of these positions in managing IT infrastructure and data handling ![A chart displaying the percentage distribution of Health IT roles, including network support at 27% and clinical informaticists at 24%](image2). As intranet functions expand to include more sophisticated elements like patient data integration, the need for personnel in network support and clinical informatics could intensify to handle increased data security, system integration, and user training, especially given the emphasis on consolidating information to reduce inefficiencies [5].\n\nIn contrast, functions like staff communication, which is projected to drop from 82% to 70%, might allow for a reallocation of resources, potentially easing demands on roles such as process/workflow design at 24%, but overall, the rise in clinical-focused intranet features underscores the importance of bolstering teams that can adapt to these changes. The expected changes in intranet functions highlight a need to align staffing with emerging trends in health IT adoption.\n\nIn summary, the anticipated growth in intranet functions for clinical data access points to an increased requirement for Health IT staff in support and informatics roles to ensure effective implementation and management."}

In many systems, the throttle valve regulates air intake, and its placement can vary depending on the type of fuel injection, such as whether it's a single-point or multi-point setup.\n\nFor instance, in systems where the fuel injector is positioned to spray fuel directly into or above the throttle valve, this arrangement is often seen in Single Point Fuel Injection (Throttle Body Injection, or TBI), as outlined in the details [3] and [7]. Here, the injector is located inside the throttle body and sits on top of the inlet manifold, meaning it operates from a point above the throttle valve to mix fuel with incoming air. This is further illustrated in a diagram that shows the injector introducing fuel into the airflow before it passes through the throttle valve, as depicted in ![In a Single Point Fuel Injection system, the injector is positioned in the throttle body to deliver fuel into the air stream before the throttle valve](image6).\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that not all systems follow this exact configuration; for example, some multi-point systems place injectors below the throttle valve in the intake manifold branches [2], but the specific case you're asking about aligns more closely with the TBI setup. Additionally, another description confirms that injectors can spray fuel from above the throttle valve [8], reinforcing the idea that in TBI, the throttle valve is indeed positioned beneath the injector for efficient fuel-air mixing.\n\nIn summary, the system where the throttle valve is placed beneath the fuel injector is the Single Point Fuel Injection (TBI) system."}

This concept aligns with standard consumption economics [5], where focusing on one item without variety can lead to reduced overall utility. For instance, the provided data illustrates this decline vividly.\n\nIn one example, ![A table showing diminishing marginal utility from hot dogs, where utility decreases with each additional one consumed, eventually turning negative](image2) demonstrates how the utility from hot dogs starts positive but falls sharply—such as dropping from +6 for the first to -50 for the 66th—highlighting the point where continued consumption becomes detrimental. Similarly, ![A table detailing the utility values for each hot dog consumed, starting at +10 for the first and decreasing to -10 for the sixth](image4) provides a clear breakdown, showing that utility begins at +10 for the first hot dog, drops to +4 for the second, reaches zero by the third, and becomes negative (-1 for the fourth, -4 for the fifth, and -10 for the sixth), reinforcing the idea that overconsumption leads to dissatisfaction.\n\nThis pattern implies that consumption behavior should involve moderation; individuals might benefit from stopping once marginal utility turns negative or seeking variety to maintain enjoyment, as overindulgence could result in wasted resources or discomfort. Ultimately, utility decreases with each additional hot dog, indicating that optimal consumption behavior involves recognizing and responding to these diminishing returns to maximize overall satisfaction."}

For instance, as described in the quotes, lines and arrows in diagrams often illustrate these connections, where fuel flows from the supply source through pumps, filters, and regulators to reach injectors and ultimately the engine [1] [4]. Specifically, the fuel supply is drawn from the tank by an electrical fuel pump, which then forces it into a regulator, and in modern systems, this pressure is used to spray fuel into the engine intake manifold or combustion chambers [10] [12]. This setup highlights how the fuel supply links to subsystems like pumps, filters, and injectors, as seen in detailed diagrams that map out the flow.\n\nTo visualize this, consider a diagram that outlines the fuel system's components and their interconnections: ![A diagram illustrating the fuel flow from the gasoline tank through pumps, filters, fuel rail, and injectors to the engine](image2). This reinforces how the fuel supply integrates with elements like the low-pressure pump and surge tank to maintain consistent delivery.\n\nFurther, another diagram emphasizes the broader network, showing how the fuel supply connects to filters, high-pressure pumps, fuel rails, and sensors, all managed by an electronic control unit: ![An illustration of the fuel injection system components linked from the fuel supply to pumps, rails, injectors, and the ECU](image5).

In this flow, reporting generates visual summaries like charts and graphs, which help identify what has occurred, paving the way for the next step. ![A flowchart depicting the transformation of data into value through reporting and analysis, leading to informed actions](image1)\n\nThis distinction becomes clearer when comparing reporting and analysis directly, as they differ in their orientation and outcomes. Reporting is primarily descriptive and backward-looking, focusing on questions like \"What happened?\" by converting data into information through dashboards and alerts. In contrast, analysis is prescriptive and forward-looking, addressing \"Why?\" and providing insights that lead to recommendations, effectively turning information into actionable findings [4].\n\nAs organizations progress from business intelligence to business analytics, these concepts play evolving roles, with reporting forming the base of business intelligence stages and analysis advancing into more sophisticated analytics. A diagram of this progression highlights how standard reports and alerts in business intelligence raise initial questions, while statistical analysis and predictive modeling in business analytics answer deeper queries like \"Why is this happening?\" and \"What will happen next?\", thereby increasing both business value and intelligence levels [8]. ![A diagram illustrating the hierarchy from business intelligence, where reporting addresses basic queries, to business analytics, where analysis drives predictive insights](image7)\n\nIn summary, reporting and analysis are integral to the analytics value chain by providing the necessary bridge from data collection to informed decisions, with reporting offering foundational descriptions and analysis delivering deeper insights that propel the shift from reactive business intelligence to proactive business analytics."}

For instance, in standard consumption economics, focusing on one activity or item often leads to reduced enjoyment because preferences change as enjoyment wanes, suggesting that variety might be necessary to maintain satisfaction [2], [6]. This is clearly illustrated in a table that tracks utility from consuming hot dogs, where each additional hot dog provides less positive utility until it becomes negative, reflecting the typical decline in satisfaction with repetition ![A table showing how utility from hot dog consumption decreases with each additional hot dog, eventually turning negative](image8).\n\nIn contrast, competitive contexts can alter this dynamic, where focused practice and the potential for significant outcomes might override the usual diminishing effects. For example, while mere repetition doesn't guarantee improvement [10], sustained focus can lead to accumulated skills that enhance both the experience and results, potentially boosting utility in ways that standard consumption does not [11]. This is evident in a visual that contrasts diminishing marginal utility with a \"differential outcome,\" where hot dog consumption in a competition shows a sudden spike in utility—such as jumping from negative to highly positive—due to achieving a championship tie, demonstrating how external motivations like competition can create exceptions to the norm ![An illustration of diminishing marginal utility in hot dog consumption with a dramatic utility increase in a competitive scenario](image1).\n\nOverall, while standard consumption sees diminishing marginal utility as a straightforward decline in enjoyment, competitive settings can transform it through focused efforts and extraordinary rewards, making the experience more rewarding despite the risks.

For instance, in Pro Mode, you can manually adjust the metering mode to ensure accurate exposure [8], and select a focus mode to precisely lock onto subjects [6], as described in the camera's advanced settings for fine-tuning photos and videos [9].\n\nMetering modes play a key role in determining how the camera evaluates light across a scene, which directly impacts the quality of the final image. One effective way to visualize this is through a detailed diagram of the Pro Mode interface, which highlights options like metering modes alongside other controls ![A diagram illustrating Pro Mode settings including metering mode for light measurement](image3). As explained in a comparative table, Matrix Metering Mode measures light across the entire frame and is ideal for broad landscapes, while Center Metering Mode prioritizes the center for portraits, and Spot Metering Mode focuses on a specific area, such as a subject's eyes, making it perfect for high-contrast situations ![A table outlining metering modes and their ideal use cases for different lighting scenarios](image5). This flexibility helps enhance photography by preventing overexposed or underexposed shots, ensuring that details are preserved in challenging environments like bright outdoors or dimly lit interiors.\n\nSimilarly, focus modes allow for precise control over how the camera locks onto subjects, reducing blur and improving clarity in dynamic scenarios. You can adjust the focus mode by touching the appropriate option [6], and a dedicated table clarifies the choices: AF-S (single) is best for stationary subjects to maintain sharp focus without drift, AF-C (continuous) tracks moving subjects for action shots, and MF (manual) lets you touch and focus on specific areas like a face for more creative control ![A table describing focus modes and their usage scenarios for stationary or moving subjects](image4). By tailoring these modes to the situation, photographers can avoid common issues like missed focus in fast-paced events or imprecise details in portraits, ultimately leading to sharper, more professional results.\n\nIn summary, the different metering and focus modes in Pro Mode enhance photography by providing precise tools for light measurement and subject focusing, adapting effectively to various scenarios for better image quality."}

From the provided data, we see a stark contrast between a specific organizational dataset and broader cross-industry averages, which can indicate variations in marketing strategies, lead quality, or sales processes.\n\nOne key dataset shows a relatively low conversion rate from MQLs to SALs, as detailed in a performance metrics overview [4], which describes the progression from MQLs to SALs as part of a lead funnel. In this context, the rate is reported at 1.50%, suggesting that only a small fraction of MQLs are advancing to the stage where sales teams accept them for further pursuit. ![Image shows specific conversion rates, including a 1.50% rate from MQL to SAL](image4) This low rate could stem from factors like overly broad lead scoring criteria or inadequate alignment between marketing and sales teams, potentially leading to leads that aren't fully vetted.\n\nIn contrast, cross-industry benchmarks provide a higher range for this conversion, indicating more optimistic outcomes in general. For instance, industry averages show SAL conversion rates ranging from 45% to 75% ![Image displays cross-industry average conversion rates, including 45-75% for SALs](image7). This suggests that in a typical scenario, a much larger proportion of MQLs are accepted by sales, possibly due to refined qualification processes or better lead nurturing practices across sectors.\n\nThe differences observed—1.50% in the specific dataset versus 45-75% in industry averages—have significant implications. A lower rate like 1.50% may point to inefficiencies, such as poor lead quality, misalignment between marketing and sales (e.g., mismatched definitions of what constitutes an MQL), or external factors like market competition, which could result in wasted resources and slower revenue growth. On the other hand, achieving rates closer to the industry benchmarks could enhance pipeline efficiency, improve ROI on marketing efforts, and foster better collaboration between departments, ultimately driving higher conversion success.\n\nIn summary, the conversion rate from MQLs to SALs varies from 1.50% in the specific dataset to 45-75% in cross-industry averages, with lower rates indicating potential process inefficiencies that could hinder sales performance."}
