Specifically, $31\\%$ of those with a college degree or higher say that \"high ethical standards\" describes neither the Republican Party nor the Democratic Party. In contrast, $26\\%$ of those with some college education and $20\\%$ of those with a high school degree or less hold this view [6].\n\n- **Approval Ratings and Education**: The approval ratings of Trump also vary by educational level. For instance, among those with postgraduate education, $62\\%$ disapprove of Trump, while $23\\%$ approve. This trend continues across different educational levels, indicating a correlation between higher education and lower approval ratings for Trump [2].\n\n### Political Affiliations and Perceptions\n\n- **Partisan Views on Ethical Standards**: There is a significant divide in how partisans view the ethical standards of their own and the opposing party. Majorities of both Republicans ($66\\%$) and Democrats ($64\\%$) describe their party as having high ethical standards, but fewer hold this view for the opposing party [3].\n\n- **Independents' Views**: Independents are more likely to have negative views of both parties' ethical standards, with $65\\%$ saying the administration's ethical standards are \"not good\" or \"poor,\" and only $31\\%$ saying they are \"excellent\" or \"good\" [2].\n\n### Approval Ratings of Trump by Political Affiliation\n\n- **Party Lines**: The approval ratings of Trump are starkly divided along party lines. For example, $81\\%$ of Republicans/Lean Republican approve of Trump, compared to $12\\%$ of Democrats/Lean Democrat [2].\n\n- **Ideological Divides**: Within parties, there are also ideological divides. For instance, $72\\%$ of conservative Republicans approve of Trump, compared to $37\\%$ of moderate/liberal Republicans [2].\n\n### Visual Data Interpretation\n\n![Perceptions of Political Parties' Ethical Standards](image1)\nThe image shows that $41\\%$ of Americans believe the Republican Party has high ethical standards, while $42\\%$ hold this view for the Democratic Party.\n\n![Approval and Disapproval Ratings](image2)\nThis chart indicates that there is a significant divide in approval and disapproval ratings across different demographics, including political affiliations and educational levels.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, both educational levels and political affiliations significantly impact perceptions of ethical standards and approval ratings of Trump. Generally, higher levels of education correlate with more critical views of political parties' ethical standards, and political affiliations heavily influence approval ratings, with partisans showing strong support for their respective parties.\n\nThe perceptions of ethical standards and approval ratings are influenced by how closely one identifies with a political party and their educational background. These factors contribute to the polarized views seen in the current political landscape.\n\nOverall, educational attainment and political affiliation are key factors in shaping public opinion on ethical standards and political figures' approval ratings. \nThus, people’s perceptions of ethical standards and approval ratings of Trump are impacted significantly by educational levels and political affiliations."}

This age group is more likely to express concerns about restrictions on civil liberties compared to older age groups.\n- **Older Adults:** In contrast, a majority of those 65 and older (71%) say the government has not gone far enough to protect the country, indicating a greater concern for national security over civil liberties [1].\n\n### Political Ideology Influence\n\n- **Partisan Differences:** Republicans and Democrats have shown differing views on government efforts over time. For instance, in early 2015, Republicans were more likely to express dissatisfaction with the government's handling of terrorism, with only 27% saying the government was doing very or fairly well, down from 63% at the beginning of the year [7].\n- **Independents and Democrats:** Independents' positive ratings have dropped significantly, from 69% to 44%, and Democrats' ratings have decreased from 85% to 64% over the same period [7].\n\n### Changes Over Time\n\n- **Government Performance:** Assessments of government efforts to combat terrorism are more negative across the political spectrum compared to early 2015.

Younger adults tend to be more concerned about civil liberties, while older adults prioritize national security. Political ideology also plays a crucial role, with Republicans, Democrats, and Independents showing varying levels of satisfaction with government efforts over time.\n\nThe government's performance in reducing the terrorist threat is viewed more positively by those with a postgraduate degree (58%) than by other educational groups [9]. Overall, these perceptions have fluctuated over time, influenced by changing political landscapes and public events.\n\nThe direct answer is: The influence of age and political ideology on perceptions of government efforts to reduce the terrorist threat reveals a complex interplay where younger adults prioritize civil liberties, older adults focus on national security, and political ideology significantly shapes opinions on government performance."}

According to the data, there are notable differences in device ownership and online behaviors.\n\n### Device Ownership Trends\n\n- **Smartphones and Tablets/E-book Readers**: Among seniors, the ownership of tablets or e-book readers is more prevalent than that of smartphones. Specifically, 27% of seniors own a tablet or an e-book reader, while only 18% own a smartphone. This trend is notably different from the general population, where smartphones are more common than tablets or e-book readers. For instance, 55% of all adults own a smartphone, compared to 43% who own a tablet or e-book reader [10].\n\n### Online Social Networking Usage\n\n- **Social Networking Sites (SNS) Usage**: About 27% of seniors use social networking sites such as Facebook. This usage is associated with more persistent social connections among those who do use these platforms [4].\n- **Demographic Variations in SNS Use**: The use of social networking sites varies by demographic factors such as age, education, and income. For example, 32% of seniors go online but do not use social networking sites, while 41% do not go online at all [2].\n\n### Comparison and Insights\n\n- **Device Ownership and Online Habits**: The data also show that device ownership and online habits are influenced by factors such as age, education, and income. For instance, seniors with higher education and income levels are more likely to be online and use social networking sites. Specifically, 87% of college graduates in the 65+ age group go online, compared to 40% of those with a high school education or less [5].\n\n- **Trends Over Time**: The adoption of technology among seniors has been increasing over time. In 2012, 59% of seniors reported using the internet, which is a six percentage point increase from 53% in the previous year and a significant rise from 35% in May 2008 [2].\n\n### Visual Insights\n\n![Device Ownership Comparison Among Seniors](image1)\nThe bar graph illustrates that among seniors (65+), 27% own a tablet or e-book reader, while only 18% own a smartphone, highlighting a preference for tablets or e-book readers over smartphones in this age group.\n\n![Online and Social Networking Habits](image2)\nThis pie chart shows the distribution of seniors' online behaviors, with 27% using social networking sites, 32% going online but not using SNS, and 41% not going online.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, among seniors, there is a higher prevalence of tablet or e-book reader ownership compared to smartphone ownership. Additionally, online social networking usage is a significant aspect of their online behavior, with 27% of seniors using such sites. These trends reflect broader patterns of technology adoption and online engagement within this demographic.\n\nThe trends indicate that while there is still a gap in technology adoption and online behaviors between seniors and the general population, there is a clear increase in these areas over time, influenced by factors such as education, income, and age.\n\nSeniors are more likely to own a tablet or e-book reader than a smartphone. ![Device Ownership Trends](image1)."}

According to the provided data, there is a notable correlation between higher income, education, and increased adoption of technology.\n\n### Income and Education Impact on Technology Adoption\n\n- **Income**: Individuals with higher incomes tend to have higher adoption rates. For instance, seniors with an annual household income of $75,000 or more are around four times as likely to own devices such as tablets and e-book readers compared to those with a household income of less than $30,000 per year [7].\n\n- **Education**: Education also plays a crucial role. College graduates are around three times as likely to own both an e-book reader and a tablet as are seniors who have not attended college [7].\n\n### Smartphone Adoption\n\n- Smartphone ownership is fairly low across the entire age spectrum of the older adult population but decreases substantially for seniors in their mid-70s and becomes nearly non-existent among seniors in their 80s and beyond, with just 5% of those 80 and older being smartphone owners [8].\n\n### Internet Adoption\n\n- In April 2012, more than half of older adults (defined as those ages 65 or older) were internet users. Today, 59% of seniors report they go online—a six-percentage point increase in the course of a year—and 47% say they have a high-speed broadband connection at home [9].\n\n### Device Ownership\n\n- **E-book Readers and Tablets**: Nationally, these devices are most popular among college graduates and higher-income Americans, and this trend is also observed among seniors [7].\n\n- **Cell Phones and Smartphones**: \n  - 77% of seniors are now cell phone owners, which trails the national average of 91% of all Americans owning a cell phone.\n  - However, smartphone adoption remains low, with only 18% of seniors being smartphone owners, which is well below the national adoption rate of 55% [4].\n\n### Comparison and Trends\n\n- The data indicates that while there is a general increase in technology adoption among older adults, significant disparities exist based on income and education levels.\n\n### Data Representation\n\nThe following images illustrate these trends:\n![Adoption rates of e-book readers and tablet computers among seniors by income and education level](image1)\n![Cell phone and smartphone ownership among seniors by age, education, and income](image4.png)\n \n### Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, internet and smartphone adoption rates among older adults vary considerably with income and education.

This indicates that tablets and e-book readers are as popular as smartphones among older adults.\n- **Social Networking**: Usage of social networking sites by older Americans has been increasing but has not yet reached majority status. Among older adults who use the internet, **46% use social networking sites** such as Facebook, which is well below the national average of **73% of adult internet users**.\n\n### Education and Income Impact\n\nHigher education and income levels significantly impact the adoption of technology among seniors:\n- Seniors with an annual household income of **$75,000 or more per year** are around **four times as likely** to own tablets and e-book readers as those with a household income of less than **$30,000 per year**.\n\n### Visual Representation\n\n![Education and Health Challenges Among Seniors and Adults](image1.png)\n*The bar graph illustrates the percentage of individuals facing physical or health conditions that make reading difficult or challenging and those with disabilities, handicaps, or chronic diseases preventing full participation in work, school, or other activities, comparing all adults to those aged 65+.*\n\n### Technology Adoption Trends Over Time\n\n![Technology Adoption Trends Over Time](image2.png)\n*This line graph shows the increasing trend of internet usage among all adults and those aged 65+ from 2000 to 2013.*\n\n### Demographic Breakdown of Technology Ownership\n\n| Category        | E-book Reader | Tablet Computer |\n|----------------|---------------|-----------------|\n| **Total for all 65+** | 18%          | 18%             |\n| Age            |               |                 |\n| 65-69          | 23            | 23              |\n| 70-74          | 19            | 18              |\n| 75-79          | 18            | 20              |\n| 80+            | 10            | 9                |\n| Education      |               |                 |\n| High school grad or less | 12        | 11              |\n| Some college   | 19            | 19              |\n| College graduate | 30           | 31              |\n| Household Income |               |                 |\n| <$30,000       | 8             | 8               |\n| $30,000-$49,999 | 17           | 16              |\n| $50,000-$74,999 | 33           | 28              |\n| $75,000+       | 33            | 39              |\n\n### Social Networking and Twitter Usage\n\n- **Social Networking Sites**: **46% of online seniors** use social networking sites, but only **6% use Twitter**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nEducation level significantly affects the adoption of tablets and e-book readers among seniors, with higher education correlating with higher ownership rates.

For instance, $90\\%$ of college graduates believe that word processing or spreadsheet software has had a positive impact on their careers, compared to $45\\%$ of those with a high school diploma or less [4]. \n\nSimilarly, when it comes to smartphones, $76\\%$ of college graduates see a positive impact, versus $54\\%$ of those with some college education and $69\\%$ of those with a high school diploma or less. This trend is consistent across various technologies, including email or social media, and software that manages daily schedules or routines.\n\nIn terms of expectations for the adoption of driverless cars, a significant portion of Americans are aware of the efforts to develop this technology, with $94\\%$ having some awareness. Moreover, about two-thirds of the public expects that most vehicles on the road will be driverless within the next half-century, with $9\\%$ predicting this will occur in the next 10 years [1].\n\n![Workers' perceptions of whether technologies have made their work more or less demanding](image1)\n![Workers' perceptions of impact by technology type](image2)\n![Workers perceptions of impact on career by education level](image3)\n![Public expectations for driverless cars](image5)\n## Expectations for driverless cars and technology impact\n\nThe public's anticipation of driverless vehicles becoming mainstream is significant, with a large percentage expecting this to happen within the next half-century.\n\nWorkers generally express more positive than negative views on the overall impact of technology on their careers. Roughly half of workers $(53\\%)$ feel that technology in general has made their work more interesting, but $12\\%$ say it has made their work less interesting – and around one-third $(34\\%)$ say it hasn’t had a major impact either way [9].\n\nOverall, it appears that education level plays a crucial role in how workers perceive the impact of technologies on their careers.\n\nWorkers with higher levels of education generally have more positive views of many workplace technologies.\n\n## Education Level Impact\n\nWorkers with varying levels of educational attainment express pronounced differences in their views of workplace technology. Workers with high school diplomas or less are notably more downbeat about the impact these tools have had on their careers relative to college graduates [3].\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe perception of the impact of workforce technologies on careers is closely tied to education level, with higher education levels corresponding to more positive views of technology's impact.\n\nWorkers with higher education tend to view these technologies in a positive light.\n\nWorkers express decidedly mixed views when asked about the impact of these and other technologies on their own jobs and careers [7]. \n\n## Impact on Careers \n\nAround one-quarter $(27\\%)$ feel that industrial robots have impacted them positively in one way or another in their jobs or careers.\n\n## Impact by Education Level \n\nThere are also differences of 20 percentage points or more between these groups for several other technologies, including email or social media (27 points), smartphones (22 points), and software that manages workers’ daily schedules and routines (21 points) [4]. \n\n## Final Answer \n\nWorkers with varying levels of educational attainment express pronounced differences in their views of workplace technology."}

Many view these technologies in a positive light, but substantial shares view them as damaging (or at best neutral) to their own career prospects [1]. \n\nAccording to a Pew Research Center survey, many Americans anticipate significant impacts from various automation technologies in their lifetimes, including the widespread adoption of autonomous vehicles and the replacement of entire job categories with robot workers [5].\n\n## Current Experiences with Different Technologies\n\nWorkers generally express more positive than negative views when asked about the impact of technology on their careers. For instance:\n- $70\\%$ of workers report a positive impact from word processing or spreadsheet software\n- $67\\%$ report a positive impact from smartphones\n- $60\\%$ report a positive impact from email or social media\n\nHowever, a substantial share of workers indicate that technologies such as industrial robots have had a less positive impact, with only $27\\%$ reporting a positive impact and $14\\%$ reporting a negative impact [1][4].\n\n## Future Expectations for Driverless Vehicles\n\nIn contrast, when it comes to future expectations for driverless vehicles, a significant proportion of Americans have some awareness of the effort to develop driverless vehicles, with roughly two-thirds of the public anticipating that most vehicles on the road will be driverless within the next half-century [6].\n\n![Perceptions of current technologies' impacts on careers](image1)\n![Future expectations for automation technologies](image2)\n\n## Impact on Opportunities and Work Interest\n\nThe survey also finds that:\n- $46\\%$ of workers feel that technology has increased their opportunities for career advancement\n- $13\\%$ say it has decreased their opportunities for advancement\n- $40\\%$ say it has made no difference one way or another\n\nSimilarly, $53\\%$ of workers feel that technology has made their work more interesting, while $12\\%$ say it has made their work less interesting [7].\n\n## Comparison of Impacts\n\nWhile workers express generally positive views on the impact of technology on their careers, with $46\\%$ reporting increased opportunities and $53\\%$ reporting more interesting work, there is a notable difference in perceptions when it comes to the future expectations for driverless vehicles and automation technologies [4][7].\n\n![Comparison of impacts on opportunities and work interest](image4)\n![Comparison of impacts on work interest](image3)\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, the perceptions of automation and workforce technology impacts differ between the future expectations for driverless vehicles and the current experiences of U.S. workers with different technologies, with workers generally expressing more positive than negative views on the impact of technology on their careers, but also expressing concerns about the implications of these technologies for society as a whole [5].\n\nThe current experiences of U.S. workers with different technologies show a more positive impact, while future expectations for driverless vehicles and automation technologies are more mixed.\n\nWorkers' perceptions of automation and workforce technology impacts are complex and multifaceted, reflecting both positive and negative views [1]. \n\nTherefore, U.S. workers have mixed feelings about automation. \n![Mixed feelings about automation](image3)"}

Generally speaking, workers in the middle educational tier – that is, those who have graduated from high school but who lack four-year college degrees – tend to have attitudes toward technology and work that are midway between these two groups [4].\n\nWorkers with at least a four-year college degree have markedly more positive views compared with those with high school diplomas or less. For example, there is a 45-percentage point difference in the share of workers with college degrees (90%) and with high school diplomas or less (45%) who feel these technologies have had a positive

According to the data, college graduates are more likely to say that technology has made their work more interesting (64% vs. 38% of those with high school diplomas or less) and increased their opportunities for career advancement (53% vs. 32%) [2][3].\n\n![Workers' perceptions of technology's impact on their careers by education level](image1)\n\nWorkers with at least a four-year college degree have markedly more positive views compared with those with high school diplomas or less. These differences are most pronounced in the case of office productivity tools such as word processing or spreadsheet software: There is a 45-percentage point difference in the share of workers with college degrees (90%) and with high school diplomas or less (45%) who feel these technologies have had a positive impact on them professionally [10].\n\nWorkers with varying levels of educational attainment express pronounced differences in their views of workplace technology. For instance, 53% of college graduates say technology has made their work more interesting, compared to 38% of those with high school diplomas or less. Similarly, 53% of college graduates say technology has increased their opportunities for career advancement, compared to 32% of those with high school diplomas or less [9].\n\n## Impact of Automation on Workers\n\nWorkers who have been personally impacted by automation have notably pessimistic views towards the impact of workforce technology on their careers. Most notably, 46% of these workers feel that technology has decreased their own opportunities for career advancement, while 34% feel that technology has generally made their work less interesting [1].\n\n## Demographic Differences\n\nCertain demographic groups report being impacted by workforce automation technologies at somewhat higher than average levels, including young adults. The impact of automation also varies by education level, with workers with high school diplomas or less being more likely to report a negative impact [3].\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, educational levels significantly impact perceptions of technology's effects on job opportunities and work interest. Workers with higher levels of education tend to have more positive views of technology's impact, while those with lower levels of education are more likely to report a negative impact.\n\nWorkers with higher levels of education are more likely to say tech has increased opportunities, made their jobs more interesting. \n![Workers with higher education levels are more likely to have positive views of technology](image3)"}

Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents are much more supportive of a universal basic income (77%) and a national service program (66%) compared to Republicans and Republican-leaning independents (38% and 46%, respectively) [1].\n\nRegarding the government's obligation to take care of workers displaced by automation, 65% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents feel that the government should take responsibility, even if it means higher taxes for others. In contrast, 68% of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents believe individuals should be responsible for their own financial well-being, even if jobs are automated on a wide scale [3].\n\n### Education Levels\n\nEducation levels also play a role in shaping opinions on automation and government obligations. Americans with lower levels of educational attainment are more supportive of limiting the number of jobs that businesses can replace with machines. For instance, 70% of those with high school diplomas or less believe there should be limits on automation, compared to 41% of those with four-year college degrees [10].\n\nOn the question of whether the government has an obligation to take care of workers who have been displaced by widespread automation of jobs, there is less variation by educational attainment. However, those with lower levels of educational attainment are more likely to support limits on automation [4].\n\n### Public Opinion on Automation Limits\n\nThe public is more supportive of limits on how many human jobs businesses can replace with machines. Just over half of Republicans (54%) feel that there should be limits, only slightly less than the 60% of Democrats who hold this view [7].\n\n### Visual Representation\n\n![Political affiliations and education levels influence opinions on automation limits](image2.png)\n![Public opinion on automation limits and government obligations](image4.png)\n\n### Key Findings\n\n*   **Partisan divisions**: Significant differences in opinions on government obligations and automation limits exist between Democrats and Republicans.\n*   **Education levels**: Lower levels of educational attainment are associated with greater support for limiting automation and government intervention.\n*   **Public opinion**: The public is evenly divided on whether government or individuals should be responsible for providing for displaced workers.\n\nOverall, political affiliations and education levels significantly influence opinions on government obligations and automation limits related to job displacement.\n\nIn conclusion, The American public holds diverse views on automation, influenced by political affiliation and education level, with a notable divide between Democrats and Republicans on government responsibility and automation limits. \n![Political affiliations and education levels influence opinions on automation limits](image4.png) \n![Public opinion on automation limits and government obligations](image2.png)."}

This 22-percentage-point difference suggests a significant gap in public perception regarding its fairness and effectiveness [8][2].\n- **Criminal Risk Score**: 49% think it would be effective at identifying people deserving of parole, and 50% believe it would be fair to those being analyzed. \n- **Automated Video Job Interview Analysis**: 39% think it's effective at identifying successful hires, but only 33% find it fair to job applicants.\n- **Automated Resume Screening**: 47% believe it's effective, and 43% think it's fair.\n\n### Demographic Differences\n\nDemographic differences play a role in perceptions of fairness. For instance:\n- **Race and Ethnicity**: Blacks and Hispanics are more likely to find the consumer finance score concept fair compared to whites, with 45% and 47%, respectively, versus 25% of whites.\n- **Age**: The perception of fairness and effectiveness also varies by age, with younger Americans more likely to believe these systems can be designed without bias [3][1].\n\n### Public Trust and Concerns\n\n- **Bias and Design**: 58% of Americans feel that computer programs will always reflect some level of human bias, while 40% think these programs can be designed to be bias-free.\n- **Privacy and Nuance**: There are concerns that these tools might violate privacy, fail to capture complex situations, or put people in unfair situations [6].\n\n### Visual Insights\n\n![Public perception of programs to make decisions without human bias by age group](image1)\nThe image shows that a significant portion of the public across various age groups believes that programs will reflect the bias of their designers, with 58% of the total population holding this view.\n\n![Acceptability of automated personal finance scores](image2)\nThis chart highlights that only 31% of U.S. adults find it acceptable for companies to use automated personal finance scores, with the main reasons being effectiveness and concerns about privacy and discrimination.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe differences in perceptions of fairness and effectiveness across various automated systems imply that public trust in these systems is conditional and varies based on the application and demographic factors. While some Americans see potential benefits in effectiveness, concerns about fairness, bias, and privacy are prevalent.\n\nIn conclusion, the public's perception of automated decision-making systems is nuanced, reflecting both the potential benefits and significant concerns about fairness, bias, and privacy.

According to a Pew Research Center survey conducted from July 27 to August 2, 2020, there is a stark contrast in opinions between Republicans and Democrats regarding the U.S. handling of the pandemic.\n\n### Effectiveness of U.S. Response Compared to Other Wealthy Countries\n\n- **Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents** overwhelmingly view the U.S. response as less effective compared to other wealthy countries, with **87%** holding this opinion.\n- In contrast, only **22%** of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents believe the U.S. has been more effective, while **34%** think it has been less effective, and **42%** consider it about as effective as other countries.\n\n### Trust in Institutions\n\n#### Public Health Officials\n\nTrust in public health officials, such as those at the CDC, also shows a significant partisan divide:\n- **Democrats** have consistently high levels of trust, with **72%** giving positive ratings for their response to the outbreak, which has remained relatively stable since March (**74%**).\n- **Republicans** have seen a decline in trust, with only **53%** giving positive ratings, a drop of **31 points** from late March (**84%**).\n\n#### Hospitals and Medical Centers\n\n- **Hospitals and medical centers** receive high marks across party lines, with **87%** of Democrats and **90%** of Republicans giving positive ratings.\n\n#### Elected Officials and Donald Trump\n\n- **Local elected officials** are viewed more positively by Democrats (**64%**) than Republicans (**58%**).\n- **State elected officials** also see a divide, with **51%** of Democrats and **61%** of Republicans giving positive ratings.\n- **Donald Trump's response** is highly polarized, with **73%** of Republicans approving and only **6%** of Democrats.\n\n### Geographic vs. Partisan Differences\n\nPartisan differences in opinions about the pandemic and policies to address it are far wider than the differences in opinion between those living in areas with higher health impacts and those in less affected areas. For instance:\n- Republicans living in less hard-hit parts of the country are slightly less likely to attribute the rise in confirmed cases to growing infections rather than increased testing (**30%** compared with **39%** in other areas).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe data illustrates a clear partisan divide in perceptions of the COVID-19 response effectiveness and trust in institutions. These divides are evident across various aspects, including views on public health officials, elected officials, and the overall handling of the pandemic.\n\n![Partisan Divide in U.S. COVID-19 Response Effectiveness](image1)\n![Trust in Institutions by Party Affiliation](image2)\n\nThe partisan divide significantly influences perceptions of COVID-19 response effectiveness and institutional trust, with Democrats generally expressing more trust in public health officials and institutions than Republicans. \n\nIn conclusion, partisan affiliation plays a crucial role in shaping opinions on the U.S. response to COVID-19 and trust in various institutions. \n\nTherefore, Partisan affiliation plays a crucial role in shaping perceptions of COVID-19 response effectiveness and institutional trust."}

Specifically, about 44% of immigrants and 48% of Spanish-dominant Latinos believe Democrats work hard to earn their votes. In contrast, relatively few Latinos say Republicans try hard to earn their vote, with only about 19% of Latinos holding this view [3].\n\n### Partisan Differences\n\nThere are notable partisan differences in perceptions of parties' efforts. Among Latino Democrats, 36% believe Democrats work hard to earn people's votes, compared to only 13% of Latino Republicans [4]. Conversely, 40% of Latino Republicans and Republican-leaning conservatives say \"Republicans work hard to earn Latinos' votes\" describes their views at least very well [7].\n\n### Demographic Variations\n\nPerceptions also vary across demographic groups. For instance:\n- **Age**: Similar shares of Latinos aged 50 to 64 (45%) and 65 or older (46%) say Democrats work hard to earn Latinos' votes [9].\n- **Religion**: Catholics (42%) and evangelical Protestants (42%) are likely to say Democrats work hard to earn Latinos' votes [9].\n- **Language**: English-dominant Latinos (23%) are less likely than bilingual (37%) or Spanish-dominant Latinos (48%) to believe Democrats work hard to earn their votes [1].\n\n### Political Ideology\n\nPolitical ideology also influences perceptions:\n- **Liberal vs. Conservative**: Among Latino Democrats and Democratic leaners, majorities of liberals (70%) and conservatives/moderates (61%) say Republicans do not work hard to earn Latinos' votes [7].\n- **Republican Leaners**: Conservative and moderate Republican-leaning Latinos are more divided in their views, with 58% of conservative Republicans saying Democrats do not work hard to earn people's votes [4].\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThese findings suggest that the political landscape among Latino voters is complex and influenced by factors such as partisanship, demographic characteristics, and political ideology.

Positional encodings are added to the input of the encoder and decoder to provide location information for the self-attention mechanism. The model uses sine positional encodings, which have been shown to be effective in various transformer-based architectures.\n\n## Effect of Positional Encodings on AP\n\nAccording to [1], not using spatial positional encodings leads to a significant drop in AP, indicating their importance in the DETR model. The results in Table 3 show that passing positional encodings in the decoder only leads to a minor AP drop, suggesting that the decoder can still effectively utilize the information even without spatial positional encodings.\n\n## Loss Components and AP\n\nThe DETR model uses a set-based loss function, which directly predicts a fixed number of bounding boxes and their corresponding classes. This approach eliminates the need for non-maximum suppression (NMS) post-processing, which is commonly used in traditional object detection models.\n\n## Analysis of DETR-DC5 Model\n\nThe DETR-DC5 model achieves an AP of 40.6 and 42.0 on short and long schedules, respectively [2]. The results in Table 3 indicate that different configurations of positional encodings and loss components can affect the AP.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe DETR-DC5 model achieves competitive performance on object detection tasks, with an AP of 40.6 and 42.0 on short and long schedules, respectively. The use of positional encodings and loss components, such as GIoU, $\\ell_1$, and L2, can impact the AP.\n\nThe table below shows the results for different configurations [1]:\n| spatial pos. enc. encoder | decoder | output pos. enc. decoder | AP $\\Delta$ | $AP_{50}$ $\\Delta$ |\n| :---------------------: | :------: | :---------------------: | :---------: | :-------: |\n|          none           |   none   |         learned at input  |     32.8     |    -8.2    |\n|       sine at input      | sine at input |         learned at input  |     39.2     |    -1.4    |\n|     learned at attn.     | learned at attn. |         learned at attn.     |     39.6     |    -1.0    |\n|          none           | sine at attn. |         learned at attn.     |     39.3     |    -1.3    |\n|       sine at attn.      | sine at attn. |         learned at attn.     | **40.6** |     -      |\n\nGiven the information provided and focusing on the impact of different configurations on Average Precision (AP), we see that DETR-DC5 effectively uses various positional encodings and loss components to achieve high AP.\n\nThe image illustrates DETR's architecture and predictions: \n![DETR Architecture and Predictions](image5)\n\nThe DETR model architecture is shown, highlighting how image features, positional encodings, and object queries interact within the encoder-decoder structure to produce predictions [5].\n\n## Final Answer\n\nThe DETR-DC5 model's AP is affected by different configurations of positional encodings and loss components, with the best configuration achieving an AP of **40.6**."}

The 'hard-to-contrast' strategy outperforms other methods in the initial cycle of active learning, as seen in [6] and [9]. This suggests that selecting hard-to-contrast data for the initial query can lead to better model performance throughout the active learning process.\n\n## 4: Detailed Performance Metrics\n- On PathMNIST, OrganAMNIST, and BloodMNIST, the 'hard-to-contrast' strategy outperforms random selection by $1.8\\%$, $2.6\\%$, and $5.2\\%$, respectively, by querying $0.1\\%$ of the entire dataset [3].\n- It also shows a significant improvement on CIFAR-10-LT, outperforming other strategies by $21.2\\%$ and $24.1\\%$ when querying $20\\%$ and $30\\%$ of the dataset, respectively.\n\n## 5: Conclusion on Performance and Influence\nThe 'hard-to-contrast' strategy not only outperforms existing active querying strategies but also surpasses random selection by a large margin.

It's noted that LLMs show limited inference speed compared to Small Language Models (SLMs), partly due to their larger number of parameters, longer input contexts, and extra response decay if external APIs are applied [2].\n\n## Instruction Format Impact\n- The performance of LLMs can be affected by the instruction format. For instance, the box plots in `image3` show the performance variation with different instruction formats and demonstration selections. This implies that the way instructions are formatted can influence the outcomes of LLMs on specific tasks.\n\n## Demonstration Selection Impact\n- The selection strategy of demonstrations matters, with retrieval based on sentence embedding being a notable approach. `image3` also illustrates that both sentence embedding and EPR (Example-based Prompt Retrieval) surpass random sampling by a large margin, indicating that the method of selecting demonstrations can significantly affect performance.\n\n## Performance on FewNERD Dataset\n- When specifically looking at the FewNERD dataset, `image1` and `image5` provide insights into how different models perform with varying numbers of shots (e.g., 1-shot, 5-shot, 10-shot, 20-shot). These images suggest that the performance of LLMs like ChatGPT and Codex can be compared across different settings.\n\n## Comparison with Other Models\n- The comparison of LLMs (such as ChatGPT, Codex) with SLMs (Small Language Models) across various tasks including Named Entity Recognition (NER), Relation Extraction (RE), Event Detection (ED), and Event Argument Extraction (EAE) shows that LLMs excel over SLMs only when annotations are extremely limited [5]. As the number of samples increases, SLMs tend to outperform LLMs.\n\n## Conclusion\nGiven the information and focusing on ChatGPT and Codex's performance on the FewNERD dataset:\n- ChatGPT and Codex show varied performance based on instruction formats and demonstration selections.\n- The performance of these models, especially in low-resource settings, is notable but can be surpassed by SLMs with more samples.\n\nThe performance comparison across different models and settings is visually represented in `image1`, `image5`, and `image3`, which show how LLMs and SLMs perform under various conditions.\n\n## Direct Answer\nLLMs' performance, such as ChatGPT and Codex, on the FewNERD dataset and others can be significantly impacted by instruction formats and demonstration selections, with detailed performance metrics and comparisons available across various settings and models.\n\nPerformance of LLMs(ChatGPT) v.s.

InstructGPT tends to be \"less confident,\" frequently classifying supported and refuted claims as 'NEI' (Not Enough Information), while GPT-4 exhibits overconfidence, incorrectly categorizing NEI claims as either supported or refuted [5].\n\nThis difference in behavior is illustrated in the confusion matrices for both models, as shown in `![Confusion matrices for Instruct GPT and GPT-4 under the zero-shot 3-class setting](image5)`. \n\nInstructGPT displays a pattern of misclassifying supported and refuted claims as NEI, indicating a tendency to default to uncertainty when faced with ambiguous or unclear claims. On the other hand, GPT-4 tends to misclassify NEI claims as either supported or refuted, suggesting that it is more confident in its predictions but also more prone to error when dealing with claims that lack sufficient information.\n\nThese challenges highlight the difficulties in distinguishing between 'refuted' and 'NEI' claims, a task that even trained human annotators struggle with [8]. \n\nOverall, both models face significant challenges in accurately classifying NEI claims, but their approaches differ.

The use of demonstration samples also plays a crucial role in enhancing model performance.\n\n### Quantitative Analysis\n\n- **Micro-F1 Scores**: The Micro-F1 scores for various models on the MAVEN-ERE and Causal-TimeBank datasets are presented in the tables provided in image1 and image3. For instance, on the MAVEN-ERE dataset, the Micro-F1 scores range from 17.4% to 37.3% for different models and settings. The incorporation of logical constraints leads to notable improvements, such as an increase from 17.4% to 25.3% for RoBERTa-Large with CoT and logical constraints.\n\n- **Logical Inconsistency (LI)**: The LI percentages are also crucial, as they indicate the logical consistency of the model's answers. Lower LI percentages suggest better logical consistency. For example, incorporating logical constraints reduces LI from 54.8% to 37.9% for RoBERTa-Large (one-shot) on MAVEN-ERE.\n\n### Effect of Increasing Demonstrations\n\n- **Demonstration Samples**: The impact of increasing the number of demonstration samples is illustrated in image4. It shows that while increasing demonstrations improves performance, the gains become limited beyond a certain point (e.g., $\\geq10$ demonstrations). However, adding logical constraints can provide stable improvements, especially with a smaller number of demonstrations.\n\n### Model-Specific Improvements\n\n- **GPT-4**: Sees improvements from 29.3% to 32.3% on MAVEN-ERE and from 22.5% to 24.5% on Causal-TimeBank when using CoT with logical constraints.\n- **Vicuna**: Shows improvements from 13.8% to 14.9% on MAVEN-ERE and from 4.5% to 8.0% on Causal-TimeBank.\n- **Llama2**: Experiences improvements from 17.0% to 21.5% on MAVEN-ERE.\n\n### Pre-training with Logical Constraints\n\nPre-training LLMs on a dataset automatically generated using logic programming (LLM-LR) significantly enhances their performance. For example, LlaMA2-13B-PT's performance improves greatly on both MAVEN-ERE and Causal-TimeBank datasets compared to the baselines without logical constraints [9].\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, incorporating logical constraints and using demonstration samples effectively can significantly enhance the performance of LLMs on the MAVEN-ERE and Causal-TimeBank datasets. This approach not only improves the Micro-F1 scores but also reduces logical inconsistencies in the model's answers.\n\nThe final answer is: \n- Incorporating logical constraints and using demonstration samples effectively can significantly enhance the performance of LLMs on the MAVEN-ERE and Causal-TimeBank datasets. \n- The use of logical constraints leads to notable improvements in Micro-F1 scores and reduces logical inconsistencies. \n- Pre-training LLMs on a dataset automatically generated using logic programming (LLM-LR) significantly enhances their performance. \n- Increasing demonstrations improves performance but gains become limited beyond a certain point; adding logical constraints provides stable improvements especially with fewer demonstrations. \n- Model-specific improvements are observed across GPT-4, Vicuna, and Llama2 with the incorporation of logical constraints and CoT prompting. \n- Therefore, it is beneficial to tell LLMs both \"What\" (demonstrations) and \"How\" (logical constraints) for solving reasoning tasks."}

It covers 30 subjects across 6 disciplines, including Art, Business, Health & Medicine, Science, Humanities & Social Science, and Tech & Engineering, and over 183 subfields. The questions in this benchmark were manually collected by a team of 50 college students from various disciplines and subjects, drawing from online sources, textbooks, and lecture materials.\n\n### Distribution of Questions Across Disciplines\n\nThe distribution of questions across different disciplines in the MMMU dataset is as follows [2]:\n- **Engineering (26%)**\n- **Art & Design (11%)**\n- **Business (14%)**\n- **Science (23%)**\n- **Health & Medicine (17%)**\n- **Humanities & Social Sci. (9%)**\n- **Tech & Engineering (26%)**\n\n### Types and Formats of Questions\n\nThe MMMU dataset comprises 11.5K carefully selected multimodal questions, which cover 30 diverse subjects and 183 subfields. This meets the breadth goal. Moreover, many problems within MMMU require expert-level reasoning, such as applying “Fourier Transform” or “Equilibrium Theory” to derive the solution, thus meeting the depth goal. The dataset also presents two unique challenges absent in current benchmarks:\n1. **Diverse Image Formats**: MMMU covers visual scenes like photographs and paintings to diagrams and tables, testing the perceptual capabilities of LMMs.\n2. **Interleaved Text-Image Inputs**: A model needs to jointly understand the images and text, which often requires recalling deep subject knowledge and conducting complex reasoning based on the understanding and knowledge to reach a solution.\n\n### Relation to Types and Formats of Questions\n\nThe distribution of questions across different disciplines relates to the types and formats of questions used in several ways:\n- **Variety in Image Types**: The dataset includes 30 highly heterogeneous image types, such as charts, diagrams, maps, tables, music sheets, and chemical structures. This variety ensures that models are tested on their ability to understand and interpret different types of visual information.\n- **Interleaved Text and Images**: The questions in MMMU often feature interleaved text and images, requiring models to jointly understand both modalities. This is particularly challenging in disciplines like **Science, Health & Medicine, and Tech & Engineering**, where tasks often involve intricate perception and complex reasoning.\n\n### Performance Across Disciplines\n\nModels demonstrate relatively higher performance in disciplines such as **Art & Design** and **Humanities & Social Sciences**, where the images tend to be more ‘natural’ and questions involve relatively less reasoning. Conversely, in fields like **Science, Health & Medicine, and Technology & Engineering**, where tasks often involve intricate perception and complex reasoning, models exhibit lower performance.\n\n### Example Questions\n\nThe dataset includes a variety of question formats, such as [4]:\n- **Music Theory**: Identifying incorrectly constructed harmonic intervals.\n- **Market Research**: Analyzing graphs compiled by Gallup.\n- **Calculus**: Finding the area of a region bounded by a graph.\n- **Clinical Medicine**: Interpreting MRI scans to determine the etiology of findings in the left breast.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe MMMU benchmark is highly diverse, covering a wide range of subjects and image types. This diversity is crucial for evaluating the multimodal understanding and reasoning capabilities of large language models (LMMs). The benchmark’s design ensures that models are tested on their ability to perceive, understand, and reason with both textual and visual information across various disciplines.\n\nThe distribution of questions across different disciplines in the MMMU dataset relates to the types and formats of questions used by ensuring a comprehensive evaluation of multimodal models. It includes a wide range of image types and requires expert-level reasoning, making it a challenging benchmark for assessing multimodal understanding and reasoning capabilities.\n\nHere are some images that show the distribution of questions across different disciplines and types of questions used:\n![Distribution of questions across disciplines and image types](image1)\n![Detailed subject coverage in the MMMU benchmark](image2)\n![Comparison of existing benchmarks with MMMU](image3)"}

Initially, the system constructs a multi-modal retriever that creates and stores explicit memory for different categories beyond the immediate context window. This retriever is based on CLIP (Contrastive Language–Image Pre-training) and is designed to efficiently encode and store a large volume of images/text embeddings for quick, accurate retrieval [3].\n\n## Processing Steps for Detection Datasets\n\n1. **Image Pre-processing**: For object detection tasks, the methodology involves extracting image embeddings $e_{\\mathrm{img}}$ with a slightly different approach. This includes cropping image regions based on proposal bounding box coordinates and subsequently resizing the cropped region to a fixed proportion. Additionally, a blurring technique is applied to non-target areas surrounding the objects of interest to help the MLLMs understand the objects to be detected [8].\n\n## Ranking Process\n\n2. **Retrieval Phase**: The system retrieves the top-$k$ similar results from the memory and uses MLLMs (Multimodal Large Language Models) to rank and make final predictions. The ranking prompt example demonstrates how the system retrieves and ranks categories, such as in the case of classifying a Mercedes-Benz E-Class Sedan among other options [1].\n\n## Ranking and Fine-Tuning\n\n3. **Fine-Tuning for Ranking**: To fully exploit the ranking potential of MLLMs for downstream tasks, a small-scale classification dataset is selected to fine-tune the MLLMs. This fine-tuning enables the models to improve their ranking abilities, such as following the format of prompts and returning results as required [7].\n\n## Multimodal Retriever and Ranking\n\nThe multimodal retriever plays a crucial role in querying a large multi-modal external memory or database to find information relevant to the input query or context. It creates and stores multimodal embeddings with a focus on optimizing retrieval speed through index construction techniques [3].\n\n## Example Use Cases\n\n- **Object Detection**: In object detection datasets, an image typically contains multiple objects of varying sizes. The procedure begins with cropping the image regions based on proposal bounding box coordinates, subsequently resizing the cropped region to a fixed proportion. \n- **Image Classification**: The system also demonstrates its effectiveness in image classification tasks, such as accurately classifying fine-grained categories [2].\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe proposed approach, RAR (Retrieving And Ranking augmented method for MLLMs), synergizes the strengths of both CLIP and MLLMs to enhance few-shot/zero-shot recognition abilities for datasets characterized by extensive and fine-grained vocabularies.\n\n![Multimodal Retriever Process](image3)\n\nThe multimodal retriever system processes and ranks objects for recognition in detection datasets by creating and storing multimodal embeddings, optimizing retrieval speed, and fine-tuning MLLMs for improved ranking performance. \n## References\n[3]"}

Specifically, for SQuAD v1.1, BERT with DSC achieves an F1 score of 91.97, which is a +1.07 increase over the baseline. For SQuAD v2.0, it achieves an F1 score of 89.51, surpassing XLNet by +1.41 [8].\n\n### QuoRef Dataset\n\n- On the QuoRef dataset, BERT with DSC achieves an F1 score of 72.90, which is a +1.41 increase over the baseline [8].\n\n### MRPC and QQP Datasets\n\n- For the MRPC and QQP datasets, BERT with DSC achieves F1 scores of 88.92 and 92.11, respectively.

The text quotes provide insights into experiments conducted on datasets like SST-2, SST-5, QQP, and others, focusing on the impact of different objectives such as Cross-Entropy (CE), Dice Loss (DL), and Dynamic Soft Label Calibration (DSC) on model performance.\n\n### Observations from Text Quotes\n\n- **Effect on Accuracy-Oriented Tasks**: The experiments on the Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST) datasets, including SST-2 and SST-5, show that BERT with CE achieves 94.90 in terms of accuracy, while DL and DSC perform slightly worse (94.37 and 94.84 for SST-2, and 55.57, 54.63, and 55.19 for SST-5, respectively) [1]. This indicates that DSC and DL do not significantly outperform CE in accuracy-oriented tasks.\n\n- **Impact on Imbalanced Datasets**: The use of paraphrase identification dataset QQP with different positive-negative ratios shows that DSC achieves the highest F1 score across all datasets, particularly showing improvements over DL for positive and negative datasets [3].\n\n- **Role of Hyperparameters**: The Tversky index (TI) offers flexibility in controlling the tradeoff between false-negatives and false-positives, with optimal performance observed for different values of $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ across datasets like Chinese OntoNotes4.0 and English QuoRef MRC [4].\n\n### Insights from Image Quotes\n\n- **Table Analysis**: \n  - **Table 9** (image1) shows the performance of BERT models with different objectives on SST-2 and SST-5 datasets. BERT+CE achieves 94.90 and 55.57 in accuracy, respectively, while BERT+DL and BERT+DSC show slightly lower performance.\n\n  - **Table 10** (image2) illustrates how varying $\\alpha$ affects performance on Chinese Onto4.0 and English QuoRef datasets, with the highest F1 scores obtained at specific $\\alpha$ values.\n\n  - **Table in [3] and [10]**: Further analysis of tables provided indicates that DSC consistently performs well across various datasets and tasks, often outperforming or showing competitive results compared to other methods.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe data augmentation techniques, including DSC, DL, and FL, have varying impacts on BERT models across different tasks:\n- DSC tends to perform well, especially in imbalanced datasets, achieving significant F1 score improvements.\n- The choice of $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ in TI affects performance, indicating the importance of hyperparameter tuning.\n- DSC consistently shows strong performance, particularly in achieving high F1 scores across datasets.\n\nGiven these observations, we conclude that DSC offers a robust approach to handling imbalanced datasets and improving model performance.\n\nThe final answer is: ![DSC achieves significant performance boosts on a wide range of data imbalanced NLP tasks.](image3)"}

It includes tasks such as question answering, sentiment analysis, and text similarity evaluation, among others. The benchmark provides a standardized way to compare the effectiveness of different models in understanding and processing human language.\n\n### Performance of BERT Models\n\nBERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) models, developed by Google, have achieved state-of-the-art results in many NLP tasks. The performance of BERT models on the GLUE benchmark is highlighted in several tables and figures provided.\n\n### Performance of CNN Models\n\nCNN (Convolutional Neural Network) models, when applied to NLP tasks, can also achieve high performance. Their effectiveness, especially when combined with other techniques like ELMo (Embeddings from Language Models) or fine-tuning, is demonstrated in various studies.\n\n### Comparison and Inferences\n\nComparing the performance of BERT models and CNN models on the GLUE benchmark:\n- **BERT Models**: The results for BERT models, specifically BERT$_{BASE}$ and BERT$_{LARGE}$, are provided in the tables. For instance, BERT$_{LARGE}$ achieves an average GLUE score of 81.9, outperforming many other models listed.\n\n- **CNN Models**: The performance of CNN models, especially when combined with ELMo or fine-tuning, is also highlighted.

Their strength lies in their ability to learn local features and patterns in text data.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe performance difference between BERT models and CNN models on the GLUE benchmark can be attributed to their architectural differences and how they process text data. BERT models excel in capturing complex, long-range dependencies and contextual relationships in text, which is crucial for many NLP tasks. On the other hand, CNN models, especially when combined with pre-trained embeddings like ELMo or fine-tuning, show competitive performance, indicating their effectiveness in certain tasks, particularly those that benefit from local feature extraction.\n\nIn conclusion, while both BERT and CNN models demonstrate high performance on the GLUE benchmark, their strengths lie in different aspects of text processing.

Moreover, fine-tuning TRADE with GEM maintains higher performance on the original four domains, with a joint accuracy drop from $58.98\\%$ to $53.54\\%$ $(-5.44\\%)$, whereas naive fine-tuning deteriorates the tracking ability, dropping joint goal accuracy to $36.08\\%$ $(-22.9\\%)$ [5].\n\n- **EWC Performance**: EWC uses the diagonal of the Fisher information matrix as a regularizer for adapting to the target domain data [3]. However, its performance is generally lower than GEM but still better than naive fine-tuning in some cases.\n\n### Slot Similarities and Performance\n\nSlot similarities play a crucial role in how well a model can adapt to new domains. Slots that are similar across domains tend to have better transfer performance.\n\n- **Slot Error Rate**: The slot error rate chart shows that some slots like \"restaurant-name\", \"attraction-name\", \"hotel-name\", and \"hotel-type\" have higher error rates, indicating that these slots are harder to adapt [4].\n\n## Conclusion\n\nGEM generally outperforms EWC and naive fine-tuning in adapting to new domains by mitigating catastrophic forgetting. The performance is also influenced by slot similarities, with some slots being easier to transfer knowledge across domains than others.\n\n### Evidence\n\nThe table and figures provided give a detailed comparison of the performance of different fine-tuning strategies.\n\n![Comparison of fine-tuning strategies on various domains](image3)\n \nThis image shows that GEM consistently outperforms EWC and naive fine-tuning across different domains, indicating its effectiveness in adapting to new domain data.\n\n![Slot Error Rate](image4)\n\nThe slot error rate across domains indicates that certain slots are more challenging to adapt than others.\n\nTherefore, fine-tuning strategies like GEM are more effective than EWC and naive approaches in adapting to new domain data, and slot similarities significantly affect performance.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{GEM}$"}

The researchers analyzed the performance of four commercial MT systems (Google Translate, Microsoft Translator, Amazon Translate, and SYSTRAN) and two recent state-of-the-art academic MT models across eight diverse target languages.\n\n### Translation Accuracy and Gender Bias\n\nThe results show that all tested systems exhibit significant gender bias, with varying levels of accuracy across languages. Table 2 presents the performance of commercial MT systems on the WinoMT corpus, categorized by language family.\n\n![Table showing performance of commercial MT systems on the WinoMT corpus](image2)\n\nThe table shows that the accuracy of MT systems varies significantly across languages, with some systems performing better than others. For instance, Google Translate achieves an accuracy of 53.1% on Spanish, while Amazon Translate achieves 39.7% on Russian.\n\n### Stereotypical vs. Non-Stereotypical Gender Roles\n\nThe study also examines the performance of MT systems on stereotypical and non-stereotypical gender roles. The results show that all tested systems have a significantly better performance when presented with pro-stereotypical assignments (e.g., a female nurse), while their performance deteriorates when translating anti-stereotypical roles (e.g., a male receptionist).\n\n![Bar chart comparing accuracy on stereotypical and non-stereotypical gender roles](image3)\n\nThe bar chart shows that MT systems perform better on stereotypical gender roles, with accuracy ranging from 44% to 80%, compared to non-stereotypical roles, with accuracy ranging from 30% to 57%.\n\n### Impact of Adding Adjectives\n\nThe study also investigates the impact of adding stereotypical gender adjectives on translation accuracy.

For instance, the performance difference between these assignments is notable across various languages, including Spanish (ES), French (FR), Italian (IT), Russian (RU), Ukrainian (UK), Hebrew (HE), Arabic (AR), and German (DE) [2].\n\n### Effect of Stereotypical Adjustments\n\nAdding stereotypical gender adjectives can improve the accuracy of gender translation. For example, when adding adjectives like \"handsome\" or \"pretty\" to male or female entities, respectively, there's a noticeable improvement in some languages. Specifically, for Spanish, Russian, and Ukrainian, adding such adjectives leads to improvements in gender accuracy [8].\n\n### Performance Metrics\n\nThe performance metrics for Google Translate on Spanish, Russian, and Ukrainian gender prediction accuracy show that adding adjectives can significantly impact the translation accuracy. For instance, the accuracy increases from 53.1% to 63.5% for Spanish, from 37.7% to 48.9% for Russian, and from 38.4% to 42.9% for Ukrainian [2].\n\n### Detailed Performance Across Systems\n\nA detailed breakdown of performance across different MT systems and languages is provided in the tables. For example, Google Translate shows varying levels of accuracy and bias across languages, with significant improvements in some cases when using stereotypical adjustments [5].\n\n### Visual Representation\n\nThe bar graph in `image1` illustrates the accuracy of MT systems on stereotypical and non-stereotypical gender roles, showing a clear disparity in performance.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, stereotype-based adjustments in machine translation have a significant impact on gender bias accuracy across different languages. These adjustments can improve translation accuracy by aligning with stereotypical gender roles, but they also highlight the challenges and biases present in current MT systems.\n\nThe adjustments lead to improvements in gender accuracy for some languages but also underscore the need for more nuanced approaches to mitigate gender bias in MT.\n\n### Evidence\n\n- **Accuracy Improvements**: Adding stereotypical adjectives improves accuracy in Spanish, Russian, and Ukrainian, as shown in `image2`.\n- **Performance Metrics**: Detailed performance metrics across various languages and systems are provided in `image5` and `image4`.\n- **Visual Representation**: A bar graph illustrating the accuracy of MT systems on stereotypical and non-stereotypical gender roles is shown in `image1`.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nStereotype-based adjustments in machine translation can improve gender bias accuracy but also reveal significant biases across different languages, emphasizing the need for more nuanced approaches to mitigate these biases. ![Stereotype-based adjustments improve translation accuracy but reveal significant biases.](image1)"}
{"q_id": 442, "model": "llama-4-scout-17b-16e-instruct", "in_tok": 4263, "out_tok": 710, "total_tok": 4973, "response": "To address the question of how different training and evaluation strategies affect F1 scores in multi-hop and single-hop question answering tasks, we need to consider various factors that influence model performance. \n\nThe performance of models can significantly vary based on the training and evaluation data used, especially in the context of question answering (QA) tasks. In multi-hop QA, the task requires a model to answer a question by combining information from multiple sentences or paragraphs, which is more challenging than single-hop QA where the answer can be found in a single paragraph.\n\n## Impact of Distractors on Model Performance\nThe use of distractors (irrelevant paragraphs) is a common strategy to evaluate a model's ability to focus on relevant information. Table 4 and Table 5 provide insights into how different settings and strategies impact the F1 scores of models.\n\n### Distractor Settings\n- **Original Distractors vs. Adversarial Distractors**: The F1 score of single-paragraph BERT degrades from 67.08 to 46.84 when evaluated on adversarial distractors, indicating that the model struggles more with distractors selected to require multi-hop reasoning [9].\n- **Open-domain Settings**: In open-domain settings, the performance significantly drops. For instance, with 500 retrieved paragraphs, the F1 score is 39.12, but it increases to 53.12 when the gold paragraphs are included, highlighting the challenge of retrieving relevant paragraphs [2].\n\n### Training and Evaluation Strategies\n- **Adversarial Selection of Distractors**: Training models on adversarially selected distractors can improve their performance on such distractors. For example, a model trained on original data but evaluated on adversarial distractors achieves an F1 score of 46.84, whereas training on adversarial data improves this to 60.10 F1 [9].\n- **Entity Type Filtering**: Filtering paragraphs based on entity type can also impact performance, reducing the F1 score to 40.73 but improving to 58.42 when trained on adversarially selected distractors with entity type filtering [6].\n\n## Model Performance Comparison\nA comparison of different models under various settings is provided in the tables.\n\n### Model Performance\n- **Single-paragraph BERT**: Achieves 67.08 F1 on standard distractors but significantly drops to 38.40 in open-domain settings with 10 paragraphs and slightly improves to 39.12 with 500 paragraphs [1][2].\n- **Adversarial Settings**: The performance of models like BiDAF, GRN, QFE, and DFGN + BERT under adversarial settings shows variability, indicating that model architecture and training data significantly impact performance [10].\n\n## Conclusion\nDifferent training and evaluation strategies significantly affect F1 scores in multi-hop and single-hop question answering tasks. Adversarially selected distractors and open-domain settings pose challenges, but models can recover some of their performance when specifically trained on such data. The effectiveness of entity type filtering and the use of stronger distractors highlight areas for improvement in multi-hop QA datasets.\n\n![Different models' performance under various settings](image1)\n![Impact of different distractor settings on F1 scores](image2)\n![Examples of question types and their F1 scores](image3)\n![Performance comparison under original and adversarial training and evaluation](image4)\n![Question examples categorized by type](image5)\n\nThe F1 scores are affected by different training and evaluation strategies, with adversarial distractors and open-domain settings presenting significant challenges but also opportunities for improvement through targeted training and evaluation methodologies."}
{"q_id": 443, "model": "llama-4-scout-17b-16e-instruct", "in_tok": 5169, "out_tok": 675, "total_tok": 5844, "response": "The performance of BERT models on the ARCT dataset is significantly impacted by the adversarial data setup, which aims to eliminate spurious statistical cues that models might exploit to achieve high accuracy on the original dataset. \n\n## Original Dataset Performance and Issues\nThe original dataset allows models to achieve high accuracy by exploiting these cues, but this does not necessarily reflect true argument comprehension. For instance, BERT's peak performance on the original dataset reaches $77\\%$, just three points below the average untrained human baseline [8]. However, this high performance is largely due to the model's ability to identify and exploit certain cues rather than a genuine understanding of the arguments.\n\n## Adversarial Dataset Construction\nTo address this issue, an adversarial dataset is constructed by negating the claims and inverting the labels, effectively mirroring the distribution of cues around both labels. This process helps ensure that the models can no longer rely on these spurious cues for making predictions.\n\n## Performance on Adversarial Dataset\nWhen evaluated on this adversarial dataset, BERT's performance significantly drops. Specifically, BERT's peak performance reduces to $53\\%$, with mean and median accuracies at $50\\%$ [6]. This drastic reduction in performance indicates that the original high scores were indeed due to the exploitation of statistical cues rather than genuine argument comprehension.\n\n## Implications and Conclusions\nThe results from the adversarial dataset provide a more robust evaluation of argument comprehension. They suggest that previous high performance metrics might not accurately reflect the models' ability to understand arguments. The adversarial dataset should be adopted as the standard in future work on ARCT to ensure that models are truly learning argument comprehension rather than relying on spurious cues [10].\n\n## Performance Comparison\nThe performance comparison on the original versus the adversarial dataset highlights the importance of controlling for spurious statistics. On the original dataset, models like BERT achieve high mean, median, and maximum accuracies (e.g., $0.671$, $0.712$, and $0.770$ respectively) [5]. However, on the adversarial dataset, these numbers significantly decrease, indicating that the models were not truly understanding the arguments but rather exploiting statistical cues.\n\n## Visual Representation\nThe architecture used for processing involves complex interactions between different parts of the input, as shown in `![BERT architecture for processing claims, reasons, and warrants](image2)`. This visual representation helps in understanding how models like BERT process input data.\n\n## Key Results\nKey results from the experiments on the adversarial dataset are presented in tables, such as `|   | Mean | Median | Max | | --- | --- | --- | --- | | BERT | 0.504 ± 0.01 | 0.505 | 0.533 |` [4], indicating a more nuanced understanding of model performance.\n\n## Conclusion\nIn conclusion, the adversarial data setup significantly impacts BERT models' performance on the ARCT dataset, reducing their accuracy to near-random levels. This finding suggests that previous high performance metrics may not reflect genuine argument comprehension. The use of an adversarial dataset provides a more robust evaluation method, ensuring that future research focuses on developing models that truly understand arguments rather than exploiting statistical cues.\n\nThe adversarial dataset effectively eliminates the cues, providing a more robust evaluation of machine argument comprehension, and it should be adopted as the standard in future work [10]. \n![The adversarial dataset provides a more robust assessment of argument comprehension](image4)."}

An increase in AUM typically leads to higher management fees, contributing to revenue growth. Conversely, changes in fee rates can affect revenue margins.\n\nThe increase in AUM and adjustments in fee rates can enhance revenue, but the actual impact depends on various factors including market conditions and the performance of investments.\n\n### Evidence\n\nThe provided images and text quotes support these conclusions:\n- The table showing AUM changes over the years (`image2`, `image4`).\n- The fee rates across different asset classes (`image1`).\n- The increase in asset management revenues (`image4` and [9]). \n\nGiven this information, the firm's revenues are likely to increase with growing AUM and potentially changing fee rates, as indicated by the data provided.\n\nThe effective tax rate and net discrete tax provisions also saw changes:\n- Effective tax rate: 22.5% in 2020, 18.3% in 2019, and 20.9% in 2018 (`image3`).\n\n![Changes in AUM and Fee Rates](image2)\n![Fee Rates in Basis Points](image1)\n![Effective Tax Rate and Provisions](image3) \nThe firm's AUM and fee rates have changed significantly from 2018 to 2020, potentially impacting revenues positively due to increased AUM and adjustments in fee structures."}

The discount rates for significant plans are [4]:\n- **2021:** 1.7% (Euro), 1.0% (U.S. dollar), 2.7% (British pound), and 1.9% (Swiss franc)\n- **2020:** 1.5% (Euro), 0.9% (U.S. dollar), 2.4% (British pound), and 1.7% (Swiss franc)\n\n#### Compensation Increase and Pension Progression\n\nThe compensation increase and pension progression for countries where these assumptions have a significant effect are shown in the following tables [1][3]:\n| Country        | 2021 | 2020 |\n|----------------|------|------|\n| United Kingdom  | 3.0  | 2.6  |\n| Switzerland    | 1.5  | 1.4  |\n| Germany        | 1.5  | 1.5  |\n| United Kingdom  | 3.0  | 2.6  |\n\n### Financial Indicators\n\nThe changes in demographic assumptions, financial assumptions, experience gains and losses, and total actuarial gains and losses are as follows [2]:\n| (in millions of €) | Fiscal year 2021 | Fiscal year 2020 |\n|-------------------|------------------|------------------|\n| Changes in demographic assumptions | -8 | -3 |\n| Changes in financial assumptions    | -26 | 72 |\n| Experience gains and losses         | 12 | -2 |\n| Total actuarial gains (-) and losses | -22 | 67 |\n\n### Defined Benefit Obligation\n\nThe defined benefit obligation was attributable to active employees (47% in 2021; 45% in 2020), to active and former employees with vested benefits for whom no more current service cost is recognized (4% in 2021; 14% in 2020), and to retirees and surviving dependents (39% in 2021; 41% in 2020) [7].\n\n### Effects of Asset Ceiling\n\nThe effects of asset ceiling were €8 million in 2021 and €13 million in 2020 [3].\n\n### Remeasurements Recognized in Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income\n\nRemeasurements recognized in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income are as follows [3]:\n|  | Fiscal year 2021 | Fiscal year 2020 |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Return on plan assets (excluding amounts included in net interest income and net interest expenses) | - | - |\n| Actuarial gains (-) and losses | -22 | 67 |\n| Effects of asset ceiling | - | 1 |\n| Other | - | -6 |\n\n### Differences in Actuarial Assumptions and Financial Indicators\n\nThe differences in actuarial assumptions and financial indicators affecting the defined benefit plans in Germany and the United States for fiscal years 2021 and 2020 are primarily related to changes in discount rates, changes in demographic assumptions, changes in financial assumptions, experience gains and losses, and effects of asset ceiling.\n\nThe discount rates used for significant plans are [4]:\n- Euro: 1.7% (2021) and 1.5% (2020)\n- U.S. dollar: 1.0% (2021) and 0.9% (2020)\n- British pound: 2.7% (2021) and 2.4% (2020)\n- Swiss franc: 1.9% (2021) and 1.7% (2020)\n\nThe changes in demographic assumptions, financial assumptions, experience gains and losses, and total actuarial gains and losses are [2]:\n- **Germany:** \n  - Siemens-specific tables (Siemens Bio 2017/2021) mainly derived from data of the German Siemens population and to a lesser extent from data of the Federal Statistical Office in Germany by applying formulas in accordance with recognized actuarial standards (2021)\n  - Siemens-specific tables (Siemens Bio 2017/2020) mainly derived from data of the German Siemens population and to a lesser extent from data of the Federal Statistical Office in Germany by applying formulas in accordance with recognized actuarial standards (2020)\n- **United States:** \n  - Pri-2012 generational projection from the U.S. Social Security Administration’s Long Range Demographic Assumptions (2021)\n  - Pri-2012 generational projection from the U.S. Social Security Administration’s Long Range Demographic Assumptions (2020)\n- **United Kingdom:** \n  - SAPS S2 Standard mortality tables for Self-Administered Pension Schemes with allowance for future mortality improvements (2021)\n  - SAPS S2 Standard mortality tables for Self-Administered Pension Schemes with allowance for future mortality improvements (2020)\n- **Switzerland:** \n  - BVG 2020 G (2021)\n  - BVG 2015 G (2020)\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe actuarial assumptions and financial indicators affecting the defined benefit plans in Germany and the United States for fiscal years 2021 and 2020 show variations in discount rates, compensation increases, pension progression, demographic assumptions, financial assumptions, experience gains and losses, and total actuarial gains and losses.\n\nThe discount rates used for significant plans vary across countries and years. The changes in demographic assumptions, financial assumptions, experience gains and losses, and total actuarial gains and losses also vary across countries and years.\n\n## ![Actuarial assumptions and financial indicators](image2)\n\n## ![Defined benefit obligation](image3)\n\n## ![Discount rates](image4)"}

Excluding unfavorable currency, the decrease was 13.3%. The variance was primarily due to a volume/mix decrease of $635 million and a price increase of $44 million [1].\n\n  - Operating income decreased by 21.0% to $1,709 million from $2,163 million in 2019. This decline was mainly due to unfavorable volume/mix and lower fees for certain distribution rights [2].\n\n- **Regional Performance**:\n  - **Middle East & Africa**: Net revenues decreased by 21.7% to $3,088 million in 2020 from $4,042 million in 2019, primarily due to lower cigarette volume, heated tobacco unit volume, and IQOS device volume in PMI Duty Free [5].\n\n  - **South & Southeast Asia**: The net revenue change was not directly provided, but the operating income decrease was influenced by unfavorable volume/mix, mainly due to lower cigarette and heated tobacco unit volume in PMI Duty Free [2].\n\n  - **East Asia & Australia**: Net revenues increased by 1.2% to $5,429 million in 2020, despite a 9.7% decrease in cigarette volume [3].\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe changes in PMI shipment volumes and net revenues across different regions from 2019 to 2020 reflect a mixed performance.

This decline was primarily driven by decreases in Home Lending ($44,140 million, 16%), Personal Lending ($1,101 million, 18%), and Small Business ($6,473 million, 36%).\n\nOn the other hand, total deposits increased from $722,085 million in 2020 to $834,739 million in 2021, representing a 16% increase. This growth was mainly attributed to higher levels of liquidity and lower investment spending, reflecting government stimulus programs and continued economic uncertainty associated with the COVID-19 pandemic [1][3][image1].\n\n### Contributing Factors\n\nThe decrease in total loans can be attributed to [3]:\n* Lower loan demand, including lower line utilization\n* Higher paydowns reflecting continued high levels of client liquidity and strength in the capital markets\n* Modest loan growth in late 2021 driven by higher line utilization and customer growth\n\nThe increase in total deposits was driven by [4]:\n* Higher levels of liquidity and savings for consumer customers reflecting government stimulus programs and payment deferral programs\n* Continued economic uncertainty associated with the COVID-19 pandemic\n\n### Revenue and Noninterest Income Changes\n\nThe changes in revenue and noninterest income across different lines of business also contributed to the overall changes in total loans and deposits. For instance, investment banking fees increased due to higher debt underwriting fees, advisory fees, and equity underwriting fees. Additionally, other noninterest income increased driven by commercial mortgage banking income and low-income housing investments [9].\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, the total loans and deposits changed significantly across different lines of business from 2020 to 2021, driven by factors such as lower loan demand, higher paydowns, and increased liquidity and savings for consumer customers.\n\nThe decrease in total loans and increase in total deposits are shown in the table below [image1]:\n![The decrease in total loans and increase in total deposits are shown in the table below](image1)"}

This significant increase was primarily driven by:\n- Higher margins on refined product sales of **\\$1.6 billion**.\n- Higher earnings from 50 percent-owned CPChem of **\\$1.0 billion**.\n- Higher sales volumes of **\\$470 million**.\n- Partially offset by higher operating expenses of **\\$150 million**.\n\n### International Downstream Sector Earnings\n\nIn contrast, international downstream earnings decreased from **\\$618 million** in 2020 to **\\$525 million** in 2021. The decline was largely due to:\n- Lower margins on refined product sales of **\\$330 million**.\n- Higher operating expenses of **\\$100 million**.\n- Partially offset by a favorable swing in foreign currency effects of **\\$337 million** between periods.\n\n### Visual Representation\n\nThe earnings for both sectors can be visualized as follows:\n\n![Earnings Comparison](image1)\n| Sector        | 2021   | 2020   | 2019   |\n|---------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Earnings*     | \\$525  | \\$618  | \\$922  |\n\n*Includes foreign currency effects.\n\n### U.S. Downstream Earnings Trend\n\nThe U.S. downstream earnings trend from 2019 to 2021 is as follows:\n- **2019:** \\$1,559 million\n- **2020:** \\$ (571) million\n- **2021:** \\$2,389 million\n\n![U.S. Downstream Earnings Trend](image3)\n \n### Conclusion\n\nThe U.S. downstream sector saw a substantial increase in earnings from 2020 to 2021, primarily due to higher margins and sales volumes.

This growth is primarily attributed to higher income from equity investments and profit transfer from Siemens Healthcare GmbH, which increased by **€420 million** to **€1,879 million**.

Specifically, cigarette shipment volume decreased from 174,319 million units in 2019 to 163,420 million units in 2020, representing a **6.3% decrease** [5].

This increase was primarily driven by [5]:\n  - An increase in Derivatives exposures due to market volatility.\n  - An increase in Investment securities mainly as a result of the E* TRADE acquisition.\n  - Increases in Lending commitments within the Wealth Management and Institutional Securities business segments.\n  - An increase in Equity investments due to higher exposure and market value gains.\n\n### Market Risk RWA\n\n- **Increase in Market Risk RWA**: Market risk RWA increased in 2020 under both the Standardized and Advanced Approaches, primarily due to an increase in Regulatory VaR mainly as a result of higher market volatility [6].\n\n### Operational Risk RWA\n\n- **Decrease in Operational Risk RWA**: The operational risk RWA under the Advanced Approach decreased in 2020, reflecting a decline in the frequency and severity of litigation-related losses [9].\n\n### Impact on TLAC as a Percentage of RWA\n\nGiven these changes, let's examine their impact on External TLAC as a percentage of RWA:\n\n- **External TLAC as a % of RWA**: Increased from 49.9% at December 31, 2019, to 47.7% at December 31, 2020 [5].\n\nThe decrease in TLAC as a percentage of RWA can be attributed to the significant increases in RWA, particularly in credit risk and market risk, which outpaced the growth in TLAC. \n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe External TLAC as a percentage of RWA decreased from 49.9% in 2019 to 47.7% in 2020, primarily due to increases in credit risk RWA, market risk RWA, and a decrease in operational risk RWA.\n\n![Changes in RWA Components](image3)\n\nThe table shows the changes in various components of RWA, including credit risk, market risk, and operational risk.\n\n![TLAC as a Percentage of RWA](image5)\nThe table provides the External TLAC as a percentage of RWA, which decreased from 49.9% in 2019 to 47.7% in 2020. \n\nThe External TLAC decreased as a percentage of RWA from 49.9% to 47.7%."}

In 2020, the U.S. segment accounted for 50% of the total revenue, while the International Operated Markets segment accounted for 41%, and International Developmental Licensed Markets & Corporate accounted for 9% (`image4`).\n\n### Growth Rates\n\nThe table shows that the International Operated Markets segment had a growth rate of -15% in 2020, compared to 6.1% in 2019 (`image2`). The U.S. segment had a growth rate of 0.4% in 2020, compared to 5.0% in 2019.\n\n### Influencing Factors\n\nSeveral factors might have influenced these changes:\n* **COVID-19 Pandemic**: The pandemic led to widespread lockdowns, social distancing measures, and reduced consumer spending, negatively impacting the International Operated Markets segment.\n* **Government Regulations**: Government regulations and resurgences of COVID-19 continued to have a negative impact on revenue in the near term [9].\n* **Marketing Investments**: The company's strategic marketing investments and promotional activities had a positive impact on comparable sales in the U.S. segment [4].\n* **Delivery Growth**: The growth in delivery also contributed to the positive sales performance in the U.S. [4].\n\n### Financial Performance\n\nThe financial performance of the segments is also reflected in the company's revenues and margins. The International Operated Markets segment saw a significant decline in revenues, from $11,398 million in 2019 to $9,462 million in 2020, representing a 17% decrease (`image3`). In contrast, the U.S. segment saw a relatively stable revenue performance, with a 2% decrease in 2020.\n\nOverall, the COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on McDonald's revenue composition and growth rates in 2020, with the International Operated Markets segment being particularly affected.\n\n![Revenue Composition and Growth Rates](image1)\n\nThe bar chart shows the franchised and company-operated margins for McDonald's from 2018 to 2020. \n\nIn conclusion, the COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on McDonald's revenue composition and growth rates in 2020, with the International Operated Markets segment experiencing a significant decline in revenues and comparable sales. \n\n![Revenue

In 2020, there were 39,198 systemwide restaurants, compared to 38,695 in 2019 and 37,855 in 2018. This represents an increase of 503 restaurants from 2019 to 2020, primarily due to an increase in franchised restaurants.\n\n### Analysis\n\nThe decrease in cash provided by operations, combined with the increase in systemwide restaurants, might indicate that while the company is expanding its operational footprint, its ability to generate cash from operations has been negatively impacted. This could be due to various factors such as increased costs associated with new restaurants, changes in consumer spending habits, or impacts from COVID-19.\n\n![Cash Flow Information](image4)\n\nThe cash provided by operations decreased primarily due to a reduction in operating earnings due to COVID-19.\n\n![Systemwide Restaurants](image2)\n\nThe increase in systemwide restaurants from 38,695 in 2019 to 39,198 in 2020 indicates expansion.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe changes in cash provided by operations and the number of systemwide restaurants from 2019 to 2020 indicate that while McDonald's is expanding its business presence, it faces challenges in maintaining or increasing its operational cash flow, potentially due to external factors like the COVID-19 pandemic."}

This significant change was driven by several factors including a decrease in net cash used for acquisitions and a decrease of $6,245 million in cash provided by net non-operating finance receivables [8][3].\n\n### Equity Changes\n\n- **Equity**: Total equity decreased by $258 million from December 31, 2019, primarily due to dividends paid of $5,797 million and a decline in accumulated other comprehensive income of $740 million mainly due to foreign currency translation adjustments; partially offset by increases from net income of $5,590 million and common stock of $661 million [7].\n\n### Return on Equity\n\n- The Global Financing return on equity remained constant at 25.8% for both 2019 and 2020, indicating stable profitability relative to equity [1].\n\n### Analysis\n\nThe increase in noncurrent assets indicates investment in assets that will generate future economic benefits for IBM. However, the decrease in long-term debt might suggest a strategic decision to reduce leverage or manage debt more efficiently.\n\nThe significant use of cash in financing activities in 2020 compared to a source of cash in 2019 indicates a shift in the company's financial management strategy, possibly reflecting efforts to manage liquidity and debt profiles.\n\nThe stable return on equity despite changes in financial structure suggests that IBM maintained its profitability relative to shareholder equity.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe financial changes indicate IBM's strategic management of its balance sheet, focusing on optimizing its debt and asset structure. The decrease in long-term debt and changes in cash flows reflect active management of financial resources.\n\nGlobal Financing debt of $21,167 million decreased $3,560 million from December 31, 2019, primarily due to lower funding requirements as a result of the decline in financing assets, consistent with the company’s portfolio management strategy.\n\n![Financial Data Comparison](image2)\n![Cash Flow Data](image3)\n![Return on Equity](image1) \n![Debt Structure](image4) \nThe financial changes reflect strategic management of assets, debt, and equity to maintain stability and profitability."}

To understand the change in the valuation allowance from 2021 to 2022 and its impact on net deferred tax assets, we need to examine the relevant financial data.\n\n### Change in Valuation Allowance\n\nAccording to the provided text quotes [6], in 2022 and 2021, the Company had valuation allowances of $\\S313$ and $\\S214$, respectively. This indicates an increase in the valuation allowance from 2021 to 2022.\n\n### Impact on Net Deferred Tax Assets\n\nThe increase in the valuation allowance from $\\S214$ in 2021 to $\\S313$ in 2022 suggests that the Company became more cautious about its ability to realize certain deferred tax assets, likely due to changes in its financial performance, tax laws, or expectations about future profitability.\n\n### Analysis of Deferred Tax Assets and Liabilities\n\nThe deferred tax accounts at the end of 2022 and 2021 include deferred income tax assets of $\\S445$ and $\\S444$, respectively, and deferred income tax liabilities of $\\S724$ and $\\S754$, respectively [10]. The increase in valuation allowance directly affects the net deferred tax assets by reducing them.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe valuation allowance increased from $\\S214$ in 2021 to $\\S313$ in 2022, indicating a more conservative stance on the realizability of deferred tax assets. This change suggests that the Company expects to have less benefit from these assets in the future, potentially due to changes in profitability expectations or tax laws.\n\nGiven this context, here is a direct and concise answer:\n\nThe valuation allowance increased from $\\S214$ in 2021 to $\\S313$ in 2022. This change indicates a decrease in the expected realization of deferred tax assets, which would decrease the net deferred tax assets.\n\n### Relevant Data\n\n| Year | Valuation Allowance |\n| :--- | :-----------------: |\n| 2021 |         $\\S214$       |\n| 2022 |         $\\S313$       |\n\n![Valuation Allowance Change](image1)\n\nThe image shows a comparison of financial data between 2021 and 2022 but does not directly provide information on the valuation allowance change. However, based on the text, we can infer that the increase in valuation allowance from $\\S214$ to $\\S313$ reflects a more conservative outlook on deferred tax asset realization.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe valuation allowance increased by $\\S99$ from 2021 to 2022, indicating a more conservative stance on deferred tax asset realization, which would decrease net deferred tax assets."}

This increase was primarily driven by the reduction of financing receivables due to sales of receivables.\n\n### Net Cash Used in Investing Activities\n\nThe net cash used in investing activities decreased by $23,908 million. This decrease was driven by [3]:\n- A decrease in net cash used for acquisitions of $32,294 million due to the Red Hat acquisition in the prior year.\n- A decrease of $6,245 million in cash provided by net non-operating finance receivables primarily driven by the wind-down of the OEM IT commercial financing operations.\n- An increase in cash used for net purchases of marketable securities and other investments of $896 million.\n\n### Net Cash Used in Financing Activities\n\nFinancing activities were a net use of cash of $9,721 million in 2020 compared to a net source of cash of $9,042 million in 2019. The year-to-year change of $18,763 million was driven by various factors, including early retirements and debt maturities of $11,267 million, partially offset by issuances of $8,982 million [4].\n\n### Impact on Overall Cash Flow\n\nThe net change in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash was $5,361 million for 2020 and $(3,290) million for 2019 [4].\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe changes in net cash provided by operating, investing, and financing activities had a significant impact on IBM's overall cash flow between 2019 and 2020.\n\n### Changes in Net Cash Provided/Used in Continuing Operations\n\n| **For the year ended December 31:** | **2020** | **2019** |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Net cash provided by/(used in) continuing operations |  |  |\n| Operating activities | $18,197 | $14,770 |\n| Investing activities | $(3,028) | $(26,936) |\n| Financing activities | $(9,721) | 9,042 |\n\n![Changes in Net Cash Provided/Used in Continuing Operations](image4)\n\nThe table and image above show that IBM's operating activities generated more cash in 2020 ($18,197 million) compared to 2019 ($14,770 million).

These changes indicate a significant shift in IBM's cash management and investment strategies between the two years.\n\nOverall, IBM's cash flow improved in 2020 due to increased operating cash and reduced investing cash outflows, despite a significant use of cash in financing activities. \n\nThe company's ability to generate cash from operations and manage its investing and financing activities effectively contributed to its overall cash position. \n\nTherefore, IBM's cash flow improved in 2020 compared to 2019."}

However, excluding the impact of the Tokyo Olympics, the revenue growth was still substantial, driven by various factors such as higher pricing, increased advertising revenue in Peacock, and contractual rate increases. \n\nThe impact of the Tokyo Olympics on NBCUniversal's advertising and distribution revenues in 2021 compared to 2020 was an increase of $\\$1.3$ billion and $\\$1.3$ billion respectively, in advertising and $\\$522$ million in distribution."}

A higher penetration of gasoline sales generally lowers the gross margin percentage. In 2022, higher gasoline prices positively impacted net sales but negatively affected the gross margin percentage [2].\n\n- **Core Merchandise Categories**: Decreases in core merchandise categories across all segments negatively impacted gross margin, partially offset by increases in warehouse ancillary and other businesses [1].\n\n- **LIFO Charge and Rewards**: The gross margin was negatively impacted by a LIFO charge for higher merchandise costs and increased $2\\%$ rewards [5].\n\n- **Foreign Currency Changes**: Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted gross margin by approximately $\\S176$ compared to 2021, primarily attributable to the Other International Operations [5].\n\n- **Merchandise Costs and Inflation**: Inflation higher than experienced in recent years impacted merchandise costs in 2022. The company absorbed some of these costs, worked with suppliers to share cost increases, and passed some increases on to members, which negatively impacted gross margin [3].\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe decrease in gross margin percentage from 2020 to 2022 was influenced by various factors including changes in gasoline prices, performance in core merchandise categories, LIFO charges, increased rewards, and foreign currency fluctuations.\n\nThe gross margin percentage change from 2020 to 2022 is shown in image1 `![Gross margin percentage change](image1)`."}

Among Democratic-leaning Latinos, 47% perceive a great deal of difference, compared to 48% of Republican-leaning Latinos.\n\nThe data also shows that [3] 77% of Latino registered voters are dissatisfied with the way things are going in the country, and 54% disapprove of the way Joe Biden is handling his job as president. \n\nHowever, despite these sentiments, equal shares of Latino Democrats and Democratic-leaning registered voters (60%) and Latino Republicans and GOP-leaning registered voters (60%) say it really matters who wins control of Congress.\n\nLatino registered voters identify with or lean toward the Democratic Party over the Republican Party by a nearly two-to-one margin (64% vs. 33% in this year’s survey), with Latino party identification shifting little over the past few years [4].\n\n![Latino voters’ party affiliation little changed in recent years](image3)\n\nOverall, the alignment of Latino registered voters with the parties and their perceptions of differences between them suggest that [7] Latinos are the nation’s second-largest group of eligible voters (adult U.S. citizens) and are among its fastest-growing voter blocks.

A 2021 Pew Research Center study of Americans’ political views found substantial shares of Latino voters fell into groups with soft ties to the political parties.\n\n![Perceptions of differences between parties among Latino registered voters](image2)\n\nIn terms of key issues, 80% of Latino registered voters say the economy is a very important issue when deciding who to vote for in the 2022 congressional midterm elections, a greater share than any other issue, and unchanged since March. Other top issues include health care (71%), violent crime and education (70% each), and gun policy (66%) [9].\n\nAbortion has risen the most in importance as a voting issue among Hispanics in recent months, a shift that comes after the Supreme Court’s decision to end the federal guarantee of a right to legal abortion in the United States.

The number of mobile subscribers increased from 2006 to 2010 at an annual rate of 31.9% [4].\n\n### Operator Performance Comparison\n\n- **Subscribers (in millions)**: \n  - Telkomsel: 132.7\n  - XL: 68.5\n  - Indosat: 59.7\n  - 3: 38\n  - Smartfren: 13\n  - Esia: 12.3 [2]\n\n- **Smartphone Users (in millions)**:\n  - Telkomsel: 24\n  - XL: 13.6\n  - Indosat: 8\n  - 3: 6.5\n  - Smartfren: 3.8\n  - Esia: 0.8 [2]\n\n- **BlackBerry Users (in millions)**:\n  - Telkomsel: 7.2\n  - XL: 4.05\n  - Indosat: 2.6 [2]\n\n- **Data Users (in millions)**:\n  - Telkomsel: 60.5\n  - XL: 37.5\n  - Indosat: 29 [2]\n\n## Analysis of Subscriber and Data User Growth\n\nThe data indicates that Telkomsel had the highest number of subscribers, smartphone users, and data users. The significant number of subscribers and data users for Telkomsel, XL, and Indosat suggests a strong performance in terms of user acquisition and data services.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe subscriber numbers and data user numbers for Telkomsel, XL, and Indosat indicate a strong performance in the Indonesian telecom market during 2013-2014. With Telkomsel leading in subscribers (132.7 million) and data users (60.5 million), followed by XL and Indosat, this suggests that these operators have been successful in expanding their user base and data services.\n\nGiven this context, it can be inferred that the operators with higher subscriber and data user numbers are likely performing better in terms of market share and service uptake.\n\nThe trend of decreasing SMS and voice call usage, coupled with increased data usage, is likely driving this growth, as users shift towards data-based services [10].\n\n![Subscriber and Data User Numbers](image2)\n\nThis graph shows the number of subscribers, smartphone users, BlackBerry users, and data users for several telecom operators in Indonesia.\n\nThe high subscriber and data user numbers for Telkomsel, XL, and Indosat indicate their strong market presence and growth in data services. \n\nIn conclusion, Telkomsel, XL, and Indosat have shown significant growth in subscriber and data user numbers, reflecting their robust performance in Indonesia's telecom sector."}

This scarcity not only led to low entry valuations but also drove up capital efficiency and yield (or hit rate) because the very few investors could simply be more selective [3].\n\n- **Investment Cycle and Fund Performance**: There was an immediate drop in venture deal flow by 50% after the bubble burst, followed by entrepreneurs running for the woods. An exit boom starting in 2005 began to drive up demand. By 2010, the market was still saturated with pre-bubble VC funds, and 65% of all VC funds slid into oblivion [1].\n\n- **Fundraising and Investments**: The period post-2004 saw significant changes in how VC funds operated and performed. The scarcity of VC money in Europe led to high capital efficiency. Roughly 70 percent higher than in the US, and a higher yield due to investors being more selective [3].\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWhile the exact chart isn't provided, based on the descriptions and trends:\n \nThe early-stage VC fundraising in Europe, post-2004, experienced a downturn in available capital but saw improvements in performance for post-bubble vintages, particularly from 2005/2006 onwards. This period was marked by increased selectivity among investors, higher capital efficiency, and a significant gap in the supply of venture capital versus the availability of deals.\n\nTherefore, early-stage VC fundraising in Europe became more selective and efficient with a notable decrease in available capital but an increase in the performance of funds that were active.\n\nThe dramatic decrease in available capital for European Venture Capital funds is illustrated in `![Supply and demand dynamics for Venture Capital in Europe from 2000-2010 ]()`"}

This trend suggests that more people are moving away from traditional party affiliations.\n\n## Political Leanings of Independents\nAmong Democratic-leaning independents, slightly more identify as moderates $(45\\%)$ than as liberals $(39\\%)$, while $14\\%$ are conservatives.

This transformed Nebraska into a \"booming agricultural state\" and led to a great tide of emigration to the west, especially Nebraska [9].\n\nAdditionally, the Homestead Act of 1862 provided pioneers with 160 acres of land if they constructed a permanent structure and resided on it for five years, leading to a large number of people acquiring land in Nebraska under the Act [9].\n\nThe agricultural economy also played a significant role in shaping the population trends. Corn has long dominated the agricultural economy, but methods and the agricultural landscape have changed dramatically over the last century. As a result of mechanization, the scale of farming in the United States has been altered, leading to significant impacts on rural life [4].\n\nThe settlement of Hamilton County was influenced by various ethnic groups, including Germans, Danes, Swedes, Irish, Bohemians, and Russians, who settled in clusters across the county [8].\n\n![A church building with a steeple and a cemetery in front of it, indicating the importance of religious congregations in rural areas.](image1)\n\nThe images show various churches in Hamilton County, Nebraska, including a Lutheran church and a Catholic church, which were likely built by these ethnic groups [1][7].\n\nOverall, the population trends of Hamilton County, Nebraska, from 1870 to 2000 were influenced by historical factors such as the construction of the Union Pacific Railroad, the Homestead Act, and changes in the agricultural economy.\n\nThe population peaked at 14,096 in 1890 and has been declining ever since.\n\nThe population changes are also reflected in the changes in farming practices, with the number of farms steadily declining since its peak in 1900, while the average size of farms has increased [4]."}

These acts transformed the landscape by facilitating westward expansion and providing settlers with land, leading to an increase in farming activities [2].\n\n### Farm Numbers and Size\n\n- **1880**: There were 1,597 farms.\n- **1900**: The number of farms peaked at 2,049.\n- **1950**: By this year, the number of farms had decreased to 1,453.\n\nThis trend indicates a decline in the number of farms over the 70-year period, reflecting changes in agricultural practices, technological advancements, and economic factors.\n\n### Agricultural Practices and Technological Advancements\n\nThe introduction of new technologies, such as deep-well irrigation in the late 1930s and center-pivot irrigation systems in the early 1970s, significantly impacted farming practices. These technologies allowed for more efficient use of land and resources, contributing to farm consolidation and changes in farm numbers [6][8].\n\n### Visual Representation of Agricultural Infrastructure\n\nThe presence of grain elevators, as shown in images1, 2, and 3, played a crucial role in the agricultural economy, serving as focal points for grain storage and distribution. These structures are indicative of the agricultural activities in the region.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe number of farms in Hamilton County, Nebraska, experienced fluctuations between 1880 and 1950, influenced by technological advancements, legislative acts, and economic conditions.

Specifically, [9] states that \"ios 9 has the fastest adoption rate ever, with more than 50 percent of devices already using ios 9.\" This indicates a high adoption rate of iOS 9.\n\n## 2: Analyze Image Quotes\nLooking at image2, we see a bar graph showing the adoption rates of different iOS versions in Q2/2015 and Q3/2015. The graph shows that iOS 9 had a significantly higher adoption rate in Q3/2015 compared to other versions.\n\n## 3: Compare Adoption Rates\nAccording to [9], iOS 9 had an adoption rate of over 50% as of September 19, 2015. However, the exact global average rate is not provided directly in the quotes. \n\n## 4: Determine Vietnam's Adoption Rate of iOS 9\nThe question specifically asks about Vietnam's adoption rate of iOS 9 compared to the global average rate. Although the exact adoption rate in Vietnam is not directly provided, we can infer from [7] and [9] that iOS 9 had a very high adoption rate.\n\n## 5: Find Global Average Rate\nGiven that image4 shows a pie chart with 51%, 41%, and 8% distribution but does not directly relate to iOS 9 adoption rates, we focus on image2 for iOS adoption rates.\n\n## 6: Compare and Calculate Difference\nSince we do not have a direct global average rate provided for comparison but know iOS 9's adoption rate was over 50%, and assuming the global average could be inferred from other data points, we still need a specific number for Vietnam or a clear global average to calculate the difference.\n\n## 7: Conclusion Based on Available Data\nHowever, image2 indicates iOS 9 adoption reached 52% by Q3/2015. Without a specific global average provided in the quotes, we assume the question implies comparing Vietnam's rate (if available) to a general understanding of iOS 9's adoption.\n\nGiven iOS 9's fast adoption rate of over 50% and assuming this reflects a high rate compared to other regions or globally, and without a specific global average or Vietnam rate provided directly, we infer based on available data.\n\nThe adoption rate of iOS 9 in Q3 2015 was 52% ![Adoption rate comparison](image2).\n\n## 8: Final Assessment\nGiven that we do not have a direct comparison or a specific Vietnam rate versus a global rate but knowing iOS 9 had a significant adoption, we conclude based on available numbers.\n\niOS 9's adoption rate was significantly high. Assuming a global average or comparison isn't directly calculable without more specific geographic data on iOS 9 adoption rates.\n\nHowever, iOS 9 adoption rate was higher than other iOS versions ![Global iOS Breakdown](image2). \n\n## 9: Final Answer\nGiven the information and focusing on iOS 9's adoption: iOS 9 had an adoption rate of 52% in Q3 2015; hence, it is higher."}

According to the data, **23%** of older adults indicate that they have a \"physical or health condition that makes reading difficult or challenging,\" while **29%** have a \"disability, handicap, or chronic disease that prevents them from fully participating in many common daily activities\" [8].\n\n### Comparison with All Adults\n\nWhen comparing these figures to all adults, we see:\n- **16%** of all adults report a physical or health condition that makes reading difficult or challenging.\n- **18%** of all adults report a disability, handicap, or chronic disease that prevents full participation in work, school, or other activities.\n\n![Physical health conditions comparison between older adults and all adults](image1)\n\nThis chart illustrates that older adults face more significant physical challenges than the general adult population, with higher percentages reporting difficulties.\n\n### Technology Adoption and Physical Challenges\n\nThese physical challenges can affect technology adoption and use. For instance, **49%** of seniors with physical challenges go online, compared to **66%** of those without such challenges. Similarly, **38%** of seniors with physical challenges have broadband at home, versus **53%** of those without these challenges [3].\n\n### Demographic Breakdown\n\nThe data also shows variations within the older adult population based on demographics such as age, education, and income:\n- **Cell phone ownership** varies by age:\n  - **65-69:** 84%\n  - **70-74:** 84%\n  - **75-79:** 72%\n  - **80+:** 61%\n\n- **Smartphone ownership** also varies:\n  - **65- [65-69:** 29%\n  - **70-74:** 21%\n  - **75-79:** 10%\n  - **80+:** 5% [2]\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, physical health conditions significantly affect technology use among older adults compared to all adults, with older adults experiencing higher rates of physical and health-related challenges that hinder their ability to engage with digital technologies.\n\nThe technology adoption levels are lower among seniors who have not attended college and those with an annual household income of less than $30,000 per year. Overall, adoption levels are similar among seniors who have not attended college and those with low household incomes [2]."}

Specifically, the percentages of no agreement range from 9.3% to 13.1% across different model pairs. On about $28\\%$ to $35\\%$ of the pairs, all annotators have unanimous judgments, and in about $55\\%$ to $60\\%$ of the pairs, one annotator differs from the other two. This suggests a moderate level of agreement among annotators, indicating that while there is a reasonable level of consistency in evaluating Chameleon's performance against other models, there is also a notable degree of variability or uncertainty in the assessments.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe comparison highlights that while there is a significant level of agreement among annotators, there is also a considerable degree of variability or uncertainty in the assessments, reflected by $10\\%$ to $13.1\\%$ no agreement cases.

However, further increasing the number of demonstrations beyond 5 yields limited improvements [10].\n\n- **With Logical Constraints**: Adding logical constraints to the demonstrations can provide stable improvements in Micro-F1 performance. Notably, using a smaller number of demonstrations with logical constraints can sometimes surpass the performance achieved with a larger number of demonstrations without logical constraints. For instance, on the MAVEN-ERE dataset, using 5 demonstrations with logical constraints can achieve a performance of $25.7\\%$, which is better than using 10 demonstrations without logical constraints ($24.5\\%$) [10].\n\n### Comparison Across Models\n\n- Different models respond differently to the addition of logical constraints and the number of demonstrations:\n  - **GPT-4**: Shows outstanding performance with a small number of hops (2~5) and degrades as the number of hops increases, indicating that more complex reasoning tasks require better logical consistency [1].\n  - **Vicuna-13B and Llama2-13B**: Their performance improves with logical constraints, especially notable in the reduction of logical inconsistency [6].\n\n### Logical Inconsistency Reduction\n\n- Incorporating logical constraints not only improves Micro-F1 performance but also reduces logical inconsistency. The reduction in logical inconsistency is more significant with an increasing number of iterations, although the Micro-F1 score may stabilize or fluctuate [2].\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, the number of demonstration samples has a positive but diminishing return effect on Micro-F1 performance without logical constraints. With logical constraints, even a smaller number of demonstrations can achieve or surpass the performance of a larger number of demonstrations without constraints. This indicates that telling LLMs both \"what\" (demonstrations) and \"how\" (logical constraints) is crucial for solving reasoning tasks effectively.\n\n![Impact of logical constraints and demonstrations on Micro-F1 performance](image4)\n\nThe figure illustrates the impact of logical constraints and the number of demonstration samples on Micro-F1 performance across different models and datasets.\n\nIn the provided table:\n\n| Model        | MAVEN-ERE Micro-F1 (%) | LI (%) $\\downarrow$ | Causal-TimeBank Micro-F1 (%) | LI (%) $\\downarrow$ |\n|--------------|------------------------|----------------------|-----------------------------|----------------------|\n| **GPT-4**     | 37.3                    | 8.3                  | 26.0                        | 20.0                  |\n|              | 33.5                    | 28.8                 | 24.0                        | 13.5                  |\n|              | 17.0                    | 0                     | 19.0                        | 0                     |\n| **Davinci**   | 27.0                    | 25.6                 | 31.0                        | 21.8                  |\n|              | 27.8                    | 30.8                 | 22.0                        | 40.5                  |\n|              | 14.8                    | 0                     | 19.0                        | 0                     |\n| **Llama2-13B** | 19.5                    | 34.6                 | 10.0                        | 23.5                  |\n|              | 18.3                    | 38.2                 | 9.5                         | 26.7                  |\n|              | 12.0                    | 0                     | 9.5                         | 0                     |"}

It uses an index system, such as the HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World) algorithm, to optimize retrieval speed by reducing the dimensionality of vectors.\n\n### 2. **Retrieval Process**:\n   - **Function**: Queries a large multimodal external memory or database to find information relevant to the input query or context.\n   - **Role**: The retrieval process aims to find the top-$k$ class names or labels most similar to the input image. This is achieved by encoding the input image and comparing it with stored embeddings to retrieve relevant categories.\n\n### 3. **Ranking Process**:\n   - **Function**: Ranks the retrieved candidate results to make the final prediction.\n   - **Role**: After retrieving the top-$k$ similar results, the MLLMs rank these results based on similarity to produce the final classification prediction. This involves integrating the retrieved information with the internal knowledge of the MLLMs.\n\n### 4. **Index Construction Techniques**:\n   - **Function**: Enhances the speed of retrieval by reducing the dimensionality of vectors.\n   - **Role**: Techniques like HNSW are used to construct a more condensed index, allowing for faster and more efficient retrieval of relevant information.\n\n### 5. **Inference Pipeline**:\n   - **Function**: Combines the retrieval and ranking processes.\n   - **Role**: Upon receiving an input image, the pipeline retrieves the top-$k$ class names most similar to the image and then uses MLLMs to rank these retrieved candidate results as the final prediction.\n\n### 6. **Pre-processing for Detection Datasets**:\n   - **Function**: Involves cropping and blurring techniques.\n   - **Role**: For object detection datasets, pre-processing steps such as cropping image regions based on proposal bounding box coordinates and resizing them help the MLLMs focus on relevant objects.\n\n### 7. **Prompt Format**:\n   - **Function**: Merges the input image with the retrieved category information.\n   - **Role**: Guides MLLMs to rank the retrieved candidate object categories based on similarity.\n\n### 8. **Memory Bank ($\\mathcal{M}$)**:\n   - **Function**: Stores multimodal embeddings for different categories.\n   - **Role**: Acts as an external memory that provides relevant information to the MLLMs during the retrieval and ranking process.\n\n### 9. **MLLMs (Multimodal Large Language Models)**:\n   - **Function**: Ranks the retrieved results and makes the final predictions.\n   - **Role**: Combines internal knowledge with retrieved information to accurately classify images into fine-grained categories.\n\n### 10. **Index System (HNSW)**:\n   - **Function**: Implements efficient retrieval through dimensionality reduction.\n   - **Role**: Enables the construction of a condensed index for faster retrieval.\n\nThese components work together to bridge the gap between the broad generalization capabilities of MLLMs and the need for precise, fine-grained categorization, significantly boosting performance on downstream tasks.\n\nThe main components include:\n- **Multimodal Retriever**: Stores and queries multimodal embeddings.\n- **Index System (HNSW)**: Optimizes retrieval speed.\n- **Retrieval Process**: Finds top-$k$ similar class labels.\n- **Ranking Process**: Uses MLLMs to rank retrieved results.\n\nThe functions of these components are to enable efficient and accurate retrieval and ranking of categories for input images, enhancing the few-shot/zero-shot perception capabilities of MLLMs.\n\n![Multimodal Retriever and Ranking Process](image3)\n\nIn this image, we can see the main components of RAR pipeline including **Multimodal Retriever**, **Database Image Feature Embeddings**, **Feature Index**, and **Retrieving & Ranking**.[3]\n\nThe proposed approach seeks to bridge the gap between the broad generalization capabilities of MLLMs and the need for precise, fine-grained categorization, offering a path forward that preserves the model’s extensive knowledge base while significantly boosting its performance on downstream tasks. \n\nThe RAR pipeline can be seamlessly integrated into various MLLMs in a plug-and-play manner [2]. \n\nThus, RAR method uses MLLM to rank the retrieved results.[4]"}

These methods differ significantly in their approach to navigating the tree and selecting relevant information.\n\n### Tree Traversal Retrieval\n\nTree Traversal Retrieval involves navigating through the tree layer by layer, selecting the most relevant nodes at each level based on their similarity to the query. This process starts with the top layer and progressively moves down to finer details. The method allows for control over the specificity and breadth of the information retrieved by adjusting the depth $d$ and the number of nodes $k$ selected at each layer [9].\n\n### Collapsed Tree Retrieval\n\nOn the other hand, Collapsed Tree Retrieval offers a different approach by evaluating nodes collectively across all layers to find the most relevant ones. Instead of traversing the tree layer by layer, this method essentially flattens the multi-layered tree into a single layer, bringing all nodes onto the same level for comparison. This approach provides greater flexibility by searching through all nodes simultaneously, which enables it to retrieve information at the correct level of granularity for a given question [3].\n\n### Key Differences\n\n- **Layer-by-Layer vs. Simultaneous Evaluation**: Tree Traversal Retrieval evaluates nodes layer by layer, while Collapsed Tree Retrieval considers all nodes simultaneously.\n- **Flexibility and Granularity**: Collapsed Tree Retrieval offers greater flexibility and can retrieve information at a more appropriate level of granularity due to its simultaneous evaluation of all nodes.\n- **Performance**: The performance comparison between these two methods shows that Collapsed Tree Retrieval consistently performs better, as demonstrated in Figure 3, where it outperforms Tree Traversal Retrieval across different top-sizes and maximum token numbers [1].\n\n### Visual Representation\n\nThe visual representation of these methods can be seen in `![Tree Traversal and Collapsed Tree Retrieval Approaches](image2)`, which illustrates how each method processes the tree structure differently.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, the main difference between Tree Traversal Retrieval and Collapsed Tree Retrieval lies in their approach to navigating the tree structure. Tree Traversal Retrieval offers a layered approach, while Collapsed Tree Retrieval provides a more flexible and granular method of information retrieval by considering all nodes simultaneously.\n\nThe Collapsed Tree Retrieval approach consistently performs better than Tree Traversal Retrieval. ![The collapsed tree approach performs better](image5)."}

The system allows users to input a claim and then predicts its veracity with a comprehensive report detailing its reasoning process, guided by a sequence of (question, answer) pairs.\n\n## Step 2: Identify Relevant Performance Metrics\nTo calculate the average performance gap between the ProgramFC performance and the proposed QACHECK system in the HOVER dataset, we first need to identify their respective performance metrics. According to [9], QACHECK achieves a macro-F1 score of 55.67, 54.67, and 52.35 on HOVER two-hop, three-hop, and four-hop claims, respectively. For ProgramFC, the performance is mentioned but not directly provided in the visible text; however, we can infer from the table in image3 that ProgramFC has specific scores as well.\n\n## 3: Locate Specific Performance Scores\nFrom image3, we see that ProgramFC has scores of 54.27, 54.18, and 52.88 on the HOVER dataset for two-hop, three-hop, and four-hop claims, respectively. The QACHECK system outperforms ProgramFC slightly with scores of 55.67, 54.67, and 52.35.\n\n## 4: Calculate Performance Gap\nTo find the average performance gap, we calculate the difference in scores for each type of claim and then find the average.\n\n- For two-hop claims: $55.67 - 54.27 = 1.4$\n- For three-hop claims: $54.67 - 54.18 = 0.49$\n- For four-hop claims: $52.35 - 52.88 = -0.53$\n\n## 5: Compute Average Performance Gap\nThe average performance gap is $\\frac{1.4 + 0.49 - 0.53}{3} = \\frac{0.86}{3} = 0.29$ (rounded to two decimal places for simplicity, but we'll compute it precisely).\n\n## 6: Provide Final Calculation\nAverage performance gap $= \\frac{(55.67-54.27) + (54.67-54.18) + (52.35-52.88)}{3}$ \n\nAverage performance gap $= \\frac{1.4 + 0.49 -0.53}{3}$\n\nAverage performance gap $= \\frac{1.36}{3} = 0.45$\n\n\nThe final answer is: \n![The QACHECK system achieves better performance with an average gap of 0.45 compared to ProgramFC across different hop claims.](image3)"}

These differences are crucial for understanding how each process enhances the performance and adaptability of RAG systems.\n\n### Iterative Retrieval Process\nThe Iterative process focuses on **providing more context information**. It involves a loop where the system retrieves information, generates a response, and then judges the output. If the output does not meet a certain threshold or criteria, the system iterates back to the retrieval step, potentially refining the query or seeking additional information. This process continues until a satisfactory response is generated or a predefined maximum number of iterations is reached.\n\n### Recursive Retrieval Process\nThe Recursive process is designed to **break down complex problems step by step**. It starts with a retrieval step, followed by generation, and then a judgment step. If the judgment indicates that the response is not adequate, the system can transform or decompose the query further and retrieve additional information. This process allows for a deeper exploration of the information space, breaking down complex queries into simpler sub-queries and retrieving relevant information step by step.\n\n### Adaptive Retrieval Process\nThe Adaptive process offers **flexible and active control of retrieval and generation**. It introduces a judge component that actively decides whether to retrieve more information or to proceed with generation based on the query and the current context. This process allows for on-demand retrieval, adapting the retrieval and generation steps according to the needs of the query and the quality of the generated response.\n\n### Comparison of the Processes\n- **Iterative**: Focuses on refining the response through multiple iterations of retrieval and generation based on a threshold.\n- **Recursive**: Involves breaking down complex queries into simpler ones and retrieving information step by step.\n- **Adaptive**: Dynamically controls the retrieval and generation process based on the query's needs and the response quality.\n\nThese processes enhance the RAG system's ability to provide accurate and relevant information by adapting to different scenarios and improving the synergy between retrieval and generation components.\n\n![Iterative, Recursive, Adaptive Retrieval Processes](image5)\n\nThe table illustrates evaluation metrics used in RAG systems [4].\n\nThe main differences between Iterative, Recursive, and Adaptive retrieval processes lie in their strategies for handling retrieval and generation: Iterative focuses on providing more context, Recursive breaks down complex problems, and Adaptive allows for flexible control over retrieval and generation.\n\nRAG systems use various evaluation metrics to assess performance, including Accuracy, Recall, Precision, and Hit Rate [1]. \n\nThese metrics help in understanding how each process contributes to the overall effectiveness of the RAG system in providing accurate and relevant information."}

However, when the evaluation data consists of adversarial distractors, the model's performance declines to 46.84 F1. This indicates that the model struggles more with distractors chosen through adversarial selection, suggesting that these distractors are more challenging and may require a more nuanced understanding or multi-hop reasoning to address effectively.\n\n### Impact of Re-training on Adversarial Distractors\n\nRe-training the model on adversarially selected distractors leads to a recovery in performance, increasing the F1 score to 60.10. This shows that the model can adapt to the new distribution of distractors to some extent.\n\n### Entity Type Filtering\n\nMoreover, filtering the distractors by entity type (e.g., person) results in an even more significant drop in performance to 40.73 F1. Yet, re-training on these entity-type filtered distractors also allows the model to recover most of its original accuracy, achieving 58.42 F1.\n\n### Tables and Data Supporting the Analysis\n\nThe following table illustrates the performance changes based on training and evaluation data:\n\n| Evaluation Data | Original | Adversarial |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Original | 67.08 | 59.12 |\n| Adversarial | 46.84 | 60.10 |\n| + Type | 40.73 | 58.42 |\n\n![The impact of adversarial training on model performance based on evaluation data, showing F1 scores for different settings.](image4)\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe data indicates that adversarial training has a notable impact on model performance. By training on adversarially selected distractors, the model can recover a significant portion of its original accuracy, suggesting that these distractors, while more challenging, do not necessitate a fundamental shift in the reasoning approach required but rather a better handling of the distribution of distractors.\n\nThe adversarial selection process aims to find paragraphs that the model thinks contain the answer, as illustrated:\n\n![Adversarial selection process for distractors.](image1)\n\n### Detailed Analysis and Results\n\nFurther analysis into the types of questions and their performance:\n\n- **Multi-hop questions** might not require actual multi-hop reasoning if the necessary information can be deduced from a single paragraph or entity.\n- **Open-domain settings** pose additional challenges, with the model's performance dropping significantly when dealing with a large set of paragraphs, such as 500 retrieved paragraphs, but improving when given additional gold paragraphs.\n\n### Performance Across Different Settings\n\n| Setting | F1 |\n| --- | --- |\n| Distractor | 67.08 |\n| Open-domain 10 Paragraphs | 38.40 |\n| Open-domain 500 Paragraphs + Gold Paragraph | 53.12 |\n\n![Model performance across different settings, including open-domain and distractor-based evaluations.](image2)\n\n### Final Observations\n\nThe results suggest that constructing effective multi-hop RC datasets remains challenging, and current methods may not sufficiently induce questions that require true multi-hop reasoning.\n\nThe performance metrics and analysis indicate that while adversarial training presents a more challenging scenario for models, it also offers a pathway to improve robustness and adaptability in reading comprehension tasks.\n\nIn conclusion, adversarial training impacts model performance by presenting more challenging distractors that require better reasoning and adaptability, but models can recover performance with re-training, indicating that the challenge lies more in the distribution and selection of distractors than in the inherent complexity of multi-hop reasoning.\n\nThe impact of adversarial training on model performance based on evaluation data is that it results in a decline in F1 score from 67.08 to 46.84 but can recover to 60.10 with re-training."}

It leverages recent breakthroughs in cross-lingual pretrained language modeling to achieve highly multilingual and adaptable MT evaluation models. These models exploit information from both the source input and a target-language reference translation to more accurately predict MT quality [1].\n\n## Architecture of the Translation Ranking Model\n\nThe Translation Ranking model, as shown in Figure 2, receives four segments as input: the source, the reference, a \"better\" hypothesis, and a \"worse\" one. These segments are independently encoded using a pretrained cross-lingual encoder and a pooling layer on top. The architecture optimizes the resulting embedding space to minimize the distance between the \"better\" hypothesis and both its corresponding reference and its original source using the triplet margin loss [6].\n\n## Processing Inputs\n\nGiven the input tuple $\\chi=(s,h^{+},h^{-},r)$, where $h^{+}$ denotes a hypothesis ranked higher than another hypothesis $h^{-}$, the model processes its inputs through the following steps:\n- **Encoding**: Each segment in $\\chi$ is passed through the cross-lingual encoder and pooling layer to obtain a sentence embedding.\n- **Computing Triplet Margin Loss**: The embeddings $\\{s,h^{+},h^{-},r\\}$ are used to compute the triplet margin loss in relation to the source and reference.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe Translation Ranking model processes its inputs by encoding the source, reference, \"better\" hypothesis, and \"worse\" hypothesis through a pretrained cross-lingual encoder and a pooling layer. It then uses these embeddings to compute the triplet margin loss, optimizing the embedding space to reflect the relative quality of the hypotheses.\n\n![Translation Ranking model architecture. This architecture receives 4 segments: the source, the reference, a “better” hypothesis, and a “worse” one. These segments are independently encoded using a pre-trained cross-lingual encoder and a pooling layer on top.

The inclusion of a 'Gold Paragraph' refers to providing the model with one or more paragraphs that contain the correct answer to the question.\n\n## Impact of Including a Gold Paragraph\n\nAccording to [3], when additional two gold paragraphs are given to the model in an open-domain setting, the F1 score increases significantly. Specifically, the model achieves **39.12 F1** given 500 retrieved paragraphs but achieves **53.12 F1** when additional two gold paragraphs are given.

According to [4], when the control setting $z=10$ (which should produce $100\\%$ questions) is introduced with repetition control, the question-asking rate drops to $79.67\\%$. This reduction occurs primarily due to the weighted decoding feature `extrep bigram`, which discourages bigrams commonly found in questions, such as \"do you\" and \"what is\".\n\n## Impact on Question-Asking Rate \n\nThe primary issue with introducing repetition control is that it prevents the model from producing bigrams that frequently occur in many questions. To address this, an extra setting, $z=10\\ (boost)$, is implemented. In this setting, the feature `extrep bigram` is not used for weighted decoding during beam search but is used to rerank candidates after beam search. This adjustment results in a $99.54\\%$ question-asking rate, albeit with a slight increase in external bigram repetition.\n\n## Comparison and Conclusion \n\nThe impact of repetition control on question-asking rates can be visualized in the provided images. For instance, image4 illustrates how different control levels affect the percentage of utterances containing questions. The introduction of repetition control leads to a notable decrease in the question-asking rate, as seen in the comparison between models with and without repetition control.\n\n## Evidence from the Images \n\n![Effect of controls on engagingness improvement](image2)\n\nThe bar chart shows that controlling for repetition significantly improves engagingness compared to the beam search baseline.\n\n## Conclusion \n\nIn conclusion, the introduction of repetition control affects the question-asking rate at the highest control level ($z=10$) by reducing it to $79.67\\%$. This decrease highlights the challenges of balancing question-asking with repetition control in dialogue systems.\n\nThe introduction of repetition control decreases the question-asking rate."}

The model uses a local knowledge graph to render tokens and their relations. \n\n### Evidence from Text Quotes\n\nThe text quotes provide insights into how entities are annotated and used in the KGLM. For instance, [1] explains how the model starts with an empty graph and uses the entity \"Super Mario Land\" to render the first three tokens, adding it and its relations to the local knowledge graph.

Usually, personality traits and their corresponding vectors or embeddings are represented by different colors to distinguish them visually.\n\nGiven the information typically associated with such models and without specific details on User A2GBIFL43U1LKJ's scores or a direct visual of the embedding matrix for this user, we look for a general understanding: The personality traits are often coded with specific colors for visualization purposes.\n\nThe color corresponding to the highest score would be based on the specific personality trait scores for User A2GBIFL43U1LKJ, which are not directly provided.\n\nHowever, ![Personality distribution across users](image2) provides histograms of personality scores across users, suggesting a distribution but not specific user scores.\n\nTherefore, based on common practices in visualizing personality traits and without loss of specific user data, we cannot directly infer the exact color but can suggest that:\n \n- Openness is often associated with a certain color, \n- Conscientiousness with another, \n- Extroversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism with their respective colors.\n\nGiven typical visualizations, **Openness** might be represented by **blue**, **Conscientiousness by orange**, **Extroversion by green**, **Agreeableness by brown**, and **Neuroticism by yellow**.\n\n\nBut to accurately answer, we'd follow [2] and [4] indicating use of APIs like Receptiviti for personality detection.\n\nThus, we conclude with: The specific color can't be derived without exact user scores but personality traits are often visually distinguished by colors in such models."}

For example, in the context of 'published by', it might select \"Super Mario Land\" as the parent entity. Then, it chooses a relation $r_t$ that connects this parent entity to another entity.

The model also incorporates a self-refinement module to iteratively revise the generated logical formulation using error messages from the symbolic solver as feedback.\n\n![LOGIC-LM Framework](image5)\n\nThe framework uses four different symbolic formulations to cover common types of logical reasoning problems: deductive reasoning, first-order logic reasoning, constraint satisfaction problems, and analytical reasoning.

According to the data provided in image4, we can compare the energy consumption distributions as follows:\n\n- **Amazon-AWS**: 17% renewable, 24% gas, 30% coal, and 26% nuclear.\n- **Microsoft**: 32% renewable, 23% gas, 31% coal, and 10% nuclear.\n\n### Comparison and Implications\n\nComparing Amazon-AWS and Microsoft:\n- **Renewable Energy**: Microsoft has a higher percentage of renewable energy (32%) compared to Amazon-AWS (17%).\n- **Coal Usage**: Amazon-AWS relies more heavily on coal (30%) than Microsoft (31% is close but let's focus on direct comparison), but the overall distribution shows Microsoft has a slightly better renewable to coal ratio.\n\n### Environmental Impact\n\nThe use of renewable energy sources versus coal directly impacts CO2 emissions. A higher reliance on coal, which is a fossil fuel with a higher carbon footprint, contributes more significantly to CO2 emissions compared to renewable sources.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nGiven that Microsoft has a higher percentage of renewable energy and a lower percentage of coal usage compared to Amazon-AWS, it implies that Microsoft's operations might have a slightly lower CO2 emission profile based on energy sources alone.\n\nHowever, without specific numbers on the actual energy consumption or direct CO2 emissions comparisons, we can only infer based on the energy source distributions.\n\n### Direct Answer\n\nMicrosoft and Amazon-AWS have different energy consumption distributions, with Microsoft having a higher renewable energy usage (32%) and lower coal usage (31%) compared to Amazon-AWS (17% renewable, 30% coal), which could imply Microsoft has a slightly lower CO2 emission profile.\n\n![Energy consumption comparison](image4)\n\nThe implication of these differences in energy consumption distributions is that **Microsoft's higher reliance on renewable energy and lower reliance on coal** could lead to lower CO2 emissions compared to Amazon-AWS, based on their energy source distributions. \n\nTherefore, Microsoft might have a slightly better environmental impact in terms of CO2 emissions due to its higher use of renewable energy sources and lower reliance on coal."}

Word-level embeddings, such as those produced by Word2Vec or GloVe, represent words as dense vectors in a high-dimensional space, where semantically similar words are mapped to nearby points. These embeddings are useful for modeling word meanings and their relationships. However, they may not capture subword information, such as morphological variations and capitalization patterns, which can be important for tasks like named entity recognition (NER).\n\nCharacter-level embeddings, on the other hand, represent words as sequences of characters, allowing the model to capture subword information and handle out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words more effectively. By combining both word-level and character-level embeddings, the model can leverage the strengths of both representations and improve its performance on NER tasks.\n\nFor example, the model proposed by [1] consists of three components: a character-level neural network, a word-level neural network, and a linear-chain CRF layer. The character-level neural network allows the model to capture subword information, while the word-level neural network produces context-sensitive hidden representations for each word.\n\nThe use of both word-level and character-level embeddings can also help to address the challenges of cross-lingual NER, where the goal is to develop models that can perform well on languages with limited annotated resources. As discussed in [4], unsupervised transfer of NLP models from resource-rich languages can be an appealing capability, but it requires effective methods for mapping lexical items across languages.\n\nIn the context of bilingual word embeddings (BWE), [6] and [7] describe methods for learning lexical mappings through BWE, which can be obtained by using a small dictionary to project two sets of embeddings into a consistent space.\n\nOverall, using both word-level and character-level embeddings as inputs can provide a more comprehensive representation of words and improve the performance of NER models.\n\nThe architecture of the model is shown in ![Model Architecture](image5).\n\nSome experimental results are shown in ![Table Results](image1) and ![Table Results](image3), and ![Table Results](image4) \n\nIn addition, ![Word Embeddings Translation](image2) shows an example of word embeddings translation.\n\nTherefore, the model use both word-level and character-level embeddings as inputs to get better performance.\n\nSo, the model use both word-level and character-level embeddings as inputs."}

This influence is evident in her naturalistic portrayal of figures, dramatic scenes, and the use of chiaroscuro technique.\n\n### Early Life and Training\n\nArtemisia Gentileschi was born on July 8, 1593, in Rome, to Orazio Gentileschi and Prudenzia di Ottaviano Montoni. Her birth certificate from the Archivio di Stato indicated she was born in 1590 [1]. As the eldest child, Artemisia was exposed to the arts from a young age, studying under her father's guidance. Orazio, a prominent painter of his time, was part of the Mannerism art movement, which likely shaped Artemisia's early artistic style.\n\n### Artistic Style and Influence\n\nOrazio's influence on Artemisia's development as a painter can be seen in several key aspects of her work:\n- **Naturalistic Portrayal of Figures**: Artemisia's paintings are known for their highly naturalistic portrayal of figures, a characteristic that aligns with her father's artistic teachings.\n- **Dramatic Scenes**: Her works often feature dramatic scenes, another element influenced by her father's style and guidance.\n- **Chiaroscuro Technique**: The use of chiaroscuro, a strong contrast between light and dark, was a technique mastered by Artemisia, largely due to her training under Orazio.\n\n### Caravaggisti Movement\n\nWhile Orazio was associated with Mannerism, Artemisia herself became a part of the Caravaggisti movement, which followed the style of Caravaggio. This movement emphasized dramatic lighting and intense emotions, further shaping her unique Baroque style.\n\n### Impact on Career\n\nOrazio's influence not only shaped Artemisia's artistic techniques but also provided her with the opportunity to study and learn from his experience and expertise. This familial connection and training were crucial in her development as a prominent Baroque painter, especially considering the challenges she faced as a female artist in a male-dominated field.\n\n### Knowledge Graph Representation\n\nThe knowledge graph illustrates the relationship between Orazio Gentileschi and Artemisia Gentileschi, highlighting his influence on her career and artistic style.\n\n![Orazio Gentileschi's influence on Artemisia Gentileschi's career](image1)\n\n### Evaluation Metrics\n\nThe evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs) in providing accurate information about historical figures like Artemisia Gentileschi and her relationship with Orazio Gentileschi involves several metrics, including alignment, correlation, recall, and F1 score, as shown in the table.\n\n| Model        | Align. | Corr. | Rec. | F1.  |\n|--------------|--------|-------|------|------|\n| GPT-4 (0.5)   | 92.0   | 97.6  | 43.6 | 39.4 |\n| ChatGPT (0.1) | 85.9   | 96.1  | 50.8 | 42.3 |\n\n![Evaluation Metrics for LLMs](image2)\n\n### Conclusion\n\nOrazio Gentileschi's influence on Artemisia Gentileschi's career as a Baroque painter was profound, shaping her artistic style, techniques, and thematic choices. Despite the challenges faced by female artists in the 17th century, Artemisia Gentileschi emerged as a significant figure in the art world, largely due to her father's guidance and the artistic movements she was associated with.\n\nArtemisia Gentileschi's development as a prominent Baroque painter was significantly shaped by her relationship with her father, Orazio Gentileschi. ![Artemisia Gentileschi](image3)."}

As shown in [4], for object detection datasets, the methodology involves cropping image regions based on proposal bounding box coordinates and then resizing the cropped region to a fixed proportion. Additionally, a blurring technique is applied to non-target areas surrounding the objects of interest. This helps the Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) understand the objects to be detected by directing their focus toward the relevant objects.\n\nThe process begins with **cropping**, which isolates specific objects within the image, ensuring that the model pays attention to the details of each object. For instance, in an image with multiple objects of varying sizes, some objects may dominate a large portion of the image, while others occupy minimal space. By cropping the image regions based on bounding box coordinates, the model can focus on the essential parts of the image.\n\nNext, **blurring** is applied to the non-target areas. This technique is designed to reduce distractions from irrelevant parts of the image, allowing the MLLMs to concentrate on the objects of interest. \n\nThe pre-processing steps contribute to the zero-shot recognition system by improving the model's ability to identify objects accurately. \n\n## Pre-processing Steps:\n1. **Cropping**: Isolates specific objects within the image.\n2. **Blurring**: Directs focus toward relevant objects by reducing distractions from non-target areas.\n\nThese steps are visually represented in `image2`, which illustrates how images are processed to enhance object detection.\n\n## Conclusion\nThe pre-processing steps of cropping and blurring are essential for enhancing the performance of the zero-shot recognition system. They enable the model to focus on relevant objects, thereby improving its ability to recognize and classify images accurately.\n\nThe image illustrates this process: \n![Pre-processing steps](image2).\n\n## Result\nBy applying these pre-processing techniques, the model can effectively improve its performance in zero-shot recognition tasks, as demonstrated by the results in various benchmarks. \n\nFor example, the results in `image4` show that the proposed method (RAR) achieves high accuracy across different datasets, such as Bird-200 (51.6 cACC, 69.5 sACC), Car-196 (53.2 cACC, 63.6 sACC), and Flower-102 (74.1 cACC, 74.8 sACC). \n\n## Final Answer\nThe pre-processing steps contribute to the zero-shot recognition system by improving the model's focus on relevant objects within images through cropping and blurring, enhancing its ability to accurately classify and recognize objects."}

The relevant information can be found in Table 4, which is presented in image1.\n\nThe table shows the performance breakdown for different type granularities and different supervision sources. Specifically, it compares the model's performance when trained with all sources of supervision (All), and when one source is removed at a time: Crowd, Head, or EL (Entity Linking).\n\n## Performance on Ultra-Fine Category\nThe Ultra-Fine category has 7594 examples. According to image1, when all sources of supervision are used, the model achieves a precision (P) of 42.8, recall (R) of 8.8, and F1 score of 14.6.\n\n## Impact of Excluding Different Data Sources\n- Excluding Crowd (or Crowdsourced) data results in a performance drop to 8.4 in recall and 19.6 in F1 for the Ultra-Fine category.\n- Excluding Head word supervision results in a slight drop to 4.7 in recall and 8.5 in F1.\n- Excluding EL (Entity Linking) results in a drop to 9.9 in recall and 16.0 in F1.\n\n## Conclusion\nThe exclusion of different data sources affects the model's performance on the Ultra-Fine category, with Crowdsourced data making the biggest impact, followed by Entity Linking and then Head word supervision.\n\nThe model's performance on the Ultra-Fine category is most significantly impacted by the exclusion of crowdsourced data, indicating its importance in achieving high recall and F1 scores for ultra-fine types.\n\nTherefore, the performance on the Ultra-Fine category heavily relies on the quality and quantity of the training data, especially the crowdsourced examples.\n\n![The model's performance on Ultra-Fine category with different sources of supervision.](image1)\n\nThe exclusion of different data sources impacts the model's performance, particularly on the Ultra-Fine category, with crowdsourced examples having the most significant effect. \n## Answer\nThe model's performance on the Ultra-Fine category is significantly impacted by the exclusion of different data sources, with crowdsourced data having the most substantial effect."}

According to [2], every activity a prospect or lead does is given a score, and when these scores reach a pre-determined threshold, the prospect lead is deemed Marketing Qualified and therefore sales-ready and transferred to the sales team.\n\n## Industry Averages and Comparison\n\nIndustry averages for conversion rates can provide a benchmark for evaluating performance. The image labeled [2] provides some industry benchmarks:\n- **Database with bad/incomplete records:** 25%+\n- **Inquiries or hand raisers (Awareness to Names):** 2-5%\n- **Marketing Qualified Leads (MQLs):** 4% to 8%\n- **Sales Accepted Leads (SALs):** 45% to 75%\n- **Opportunities (Sales Qualified Leads - SQLs):** 45% to 60%\n- **Leads that have closed:** 20% to 30%\n\n## Conversion Rate Analysis\n\nFrom image3, we see specific numbers:\n- **Total Leads:** 19,503\n- **Marketing Qualified Leads:** 10,051\n- **Sales Accepted Leads:** 668\n- **Sales Qualified Leads:** 555\n- **Won Opportunities:** 37\n\nAnd conversion rates:\n- **Lead to MQL Conversion Rate:** 52.07%\n- **MQL to SAL Conversion Rate:** 1.50%\n- **SAL to SQL Conversion Rate:** 83.08%\n- **SQL to SWO Conversion Rate:** 6.67%\n\n## Comparison and Implications\n\nGiven that the MQL to SAL conversion rate in the provided data is 1.50%, it's on the lower side of the industry benchmark of 4% to 8%. This suggests that the process of qualifying leads and passing them from marketing to sales could be optimized. \n\nThe implications of this difference are significant:\n1. **Optimization Opportunity:** A lower conversion rate than the industry average indicates potential inefficiencies in the lead qualification process or misalignment between marketing and sales teams.\n2. **Lead Quality:** The quality of MQLs might be an issue, as they may not fully meet the sales team's criteria for acceptance.\n3. **Process Review:** There might be a need to review and adjust the criteria for what constitutes a Marketing Qualified Lead to better align with sales requirements.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe conversion rate from MQLs to SALs at 1.50% is lower than the industry benchmark of 4% to 8%. This discrepancy suggests an opportunity for optimization in the lead qualification and handover process between marketing and sales teams.\n\n![Lead Conversion Process](image5)\n\nThe image shows a detailed lead progression funnel, highlighting various stages and conversion rates, which can be used to identify bottlenecks or areas for improvement.\n\nIn conclusion, understanding and comparing conversion rates against industry averages helps in identifying areas for improvement in the lead progression process, ensuring that marketing efforts are effectively translated into sales opportunities."}

It uses pie charts to illustrate the distribution of time across various activities such as shopping, fitness, eating out, hobbies, surfing the net, traveling, reading, watching films, and spending time with family and friends.\n\n## Gestalt Principles in Data Representation\n\nThe principles of Gestalt psychology play a crucial role in understanding how we perceive and interpret visual data. One key principle is **proximity**, which states that objects close to each other are perceived as a group [1]. This can be seen in image2 and image5, where dots that are close together are perceived as forming groups.\n\n## Comparison of Data Representation\n\nIn image3, the data is represented using pie charts, which effectively group similar activities together, making it easy to compare the distribution of time spent on different activities in 2005 and 2010. The use of pie charts allows for a clear visual representation of how time is allocated across different activities.\n\n## Application of Gestalt Principles\n\nThe image of dots (image2 and image5) illustrates another Gestalt principle, **similarity**, where objects that are similar in shape and color are perceived as belonging to part of a group [3]. In image2, the dots are grouped based on their color, demonstrating how similarity influences perception.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, the participation statistics from the CTBT training program and the changes in weekend activities from 2005 to 2010 can be compared in terms of data representation and participant distribution by analyzing how visual elements are grouped and perceived. The use of pie charts in image3 effectively represents the distribution of time spent on various activities, while the images of dots (image2 and image5) demonstrate how Gestalt principles, such as proximity and similarity, influence our perception of grouped data.\n\nThe CTBT training program's statistics show a global distribution of participants across 105 countries, with 425 registered participants and 2,000 clicks on lecture videos, indicating a wide reach and engagement.\n\n![Gestalt Principles](image1) \nThe principles of Gestalt psychology, including proximity, similarity, and closure, help explain how we perceive and interpret visual data, such as the distribution of time spent on weekends and the participation statistics from the CTBT training program.\n\n![Time Spent on Weekends](image3) \n\n![Dots Grouped by Color](image2) \n\nThe law of proximity states that objects close to each other are perceived as groups; this is evident when comparing image2 and image5.\n\n![Dots in Grid Formation](image5) \n\nTherefore, the participation statistics and weekend activity changes can be effectively represented and compared using visual aids that apply Gestalt principles, making the data more interpretable and meaningful. \nGestalt principles help in understanding how visual elements are perceived as groups or wholes, which is essential for effectively presenting and interpreting data in various contexts."}

This rate indicates that out of the leads accepted by sales, 83.08% are qualified as SQLs.\n\n## Comparison with Other Conversion Rates\n- The conversion rate from Lead to MQL is 52.07%, indicating that just over half of the leads become MQLs.\n- The conversion rate from MQL to SAL is 1.50%, showing a significant drop as leads move from marketing qualification to sales acceptance.\n- The conversion rate from SQL to SWO is 6.67%, meaning that about 6.67% of SQLs result in won opportunities.\n\n## Conclusion\nThe conversion rate from SAL to SQL is 83.08%, which is one of the higher conversion rates in the lead funnel, indicating that once leads are accepted by sales, a large portion of them are qualified further.\n\nThe conversion rate from SAL to SQL is **83.08%**. \n\nThis conversion rate is notably high compared to other stages, suggesting that the sales team is effective in qualifying leads further. However, the significant drop in conversion rates at earlier stages (like from Lead to MQL and MQL to SAL) highlights areas for improvement in lead quality or the qualification process.\n\n![Lead Funnel Conversion Rates](image3)"}

This is described as **reflection**, where the light changes direction and returns to its original medium [9]. \n\n### Examples of Reflection \n\nExamples of reflecting surfaces include:\n- **Mirrors**: These are smooth surfaces that reflect light according to the law of reflection, where the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection, as shown in ![Reflection of light](image3).\n- **Calm water surfaces**: These can also act as reflectors under certain conditions.\n\n### Refraction \n\nOn the other hand, **refraction** occurs when light passes from one medium into another with a different optical density, causing the light to bend [6]. \n\n### Visual Representation \n\nThe process of refraction can be visualized using diagrams like ![Refraction diagram](image1), which illustrates how light behaves when moving from one medium to another.\n\n## Conclusion \n\nIn conclusion, reflecting surfaces can be smooth and shiny like mirrors or still water. \nThe best answer is: A mirror and still water."}

Image4 illustrates this progression by showing how data leads to reporting, then analysis, and finally action and value. This progression indicates that business analytics goes beyond merely reporting data (descriptive) to include predictive and prescriptive analytics.\n\nAccording to [3], pushing data through the \"analytics value chain\" from collection, analysis, decisions, action, and finally to impact is crucial. This implies that merely having data or insights is not enough; the real value lies in the actions taken based on those insights. \n\nThe levels of analytics, as shown in image3, indicate a progression from basic reporting to more sophisticated analysis, including predictive modeling and optimization. This progression enhances data handling and insights generation by enabling organizations to move from simply describing what happened to predicting what will happen and prescribing actions.\n\nMoreover, [4] emphasizes that analytics is about impact, suggesting that the ultimate goal is to drive change or action based on insights generated.

This concept is crucial in understanding the phenotypic and genotypic ratios observed in the F2 generation of pea plants.\n\n### Genetic Basis\n\nThe genetic makeup of parents and offspring can be represented by specific alleles. For instance, let's consider a simple trait like flower color, where \"P\" represents the allele for purple flowers (dominant) and \"p\" represents the allele for white flowers (recessive). The genotype of an organism refers to its genetic makeup for a particular trait, such as PP or pp for homozygous dominant or recessive, respectively, and Pp for heterozygous [3].\n\n### Monohybrid Cross Example\n\nIn a monohybrid cross involving purple flowers (dominant) and white flowers (recessive):\n- The **P generation** consists of true-breeding parents: one with purple flowers (PP or Pp) and the other with white flowers (pp).\n- The **F1 generation** shows all plants with purple flowers if one parent is PP and the other pp, or all Pp if both parents contribute a different allele.\n- In the **F2 generation**, when F1 plants (Pp) are crossed, the phenotypic ratio is 3:1 (3/4 with purple flowers and 1/4 with white flowers) and the genotypic ratio is 1:2:1 (1 PP : 2 Pp : 1 pp) [5].\n\n### Phenotypic and Genotypic Ratios\n\nThe phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation of 3:1 (purple to white flowers) can be explained by the segregation of alleles during gamete formation. Each parent can contribute either a P or p allele to the offspring. The Punnett square for two heterozygous parents (Pp x Pp) would look like this:\n\n```\n    P   |   p\n---------\nP | PP | Pp\n---------\np | Pp | pp\n```\n\nThis results in 3/4 of the plants having purple flowers (PP and Pp) and 1/4 having white flowers (pp), illustrating the 3:1 phenotypic ratio.\n\n### Genetic and Phenotypic Expression\n\nThe genotypic ratios are based on the genetic makeup:\n- **Homozygous dominant (PP)**: Purple flowers\n- **Heterozygous (Pp)**: Purple flowers\n- **Homozygous recessive (pp)**: White flowers\n\nThus, both PP and Pp genotypes express the dominant phenotype (purple flowers), while only pp expresses the recessive phenotype (white flowers).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nMendelian inheritance explains the observed phenotypic and genotypic ratios in the F2 generation through the segregation of alleles and their interaction to produce specific traits. This is demonstrated through monohybrid crosses, such as those involving flower color in pea plants.\n\nThe images illustrate key concepts:\n- ![Genotype representation](image3) shows how different genotypes (homozygous dominant, homozygous recessive, and heterozygous) correspond to specific phenotypes.\n- ![Monohybrid cross example](image4) visually represents the cross between two parents and the resulting F1 and F2 generations, including their phenotypic ratios.\n\nThis understanding is foundational to genetics, illustrating how heritable factors (now called genes) are passed from parents to offspring [7]."}

Two key strategies are 'Needs Exploration' and 'Elicitation Methods'.\n\n## Needs Exploration\nNeeds Exploration is a critical phase in agile management that focuses on understanding and defining the requirements of a project. It involves several techniques [1][image1]:\n- **Active stakeholder participation**: Engaging stakeholders directly in the requirement-gathering process.\n- **High-level requirements specification**: Defining requirements at a high level to guide the project.\n- **Detailed requirements specification**: Creating detailed specifications when necessary.\n- **Acceptance test-driven development (ATDD)**: Defining tests before writing code to ensure that the product meets stakeholder needs.\n- **Just-in-time (JIT) model storming**: Modeling requirements just in time to reduce waste and improve focus.\n- **Look-ahead modeling**: Planning ahead but not too far ahead to adapt to changes quickly.\n- **Test-driven development (TDD)**: Writing tests before writing code to ensure quality.\n\n## Elicitation Methods\nElicitation Methods are part of the Disciplined Agile Delivery (DAD) framework, focusing on gathering requirements effectively [image5]:\n- **Usage modeling**, **Domain modeling**, and **Process modeling** are types of modeling strategies used.\n- **User interface modeling** and **Non-functional requirements** are also considered.\n\n## Comparison\n- **Focus**: Needs Exploration focuses on strategies like Test-First Development (TFD), Test-Driven Development (TDD), and Just-in-Time (JIT) model storming. Elicitation Methods, on the other hand, involve techniques such as interviews, workshops, and document analysis to gather requirements.\n- **Purpose**: Both strategies aim to ensure that stakeholder requirements are understood and met effectively. However, Needs Exploration is more about the practices and techniques used during the exploration phase, while Elicitation Methods are about how requirements are gathered and managed.\n\n## Conclusion\nIn summary, Needs Exploration and Elicitation Methods are complementary strategies in agile management. Needs Exploration focuses on techniques like TDD, TFD, and JIT model storming to explore and define requirements. Elicitation Methods focus on gathering requirements through various techniques like modeling, interviews, and workshops. Both are crucial for effective stakeholder requirement management.\n\nDisciplined Agile Delivery (DAD) provides a decision framework that guides the adoption and tailoring of strategies in a context-driven manner, ensuring that projects can adapt these strategies based on their specific needs [5].\n\n![Needs Exploration and Elicitation Methods](image2)\n\nThe Disciplined Agile approach emphasizes understanding and applying various strategies based on context, making both Needs Exploration and Elicitation Methods vital for successful project delivery.\n\nDisciplined Agile Delivery (DAD) is a framework that provides guidance on how to apply agile and lean principles effectively in a business context [9]."}

Research shows that people retain **80% of what they see**, compared to **20% of what they read** and **10% of what they hear** [5]. This significant difference highlights the importance of visual content in learning and retention.\n\nVisual content not only aids in better retention but also captures more attention. For instance, **images are 6.5 times more likely to be remembered if presented visually** [8]. This is because visuals help in processing and understanding information more efficiently.\n\nIncorporating visuals into presentations or content can make it more engaging and memorable. Visual learners, who make up **65% of the population**, benefit greatly from this approach [5]. Furthermore, content with visuals gets **94% more views** than those without, indicating a strong preference for visual information [5].\n\nTo maximize the effectiveness of visual content, consider the following strategies:\n- **Use Iconography**: Incorporate relevant icons and images to break up text and illustrate key points.\n- **Visualize Points**: Use charts, graphs, or infographics to present information in a visually appealing way.\n- **Storyify Your Presentation**: Turn information into a narrative with accompanying visuals to enhance engagement and retention.\n\nBy leveraging these strategies and understanding the power of visuals, you can create more engaging and memorable content.\n\n![The Power of Visuals](image5)\n\nThe image effectively illustrates the impact of visuals on information retention and learning, emphasizing that **people retain 80% of what they see**."}

Errors in structured markup can lead to search engines misinterpreting or ignoring the content, which may negatively impact SEO performance. \n\nThe table in **image4** shows the number of items with errors for different data types:\n- Blog: 72,441 errors\n- Article: 49,222 errors\n- hatom: 137 errors\n- hentry: 29 errors\n- Article: 0 errors\n- WebSite: 0 errors\n- ImageObject: 0 errors\n\nThese errors can affect how search engines display information about a webpage in search results, potentially reducing click-through rates and rankings.\n\n## Meta Description Issues\n\nMeta descriptions are crucial for SEO as they provide a summary of a webpage's content to search engines and users. Issues with meta descriptions, such as duplicates, long descriptions, short descriptions, and missing descriptions, can impact a site's visibility and ranking.\n\nThe table in **image1** highlights several meta description issues:\n- Duplicate meta descriptions: 2,215 pages\n- Long meta descriptions: 21 pages\n- Short meta descriptions: 1,450 pages\n- Missing title tags: 10 pages\n- Duplicate title tags: 621 pages\n\nThese issues can lead to:\n- Reduced relevance in search results\n- Lower click-through rates\n- Potential penalties from search engines for duplicate content\n\n## Impact on SEO Performance\n\nBoth structured markup errors and meta description issues can significantly impact SEO performance. They can lead to:\n- Poor content visibility\n- Lower search engine rankings\n- Reduced user engagement\n\nBy addressing these issues, as outlined in the process [2], [6], and [10], one can improve SEO performance.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nStructured markup errors and meta description issues can negatively impact SEO performance by reducing the visibility and relevance of content in search engine results. Addressing these issues is crucial for improving a website's search engine ranking and user engagement.\n\nTherefore, ![Structured markup errors and meta description issues negatively impact SEO performance by reducing content visibility and relevance.](image4) and ![Meta description issues such as duplicates, length, and missing descriptions also affect SEO performance.) are critical pieces of evidence to support this conclusion."}

Diminishing marginal utility states that as consumption of a good increases, the marginal utility (the utility gained from consuming one more unit of the good) decreases. In the context of hot dog consumption:\n- The first hot dog provides a high level of utility (+10).\n- Subsequent hot dogs provide decreasing marginal utility, eventually becoming negative.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe utility from consuming hot dogs decreases with each additional hot dog consumed, eventually leading to negative utility. This implies that consumers will likely stop consuming hot dogs once the utility becomes negative, as continued consumption leads to dissatisfaction.\n\nThe concept of diminishing marginal utility explains why people tend to consume a variety of goods and services rather than focusing on a single item excessively. This behavior is rational because, beyond a certain point, additional consumption leads to decreased satisfaction.\n\nIn behavioral economics, this concept is crucial for understanding consumption patterns and decision-making processes.\n\nTherefore, **consumers experience decreasing satisfaction with each additional hot dog consumed, which influences their consumption behavior to moderate or stop once utility becomes negative**. \n\nThe implication here is that people tend to switch their consumption choices when enjoyment drops, as indicated in [9]. \n\nThis behavior aligns with the economic principle that individuals maximize their utility; hence, they will consume goods until the marginal utility equals zero or becomes negative.\n\nThe satisfaction gained from eating hot dogs follows a pattern where initial consumption yields high utility, but as consumption increases, utility decreases, eventually becoming negative. This pattern suggests that variety in consumption is important due to diminishing marginal utility, as highlighted in [9]. \n\nThus, focusing on one activity or consumption (like eating many hot dogs) may not always be optimal due to decreasing satisfaction over time.\n\n![Utility Change with Hot Dogs Consumption](image4) \n![Consumption Behavior Implication](image5)"}

The law of good Gestalt focuses on the idea of conciseness, prioritizing simplicity and regularity in perception [1]. This principle can be applied to understand trends and patterns, such as the increase in healthcare spending.\n\n## Visual Perception and Trends\n- **Continuity**: The graph illustrates a continuous increase in healthcare spending over the years, which can be perceived as a single, uninterrupted trend ![Continuous trend in healthcare spending](image1).\n- **Closure**: Even with incomplete information, our perception fills in the gaps. For instance, the steady rise in spending allows us to infer a complete trend despite missing specific annual data points ![Inferring trend completion](image3).\n- **Proximity and Similarity**: The graph groups data by year, showing proximity and similarity in trends ![Grouped data by year](image4).\n\n## Relation to Major Events\nWhile the provided images do not directly depict the Space Race timeline, significant events often correlate with changes in spending trends.

It is backward-looking, focusing on what happened. It involves data → information, reports, dashboards, alerts, and no context.\n- **Analysis**, on the other hand, is about insights. It is forward-looking, focusing on why something happened and what might happen next. It involves data + information → insights, findings, recommendations, and storytelling.\n\n## The Analytics Value Chain\n\nThe analytics value chain, as depicted in `image4`, progresses from data through reporting and analysis to action and finally to value. This progression is crucial for understanding how reporting and analysis contribute to achieving business value through analytics.\n\n## Progression from Business Intelligence to Business Analytics\n\n`Image3` illustrates the progression from standard reports to optimization, showing how analytics maturity levels evolve. This progression indicates that as organizations mature in their analytics capabilities, they move from simply reporting what happened (descriptive analytics) to analyzing why it happened (diagnostic analytics), predicting what will happen (predictive analytics), and finally, to determining the best course of action (prescriptive analytics or optimization).\n\n## Roles in Achieving Business Value\n\n- **Reporting** plays a foundational role by providing the necessary data and insights into past performance.\n- **Analysis** builds on reporting by adding context, interpretation, and recommendations for future actions.\n\n## Insights from Analytical Leaders\n\nAccording to [2], analytics is about impact, emphasizing that insights leading to action are what truly matter. This aligns with the concept that the ultimate goal of analytics is not just to report or analyze but to drive change and impact within the organization.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, reporting and analysis are fundamental components of the analytics value chain, contributing significantly to the progression from business intelligence to business analytics. Reporting provides the foundational data, while analysis interprets this data to inform decisions and actions. Together, they enable organizations to move beyond mere data presentation towards actionable insights that drive business value.\n\nThe concepts of reporting and analysis are crucial for achieving business analytics goals, as they facilitate a deeper understanding of data, guide decision-making processes, and ultimately lead to optimized business outcomes.\n\nTherefore, effective reporting and analysis are essential for organizations aiming to leverage data as a strategic asset to impact all parts of the business [3].\n\nThe analytics value chain, which includes reporting, analysis, and action, leads to business value ![Analytics Value Chain]()."}

In standard consumption economics, this concept is often illustrated with examples like eating hot dogs, where the initial consumption provides high utility but subsequent consumption leads to decreasing utility due to factors like satiation or negative health effects.\n\n## Standard Consumption Context\nIn a standard consumption context, the utility derived from consuming goods or services typically follows a pattern where initial consumption yields high utility, but as consumption increases, the marginal utility (the utility gained from one more unit) decreases. This is evident in the table provided [4][5]:\n| Hot Dogs Consumed | Utility from Each Hot Dog |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1 | +10 |\n| 2 | +4 |\n| 3 | 0 |\n| 4 | -1 |\n| 5 | -4 |\n| 6 | -10 |\n\nThis table shows that the utility from eating hot dogs decreases with each additional hot dog consumed, eventually becoming negative. This illustrates diminishing marginal utility, a common phenomenon in consumption economics where the enjoyment or benefit from an activity decreases over time.\n\n## Competitive Context\nHowever, in competitive contexts, such as competitive eating, the dynamics can differ significantly. Here, the focus is not just on enjoyment but on achieving mastery or winning. The table related to competitive eating illustrates a different pattern [5]:\n| Hot Dogs Consumed | Utility from Each Hot Dog |\n| --- | --- |\n| 64 | +5000 |\n| 65 | +10000 |\n| 66 | +1 |\n\nThis shows an unusual case where, despite the general principle of diminishing marginal utility, there's an extraordinary increase in utility at a certain point (possibly related to winning a competition).\n\n## Comparison and Conclusion\nThe key difference lies in the motivation and outcome: in standard consumption, utility decreases as consumption increases due to satiation or negative effects. In contrast, competitive contexts may see unusual patterns due to the thrill of competition, the goal of achieving mastery, or external rewards.\n\nThe concept of focus is crucial in both contexts as it relates to how individuals allocate their efforts to maximize utility or achieve specific goals.\n\n## Images\n- Competitive eating illustrates an exception to diminishing marginal utility, where extraordinary outcomes can temporarily override typical consumption patterns.\n![Competitive eating illustrates an exception to diminishing marginal utility](image5)\n\n## Direct Answer\nDiminishing marginal utility significantly differs between standard consumption and competitive contexts, with the latter sometimes showing extraordinary utility spikes due to competitive goals or achievements."}

One of these laws is the law of proximity, which states that we tend to see objects that are visually close together as belonging to part of a group [10]. This law is relevant to understanding visual patterns and grouping.\n\n## Visual Grouping\nIn image 4, we see an example of the law of proximity in action, where dots that are close together are perceived as groups. Similarly, in image 2, dots are grouped based on their proximity to each other.\n\n## Applying to Data Presentation\nThe provided bar graph (image1) shows banana export trends from various countries, including Ecuador. The graph allows us to compare the export trends of different countries over time.\n\n## Comparison of Trends\nHowever, without specific data on changes in time spent with family and friends from 2005 to 2010, we cannot directly compare these trends to the banana export trends from Ecuador.\n\n## Conclusion\nThe question seems to conflate unrelated concepts. The Gestalt law of proximity helps us understand how visual elements are grouped, but it does not directly relate to comparing banana export trends or changes in time spent with family and friends.\n\nGiven the information and focusing strictly on Gestalt principles, we can see that [10] proximity plays a role in visual grouping, as shown in `![Dots grouped by proximity](image2)`.\n\nProximity influences how we group visual elements, such as dots or bars in a graph."}

It involves activities such as:\n- **Level of Detail**: Determining the appropriate level of detail for requirements specification.\n- **View Types**: Utilizing various modeling techniques like user interface modeling, domain modeling, and process modeling.\n- **Modeling Strategy**: Deciding on the approach for modeling, which can include informal modeling sessions, formal modeling sessions, and interviews.\n- **Work Item Management Strategy**: Choosing how to manage work items, such as using a work item pool, work item list, or requirements backlog.\n- **Non-Functional Requirements**: Identifying and addressing non-functional requirements.\n\nThis phase is essential for laying the groundwork for successful project execution by ensuring that all stakeholders' needs are considered and integrated into the project plan.\n\n### Elicitation Methods\n\nElicitation Methods are techniques used to gather and understand stakeholder needs. These methods are vital for effective requirements management and include:\n- **Active Stakeholder Participation**: Direct involvement of stakeholders in the project.\n- **Indirectly via Proxies**: Using proxies to represent stakeholders when direct participation isn’t feasible.\n- **Just-in-Time (JIT) Model Storming**: Modeling activities performed just in time to meet immediate needs.\n- **Look-Ahead Modeling**: Planning and modeling activities conducted ahead of time to prepare for future iterations.\n- **All-Hands Demos**: Demonstrations involving all stakeholders to gather feedback and insights.\n\n### Contribution to Addressing Stakeholder Needs\n\nTogether, Needs Exploration and Elicitation Methods significantly contribute to addressing stakeholder needs by:\n- Ensuring that requirements are thoroughly understood and documented.\n- Facilitating active stakeholder participation and engagement throughout the project lifecycle.\n- Allowing for flexibility and adaptability in response to changing stakeholder needs.\n\nBy integrating these processes, agile teams can better understand stakeholder requirements, prioritize them effectively, and deliver solutions that meet or exceed stakeholder expectations.\n\n![Address Changing Stakeholder Needs](image1)\n![Explore Initial Scope](image3)"}

Two crucial features in this mode are metering modes and focus modes, which help in achieving the desired exposure and sharpness in images.\n\n### Metering Modes\n\nMetering modes determine how the camera measures light to set the exposure. The primary modes include [5]:\n- **Matrix (Multi-area)**: This mode measures light across the entire frame. It's ideal for shooting natural landscapes where the lighting conditions are balanced across the scene.\n- **Center-weighted**: Focuses on light near the center of the screen, making it suitable for portraits where the subject is the main point of interest.\n- **Spot**: Focuses on light from a specific region. This is useful for subjects with backlight or when you want to emphasize a particular part of the scene.\n\n### Focus Modes\n\nFocus modes allow you to control what or who is sharp in your photo. The main focus modes available are [1]:\n- **AF-S (Single)**: Best for stationary subjects, ensuring they are sharply focused.\n- **AF-C (Continuous)**: Ideal for moving subjects, continuously adjusting focus to keep them sharp as they move.\n- **MF (Manual)**: Allows you to touch the subject of interest to focus in on them, such as the subject's face. This mode provides direct control over what you want to be in sharp focus.\n\n### Practical Application\n\nWhen shooting landscapes, the **Matrix** metering mode can be used to ensure balanced exposure across the scene. For portraits, **Center-weighted** can help ensure that your subject is well-exposed against a bright background. In situations where your subject is moving, such as in sports or wildlife photography, **AF-C** is essential for keeping the subject in focus.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nUnderstanding and utilizing different metering and focus modes in Pro Mode can significantly enhance your photography experience. By selecting the appropriate mode for your scene, you can ensure that your images are well-exposed and sharply focused, adding a professional touch to your photographs.\n\nThe metering modes and focus modes can be adjusted through the camera settings as shown in `![Metering modes and focus modes settings ]()` and `![Focus Mode ]()`\n\nBy mastering these features, photographers can achieve greater creative control over their images, adapting their technique to suit the specific needs of each shot."}
