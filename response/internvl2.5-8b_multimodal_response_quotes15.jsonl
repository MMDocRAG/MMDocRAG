While roughly a quarter of those ages 18 to 29 see China as a partner, only 6% of those 50 and older say the same. Conversely, older Americans are nearly three times as likely as their younger counterparts to see China as an enemy.\n\n5. **Recent Changes**:\n   - Negative views of China have increased by 7 percentage points over the last four months alone and have shot up 26 points since 2018. The percent who say they have a very unfavorable view of China is also at a record high of 42%, having nearly doubled since the spring of 2019.\n\n#### Image Evidence\n- **Image 1**: Shows the percentage of Americans with unfavorable and favorable views of China across different age groups and political affiliations.

Younger, higher-income, and more highly educated seniors use the internet and broadband at rates approaching or even exceeding the general population. However, usage rates among seniors still trail the population as a whole by a substantial margin. For instance, 59% of seniors use the internet, compared to 86% of all U.S. adults. Broadband adoption among older adults has more than doubled over a five-year period, from 19% in 2008 to 47% in 2012. Despite these increases, certain subgroups of older adults, such as those 80 years or older, those with low household incomes, and those who have not attended college, tend to be much more removed from online life. For example, only 21% of seniors aged 80 or older have broadband at home, compared to 82% of all adults in the same age group."}

Seniors with higher incomes and higher education levels tend to have higher adoption rates. For example, 90% of seniors with an annual household income of $75,000 or more go online, and 82% have broadband at home. In contrast, only 39% of seniors with an annual household income of less than $30,000 go online, and 25% have broadband at home. Similarly, seniors with a college degree have higher adoption rates, with 87% going online and 76% having broadband at home, compared to 40% of seniors who have not attended college and 27% of those with an annual household income of less than $30,000.\n\nCell phone adoption rates among seniors are also higher among those with higher incomes and education levels. For instance, 91% of all Americans own a cell phone, but only 69% of seniors did so in April 2012. However, cell phone adoption has increased significantly, with 77% of seniors now owning a cell phone, compared to 69% in April 2012. Among the oldest seniors (80 years of age or older), 61% own a cell phone, which is a significant increase from the 37% who used the internet.\n\nSmartphone adoption rates among seniors are much lower, with only 18% of seniors being smartphone adopters, which is well below the national adoption rate of 55%. However, smartphone adoption has been growing at a relatively modest pace."}

Workers with higher levels of education, such as college graduates, are more likely to view these technologies positively, finding them more interesting and beneficial for career advancement. In contrast, those with lower educational levels, like high school graduates, are less likely to see these technologies in a positive light. This disparity is evident in the survey findings, where 64% of college graduates feel their work has become more interesting due to technology, compared to only 38% of high school graduates. Additionally, 53% of college graduates believe technology has increased their opportunities for career advancement, while only 32% of high school graduates share this view.\n\nRegarding expectations for driverless car technology, a substantial majority of Americans anticipate its widespread adoption in the coming decades. Approximately 94% of Americans are aware of the development of driverless vehicles, and roughly two-thirds expect most vehicles to be driverless within the next half-century. Among these, 9% predict this will occur in the next 10 years. This widespread anticipation reflects a significant shift in societal expectations towards automation and its integration into daily life.\n\nIn summary, educational attainment plays a crucial role in shaping perceptions of workforce technologies, with higher education levels generally leading to more positive views.

Nearly eight-in-ten Republicans and Republican leaners (79%) say that his economic policies had improved conditions in the country (up from 63% in October 2017). Democrats and Democratic leaners, by contrast, have grown more negative in their views of Trump’s economic policies. Almost half (46%) of Democrats now say his economic policies have worsened conditions in the country. Positive views of economic conditions are buoyed by Republicans and Republican-leaning independents: 75% rate economic conditions as excellent or good. These ratings are little changed over the past year; Republican views of the economy have been much more positive since Trump’s election. As is the case with other economic measures, there is a sizable partisan gap in views of job availability. Currently, 71% of Republicans say there are plenty of jobs available, compared with 53% of Democrats. In October 2017, 58% of Republicans and 47% of Democrats viewed jobs as widely available locally.](image1)\n\nPerceptions of job availability are divided along partisan lines, with 71% of Republicans and 53% of Democrats saying there are plenty of jobs available locally.

White Democrats support it at 54%, while Black, Hispanic, and Asian Democrats support it more at 65%, 72%, and 71% respectively. Republicans strongly favor it at 81%, compared to only 30% of Democrats. This indicates a clear partisan divide, with Republicans being more supportive of photo identification requirements.

White adults support these policies at 53%, while Black, Hispanic, and Asian adults support them more at 66%, 75%, and 79% respectively. This suggests that while there is some racial variation, the support for these policies is generally higher across all racial groups compared to photo identification requirements.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nRacial and political affiliations play a crucial role in shaping opinions on photo identification requirements and voting accessibility policies.

Black STEM employees are especially likely to report experiencing racial/ethnic discrimination at work, with 62% of blacks in STEM jobs reporting this compared to 44% of Asians and 42% of Hispanics [3]. This is higher than the 13% of whites who report experiencing discrimination [3]. Gender-based discrimination is also prevalent, with 50% of women in STEM jobs reporting experiencing any of eight forms of discrimination due to their gender, compared to 19% of men in STEM jobs [6]. Women in STEM jobs are more likely to experience workplace discrimination than men, with 50% of women reporting experiencing discrimination compared to 19% of men [6]. The most common forms of gender discrimination experienced by women in STEM jobs include earning less than a man doing the same job (29%), being treated as if they were not competent (29%), experiencing repeated, small slights in their workplace (20%), and receiving less support from senior leaders than a man doing the same job (18%) [6].

Empirically, Figure 2 reveals that the class distribution in the selected query is highly unbalanced. These active querying strategies (e.g., Entropy, Margin, VAAL, etc.) can barely outperform random sampling at the beginning because some classes are simply not selected for training. It is because data of the minority classes occurs much less frequently than those of the majority classes. Moreover, datasets in practice are often highly unbalanced, particularly in medical images [32, 58]. This can escalate the biased sampling. We hypothesize that the label diversity of a query is an important criterion to determine the importance of the annotation. To evaluate this hypothesis theoretically, we explore the upper bound performance by enforcing a uniform distribution using ground truth (Table 1) To evaluate this hypothesis practically, we pursue the label diversity by exploiting the pseudo-labels generated by K-means clustering (Table 2). The label diversity can reduce the redundancy in the selection of majority classes, and increase the diversity by including data of minority classes.\"\n\n2. **Image Quote [image1]:** The bar chart in Figure 2 shows the class distribution of randomly queried samples, which is highly unbalanced compared to other active querying strategies. This indicates that random sampling tends to select data that is biased towards specific classes, leading to poor label diversity.\n\n3. **Text Quote [9]:** \"We compare the results of CIFAR-10-LT with MedMNIST datasets.

This encoding captures the meaning of the user's input.\n\n2. **Dialogue State Tracking**: The encoded user input is then used to update the dialogue state, which maintains a continuous representation of the conversation. This state includes the user's goals and the context of the conversation.\n\n3. **Query Formulation**: Based on the dialogue state, the system formulates a query command. This command is used to retrieve information from a knowledge base (KB).\n\n4. **Knowledge Base Interaction**: The system sends symbolic queries to the KB, which returns a ranked list of entities. The ranking of these entities is handled by an external recommender system, considering features like user profiles and context.\n\n5. **Policy Network**: The system uses a policy network to determine the next system action based on the dialogue state, the estimated user goal values, and the encoding of the query results.\n\n6. **Natural Language Generation**: The system action is used to produce a system response in natural language format. This is done by combining the state tracker outputs and the retrieved KB entities. The response is generated using a template-based natural language generator (NLG), where delexicalized tokens in the template are replaced with the values from the user goal values or the KB entities.\n\n7. **Final Response**: The final natural language system response is produced and communicated to the user.\n\n![End-to-End Task-Oriented Dialogue System](image1)\n\nThis process ensures that the system can understand the user's request, retrieve relevant information, and generate a coherent and contextually appropriate response."}

According to the table provided, the model achieves the highest AP when using learned positional encodings in both the encoder and decoder, with a slight drop in AP when these encodings are only passed in the decoder. The use of spatial positional encodings in the decoder leads to a minor AP drop, while not using spatial positional encodings in the encoder results in a minor AP drop. The learned output positional encodings are essential and cannot be removed, as removing them leads to a more significant AP drop. The combination of fixed and learned encodings also shows that learned encodings provide better performance compared to fixed ones. The model's ability to generalize to unseen numbers of instances is also tested, and it is found that the model can find all instances in a synthetic image, indicating strong generalization capabilities.\n\nIn summary, the use of learned positional encodings in both the encoder and decoder, along with learned output positional encodings, is crucial for achieving high AP in the DETR-DC5 model.

The model's performance is particularly notable in document classification, where it outperforms other models, including SciBERT, with an F1 score of 86.4 on the MeSH (MAG) dataset. However, adding authors as an input to the model results in a decrease in performance, as many author names are out-of-vocabulary for SciBERT, leading to noisy correlations. Including venues slightly decreases performance, except on document classification, which aligns with the expectation that venues have high correlation with paper topics. The model's versatility is highlighted by its ability to function without inputs like authors or venues, making it applicable in situations where such metadata is not available, such as matching reviewers with anonymized submissions or recommending anonymized preprints. The comparison with SciBERT shows that SPECTER embeddings are better at encoding topical information, as evidenced by the more compact clusters in the embedding space. The model also outperforms all other models on the recommendation task, with an nDCG of 53.9. The inclusion of hard negative distractors in the citation-based fine-tuning objective is crucial, as using only easy negatives reduces performance on all tasks. The use of a strong general-domain language model like BERT-Large instead of SciBERT in SPECTER reduces performance considerably, as SciBERT is pretrained on scientific text.

According to the text quotes, the best performance for both tasks is achieved on the second iteration (N=2 for CorefProp and M=2 for RelProp) [2][4]. This indicates that increasing the number of iterations can improve the model's performance.\n\nThe impact of the number of entities in a sentence on the relation F1 score is also shown in the image quotes. The graph in image4 demonstrates that the relation F1 score decreases as the number of entities in a sentence increases. This suggests that the model's performance in relation extraction may degrade with more entities in a sentence.\n\nIn summary, increasing the number of iterations in CorefProp and RelProp generally improves the F1 scores for both entity and relation extraction, while the number of entities in a sentence negatively affects the relation F1 score.\n\n![CorefProp and RelProp iterations effect on F1 scores](image2)\n\n![Relation F1 score vs. number of entities](image4)"}

According to the text and image evidence:\n\n1. **Coreference Propagation (CorefProp):**\n   - **Effect on Entity Extraction:** CorefProp has a significant impact on entity extraction, particularly in sentences with multiple entities. As shown in Figure 3a, the best performance for entity extraction is achieved on the second iteration (N=2) [2].\n   - **Effect on Relation Extraction:** CorefProp appears to hurt relation extraction, as observed in the ACE05 dataset [3]. This is evident from the confusion matrix in Table 8, where frequent confusions with pronouns (GPE/PER and PER/ORG) are noted, though the benefit extends to most categories [6].\n\n2. **Relation Propagation (RelProp):**\n   - **Effect on Entity Extraction:** Relation propagation does not significantly affect entity extraction, as indicated by the small difference in confusion matrix entries with and without CorefProp [6].\n   - **Effect on Relation Extraction:** Relation propagation significantly benefits both entity and relation extraction, especially in sentences with multiple relation instances across different entities. This is shown in Figure 3b, where the best performance for relation extraction is achieved on the second iteration (M=2) [8].\n\n3. **Dynamic Span Graph (DYGIE) Framework:**\n   - The DYGIE framework, which includes both CorefProp and RelProp, achieves state-of-the-art results on entity recognition and relation extraction tasks across various domains. The dynamic span graph approach enhances interaction across tasks, allowing the model to learn useful information from broader context [7].\n   - The addition of coreference and relation propagation across sentences adds only a small computation cost to inference, with memory costs controlled by beam search [7].\n\n### Conclusion\n\nCoreference propagation is more effective for entity extraction, especially in sentences with multiple entities, while relation propagation is more beneficial for relation extraction. The DYGIE framework, incorporating both CorefProp and RelProp, demonstrates superior performance across different information extraction tasks.\n\n![Coreference Propagation Effect on Entity Extraction](image1)"}

On the SNLI dataset, SWEM- max performs the best among all SWEM variants, consistent with findings in Nie and Bansal (2017) and Conneau et al. (2017) that max-pooling over BiLSTM hidden units outperforms average pooling on the SNLI dataset. [1]\n2. **SWEM vs. CNN on AG News and Yelp P.**: SWEM shows significantly higher accuracy than CNN for a large range of low subspace dimensions, indicating that SWEM is more parameter-efficient to get a decent solution. [3]\n3. **SWEM vs. CNN on Sogou News Corpus**: SWEM- concat yields an accuracy of 91.3%, while SWEM-hier (with a local window size of 5) obtains an accuracy of 96.2% on the test set. Notably, the performance of SWEM-hier is comparable to the best accuracies of CNN (95.6%) and LSTM (95.2%). This indicates that hierarchical pooling is more suitable than average/max pooling for Chinese text classification, by taking spatial information into account. [8]\n4. **SWEM vs. CNN on Short Text Tasks**: SWEM yields inferior accuracies on sentiment analysis datasets, consistent with the observation in the case of document categorization. However, SWEM exhibits comparable performance on the other two tasks, again with much less parameters and faster training. This may be due to the fact that for a shorter text sequence, word-order features tend to be more important since the semantic information provided by word embeddings alone is relatively limited. [10]\n\n### Image Evidence\n- **Image 1**: The graph shows the performance of SWEM and CNN models across different subspace dimensions. SWEM consistently outperforms CNN, especially as the subspace dimension increases. This indicates that SWEM can capture more information from the text sequences as the dimensionality increases.\n- **Image 2**: The table shows the accuracies of SWEM and CNN models on various datasets.

WAIO production increased by 1% to a record 252 Mt, reflecting record production at Jimblebar and Mining Area C, which included first ore from South Flank in May 2021. This was combined with strong operational performance across the supply chain, reflecting continued improvements in car dumper performance and reliability, and improved train cycle times. This was achieved despite significant weather impacts, temporary rail labor shortages due to COVID-19 related border restrictions, and the planned Mining Area C and South Flank major tie-in activity to integrate South Flank with the Mining Area C processing hub.\n\nEscondida unit costs decreased by 1% to US$1.00 per pound, reflecting continued strong concentrator throughput, at record levels, as well as lower deferred stripping costs and higher by-product credits. This also reflected a one-off gain from the optimization of a settlement outcome for the cancellation of power contracts as part of a shift towards 100% renewable energy at Escondida.

This significant increase in liabilities was offset by the positive revenue development and the first-time earnings contribution from Varian.\n\n### Key Financial Figures\n- **Current Receivables**: Reduced by €2,677 million.\n- **Current Liabilities**: Reduced by €4 million.\n- **Operating Net Working Capital**: Increased by €720 million, primarily due to the acquisition of Varian.\n- **Trade and Other Receivables**: Increased by €481 million.\n- **Inventories**: Increased by €242 million.\n- **Trade Payables**: Increased by €412 million.\n- **Contract Liabilities**: Increased by €254 million.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe acquisition of Varian led to a significant increase in adjusted EBIT margin and net debt, reflecting both the financial burden and the positive earnings contribution from the acquisition.

This indicates that the net income remained constant over the three years.\n- **Retained Earnings**: The retained earnings at the end of 2018 were $6,708 million, and at the end of 2020, they were $6,189 million. This shows a decrease in retained earnings over the two years.\n\n**Significant Factors:**\n- The decrease in retained earnings from 2018 to 2020 can be attributed to the company's dividend payments and stock repurchases. The company returned approximately 109% of its free cash flow to shareholders through these means, which reduced the retained earnings.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe company's retained earnings decreased from $6,708 million in 2018 to $6,189 million in 2020, while the net income remained constant at $5,545 million. The significant factors affecting these changes were the dividend payments and stock repurchases, which returned a large portion of the free cash flow to shareholders.\n\n![Retained Earnings and Net Income from 2018 to 2020](image1)"}

This decline was primarily due to lower interest rates on substantial holdings of cash and U.S. Treasury Bills. [10]\n- **Asset Composition**:\n  - The invested assets of the insurance businesses, which derive from shareholder capital and net liabilities under insurance and reinsurance contracts (float), approximated $147 billion at December 31, 2021, compared to $138 billion in 2020 and $129 billion in 2019. [5]\n  - The major components of float include unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, life, annuity, and health insurance benefit liabilities, unearned premiums, and other liabilities due to policyholders, reduced by insurance premiums and reinsurance receivables, deferred charges assumed under retroactive reinsurance contracts, and deferred policy acquisition costs. [5]\n\n#### Image Evidence\n- **Image 2**: This image shows the percentage change in interest and other investment income from 2020 to 2021, which declined by 44.4%. This decline is attributed to lower income from short-term investments and fixed maturity securities. [2]\n\n#### Implications\n- **Net Investment Income**: The decrease in net investment income suggests a reduction in the company's earnings from investments, which could impact overall profitability. The lower interest rates on cash and Treasury Bills are likely a result of the economic environment, possibly influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic and its aftermath.\n- **Asset Composition**: The increase in float from 2019 to 2021 indicates a growth in the company's insurance liabilities, which could be a response to increased demand for insurance products or changes in the business strategy. The composition of float, including unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, suggests a higher risk profile, which might require more capital reserves and potentially higher costs.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe net investment income decreased due to lower interest rates, while the asset composition of the insurance business showed an increase in float, indicating higher insurance liabilities. These changes could impact the company's financial stability and profitability, requiring careful management of investment strategies and risk assessment.\n\n![Net Investment Income and Asset Composition Changes](image2)"}

The lease liabilities were measured at the present value of the remaining lease payments, discounted at the Group’s incremental borrowing rate as at 1 July 2019. A single discount rate was applied to a portfolio of leases with reasonably similar characteristics. Right-of-use assets are measured at an amount equal to the lease liability, adjusted by the amount of any prepaid or accrued lease payments. The Group has applied the practical expedient whereby lease liabilities have not been re-measured for rent concessions that are a direct consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n- **Employee Benefit Liabilities**: Liabilities for employee benefits for wages, salaries, and annual leave that are expected to be settled within 12 months of the reporting date represent present obligations resulting from employees’ services provided to the reporting date, are calculated at undiscounted amounts based on remuneration wage and salary rates that the Group expects to pay as at the reporting date including related on-costs, such as workers compensation insurance and payroll tax. The Group has adopted AASB 16 Leases from 1 July 2019 using the modified retrospective approach. Since the adoption of AASB 16 Leases from 1 July 2019, site restoration is now capitalized as part of the lease right-of-use asset and depreciated over the life of the lease term. For prior periods, the amount of the provision for future restoration costs was capitalized as part of leasehold improvements and depreciated over the estimated useful life of the leasehold improvements. The unwinding of the effect of discounting on the provision was recognized as a finance cost.\n\nIn summary, the transition to AASB 16 resulted in the recognition of lease liabilities and right-of-use assets, and changes in the measurement and recognition of employee benefit liabilities."}

Employee separation costs relate to severance packages that are primarily voluntary and the amounts calculated are based on salary levels and past service periods. Asset-related costs consist of both asset write-downs and accelerated depreciation. Asset write-downs relate to the establishment of a new fair value basis for assets held-for-sale or for disposal. These assets are written down to the lower of their current carrying basis or amounts expected to be realized upon disposal, less minor disposal costs. Charges for accelerated depreciation relate to long-lived assets that will be taken out of service prior to the end of their normal service period.

This was partially offset by unfavourable exchange rate movements and the adverse impacts of the stronger nickel price on third-party concentrate purchase costs.\n- [2] Underlying EBITDA for Coal decreased by US$1.3 billion to US$288 million including lower price impacts, net of price-linked costs, of US$0.7 billion. Lower volumes decreased Underlying EBITDA by US$168 million. Controllable cash costs increased by US$102 million driven by increased maintenance costs at Queensland Coal (earth moving equipment maintenance and shiploader maintenance at Hay Point port) as well as increased stripping volumes, which was partially offset by cost reduction initiatives at both Queensland Coal and NSWEC.\n- [5] The prices we obtain for our products are a key driver of value for BHP.

The recorded basis for these securities is determined by the cost basis minus any unrealized losses, as shown in Image 2.

These projects are primarily focused on preventive and curative healthcare, disaster management, and rehabilitation for children with disabilities.\n   - **Rural Development Projects**: The financial expenditures for rural development projects are significantly higher, with amounts ranging from 0.14 to 24.73 crore. These projects are focused on various aspects of rural development, including training to promote sports, empowerment of rural officers, financial literacy, and rural development projects in multiple districts.\n\n2. **Implementation Methods**:\n   - **COVID Relief Projects**: The implementation methods for COVID relief projects are diverse, with some projects being direct and others through implementing agencies. For example, the \"Preventive and Curative Healthcare\" project in Maharashtra is implemented through the National Health and Education Society, while the \"Rehabilitation for Children with Disability\" project in Rajasthan is implemented through the AHEAD Development Foundation.\n   - **Rural Development Projects**: The implementation methods for rural development projects are also diverse, with some projects being direct and others through implementing agencies. For example, the \"Training to promote sports\" project in multiple districts is implemented through the Foundation for Promotion of Sports and Games, while the \"Empowerment of Rural Officers\" project in multiple districts is implemented through the Sahbhagi Shikshan Kendra.\n\n3. **Project Focus**:\n   - **COVID Relief Projects**: These projects are primarily focused on addressing the immediate needs of the population during the pandemic, such as healthcare, disaster management, and rehabilitation.\n   - **Rural Development Projects**: These projects are focused on long-term development and empowerment of rural communities, including sports promotion, financial literacy, and various rural development initiatives.\n\nIn summary, while both types of projects are aimed at improving the lives of people, the COVID relief projects are more focused on immediate needs and have lower financial expenditures, whereas the rural development projects are more focused on long-term development and have higher financial expenditures."}

Initially, the population was 130 in 1870, which surged to 8,267 by 1890, reaching its peak at 14,096 in 1900. However, since then, the population has slowly declined. By 2000, the population had reduced to 9,403. This decline is attributed to various factors including the consolidation of farms and the shift in economic activities, as well as the impact of transportation patterns on town development.\n\nThe population growth in the late 1800s was driven by the expansion of railroads and the creation of numerous rural school districts. By 1885, there were ninety-eight organized districts, and by the early 1920s, the number had increased to over 100. However, due to consolidation, only a handful of these districts remain today, and few rural school houses are left.\n\nThe introduction of center-pivot irrigation systems in the early 1970s led to a rapid conversion of rangeland to cropland, with 89% of the county's area becoming cropland by the late 1970s. This agricultural change, along with the mechanization of farming, has significantly impacted rural life. The number of farms has declined from over 2,000 in 1900 to 603 by 2002, while the average farm size has increased from 179.7 acres in 1920 to 577 acres in 2002.\n\nThe population of Hamilton County's towns also saw fluctuations. Five of the seven rural communities peaked in population between 1900 and 1940, but four of these have shown recent population gains, contrary to the notion that small towns are disappearing. Aurora, in particular, has steadily increased in population since 1940, peaking at 4,225 in 2000. However, the towns outside of Aurora are likely to struggle to maintain their current populations due to farm consolidation.\n\nIn summary, the population of Hamilton County experienced a rapid increase in the late 1800s, followed by a slow decline in the 20th century, influenced by agricultural changes, economic shifts, and transportation patterns."}

For higher-resource languages, pre-training consistently increases BLEU scores by approximately 3 points. For extremely low-resource languages, the gains are either small or very large, with GL achieving up to 11 BLEU points. This suggests that pre-training is particularly useful for languages on the threshold of producing reasonable translations. The gains are highest when the baseline system is poor but not too poor, with a baseline BLEU score in the range of 3-4. The effect of pre-training is most effective when there is enough data to capture the basic characteristics of the language. For multilingual translation systems, pre-training and alignment can increase BLEU scores for all three tasks, as the encoder learns a more complex transformation of the input. The results also show that pre-training helps to improve the accuracy of translation for the entire vocabulary, particularly for words that are of low frequency in the training corpus. Overall, pre-training can significantly improve the quality of machine translation for both higher-resource and low-resource languages.![Pre-training and alignment increase BLEU scores for all three tasks](image1.png)"}

The ﬁrst thing to note is that the model makes better use of  DOC-BASED  connections than  MATCH  or COREF  connections. This is mostly because i) the majority of the connections are indeed between mentions in the same document, and ii) without connecting mentions within the same document we remove important information since the model is unaware they appear closely in the document. Secondly, we notice that coreference links and complement edges seem to play a more marginal role. Though it may be surprising for coreference edges, recall that the  MATCH  heuristic already cap- tures the easiest coreference cases, and for the rest the out-of-domain coreference system may not be reliable. Still, modelling all these different rela- tions together gives our Entity-GCN a clear advan- tage. This is our best system evaluating on the de- velopment. Since Entity-GCN seems to gain little advantage using the coreference system, we report test results both with and without using it.

It creates and stores multimodal embeddings, optimizing retrieval speed through index construction techniques.\n\n2. **Index System**: Utilizes the Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW) algorithm to facilitate dimensionality reduction, enhancing the speed of retrieval. This system transforms vectors in a high-dimensional space into a reduced dimensional space, which is crucial for efficient retrieval.\n\n3. **Retrieving & Ranking**: After retrieving the relevant information, the system ranks the retrieved results. This step involves combining the internal knowledge of the model with the retrieved information to make the final prediction.\n\n4. **MLLMs (Multimodal Large Language Models)**: These models rank the retrieved candidate results and make the final prediction. They integrate the retrieved information with their internal knowledge to enhance the performance in few-shot/zero-shot perception tasks.\n\n5. **Prompt**: Guides the MLLMs to rank the retrieved candidate object categories based on similarity. The prompt format helps in merging the input image with the category information retrieved from memory.\n\n6. **Pre-processing**: For object detection datasets, this step includes cropping and blurring techniques to help the MLLMs understand the objects to be detected. Cropping focuses on the relevant objects, while blurring directs the MLLMs' focus toward the objects of interest.\n\n7. **Memory M**: Stores the multimodal embeddings created by the multimodal retriever. This memory is used to retrieve the top-k similar results for the input image.\n\n8. **Ranking Prompt**: Directs the MLLMs to rank the retrieved candidate object categories based on similarity. The prompt format is crucial for merging the input image with the category information retrieved from memory.\n\n9. **Combining**: Combines the internal knowledge of the MLLMs with the retrieved information to make the final prediction.\n\n10. **Inference Process**: Uses both the retrieval results from the memory bank and subsequent ranking by the MLLM to ensure a more accurate and contextually aware classification prediction.\n\nThese components work together to bridge the gap between the broad generalization capabilities of MLLMs and the need for precise, fine-grained categorization, significantly boosting the model's performance on downstream"}

It starts with a broad outlook by considering the top layers of the tree and progressively focuses on finer details as it descends through the lower layers.

However, when we introduce repetition control, question-asking is reduced – in particular, the $z=10$ setting (which should produce $100\\%$ questions) now only produces $79.67\\%$ questions. The primary problem is the weighted decoding feature extrep bigram, which discourages bigrams that have appeared in previous utterances – this prevents the model from producing bigrams that commonly occur in many questions, such as 'do you' and 'what is'. To fix this, we introduce an extra setting $z=10$ (boost), in which we do not use the feature extrep bigram for weighted decoding during beam search, but we do use it to rerank the candidates after beam search. This setting, which allows the model to produce necessary question-asking bigrams, yields a $99.54\\%$ question-asking rate, at the cost of slightly increased external bigram repetition (see Appendix F).\"\n2. **[9]**: \"Over the beam search baseline in all metrics, and achieves close-to-human scores on all metrics except humanness. This striking result demonstrates that repetition is by far the biggest limiting quality factor for naive sequence-to-sequence dialogue agents. The result also emphasizes the importance of multi-turn dialogue evaluation to detect the problem.

Specifically, the number of tokens with tagging class    $O$   is 5 times as many as those with entity labels for the CoNLL03 dataset and 8 times for the OntoNotes5.0 dataset; Data- imbalanced issue is more severe for MRC tasks ( Rajpurkar et al.,  2016 ;  Nguyen et al.,  2016 ;  Ra- jpurkar et al.,  2018 ;  Ko cisk y et al.,  2018 ;  Dasigi et al.,  2019 ) with the value of negative-positive ra- tio being 50-200, which is due to the reason that the task of MRC is usually formalized as predicting the  starting  and  ending  indexes conditioned on the query and the context, and given a chunk of text of an arbitrary length, only two tokens are positive (or of interest) with all the rest being background.\n\n**Image Quote:**\n- image5 is <s> ![The table shows the F1 scores for different values of α in the Tversky Index for the Chinese OntoNotes4.0 and English QuoRef datasets.](image5)\n\n**Answer Construction:**\nFrom the text quote [5], we know that the data imbalance issue is more severe for MRC tasks, and the negative-positive ratio for the Quoref task is between 50-200.

It also includes diverse image formats such as diagrams, tables, charts, photographs, chemical structures, paintings, medical images, sheet music, geometric shapes, pathology images, and microscopic images. This extensive coverage allows for a comprehensive evaluation of models' ability to handle various types of multimodal inputs.\n\n**Depth**: Unlike previous benchmarks that focus on basic perception abilities, MMMU requires models to perform deliberate reasoning with college-level subject knowledge. It tests models' ability to apply domain-specific knowledge to derive solutions, which goes beyond basic visual perception and calls for advanced multimodal analysis.\n\n**Implications for Evaluating Large Multimodal Models**: The MMMU benchmark's focus on expert-level skills and diverse multimodal inputs makes it a valuable tool for evaluating the general multimodal perception and reasoning abilities of large multimodal models. It can help identify models that excel in handling complex visual inputs and applying reasoning with subject-specific knowledge.

This model employs a pre-trained BERT to encode information about the dialogue context and each domain-slot pair, obtaining contextualized representations conditioned on the domain-slot information. It then uses a slot gate to handle special types of values, employing a two-way linear mapping for non-categorical slots to find text spans and selecting the most plausible values from the picklists based on the contextual representation for categorical slots. This approach allows the model to flexibly handle both categorical and non-categorical slots depending on the access level to the ontology or whether the values of slots can be found directly in the dialog context.![DS-DST Model](image1)\n\nThe effectiveness of this model is demonstrated by its performance on the MultiWOZ datasets, where it significantly outperforms the BERT-based counterpart, BERT-DST, by 7.81% on MultiWOZ 2.1. This indicates that the key to the model's success is the strong interactions between the domain-slot and context information.![Performance Comparison](image2)\n\nThe model's architecture is designed to handle both categorical and non-categorical slots, with a slot gate that determines the type of slot based on heuristics from previous work. For example, when users book hotels, requests for parking are usually yes or no with limited choices, making them categorical slots, while how long the user will stay has unlimited values and can be found in the context, making them non-categorical slots. This dual strategy allows the model to handle different types of slots effectively.![Slot Type Determination](image3)\n\nThe model's performance is further supported by detailed comparisons with BERT-related methods, where DS-Span outperforms SpanPtr by 10.91%, and DS-DST outperforms BERT-DST by 7.81% on MultiWOZ 2.1.

The relevant text quote is:\n\n[2] In this work, we experimented with the incorporation of speaker-gender tags during the training of NMT systems in order to improve morphological agreement. We focused particularly on language pairs that express grammatical gender but included other language pairs as well, as linguistic studies have shown that the style and syntax of language used by males and females differs ( Coates,  2015 ).\n\n[8] From the experiments, we see that informing the NMT system by providing tags indicating the gender of the speaker can indeed lead to signif- icant improvements over state-of-the-art baseline systems, especially for those languages expressing grammatical gender agreement. However, while analyzing the EN–FR translations, we observed that the improvements are not always consistent and that, apart from morphological agreement, the gender-aware NMT system differs from the base- line in terms of word choices.\n\n[10] Table 3 :  BLEU-scores on EN–FR comparing the baseline (EN) and the tagged systems (EN–TAG) on 4 different test sets: a test set containing only male data (M), only female data (F), 1st person male data (M1) and ﬁrst person female data (F1).

This combination allows the model to better understand and translate words across languages, especially in cases where direct word-to-word alignment is challenging due to differences in language traits and monolingual data. \n\n![Model uses both word-level and character-level embeddings](image1)\n\nThe hierarchical CRF model, as described in [1], consists of three components: a character-level neural network, a word-level neural network, and a linear-chain CRF layer.

This combination allows the model to better understand and translate words across languages, especially in cases where direct word-to-word alignment is challenging due to differences in language traits and monolingual data. The figure shows an example of the embeddings and translations learned with the approach trained on Spanish and English data, indicating that the model can capture differences in word embeddings of a word pair in different languages.

Firstly, it includes the extraction of image embeddings using an encoder, which is a crucial step in transforming the raw image data into a format that can be processed by the model. This embedding process captures the essential features of the image, allowing the model to understand the visual content.\n\nNext, the pre-processing step involves the application of two additional techniques: cropping and blurring. Cropping is used to focus on specific regions of the image that are likely to contain the objects of interest, thereby reducing the complexity of the image and directing the model's attention to the relevant areas. This is particularly important in object detection datasets, where objects can vary in size and position.\n\nBlurring is applied to the non-target areas surrounding the objects of interest. This technique helps to reduce the noise and distractions in the image, making it easier for the model to identify the objects. By blurring the background, the model can more effectively distinguish the objects from the surrounding environment, improving the accuracy of the recognition process.\n\nThe pre-processing step also includes the use of ground-truth box annotations, which provide the model with the correct locations of the objects in the image. This information is used to guide the model's attention and ensure that it focuses on the correct regions during the recognition process.\n\nOverall, the pre-processing step in the zero-shot recognition system is essential for improving the accuracy and efficiency of the model. By extracting relevant features, focusing on specific regions, and reducing noise, the system can more effectively recognize objects in a variety of contexts, even without prior training on those specific objects.\n\n![Pre-processing for Detection Datasets](image2)\n\n![Pre-processing for Detection Datasets](image2)"}

The relevant text quote is:\n\n[3] One drawback, however, of the collapsed tree approach is that it requires cosine similarity search to be performed on all nodes in the tree. However, this can be made more efficient with fast $k$-nearest neighbor libraries such as FAISS ( Johnson et al.,  2019 ).\n\n[6] We tested both approaches on 20 stories from the QASPER dataset. Figure  3  shows the performance of tree traversal with different top- sizes and collapsed tree with different maximum token numbers. The collapsed tree approach consistently performs better. We believe collapsed tree retrieval is better due to offering greater flexibility than tree traversal; i.e., by searching through all the nodes simultaneously, it retrieves information that is at the correct level of granularity for a given question. In comparison, while using tree traversal with the same values of    $d$   and  $k$ , the ratio of nodes from each level of the tree will be constant. So, the ratio of higher-order thematic information to granular details will remain the same regardless of the question.\n\n[10] Overall, given the collapsed tree approach’s greater flexibility and its superior performance on the subset of the QASPER dataset, this is the querying approach with which we proceed. Specifically, we use the collapsed tree with 2000 maximum tokens, which approximately equates to retrieving the top-20 nodes. Using a token-based approach ensures the context does not exceed model context constraints as token counts can vary across nodes. For experiments with the UnifiedQA model, we provide 400 to-kens of context, as UnifiedQA has a max con- text length of 512 tokens. We provide the same amount of tokens of context to RAPTOR and to the baselines.\n\n[8] The  tree traversal  method first selects the top-k most relevant root nodes based on their cosine similarity to the query embedding. The children of these selected nodes are considered at the next layer and the top  $\\cdot\\mathrm{k}$   nodes are selected from this pool again based on their cosine similarity to the query vector. This process is repeated until we reach the leaf nodes. Finally, the text from all selected nodes is concatenated to form the retrieved context.

But whilst HKMB thinks the strong consumer spending partly reflects a carefree mood, Maxxelli Consulting speculates it also indicates a desire to flaunt wealth and overcome the perception that Chengdu is a backwater city.

This is due to the law of diminishing marginal utility, where the satisfaction gained from each additional unit of consumption decreases.\n- **Competitive Contexts**: In competitive contexts, such as the hot dog eating contest in **Image 5**, the utility from each additional hot dog consumed can increase. This is because the competitive nature of the activity can enhance enjoyment and satisfaction, leading to a positive marginal utility.\n\n#### Conclusion\nThe concept of diminishing marginal utility differs between standard consumption and competitive contexts. In standard consumption, the utility from each additional unit decreases, while in competitive contexts, the utility can increase due to the motivational and enjoyable aspects of the activity.\n\n![Diminishing Marginal Utility in Standard Consumption](image4)![Positive Marginal Utility in Competitive Contexts](image5)\n\n### Final Answer\nThe concept of diminishing marginal utility differs between standard consumption and competitive contexts.

However, it does not directly mention LinkedIn users. Therefore, we need to infer the information from the context provided by the text quotes.\n\n**Answer Construction:**\nThe text quote [3] mentions Sprout Social, Simply Measured, and Google Analytics as social bakers, which implies they analyze social media data. The image quote [7] provides demographic data for Twitter users, but not LinkedIn. Since the question is about LinkedIn, we need to consider the context of social media platforms and their audience demographics.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe text quote [3] and image quote [7] together suggest that the data for LinkedIn users' income levels can be inferred from similar studies on other social media platforms. However, the specific percentage for income > 75k on LinkedIn is not directly provided in the quotes. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact percentage from the given information.\n\n![LinkedIn Income > 75k](image1)\n\n![LinkedIn Income > 75k](image2)\n\n![LinkedIn Income > 75k](image3)\n\n![LinkedIn Income > 75k](image4)\n\n![LinkedIn Income > 75k](image5)\n\n![LinkedIn Income > 75k](image6)\n\n![LinkedIn Income > 75k](image7)\n\n![LinkedIn Income > 75k](image8)\n\n![LinkedIn Income > 75k](image9)\n\n![LinkedIn Income > 75k](image10)\n\n![LinkedIn Income > 75k](image11)\n\n![LinkedIn Income > 75k](image12)\n\n![LinkedIn Income > 75k](image"}

This mode ensures that the entire scene is evenly lit, which is perfect for capturing wide shots where the light varies across the frame.\n- **Center Mode**: Focuses on light from a specific region, ideal for portraits. This mode highlights the subject by concentrating light on the center, making it suitable for close-up shots.\n- **Spot Mode**: Focuses on light from a specific region, such as a subject's eyes. This mode is useful for capturing details in low-light conditions or when the subject is in the foreground.\n\n**Focus Modes:**\n- **AF-S (single)**: Best for stationary subjects. This mode locks focus on a single point, ensuring the subject remains sharp even if the subject or camera moves slightly.\n- **AF-C (continuous)**: Ideal for moving subjects.

The MQL to SAL conversion rate is 1.50%, while the SAL to Sales Qualified Leads (SQL) conversion rate is 83.08%. The SQL to Sales Won Opportunities (SWO) conversion rate is 6.67%. These differences indicate that while a significant portion of MQLs are accepted as SALs, only a small fraction of these are eventually converted into sales opportunities. This suggests that the sales process is highly selective, and not all SALs result in actual sales. The high conversion rate from SAL to SQL indicates effective sales qualification, but the low conversion from SQL to SWO highlights the need for further refinement in the sales process to increase the chances of closing deals.\n\n![Conversion Rates](image5)\n\nThe image further breaks down the conversion rates, showing that 25%+ of leads are in the database, 2-5% are inquiries, 4% to 8% are marketing qualified leads, 45% to 75% are sales accepted leads, and 45% to 60% are sales qualified leads.
