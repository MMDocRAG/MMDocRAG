Severity of Assessment:\nSTEM postgraduate degree holders are notably more critical, with about 51% saying the U.S. is below average in K-12 STEM education, compared to the general public's more moderate assessment [11]. The general public tends to rate K-12 STEM education as \"average\" (43%) rather than below average (30%) [10].\n\n3. Educational Quality Assessment:\nWhile the general public gives middling assessments of STEM education for U.S. students in grades K-12, those with advanced STEM degrees are significantly more critical [6]. The disparity in views suggests that those with deeper expertise in STEM fields see more serious shortcomings in K-12 STEM education than the general public does [1].\n\nIn conclusion, STEM postgraduate degree holders hold significantly more negative views of K-12 public school education compared to the general public, with a much smaller percentage rating it as above average and a larger percentage rating it below average compared to other developed nations."}

Age-Related Patterns:\n[4] The difference in acceptance is most pronounced in friend recommendations: Users aged 18-49 approve by a two-to-one margin (66% to 33%), while those 65 and older disapprove by 63% to 36%.\n\n[8] There is some common ground across age groups: Most users, regardless of age, accept data usage for local event recommendations but reject it for political campaign messaging.\n\nThe overall conclusion is that younger users are generally more accepting of personal data usage by social media platforms, while older users are more cautious. However, across all age groups, there's higher acceptance for practical uses (like event recommendations) and lower acceptance for political or commercial purposes."}

The ridership growth in Mountain View and Palo Alto has been significant:\n![A data table showing ridership growth statistics for Palo Alto University and Mountain View from 2012-2014](image5)\n- Palo Alto saw a 38% increase from 2012 to 2014\n- Mountain View experienced a 16% growth in the same period [11]\n\n2. This growth has led to severe capacity issues:\n![A crowded Caltrain car with passengers filling all seats](image2)\n- Trains are operating well beyond their seated capacity [4][9]\n\n3. The capacity strain is particularly evident in the data:\n![A table showing northbound train capacities exceeding 100% on most morning trains](image6)\n- Morning trains are running at 102-158% of seated capacity\n- The most crowded train (319) operates at 135% of seated capacity during regular times and up to 158% during peak seasons\n\n4. The overcrowding is visible at stations:\n![A crowded platform with many passengers waiting for trains](image7)\n\n5. This aligns with the broader goal: \"We need to double Caltrain ridership from 60,000 to 120,000 daily trips by the next decade\" [10], but the current infrastructure is already strained.\n\nIn conclusion, the significant ridership growth in Mountain View (16%) and Palo Alto (38%) between 2012-2014 has directly contributed to trains operating well beyond their designed capacity, with some trains running at over 150% capacity during peak times."}

App Store Distribution:\n![Google Play Store apps grew to 1.6 million compared to App Store's 1.5 million](image1)\nThe distribution of apps between the two major stores shows that [9]:\n- Google Play Store has over 1.6 million available apps\n- Apple's App Store has approximately 1.5 million apps\n- Google Play Store leads by about 17% in terms of total apps\n\n3.

This suggests that a moderate number of demonstrations is sufficient for optimal performance.\n\n2. Effect of Logical Constraints:\n![Different approaches for incorporating logical constraints showing generative, retrieval, and pretraining methods](image2)\nThe incorporation of logical constraints provides several benefits:\n- According to [12], adding logical constraints with fewer demonstrations can outperform models using more demonstrations without constraints\n- [1] mentions that using 5 demonstrations with logical constraints (25.7%) surpasses the performance of 10 demonstrations without constraints (24.5%)\n\n3. Model Performance Comparison:\n![Performance comparison table showing different models and their metrics](image6)\nLooking at the performance metrics:\n- GPT-4 with CoT and logical constraints achieves the best performance (32.3% Micro-F1 on MAVEN-ERE, 24.5% on Causal-TimeBank)\n- All models show improvement when logical constraints are added to Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting\n- The logical inconsistency (LI) percentage significantly decreases when logical constraints are applied\n\n4.

Long-term Reasoning:\n[5] shows that while iterative retrieval of logical constraints can reduce logical inconsistency, too many iterations may lead to \"over-thinking\" and produce redundant information that doesn't necessarily improve performance.\n\nThe evidence demonstrates that the combination of logical constraints with appropriate demonstration samples leads to better performance across different models, with the key being the balance between the number of demonstrations and the effective use of logical constraints."}

Reasons for Limited Impact:\nThe limited usefulness of coreference information can be explained by several factors:\n- [8] mentions that the MATCH heuristic already captures the easiest coreference cases\n- The out-of-domain coreference system may not be reliable\n- [5] explains that in the unmasked setting, mentions to an entity may differ (e.g., \"US\" vs \"United States\") and might not be retrieved by the coreference system\n\n3. Masked Setting Performance:\n![A table showing ablation results across different model configurations](image6) indicates that coreference information is not even used in the masked setting (marked with \"-\") [5]. This is because:\n- In masked settings, coreferred mentions are already labeled with the same identifier\n- [5] notes that entities are always referred to via the same unique surface form (e.g., MASK1) within and across documents in the masked version\n\n4.

Component-wise Performance Impact:\nFrom [8] and the experimental results shown in ![Performance comparison of different model components across datasets](image4), we can observe that:\n- Transfer of both LSTM and embedding layers is more beneficial than the output layer\n- The embedding layer transfer is particularly helpful for datasets D3 and D4, which have unbalanced label distributions [8]\n- Even transferring a single layer shows improvements over the base LSTM+ATT model\n\n2. Document-level Training Impact:\n![Impact of document-level training percentage on model accuracy and macro-F1](image3) demonstrates that:\n- There is a stable improvement in accuracy across all datasets as document-level training examples increase [4]\n- For D3 and D4, there are sharp increases in macro-F1 scores when the percentage changes from 0 to 0.4 [4]\n\n3. Dataset Characteristics:\nLooking at ![Dataset statistics showing class distribution](image2), we can see that:\n- D3 and D4 have highly imbalanced class distributions, particularly for neutral class examples\n- This imbalance explains why [3] notes that \"precision and recall on neutral class will be largely affected by even a small prediction difference\"\n\n4. Overall Performance:\nAs shown in ![Performance comparison across different methods](image1), the combination of pretraining and multi-task learning (PRET+MULT) achieves the best results across most datasets [7], demonstrating that:\n- Document-level knowledge transfer is beneficial through both pretraining and multi-task learning\n- The improvements are particularly pronounced for datasets with imbalanced class distributions\n\nThe key trend observed is that incorporating document-level knowledge consistently improves model performance, with the most significant gains seen in datasets with class imbalance issues, and the effectiveness increases with more document-level training examples."}

Overall Translation Accuracy and Language Performance:\n[7] indicates that most systems perform poorly across the eight tested languages, with accuracy often not much better than random guessing.

Commercial MT Systems Performance:\n[1,4] reveals that four commercial systems (Google Translate, Microsoft Translator, Amazon Translate, and SYSTRAN) and two academic models all show significant gender bias across all tested languages.

This is in stark contrast to its original performance where:\n![Original BERT performance showing high accuracy near human baseline](image2)\nBERT had achieved 77% accuracy, just three points below the untrained human baseline [1].\n\n2. Mechanism of the Adversarial Setup:\n![Example of original and adversarial data pairs showing claim negation](image6)\nThe adversarial dataset was created by:\n- Adding a copy of each data point with the claim negated\n- Inverting the label for these new points [9]\nThis process effectively mirrored the distribution of statistical cues around both labels, eliminating spurious patterns that models could exploit [8].\n\n3. Training Impact:\nWhen models were trained on the original data and tested on the adversarial set, they performed worse than random due to overfitting to the cues in the original training set [6]. When trained from scratch on the adversarial data, they achieved only random performance [6].\n\nKey Conclusions:\n1. BERT's initially impressive performance was entirely due to exploitation of spurious statistical cues rather than true argument comprehension [10].\n2. The adversarial dataset provides a more robust evaluation of argument comprehension ability [3].\n3. As noted in [12], this reveals that stronger learners like BERT can exploit subtle distributional patterns, making it even more crucial to control for spurious statistics in dataset design.\n\nThis study demonstrates that what appeared to be near-human performance was actually just sophisticated pattern matching rather than true argument understanding [10]."}

This substantial increase of €8,812 million was primarily driven by:\n\n- A major increase in liabilities to the Siemens Group from financing activities, which grew from €4,936 million to €13,562 million\n- The main reason for this increase was financing related to the Varian acquisition [12]\n- Cash flows from financing activities contributed €8,127 million to the increase\n- Additional factors included acquisitions (€154 million), foreign exchange rate effects (€318 million), and other changes (€212 million)\n\nThe net debt increase was significant, as mentioned in [12]: \"In fiscal year 2021, net debt increased by €10,416 million to €11,901 million mainly due to finance transactions related to the financing of the acquisition of Varian.\"\n\nIn conclusion, the total financial debt nearly tripled from fiscal year 2020 to 2021, increasing by €8,812 million to reach €14,315 million, primarily due to financing activities related to the Varian acquisition."}

Nickel Performance:\n[6][9] Nickel showed positive performance:\n- Average realized price increased to US$16,250 per tonne in FY2021 (from US$13,860 in FY2020)\n- Underlying EBITDA increased by US$296 million to US$259 million\n- Performance driven by positive investor sentiment and strong end-use demand\n\n4. Key Market Drivers:\n[1][10] The primary factors affecting commodity prices include:\n- Global economic and geopolitical factors\n- Industrial activity\n- Supply and demand dynamics\n- Exchange rate fluctuations\n\n[7] The overall revenue impact shows:\n- Revenue increased by US$17.9 billion to US$60.8 billion (42% increase)\n- Higher average realized prices for most commodities, including nickel\n- Lower average realized prices for metallurgical coal\n\nIn conclusion, BHP's financial results are heavily influenced by commodity price fluctuations, with nickel showing strong positive performance due to market demand, while coal experienced significant challenges due to price declines and operational cost increases."}

The adjusted (non-GAAP) ROTCE for 2020 was 15.4%\n\nThis shows that the adjusted ROTCE was 0.2 percentage points higher than the unadjusted figure. The difference is due to integration-related expenses from the E*TRADE acquisition [1], which were excluded in the non-GAAP adjusted figures.\n\n![Financial metrics showing ROTCE figures for Morgan Stanley in 2020](image6)\n\nTo put this in context, these adjustments reflect the company's practice of providing non-GAAP measures to give stakeholders an alternate means of assessing financial condition and operating results [11]. The adjustment accounts for one-time integration costs that aren't part of normal ongoing operations.\n\nTherefore, the non-GAAP adjusted ROTCE of 15.4% in 2020 was slightly higher than the unadjusted ROTCE of 15.2%, with the difference primarily attributable to the E*TRADE integration expenses."}

Tax-Related Benefits:\n- Income tax payments decreased from $3,183 million in 2020 to $2,628 million in 2021 [image6]\n- This decrease was \"primarily due to the tax deductions resulting from our senior notes exchange, which reduced tax payments by $1.3 billion in the current year period\" [4]\n\n3.

This represents a positive swing of approximately $3 billion.\n\nThe improvement was driven by several key factors [2]:\n\n1. Higher margins on refined product sales: Contributed $1.6 billion to the increase\n2. Higher earnings from 50 percent-owned CPChem: Added $1.0 billion\n3. Higher sales volumes: Contributed $470 million\n\nThese positive factors were partially offset by:\n- Higher operating expenses of $150 million [2]\n\n![Sales and operating revenues showing overall business improvement](image1)\nThe improvement in downstream earnings occurred in a context of generally improving business conditions, as evidenced by the increase in overall sales and operating revenues from $94,471 million in 2020 to $155,606 million in 2021.\n\nIn conclusion, the U.S. downstream segment experienced a significant recovery in 2021, turning a $571 million loss into a $2.4 billion profit, primarily driven by improved margins, better performance from joint ventures, and higher sales volumes, despite some increase in operating costs."}

This indicates a shift toward more comprehensive segment performance measurement.\n\nThe increasing trend in stock-based compensation expense suggests:\n1. Growing emphasis on equity-based compensation to align employee interests with company performance\n2. Possible expansion of equity compensation programs to more employees\n3. Higher valuations of granted equity awards\n\nThe tax benefit patterns indicate effective tax planning around stock-based compensation, with the company successfully realizing tax advantages from these programs.\n\nThe changes suggest a financial strategy focused on:\n- Using stock-based compensation as a key component of employee compensation\n- Maintaining tax efficiency in compensation programs\n- Greater transparency in segment performance measurement by including stock-based compensation costs"}

Key Reasons for Changes:\n\na) Planned Store Optimization:\n[1] Reports that Inditex was very active in store optimization in 2021, with 578 stores absorbed and 226 new openings, along with 130 refurbishments including 57 enlargements.\n\n[12] The company had a strategic plan to absorb between 1,000-1,200 stores during 2020 and 2021, targeting \"stores at the end of their useful life, especially those in the younger formats, whose sales can be recuperated in local shops and online.\"\n\nb) Pandemic Impact:\n[11] The comparison between years was heavily affected by the pandemic, which \"had a material impact on the majority of markets where the Group operated, as a result of lockdown measures and restricted mobility. Up to 90% of stores were closed in the first quarter of that year.\"\n\nc) Russia-Ukraine Situation:\n[9] The company had significant presence in Russia (502 stores) and Ukraine (84 stores), all operated under lease agreements, which could have influenced the European numbers.\n\nThe overall trend shows a deliberate reduction in physical store presence as part of a strategic optimization plan, accelerated by both the pandemic's impact and geopolitical situations, while maintaining market presence through a combination of larger, refurbished stores and online channels."}

Voting Behavior and Engagement:\n![Voting rates showing independents have lower participation than party identifiers, with true independents having the lowest turnout](image3) [6] Independent leaners show lower electoral participation than party identifiers. Democratic-leaning independents had a 48% voting rate compared to 59% for Democrats, while Republican-leaning independents showed 54% compared to 61% for Republicans.\n\n4. Ideological Composition:\n[1] Among true independents (those who don't lean toward either party), nearly half identify as moderates, with 24% being conservatives and 18% liberals. These proportions have remained relatively stable since 2000.\n\nThe data indicates that while the proportion of self-identified independents has grown since 1994, this doesn't necessarily reflect a truly non-partisan electorate, as most independents maintain consistent partisan leanings and voting patterns, with only a small fraction being truly independent voters."}

Agricultural Development:\n![Large grain elevator showing agricultural infrastructure development](image1)\nThe county's development was heavily tied to agriculture:\n- By 1900, there were over 2,000 farms in Hamilton County [6]\n- The agricultural landscape dominated by corn production shaped settlement patterns [6]\n\n3.

Long-term Population Decline and Stabilization:\n- After the 1890 peak, the population gradually declined [1]\n- By 2000, the population had stabilized around 9,403 [8]\n- Farm consolidation and mechanization led to fewer, larger farms, affecting rural population [6]\n\nThe primary factors influencing these population changes were:\n1.

Comparison to Other Policies:\n[10] Other policies receive notably lower support:\n- 62% favor paying extra for human interaction\n- 60% support guaranteed basic income\n- 58% support national service programs\n\n4. Education Level Impact:\n[1] While education levels affect views on other automation policies like universal basic income, the support for limiting machines to dangerous jobs remains consistently high across educational backgrounds.\n\nThe key conclusion from the evidence is that limiting machines to dangerous jobs is Americans' most preferred automation policy, with 85% support and strong bipartisan agreement, significantly outpacing other potential solutions like universal basic income or national service programs which only receive around 60% support."}

Object Queries as Learned Positional Encodings:\n[5] explains that object queries are learned positional encodings that are added to the input of each attention layer in the decoder. These N input embeddings must be different to produce different results.\n\n2. Architecture Integration:\n![DETR's complete architecture showing backbone, encoder, decoder, and prediction heads with object queries](image5)\nThis architectural diagram shows how object queries are fed into the transformer decoder along with encoder outputs.\n\n3. Parallel Processing:\n[5] indicates that DETR processes N objects in parallel at each decoder layer, unlike traditional autoregressive models. Through self-attention and encoder-decoder attention mechanisms, these object queries allow the model to:\n- Globally reason about all objects together\n- Use pair-wise relations between objects\n- Utilize the whole image as context\n\n4. Position Encoding Importance:\n[4] reveals through experiments that output positional encodings (object queries) are essential and:\n- Cannot be removed from the architecture\n- Are always learned rather than fixed\n- Can be passed either at decoder input or added to queries at every decoder attention layer\n\n5. Final Prediction Process:\n[5] describes that the N object queries are transformed by the decoder into output embeddings, which are then independently decoded into:\n- Box coordinates\n- Class labels\nThrough a feed-forward network, resulting in N final predictions\n\n6. End-to-End Training:\n[2] notes that DETR with its object queries is trained end-to-end with a set loss function that performs bipartite matching between predicted and ground-truth objects.\n\nThe key innovation is that object queries enable DETR to directly predict the final set of detections in parallel while reasoning about object relationships and global context, eliminating the need for traditional hand-designed components like anchor boxes or non-maximum suppression [9]."}

When repetition control is introduced, it reduces the overall question-asking rate [10]: \"However, when we introduce repetition control, question-asking is reduced – in particular, the z=10 setting (which should produce 100% questions) now only produces 79.67% questions.\"\n\n![Question-asking rates with different control settings](image4) shows this effect clearly - the purple line (Question-controlled CT w/ rep ctrl) has consistently lower question rates compared to the blue line (Question-controlled CT without repetition control).\n\nThe main reason for this reduction is that:\n- Repetition control discourages common question-forming bigrams [10]: \"The primary problem is the weighted decoding feature extrep bigram, which discourages bigrams that have commonly occur in many questions, such as 'do you' and 'what is'.\"\n\nTo address this limitation, researchers developed a solution:\n[10] \"To fix this, we introduce an extra setting z = 10 (boost), in which we do not use the feature extrep bigram for weighted decoding during beam search, but we do use it to rerank the candidates after beam search. This setting... yields a 99.54% question-asking rate.\"\n\n![Overall model comparison across metrics](image3) demonstrates that despite these challenges, the question-controlled model with repetition control (shown in gray) still maintains strong performance across various metrics including inquisitiveness.\n\nThe key conclusion is that repetition control creates a trade-off between preventing repetitive text and enabling natural question formation, requiring specific technical solutions to achieve both goals simultaneously."}

Word Order is Crucial for Sentiment:\n[7] explains that word-order information is particularly important for sentiment analysis because phrases like \"not really good\" and \"really not good\" convey different levels of negative sentiment, despite containing the same words. LSTM models can capture these ordering patterns through their recurrent transition functions.\n\n2. Experimental Evidence:\n![Examples of sentiment analysis showing different sentiments with word ordering](image3)\nThe example shows how word ordering in phrases affects sentiment expression, demonstrating why models need to capture sequential information.\n\n3. Performance Impact:\n[11,12] When word order is disrupted through shuffling in training data, there is a noticeable drop in performance on sentiment analysis tasks. Specifically, when training LSTM on shuffled data for Yelp polarity dataset, the performance decreases significantly, confirming that word-order features are crucial for sentiment analysis.\n\n4. Comparison with Simple Models:\n[2,3] The study shows that incorporating local word-order information through n-gram features can help mitigate limitations of simple pooling methods, suggesting that sequential information is indeed valuable for sentiment tasks.\n\n5. Quantitative Evidence:\n![Performance comparison showing accuracy drops with shuffled data](image4)\nThe table shows that on Yelp Polarity (Yelp P.), accuracy drops from 95.11% to 93.49% when word order is shuffled, demonstrating the importance of word order for sentiment analysis.\n\nIn conclusion, word-order information significantly affects sentiment analysis accuracy in LSTM models, with experimental evidence showing performance degradation when word order is disrupted, particularly because sentiment often depends on the specific arrangement of words in phrases."}

However, when repetition control is introduced (purple line), the question-asking rate drops to about 79.67% at z=10. This reduction occurs because the repetition control feature (extrep_bigram) prevents the model from using common question-forming bigrams like \"do you\" and \"what is\" [6].\n\n3. To address this limitation, the researchers introduced a \"boost\" setting at z=10 where they:\n- Disable extrep_bigram during beam search\n- Only use it for reranking candidates after beam search\nThis modification allows the model to achieve a 99.54% question-asking rate while maintaining some control over repetition [6].\n\nIn summary, repetition control initially reduces the maximum question-asking rate from nearly 100% to about 80% at z=10, but this can be largely recovered to 99.54% through the specialized \"boost\" setting that modifies how repetition control is applied."}

Token Representation Generation: According to [4], \"We apply a bidirectional LSTM over the input tokens. The input for each token is a concatenation of the character representation, GLoVe word embeddings, and ELMo embeddings. The output token representations are obtained by stacking the forward and backward LSTM hidden states.\"\n\n2. Foundation for Span Enumeration: As shown in ![The model architecture showing how BiLSTM processes input text to generate span representations](image1), the sentence-level BiLSTM processes raw input text to create token representations that serve as the foundation for span enumeration. This is a crucial first step before the model can perform higher-level tasks.\n\n3. Domain-Independent Processing: [7] indicates that this approach allows the model to avoid relying on \"domain-specific external syntactic tools\" that could introduce cascading errors, making the model more generalizable across different domains.\n\n4. Local Context Encoding: The BiLSTM captures local contextual information within sentences before the model performs more complex tasks like entity recognition, relation extraction, and coreference resolution [9].\n\nIn conclusion, the sentence-level BiLSTM in DYGIE serves as the foundational layer that transforms raw text input into contextualized token representations, which are then used for span enumeration and subsequent higher-level information extraction tasks, while maintaining domain independence."}

Cosine Similarity Matching:\n[1] The model calculates the relevance score between the aggregated representation and reference candidates using cosine similarity, following Lin et al. (2017).\n\n![Architecture showing cosine similarity matching between BERT encoded representations](image8)\n\n3. Dual Strategy Approach:\n[8] The model employs a dual strategy by:\n- For categorical slots: Selecting values from predefined picklists\n- For non-categorical slots: Using span matching to find values directly in the dialogue context\n\n4. Strong Performance Evidence:\n[10] The effectiveness of this matching approach is demonstrated by the results where \"DS-DST outperforms BERT-DST, which separately encodes dialog context and domain-slot pairs based on BERT, by 7.81% on MultiWOZ 2.1.\"\n\n[11] The improvements come specifically from \"the strong interactions between slots and dialog context,\" making it \"important to\" enable direct interactions between these components for better matching performance.\n\nIn conclusion, the DS-DST model determines matches through a combination of BERT-based joint encoding, cosine similarity matching, and a dual strategy approach, with the key innovation being the strong interaction between dialogue context and domain-slot information during the encoding process."}

Impact with ELMo:\n[11] indicates that removing R-GCN while using ELMo embeddings also shows significant performance drops:\n- The best model is 6.1% and 8.4% more accurate than the model without R-GCN in unmasked and masked settings respectively.\n\n3. Architectural Importance:\n[6] demonstrates that simply having a graph structure isn't enough - the R-GCN component is crucial for effective performance. When replaced with a fully-connected graph without relation types, the performance shows only marginal improvements over using ELMo alone.\n\n4. Edge Prediction:\n[9] reveals that when trying to replace R-GCN's predefined edge structure with learned edges, the performance drops below even the \"No R-GCN\" baseline, highlighting the importance of R-GCN's structured approach.\n\nIn conclusion, removing R-GCN consistently degrades performance across both masked and unmasked settings, with particularly dramatic effects when using simpler embeddings like GloVe. The component proves essential for enabling effective multi-hop reasoning and relationship modeling in the network."}

Document Integration Capabilities:\n- BiDAF's superior performance is attributed to its iterative latent interactions architecture, which is particularly important when information is distributed across multiple documents [12]\n- When tested on relevant documents only (\"gold chain\" setup):\n![Performance on gold chain setup showing significant improvements](image2)\n- BiDAF's performance dramatically improves to 81.2% on WIKIHOP and 99.3% on MEDHOP (masked setting)\n- FastQA shows less impressive improvements, reaching 65.3% on WIKIHOP and 51.8% on MEDHOP\n\n3. Multi-step Inference:\n[5] Shows that when testing multi-step inference capabilities:\n- BiDAF experiences significant performance drops (3.3%/6.2% on MEDHOP and 10.0%/2.1% on WIKIHOP) when certain documents are removed\n- FastQA shows inconsistent results with slight increases in WIKIHOP but decreases in MEDHOP, suggesting difficulties in integrating cross-document information\n\n4. Key Architectural Differences:\n[6] The key difference lies in their architectures:\n- BiDAF employs iterative conditioning across multiple layers, making it better suited for integrating information across documents\n- Both models use bidirectional LSTMs and attention, but BiDAF's additional complexity appears to be beneficial for this multi-hop task\n\nIn conclusion, BiDAF demonstrates consistently superior performance compared to FastQA across both datasets, with particularly strong results when given only relevant documents. This superiority is attributed to BiDAF's more sophisticated architecture for handling cross-document information integration, though both models still fall significantly short of human performance [4]."}

Architecture Design:\n![Neural network architecture showing character and word-level embedding integration](image3)\nThe architecture clearly shows how both character embeddings and word embeddings are processed separately and then combined to create richer representations before being fed into the Bi-LSTM layer.\n\n3.

Core Pre-processing Components:\n![Pre-processing workflow showing cropping and object detection boxes](image8)\nAccording to [8], the pre-processing involves two key steps:\n- Cropping: Images are cropped based on proposal bounding box coordinates\n- Blurring: Non-target areas around objects of interest are blurred\n\n2. Purpose and Benefits:\n[8] explains that this pre-processing is particularly important because \"unlike image classification tasks where objects of interest generally appear large and centrally positioned, the objects within object detection datasets are smaller and their positions more varied.\"\n\n3. Adaptation Strategy:\n[7] provides important insights about the pre-processing optimization:\n- \"A proper amount of blurring can significantly improve classification accuracy\"\n- \"For objects with different scales, different crop scales should be adapted to maximize classification accuracy\"\n\n4. System Architecture Integration:\n![System architecture showing retrieval and ranking pipeline](image5)\nThe pre-processing step is integrated into the larger system where:\n- Processed images are fed into the image encoder\n- The encoded features are then used for retrieval and ranking [1]\n\n5. Performance Impact:\n[7] indicates that these pre-processing adaptations were validated on both the LVIS training set and other detection datasets like V3Det, demonstrating their generalizability.\n\nIn conclusion, the pre-processing step contributes significantly by optimizing the input images through strategic cropping and blurring, which helps direct the model's attention to relevant objects and accommodates varying object scales and positions, ultimately improving the zero-shot recognition performance."}

Among all models shown, the Cognitive Graph model achieves the highest Open F1 score of 48.87 [5].\n\nThe significance of this result can be understood through several key points:\n\n1. Even with the highest score of 48.87, the open-domain setting remains challenging, as indicated by the relatively low performance compared to the distractor setting scores which are typically above 65 F1 [12].\n\n2. The open-domain setting's difficulty is largely attributed to retrieval challenges [5]. As stated in the text: \"We largely attribute this to the insufficiencies of standard TF-IDF retrieval for multi-hop questions... future work can explore better retrieval methods for multi-hop questions\" [5].\n\n3. The performance gap between open-domain and distractor settings is substantial. For example, the single-paragraph BERT model achieves 67.08 F1 in the distractor setting but only 38.40 F1 in the open-domain setting [1].\n\nTherefore, while the Cognitive Graph model achieves the highest Open F1 score of 48.87, this performance still indicates significant room for improvement in open-domain question answering, particularly in developing better retrieval methods for multi-hop questions."}

Early Foundations (2009-2010):\n- The conceptual groundwork was laid with the introduction of distributional methods for detecting semantic shifts quantitatively. Jurgens and Stevens proposed the influential concept of \"Word:Semantic Vector:Time tensor\" [1].\n\n2. Google Ngrams Impact (2011):\n- The release of Google Books Ngrams corpus marked a significant turning point, launching the field of 'culturomics' [12].\n- Gulordava and Baroni successfully compared word meanings between the 1960s and 1990s [12].\n\n3. Word Epoch Disambiguation (2012):\n- Mihalcea and Nastase developed methods to detect time spans for specific word contexts undergoing shifts [3].\n\n4. Prediction-based Models (2014):\n- Kim et al. made a breakthrough by introducing prediction-based word embedding models for tracking semantic shifts [10].\n\n5. Modern Embedding Approaches (2015-2016):\n- Hamilton et al. demonstrated that SGNS (Continuous Skipgram with negative sampling) outperformed traditional PPMI-based models [10].\n- Various corpora were employed, including COHA and English Gigaword [8].\n\n6. Laws of Semantic Change (2016-2017):\n- Researchers discovered statistical patterns in semantic change, including the 'law of prototypicality' [6].\n\n![Timeline showing major developments in diachronic semantic shift research from 2010 to 2017](image1)\n\nThe period from 2010 to 2017 represents a transformation from basic distributional methods to sophisticated embedding-based approaches, with significant advancements in both methodology and theoretical understanding of semantic shifts [5]."}

The CD8+ T cell recognizes infected liver cells through two main interactions:\n- The Class I/CD8 receptor interaction\n- The Fas/FasR binding\n\n2. The CD8+ T cell then responds by:\n- Releasing perforin and granzymes\n- Producing IFN-γ (interferon gamma)\n\n3. These immune responses lead to:\n- The death of the infected liver cell\n- Apoptosis (programmed cell death) of the parasite\n\nThis mechanism is part of the broader research efforts at NMRC, where scientists are investigating \"the liver stage of infection as a vaccine target\" [1, 5]. The illustration demonstrates how the body's immune system naturally fights malaria infection at the cellular level, which is crucial knowledge for developing effective vaccines and treatments.\n\nThe immune system's targeting of malaria parasites represents a critical area of research in developing protective measures against malaria infection, especially for military personnel deployed in malaria-endemic regions."}

The Analytics Value Chain Process:\n![A diagram showing the progression from Data through Reporting, Analysis, Action to Value](image2)\nThe analytics value chain demonstrates how raw data needs to flow through multiple stages to generate value [1]. This isn't just about collecting and analyzing data - it must lead to action and impact to be considered successful.\n\n2. Levels of Analytics Maturity:\n![A progression chart showing the evolution from basic Business Intelligence to advanced Business Analytics](image7)\nThe levels of analytics show increasing sophistication in how organizations use data:\n- Starting with descriptive analytics (standard reports, ad-hoc queries)\n- Moving to diagnostic analytics (statistical analysis)\n- Advancing to predictive analytics and optimization\n\n3. Integration of Both Concepts:\n![A comparison table showing the progression from descriptive reporting to prescriptive analysis](image5)\nThe two frameworks complement each other because:\n- The value chain provides the process flow (how to move from data to value)\n- The levels of analytics show the sophistication of analysis possible at each stage\n- Together they create a framework for delivering increasingly sophisticated insights [2]\n\n4.

Closure [11]: \nThe 'G' and 'T' letters in the design use incomplete shapes, yet our mind completes these forms naturally. As the quote states, \"We tend to perceive objects such as shapes, letters, pictures, etc., as being whole when they are not complete.\" [11]\n\n![The word GESTALT demonstrates multiple Gestalt principles through creative letter designs](image2)\n\n2. Similarity [10]:\nThe striped pattern used in both 'T' and 'LT' creates a visual connection through similar textures, demonstrating how \"objects that are similar in shape and color as belonging to part of a group.\" [10]\n\n3. Proximity [1]:\nThe letters are carefully spaced to create distinct groupings, showing how \"we tend to see objects that are visually close together as belonging to part of a group.\" [1]\n\n4. Continuity [3]:\nThe flow between letters, particularly in how the 'S' connects to the 'T', demonstrates how \"Elements of objects tend to be grouped\" [3] to create a continuous visual flow.\n\nThe design effectively demonstrates how \"this meaning created by perception implies a global regularity, which is often mentally prioritized over spatial relations\" [4], making the word both a demonstration and explanation of Gestalt principles in visual design."}

Competitive Consumption Scenario:\n![Hot dog eating competition showing different utility patterns](image2)\nIn competitive scenarios, the utility pattern changes dramatically, where consuming large quantities (64-66 hot dogs) can result in extremely high utility (+5000 to +10000) due to winning competitions, despite the physical discomfort.\n\nThis pattern implies several things about consumption behavior:\n\n1. Standard consumption follows diminishing marginal utility [6]: \"Variety is important because diminishing marginal utility changes preferences. When enjoyment drops we should switch to another choice.\"\n\n2. In specialized cases, focused consumption can lead to [2]: \"Improved activity experience due to accumulated skill consumption capital\" and \"Improved activity outcome due to cumulative experience.\"\n\nThe key implication is that rational consumers should:\n1. In normal situations: Stop consuming when marginal utility approaches zero (around the 3rd hot dog in our example)\n2. In competitive/specialized scenarios: Continue consumption despite negative physical utility if the outcome utility (winning, achievement) outweighs the discomfort\n\nThis aligns with behavioral economics principles showing how context can dramatically alter consumption utility and optimal behavior patterns."}

Performance Gap: The actual MQL to SAL conversion rate (6.67%) is significantly lower than the benchmark range (45-75%) [7], indicating a major disconnect between marketing qualification criteria and sales acceptance standards.\n\n2. Lead Quality Issues: The low conversion rate suggests potential problems with:\n- Marketing qualification criteria may be too lenient [10]\n- Misalignment between marketing and sales teams on what constitutes a qualified lead\n- Poor lead scoring implementation [4]\n\n3. Cost Implications: The low conversion rate impacts the overall return on marketing investment, as shown in image8:\n![Marketing metrics showing investment and revenue ratios](image8)\nThis affects the Investment-to-Pipeline ratio (1% to 4%) and ultimately the Investment-to-Revenue metrics.\n\nThe key finding is that there is a significant opportunity to improve the MQL to SAL conversion rate by better aligning marketing and sales criteria for lead qualification and implementing more effective lead scoring methodologies to bridge the current performance gap."}
