This reflects a political landscape that is both polarized and diverse within the Latino population.\n\nIn summary: While most Latinos—especially immigrants, Spanish-dominant, Catholic or evangelical, and older adults—feel Democrats make greater efforts to earn their vote, fewer see the same from Republicans, and perceptions of party differences vary by education, language, and nativity, highlighting a complex and divided political landscape among Latinos."}

Such integration not only enables seamless transactions but also enhances the consumer experience by providing flexibility and convenience in payment choices. \n\n![Shift from Cash on Delivery to digital payments and emergence of 3rd party wallets.](image6)\n\nAccording to the evidence, CoD is projected to drop from 60% in 2013 to 50% in 2016, while debit card usage increases, EMI options gain traction, and wallets emerge as a new, popular choice.

The foundational two-sided platform model emphasizes the need to balance supply and demand while focusing on widest selection, great shopping experience, and strategic pricing—not just discounts—as critical success factors:\n\n![E-commerce models must balance supply and demand, driven by selection, experience, and pricing, not just discounts.](image5)\n\nE-commerce platforms should thus optimize their supply to favor categories yielding higher gross margins even if their transaction volumes are lower, as this supports profitability. At the same time, maintaining a wide selection, including low-margin, high-volume categories, is also necessary to drive customer acquisition and engagement. This duality creates a need to strategically manage both supply (which products to stock and promote) and demand (using retention and experience, not just discounts) to maximize the platform's overall value proposition [1].\n\n**In summary:** Categories with the highest transaction volumes in online retail do not necessarily deliver the highest gross margins; this discrepancy underscores the need for e-commerce models to balance high-value and high-volume categories, focusing on both profitability and customer experience to optimize the supply and demand relationship."}

In the standard setting, models have access to all support documents, including irrelevant ones; in the gold chain condition, only the relevant documents leading to the correct answer are provided.

According to detailed ablation studies, not using spatial positional encodings causes a substantial performance drop (AP decreases from 40.6 to 32.8, a loss of 7.8 points). Using sine spatial encodings at the attention layers in both encoder and decoder achieves the highest AP of 40.6, while variants that apply positional encodings less frequently or use learned encodings give slightly lower, but similar, AP values. This demonstrates the importance of injecting positional information into the model at every layer for optimal detection performance[6][8].\n\n![Passing spatial positional encodings at each attention layer in encoder and decoder achieves the highest AP of 40.6, while omitting them causes a large drop.](image3)\n\n### Loss Components\n\nThe loss function configuration is also essential. Including the class (classification loss), ℓ₁ (bounding box regression loss), and GIoU (generalized IoU loss) terms in the loss yields the best AP (40.6). Omitting either the ℓ₁ or GIoU terms results in a noticeable decrease (with AP dropping to 35.8 when only ℓ₁ is used, and 39.9 when only GIoU is omitted)[7].\n\n![Including class, ℓ₁, and GIoU losses together gives the highest AP, while reducing losses causes AP to drop.](image7)\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn summary, DETR-DC5 achieves the highest Average Precision when spatial positional encodings are added at every encoder and decoder attention layer, and when all key loss components (class, ℓ₁, and GIoU) are used.

For InstructGPT, the model frequently displays a lack of confidence, tending to classify supported or refuted claims as 'NEI', which results in an over-use of the NEI label and under-recognition of clear evidence for support or refutation [5][6]. In contrast, GPT-4 is more overconfident: it tends to mislabel true NEI claims as either supported or refuted, thus failing to acknowledge when information is insufficient (a crucial aspect for scientific integrity) [5]. This is illustrated by their respective confusion matrices, where InstructGPT’s predictions are biased towards NEI, while GPT-4's NEI predictions are underrepresented even when the claim merits it.\n\n![InstructGPT tends to over-predict NEI, while GPT-4 tends to under-predict NEI, mistakenly classifying NEI claims as supported or refuted.](image7)\n\nThe underlying reasons for these errors are multifaceted:\n- For InstructGPT, the difficulty lies in confidently discriminating between verifiable (supported/refuted) and unverifiable (NEI) claims, causing it to err on the side of caution [5][6].\n- For GPT-4, the challenge is the opposite: its overconfidence leads it to decide support or refutation even when the evidence is lacking for an appropriate verdict [5].\n- In general, distinguishing between 'refuted' and 'NEI' is especially challenging due to the subtlety and ambiguity of scientific claims; this impacts model confidence and prediction accuracy, a difficulty even faced by human annotators [6][9].\n- Another technical aspect is the grounding of claims, i.e., mapping claims precisely to the relevant table content. Errors in grounding and handling claim ambiguity are pronounced and account for a large proportion of mistakes in NEI classification [2][6].\n\nThese findings are supported by the error type analysis, which shows that grounding errors (incorrectly linking claims to table data) and ambiguity errors (difficulty with unclear claim phrasing) significantly hinder correct NEI classification.\n\n![Grounding errors and ambiguity errors are the largest categories of error contributing to misclassification.](image6)\n\nIn summary, InstructGPT often defaults to the NEI label due to lower confidence, while GPT-4 tends to overlook NEI claims due to overconfidence in finding evidence, and both are hindered by errors in grounding and ambiguity recognition when handling scientific claims in tables.\n\nThe main challenges for NEI classification are InstructGPT's cautious over-prediction of NEI and GPT-4's overconfident under-prediction, mainly caused by difficulties in claim grounding and handling ambiguity."}

The Collapsed tree approach exhibits both a steeper initial improvement and a higher plateau as context length increases. For example, at shorter contexts (~500 tokens), both methods show lower F1, but Collapsed tree rapidly achieves higher scores as the context lengthens and sustains this advantage throughout the range. This reflects Collapsed tree's greater flexibility: by evaluating all nodes at once rather than following a rigid layer-by-layer selection, it retrieves information matching the granularity required by the question, resulting in higher relevance and thus better downstream model performance [9, 1, 8].  \n![Collapsed tree retrieval yields higher F1 across all context lengths compared to Tree Traversal.](image1)\n\nIllustrating the two retrieval mechanisms, a diagram shows that Tree Traversal retrieves context by sequentially pruning from each level of the tree structure, while Collapsed tree flattens the tree, comparing all nodes directly and selecting the most relevant [7, 11].  \n![Diagram showing Collapsed tree retrieval selects from all nodes simultaneously, while Tree Traversal operates level-by-level.](image7)\n\nRegarding model metrics (ROUGE, BLEU, METEOR), the results table provides a side-by-side comparison.

The model's \"collapsed tree\" approach—where top nodes are gathered based on a token budget—outperforms simple tree traversal at all context lengths.

For zero-shot object recognition specifically, the method proves particularly impactful in rare class discovery under long-tailed distributions[10].\n\nIn summary:  \nRAR (LLaVA1.5) excels at both fine-grained visual recognition and zero-shot object recognition, but its relative gains are especially marked in fine-grained classification benchmarks and for rare class recognition in zero-shot settings, due to its retrieval and ranking approach that mitigates MLLM limitations in large, nuanced category spaces."}

For example, on the LVIS dataset—a benchmark for large-vocabulary detection—RAR with InternLM-XC2 outperforms the CLIP baseline by a margin of 6.4 percentage points in overall average precision (APall), achieving 57.1% versus 50.7% for the best CLIP variant[1]. Similar improvements are observed for the V3Det dataset, with up to a 1.5 percentage point gain on this highly challenging benchmark with 13,204 categories[1][4][5]. These numeric improvements illustrate RAR’s efficacy in handling both the breadth and nuance of categories in zero-shot settings.\n\n![RAR achieves higher AP on LVIS and V3Det compared to all CLIP baselines.](image2)\n\nAn even more striking benefit is visible when focusing on rare categories. The RAR models display up to 19.6 percentage points improvement in precision (APr) over CLIP for rare classes, reflecting their superior ability to accurately classify infrequent objects. This is attributed to their retrieval-augmented mechanism, which pools relevant information from an external memory, and then employs MLLMs to perform reranking and make more informed predictions—even for classes poorly represented in training data[5].\n\n![RAR dramatically improves precision for rare classes (APr), outperforming CLIP by a large margin.](image2)\n\nThe underlying reason for RAR’s superior performance lies in its two-step pipeline: CLIP is used as a retriever to find the most relevant candidate categories, and MLLMs subsequently rank them to produce final predictions. This hybrid approach leverages CLIP’s broad retrieval capabilities and MLLMs’ context-aware discrimination, allowing robust recognition in zero-shot scenarios with extremely large or fine-grained vocabularies[8][9][10].\n\nThis effectiveness is visually supported by summarized illustrations of RAR’s improvements in fine-grained and large-vocabulary recognition tasks, where it consistently outperforms baselines both in accuracy and average precision across datasets[1][3].\n\n![RAR consistently boosts classification and detection performance in zero-shot and few-shot scenarios.](image3)\n\nIn summary, RAR models consistently surpass baseline zero-shot recognition methods like CLIP, particularly excelling in rare and fine-grained object categories, thanks to their retrieval-augmented reranking framework[1][2][4][5][9].\n\nRAR models outperform baseline models in zero-shot object recognition by delivering significant accuracy and precision improvements, especially for large vocabularies and rare categories, through their retrieval and reranking pipeline."}

This is crucial because, unlike classification datasets where the object is generally large and centered, detection datasets feature multiple small objects in various positions. To further help the model focus, a blurring preprocessing is applied to non-target areas around each object, thus guiding attention to the relevant object within the region of interest [5].\n\n![Cropped and blurred object regions are used to focus on relevant detection areas.](image7)\n\nOnce the cropped and blurred sub-images are obtained, they are processed through an image encoder to extract feature embeddings for each object region. Instead of retrieving similar images, the system leverages CLIP’s image-text interaction to retrieve the most similar text/category labels corresponding to each object region [12]. The top-k category labels with the highest similarity to the extracted features are retrieved from a multimodal memory [10][11].\n\n![The multimodal retriever finds candidate text labels for each object region, enabling accurate object recognition.](image2)\n\nAfter retrieval, the candidate labels are presented to a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM), which then ranks these categories. The ranking prompt enables the MLLM to analyze and reorder the candidates based on their contextual appropriateness, leveraging its semantic understanding and prior knowledge to select the most likely object class [4][7]. This allows the system to move from a preliminary shortlist of relevant categories to a precise, contextually-aware final prediction.\n\n![The retrieved top-k categories for each object region are ranked by the MLLM, producing the final recognition result.](image6)\n\nIn summary, the multimodal retriever system in detection tasks:\n- Crops and preprocesses object regions with blurring,\n- Extracts feature embeddings for each region,\n- Retrieves the top-k candidate labels using image-text similarity,\n- Uses an MLLM to rank these candidates for final, context-sensitive recognition.\n\nThis pipeline allows accurate and efficient object recognition even in complex images with multiple, small, variably-located objects.\n\nFinal answer: The system preprocesses object regions, retrieves the most relevant candidate labels using image-text similarity, and employs an MLLM to rank these candidates, thereby ensuring accurate and context-aware object recognition in detection datasets."}

It also corrects 21.6% of errors from a pure RAG approach, with a low error introduction rate of 6.3% relative to RAG[3][10]. This demonstrates that for TimeQA, Step-Back + RAG is highly effective in improving upon both baseline and RAG approaches, with a significant portion of previously incorrect answers made correct.\n\n![In TimeQA, Step-Back + RAG corrects a high percentage of baseline and RAG errors with few new errors introduced.](image8)\n\nStrategyQA, however, exhibits more modest improvements. Here, Step-Back + RAG turns 15.4% of baseline errors into correct answers and fixes 12.7% of RAG errors, while introducing 6.1% and 4.4% new errors over the baseline and RAG respectively [9][11]. The improvements are present but not as pronounced as in TimeQA, indicating that while Step-Back + RAG still contributes value, the level of challenge or error types in StrategyQA limit its impact.\n\n![In StrategyQA, Step-Back + RAG produces smaller error reductions compared to TimeQA, reflecting the dataset’s multi-hop reasoning challenges.](image3)\n\nThe underlying reason for these differences ties back to the datasets’ task types and scales. TimeQA, a large-scale Knowledge QA dataset with over 5000 test examples [8][image6], benefits particularly from Step-Back + RAG, since the approach helps clarify complex temporal or factual ambiguities that trip up baseline models. StrategyQA, much smaller in scale (229 examples) and focused on multi-hop reasoning, has more errors rooted in challenging logical or contextual steps that are less easily addressed simply by abstraction and information retrieval [8][image6]. As a result, the percentage of errors Step-Back + RAG can fix is lower in StrategyQA.\n\nIn summary, Step-Back + RAG is especially beneficial for large knowledge-based datasets like TimeQA, where its error-correcting potential is maximized, while the method provides more modest but still valuable improvements on smaller, reasoning-intensive datasets such as StrategyQA.\n\n**Direct and concise answer:**  \nStep-Back + RAG corrects a much higher proportion of errors in TimeQA than in StrategyQA, reflecting TimeQA’s large scale and knowledge-focused questions, whereas the smaller, reasoning-heavy StrategyQA dataset allows less room for Step-Back + RAG to make dramatic improvements."}

This approach has demonstrated both improved task performance and a distinct error profile compared to alternatives like Chain-of-Thought (CoT), simple retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and Take a Deep Breathe (TDB) prompting.\n\n### Task Performance Across Benchmarks\n\nEmpirical results across a range of benchmarks consistently show that Step-Back prompting—particularly when combined with RAG—achieves higher accuracy than baseline models and standard prompting methods. For example, on the TimeQA dataset, the combination of PaLM-2L with Step-Back + RAG reached 68.7% accuracy, greatly outperforming PaLM-2L with CoT (40.8%) and PaLM-2L with just RAG (57.4%) ([3], [8]). Similarly, on SituatedQA and other multi-hop reasoning tasks, Step-Back methods close the gap with or even surpass strong baselines like GPT-4 ([8], [10]).\n\n![Step-Back Prompting boosts accuracy on all tested benchmarks compared to other methods, such as CoT and RAG.](image2)\n\nThis improvement is robust even as the number of few-shot exemplars varies, highlighting that Step-Back prompting is sample-efficient and maintains high performance regardless of demonstration count ([5]).\n![Accuracy of Step-Back Prompting remains stable across varying numbers of few-shot exemplars.](image1)\n\nTabular results also reinforce this: Tables illustrate that Step-Back approaches achieve near or top accuracy in individual tasks like MMLU Physics, Chemistry, MuSiQue, and StrategyQA ([4], [5], [8]).\n![Step-Back Prompting achieves top results on MMLU and other benchmarks.](image4)\n![PaLM-2L + Step-Back + RAG achieves the best accuracy on challenging multi-hop tasks.](image5)\n![Across TimeQA and SituatedQA, Step-Back + RAG outperforms baselines and even rivals GPT-4.](image8)\n\n### Error Analysis\n\nStep-Back prompting not only corrects a significant portion of mistakes made by baseline models, but it does so while introducing relatively few new errors of its own. Specifically, Step-Back Prompting corrects 39.9% of the cases where the baseline is wrong, while only introducing errors in 5.6% of such cases ([6]). When paired with RAG, it also mitigates errors that the RAG-augmented model alone cannot fix ([6]).\n\n![Most prediction errors fixed by Step-Back Prompting are due to improved reasoning; only a small error rate is introduced.](image6)\n\nThe dominant sources of residual errors in Step-Back remain in reasoning and retrieval, but critical error analysis shows that the largest remaining failures are in reasoning, not in the abstraction process itself ([2], [6]). Step-Back prompting consistently reduces the incidence of \"baseline wrong\" errors, demonstrating its effectiveness.\n\nFurther, error distribution across task difficulties and the number of shots highlights Step-Back's robustness: both on easy and hard tasks, it sustains superior performance with minimal error introduction ([5], [7]).\n![Error rates remain low and accuracy stable for Step-Back Prompting across both easy and hard questions, suggesting consistent reliability.](image7)\n\n### Methodological Advantages\n\nThe qualitative mechanism underlying Step-Back's success can be seen in worked examples where abstraction leads to more principled, correct solutions compared to direct CoT reasoning that may get caught in misleading details ([3]).\n\n![Step-Back Prompting uses abstraction to surface key principles leading to correct answers, while standard CoT may get trapped in incorrect details.](image3)\n\n### Conclusion\n\nStep-Back prompting outperforms standard few-shot, CoT, TDB, and RAG approaches in both accuracy and error correction across diverse benchmarks. By focusing the model on high-level abstractions, it reliably fixes a substantial portion of baseline errors while introducing few new mistakes.\n\nIn summary: Step-Back prompting delivers superior task accuracy and robust error reduction over other prompting methods, especially in knowledge-intensive and multi-step reasoning benchmarks."}

However, combining Step-Back Prompting with RAG delivers even greater accuracy, emphasizing the synergy of abstraction and information retrieval [10][4].\n\nOn other knowledge-rich QA tasks (like MMLU Physics/Chemistry and SituatedQA), Step-Back Prompting continues to outperform both GPT-4 and all other prompting strategies, with improvements up to 7–11% in accuracy on MMLU sub-domains and moderate but meaningful gains on SituatedQA [2][7][12].

Over 90% of overall errors are attributed to reasoning or subsequent retrieval, indicating that while abstraction helps guide the process, reasoning and fact retrieval remain bottlenecks [6][5]. For instance, 52% of Step-Back's errors are pure reasoning mistakes, and 45% are failures in retrieval even when the abstraction is sound [5][6].\n\nPrinciple errors—failures in the abstraction itself—constitute a small minority (<10%) of total errors. Math errors and context losses represent additional, but smaller, sources of mistakes.\n\n![Step-Back Prompting errors are dominated by reasoning and retrieval failures, with only minor contribution from abstraction errors.](image1)\n\n### How Step-Back Prompting Works\n\nStep-Back Prompting operates in two phases: (1) generate an abstraction (a high-level principle or concept) from the original question, and (2) use this abstraction alongside retrieved facts to guide step-by-step reasoning toward the answer [2][11]. This method is illustrated below, where Step-Back helps correct errors that Chain-of-Thought alone could not solve:\n\n![Step-Back Prompting resolves complex reasoning tasks by explicitly abstracting key concepts, then using them as the foundation for multi-step deduction, reducing errors present in baseline approaches.](image6)\n\n### Summary Answer\n\nStep-Back Prompting, especially combined with retrieval augmentation, significantly improves accuracy across various QA benchmarks compared to GPT-4 and other prompting methods, with the most common error types being reasoning and retrieval failures, while abstraction errors are rare [1][2][4][5][6][7][10][11]."}

In the context of QQP, augmentation strategies include adding positive or negative samples, or both, affecting class balance.\n\nAs the evidence explains, balanced datasets tend to yield better performance, while imbalanced datasets (those skewed strongly towards negative or positive samples) can hurt model outcomes. For example, \"positive\" augmentation (adding more positive samples) and a combination of positive & negative samples lead to consistently better F1 and accuracy, while \"negative\" augmentation (adding more negative samples) leads to performance drops because of increased class imbalance [1], [5], [7].

However, the magnitude of improvement depends both on language similarity and the baseline system performance:\n\n![BLEU score improvements vary by language pair and similarity](image1)\n\nAs shown above, language pairs with more distant relationships (e.g., RU→PT and HE→PT) experience larger gains from pre-training compared to more similar pairs like ES→PT, FR→PT, and IT→PT. This is explained by the baseline BLEU score: systems with initially lower accuracy (i.e., more challenging languages) have more room for improvement and thus see a greater benefit from pre-training [1].\n\nTraining data size is another dominant factor. Pre-training gives the largest boost when there is some, but not too little, training data—the so-called \"sweet spot\" [4][12]. If the baseline system is too poor (i.e., with a BLEU score below about 3–4), limited data may hinder the effects of pre-trained embeddings, but with enough data to capture basic language characteristics, pre-training becomes highly effective.\n\n![BLEU increase from pre-training is greatest at moderate training set sizes](image2)\n\nIn the graph above, as training set size increases, the improvement obtained via pre-training (shown by the distance between dashed and solid lines and explicitly in the bottom plot) is most pronounced at lower-to-moderate data regimes and diminishes as more training data becomes available, since models trained on large datasets already achieve high accuracy [4].\n\nFurthermore, the similarity between languages plays a dual role. While more distant pairs show greater improvements initially due to lower baselines (as above), within multilingual systems—where multiple source languages are used and the encoder/decoder is shared—pre-training and explicit alignment of embedding spaces are most beneficial for similar language pairs [11][12]. This alignment is less critical in bilingual setups but helps significantly in multilingual ones as it allows the model to leverage similarities in the source languages more effectively [11][12].\n\nFinally, the benefits of pre-training are especially marked for rare words and low-resource settings, as it facilitates better generalization over the vocabulary:\n\n![Pre-training benefits are especially large for rare words](image4)\n\nPre-training aids translation of low-frequency words, as seen in the F-measure improvement, especially at lower frequencies [7].\n\nIn summary, pre-training word embeddings improves translation accuracy across language pairs, with the greatest relative benefits seen in settings with limited but sufficient training data and in language pairs that are either highly challenging (low baseline) in a bilingual context, or more similar in a multilingual, embedding-aligned context. Language similarity and dataset size together determine where the impact of pre-training will be most notable.\n\n**Direct answer:**  \nPre-training improves translation accuracy most in low-resource conditions and for language pairs that are either distant (with low baselines) or similar (in multilingual aligned settings), with the greatest gains occurring when the training data is limited but not too scarce, and benefits being particularly strong for rare words [1][4][7][11][12]."}

This performance advantage extends to datasets with overlapping entities as well, such as ACE04-O, ACE05-O, and GENIA, where DyGIE again achieves top entity extraction F1 scores—84.7, 82.9, and 76.2, respectively [7].\n\n![DyGIE achieves top or near-top F1 scores in entity and relation tasks across multiple datasets.](image1)\n\n![On overlapping entity extraction datasets, DyGIE outperforms previous methods significantly.](image6)\n\nAblation studies reveal the importance of DyGIE’s coreference and relation propagation mechanisms. Coreference propagation particularly enhances entity extraction, while relation propagation is especially beneficial for relation extraction. For instance, removing relation propagation ('-RelProp') reduces the relation F1 score in ACE data, underscoring its contribution, while entity F1 remains nearly unchanged. Meanwhile, coreference propagation mainly boosts entity F1, but can also slightly improve relation F1 depending on the dataset [6][11].\n\n![Coreference propagation improves entity F1, and relation propagation improves relation F1, especially for DyGIE.](image4)\n\nFurther, relation propagation brings greater improvements for sentences with more entities, indicating its ability to utilize broader context for relation extraction [2].\n\n![Relation propagation gives greater F1 boost as the number of entities in a sentence increases.](image2)\n\nIn summary, DyGIE achieves state-of-the-art results for both entity and relation extraction across various datasets, and its gains are primarily driven by effective propagation of contextual information through coreference (for entities) and relation (for relations) links."}

For example, on ACE04, DyGIE achieves an Entity F1 of 87.4 and Relation F1 of 59.7, surpassing previous top systems by notable margins.

Their effectiveness, however, depends on the dataset and specific task:\n\n- On relation extraction, RelProp offers clear benefits in both entity and relation F1, especially in datasets like ACE05 and SciERC where sentences contain multiple entities and relations. Dropping RelProp results in a notable decline in Relation F1 [8].\n\n- CorefProp provides mixed but often smaller gains in entity extraction compared to RelProp, and its effect also varies according to the presence of coreference information in the dataset. For instance, in SciERC where pronouns are generically labeled, CorefProp has limited impact [1][5].\n\n- In datasets where pronoun disambiguation is crucial, like ACE05, CorefProp brings measurable improvements for entity categorization, particularly for pronouns, where it improves performance by 6.6% [12].\n\nComparing models with and without these components across datasets underlines these findings:\n\n- On ACE05, removing CorefProp (-CorefProp) or RelProp (-RelProp) leads to lower F1 for entity and relation extraction, but RelProp has a larger effect on relation F1 [8].\n- In experiments with different iterations of propagation for CorefProp (N) and RelProp (M), optimal performance is achieved with moderate iterations, further confirming the value of propagation mechanisms.\n- DyGIE achieves higher F1 for entity and relation extraction than its base or ablated variants, demonstrating the value of its full architecture.\n\n![Relation propagation (RelProp) is crucial for relation extraction, especially as entities per sentence increase; CorefProp's impact is smaller but meaningful in certain contexts.](image4)\n\n![As the number of entities in a sentence increases, relation F1 improves significantly with RelProp activated.](image6)\n\n### Dataset and Task Properties\n\nThe effect of CorefProp and RelProp also hinges on the dataset's format and annotation details. For example, datasets with higher entity overlap or more coreference annotations (e.g., ACE04-O vs. ACE05-O) might benefit differently from these components.\n\n![Comparative table of datasets highlighting the presence of coreference annotations and overlap levels.](image1)\n\n### Summary\n\n- DyGIE achieves state-of-the-art entity and relation extraction results across diverse datasets.\n- RelProp is particularly valuable for relation extraction, especially in complex or dense sentence contexts.\n- CorefProp assists mainly in entity recognition for pronouns and datasets with meaningful coreference information.\n- Removing either component generally decreases performance, with RelProp having a more pronounced effect for relations.\n\nIn summary: DyGIE outperforms prior models across benchmarks, and while both CorefProp and RelProp contribute to its success, RelProp is especially critical for relation extraction, whereas CorefProp’s benefits are more context- and dataset-dependent."}

According to Figure 3a and Figure 3b, the best F1 performance for both entity and relation extraction occurs at the second iteration for each respective propagation module:\n\n- For entity extraction (CorefProp): The entity F1 increases up to two iterations (N=2) and then plateaus or decreases with more iterations, suggesting diminishing or negative returns beyond the optimal point [12].\n- For relation extraction (RelProp): Similarly, relation F1 peaks at the second iteration (M=2), indicating the model benefits most from a moderate amount of propagation, likely because excessive propagation may introduce noise or spurious connections [2].\n\n![Two iterations of CorefProp and RelProp yield the highest F1 scores for their respective tasks.](image3)\n\n### Effect Across Varying Numbers of Entities in a Sentence\n\nThe effect of different propagation modules also varies with sentence complexity, particularly the number of entities. Figure 4 shows that relation propagation provides the largest boost in relation F1 as the number of entities in a sentence increases:\n\n- With few entities, the benefit is minimal, but as entity count rises, the performance gap between models with and without RelProp widens.

The transfer of the LSTM and embedding layers tends to yield larger improvements than transferring the output layer, which is more task-specific. Notably, embedding transfer is particularly beneficial on datasets D3 and D4, likely because these datasets have highly unbalanced label distributions and fewer negative/neutral examples, so additional semantic information from document-level data helps remedy limited aspect-level training[8].\n\n![Ablation study table showing improvements when transferring LSTM and embedding layers, especially for D3 and D4](image4)\n\nSecond, comprehensive results comparing classic and proposed methods show that models utilizing pretraining (PRET), multi-task learning (MULT), or their combination (PRET+MULT) consistently outperform both standard LSTM and LSTM+ATT models on all datasets—demonstrating the strong effect of document-level knowledge transfer.

Slot similarity across domains drives the success of knowledge transfer: the more a slot is shared across domains, the better its zero-shot and few-shot tracking performance.\n\nIn summary: GEM outperforms EWC in avoiding catastrophic forgetting and enabling transfer to new domains, and shared slot similarity across domains is a key driver of successful adaptation and model performance."}

COMET Decoding Methods vs. Human Validation\n\nThe performance of different decoding strategies (random sampling, beam search, greedy decoding) can be contrasted directly with human validation scores using the results from the detailed evaluation:\n\n- Greedy decoding achieves a high average score (77.53), with particularly strong performance in categories like xNeed (85.60) and xReact (92.20).\n- Human validation of gold ATOMIC knowledge graphs achieves a substantially higher average (86.18), with almost all individual categories surpassing 80, and some (like xReact) reaching 95.18.\n- Beam search with increasing beams tends to lower overall average performance compared to greedy decoding and human validation.\n- Random sampling produces notably lower scores, especially with larger sampled sets.\n\nThis indicates that, while the best automatic (greedy decoding) methods approach but do not fully reach human-level quality, there remains a significant gap—highlighting the challenge of fully automating commonsense inference at a human level.\n\n![Greedy decoding approaches human validation, but humans are still clearly ahead in commonsense inference generation.](image5)\n\n### 2. Impact of Training Data Proportions on Metrics\n\nThe influence of the proportion of training data on COMET's performance can be clearly seen:\n\n- With **only 1% of training data**, the model’s BLEU-2 is low (5.08) and both novelty (N/T o) and uniqueness (N/U o) metrics are lower (7.24 and 49.36).\n- Using 10% of the data sees a significant leap in BLEU-2 (12.72), along with greater novelty (N/T o = 9.54, N/U o = 58.34).\n- Increasing to 50% and full training data continues to improve BLEU-2 and stabilize novelty/uniqueness.\n- Pre-training adds additional benefits over models trained from scratch with the same data.\n\n![Higher percentages of training data lead to better BLEU-2 scores and higher novelty and uniqueness in generations.](image8)\n\n### Conclusion\n\nGreedy decoding is the best automatic approach but still falls short of human validation in generating commonsense inferences, and increasing the amount of training data leads to higher quality and more novel model generations."}

The most relevant results are summarized as follows:\n\n- LSTM-s and CKBG baselines achieve classifier scores of 60.83 and 57.17, respectively, with high novelty in full tuples (N/T sro ≈ 86.25) but much lower novelty in object generation (N/T o ≈ 8%); their human-evaluated plausibility is relatively low (63.86 and 53.95) [5].\n- COMET models, particularly the main COMET model, dramatically outperform the baselines in both accuracy and quality: classifier score 95.25%, human evaluation at 91.69, and a high proportion of the generated tuples judged plausible [5]. However, COMET novelty in full tuples is lower (N/T sro 59.25), but still substantial, and novelty in object generation is 3.75%, indicating most novel knowledge comes from new edges rather than entirely new objects [1], [5].\n\n![COMET achieves high accuracy and produces a substantial proportion of novel tuples on ConceptNet compared to baselines.](image5)\n\n- COMET’s strong performance is confirmed both by classifier and human evaluation scores, highlighting its ability to reliably generate correct and novel commonsense knowledge [1][5]. For example, empirical analysis found 59.25% of generated tuples are novel (not present in the training set), and human judges rate 91.7% as correct [1][11]. \n- While baselines generate more structurally novel sro tuples, their quality and plausibility are noticeably lower [5].\n\nThis implies that COMET is highly effective for automatic knowledge base completion, striking a strong balance between accuracy and novelty, with generated knowledge that is both correct and original, and approaches or even matches human-level performance [1][4][5].\n\nTo summarize:  \nCOMET substantially outperforms baseline models on ConceptNet in accuracy and quality of generated knowledge, and achieves a high degree of novelty in forming new tuples, indicating it is highly effective for commonsense knowledge base construction."}

The choice of backoff strategy—Pass-Through, Background, or Neutral—affects both WER and the model’s sensitivity to adversarial perturbations.\n\nClosed vocabulary models tend to have much lower sensitivity than open vocabulary models, regardless of backoff strategy. For instance, as shown by the sensitivity metric (the number of unique outputs resulting from perturbations):\n\n- With pass-through backoff, closed vocab models show sensitivity around 11.3, whereas open vocab models have much higher sensitivity, as seen with values up to 30.3.\n- The neutral backoff reduces sensitivity to a minimum (11.3) for both types, but the reduction is much more pronounced for open vocab models, bringing their sensitivity close to that of closed vocab models [8, 6].\n- Background backoff leads to slightly higher sensitivity than neutral for both, but still less than pass-through in open vocab settings.\n\nFor word error rate:\n\n- The background backoff strategy generally yields the lowest WER, especially in open vocab models, compared to pass-through and neutral.\n- Closed vocabulary models' WER values are consistently lower across all backoff types (e.g., around 11.3 for neutral), but the difference is especially stark in open vocab models where pass-through causes much higher WER (up to 30.3), while neutral and background significantly reduce it [6, 7].\n- Sensitivity is a more dominant factor for robustness than WER when both are already low, and the best defense combines low sensitivity and WER [12, 5].\n\nThis relationship is visualized in an empirical study, where open vocab models with pass-through backoff exhibit the highest sensitivity and consequently lower robustness, despite sometimes having similar WER [3].\n\n![Closed vocab models show low sensitivity and modest WER while open vocab models' sensitivity drops sharply only with neutral backoff.](image6)\n\n![Empirical data shows background backoff has the lowest WER, neutral has lowest sensitivity, critical for robustness.](image3)\n\nIn summary: Closed vocabulary models always have low sensitivity, while open vocabulary models achieve low sensitivity only with neutral or background backoff. The background backoff gives the lowest WER, most notably in open vocab models. Neutral backoff ensures the lowest sensitivity across model types, which is crucial for robustness.\n\nTherefore, closed vocabulary models are less sensitive and slightly more robust by default, while open vocabulary models require careful backoff (especially neutral) to achieve low sensitivity and maximize robustness."}

Both BiDAF and FastQA are LSTM-based extractive QA models adapted for multi-document reasoning by concatenating all relevant documents into a single superdocument with separator tokens [11].\n\nPerformance Overview:\n\n- Under standard conditions, BiDAF consistently outperforms FastQA on both WikiHop and MedHop, regardless of whether masking is applied [11][5][6]. This superiority is attributed to BiDAF’s iterative latent interactions, which are particularly valuable when information is distributed across several documents [5].\n- When only relevant documents are provided (the \"gold chain\" setup), both models' performance increases markedly, especially BiDAF, which reaches up to 85.7% on WikiHop and 100.0% on MedHop in the masked gold chain scenario. FastQA also improves, but not as dramatically [12].\n\n![Comparison of BiDAF and FastQA accuracy under standard, masked, and gold chain conditions for WikiHop and MedHop](image1)\n\n- In masked setups (where answer expressions are replaced by random tokens), both models leverage contextual information rather than lexical cues. BiDAF remains significantly stronger than FastQA, especially in WikiHop, suggesting it is more robust to masking and noise in candidate expressions [9].\n\nWhy the Difference?  \n- BiDAF leverages iterative conditioning and bidirectional attention, making it better equipped for integrating information scattered across documents, while FastQA, with fewer latent interactions, has more difficulty with cross-document inference [6][8].\n\nEffect of Masking Out Non-Relevant Documents:  \n- When non-relevant documents are removed, the performance of both models drops, but more so for BiDAF—evidence that BiDAF relies more on synthesizing information across multiple documents [8].  \n![Removing non-relevant documents causes greater performance drops for BiDAF than FastQA, especially in MedHop](image2)\n\nSummary Table:\n\n- In standard test conditions for WikiHop:\n  - BiDAF: 42.9% accuracy (standard test), 54.5% (masked test)\n  - FastQA: 25.7% accuracy (standard test), 35.8% (masked test)\n- In MedHop:\n  - BiDAF: 47.8% (standard), 33.7% (masked)\n  - FastQA: 23.1% (standard), 31.3% (masked)\n- With gold chains (only relevant documents), BiDAF’s lead widens substantially.\n\nDirect Answer:  \nBiDAF consistently outperforms FastQA across both datasets and all test conditions, with its advantage most pronounced when integrating information across multiple documents or when answers are masked, likely due to its more sophisticated attention and interaction mechanisms."}

In the standard test setup, BiDAF achieves higher accuracy than FastQA: for WIKIHOP, BiDAF scores 42.9% (standard) and rises to 54.5% in the masked condition, while FastQA scores 25.7% (standard) and 35.8% (masked) [12][4].

This gap highlights that both models benefit greatly from the removal of distractor documents, with BiDAF gaining even more than FastQA. This setup demonstrates the models' capacity to accurately identify answers when irrelevant content is eliminated, but also indicates that their real-world robustness depends significantly on effective document selection. \n\n![BiDAF and FastQA show much higher performance on both datasets when given only relevant documents; BiDAF achieves the highest gains, especially in the masked gold chain setting.](image3)\n\nIn summary, BiDAF consistently outperforms FastQA, and both models perform far better when only relevant documents are provided; the gap is especially pronounced for BiDAF in the most supportive (\"gold chain, masked\") setup [1][12].\n\n**Direct answer:** BiDAF outperforms FastQA across both datasets and all test conditions, with both models showing dramatically higher accuracy when only relevant documents are provided, especially under the gold chain masked setting."}

Capital expenditures (Capex) decreased significantly, dropping from $31.1 billion in 2019 to $21.4 billion in 2020, as shown in the total Capex for the year [12]. This decline was observable across different divisions, such as a reduction in downstream capital investments from $4.4 billion to $4.2 billion and chemicals from $3.2 billion to $2.7 billion [10][12].

The program is indefinite, with substantial liquidity requirements, and in 2021 alone, $27.1 billion was spent on share buybacks [12]:\n\n> \"Berkshire paid $27.1 billion in 2021 to repurchase shares of its Class A and B common stock.\" [12]\n\nRepurchases in the fourth quarter of 2021, for example, included millions of Class B shares and thousands of Class A shares, at average prices ranging from about $282.86 to $439,625.92 per share, demonstrating a significant commitment to buybacks as a capital allocation strategy:\n\n![Substantial share repurchases of Class A and B stock took place each month in Q4 2021.](image7)\n\n### Net Earnings Across Different Segments (2019–2021)\n\nBerkshire Hathaway’s net earnings varied widely across segments and years, affected by external challenges such as the COVID-19 pandemic, but rebounded strongly in 2021.\n\n#### Segment Performance\n\nThe table below shows net earnings by segment (in millions):\n\n![Net earnings by segment from 2019 to 2021, showing major fluctuations and a strong rebound in 2021.](image4)\n\nKey trends:\n- **Insurance – Underwriting**: Improved from $325M in 2019 to $728M in 2021, with significant variability due to catastrophe events and pandemic impacts [9].\n- **Insurance – Investment Income**: Declined each year due to falling interest rates, from $5,530M in 2019 to $4,807M in 2021 [6].\n- **Railroad, Utilities, and Energy**: Railroad earnings fell in 2020 but recovered in 2021; utilities and energy grew steadily each year [10].\n- **Manufacturing, Service, and Retailing**: Earnings dropped in 2020 due to the pandemic but increased markedly in 2021, surpassing pre-pandemic levels [7].\n- **Investment and Derivative Gains/Losses**: Highly volatile, with a dramatic drop in 2020 followed by a rebound in 2021, due in part to market fluctuations, impairments, and foreign exchange effects [3].\n- **Total Net Earnings**: $81,417M in 2019, fell to $42,521M in 2020, and surged to $89,795M in 2021, reflecting pandemic recovery and strong segment rebound.\n\n#### Additional Context\n\nThe pandemic in 2020 severely impacted most segments, especially manufacturing and retail.

Let's break down the changes in both operating income and core operating income, and identify the main contributing factors.\n\n### 1. Operating Income\n\nIn 2021, Sandoz's operating income increased substantially compared to the previous year. Operating income rose from $1,043 million in 2020 to $1,600 million in 2021, a 53% increase in USD (48% in constant currencies).\n\n![Sandoz's operating income rose from $1,043 million in 2020 to $1,600 million in 2021, a 53% increase in USD.](image3)\n\nThis significant increase was mainly driven by lower legal settlements, lower impairments, and lower amortization. These positive effects were only partly offset by unfavorable gross margin and lower sales, while currency had a small positive impact. As a result, Sandoz’s operating income margin increased by 5.8 percentage points to 16.6% of net sales from continuing operations during this period [6].\n\n### 2. Core Operating Income\n\nConversely, Sandoz's core operating income decreased. Core operating income dropped from $2,334 million in 2020 to $2,064 million in 2021, representing a 12% decrease in USD (14% decline in constant currencies).\n\n![Sandoz’s core operating income declined from $2,334 million in 2020 to $2,064 million in 2021, a 12% decrease.](image2)\n\nThis decrease can be attributed to weaker sales performance, particularly impacted by the pandemic—delays in cancer care and a weak flu season diminished generics sales [2]. Although Sandoz benefited from biopharmaceutical sales (which grew 10% in USD), the decline in retail generics and anti-infectives offset this growth, resulting in flat overall net sales for Sandoz in 2021 compared to 2020.\n\n![Total Sandoz net sales remained almost flat, with a marginal decrease from $9,646 million in 2020 to $9,631 million in 2021.](image6)\n\n### Main Contributing Factors\n\n- **Operating Income Increase**: Driven mainly by reduced legal settlements, impairments, and amortization expenses, with only partial offset from lower sales and gross margin [6].\n- **Core Operating Income Decrease**: Attributable to lower sales, specifically due to ongoing pandemic-related impacts on generics and oncology, despite some growth in biopharmaceuticals [2].\n\nIn summary, Sandoz's 2021 operating income improved due to lower non-core expenses, but core operating income decreased due to pressure on sales from pandemic effects and generics market challenges."}

The effective tax rate also rose:\n- 2018: 22.3%\n- 2019: 20.8%\n- 2020: 24.0%\n\nSeveral factors contributed to this increase, including higher pre-tax earnings, changes in health insurance tax, and certain compensation items. Notably, the \"Health insurance tax\" reappeared in 2020 after being absent in 2019, adding $626 million (or 3.0%) to the 2020 tax provision, which is a significant driver of the increase.[6]\n\n![Table showing tax provision breakdown and effective rates for 2018-2020, with rising totals and an uptick in effective rate in 2020.](image1)\n\n#### Breakdown Between Current and Deferred Taxes\n\nMost of the tax provision consists of current provisions (actual taxes payable), with minor impact from deferred (future) taxes:\n- Current provision increased dramatically from 2019 ($3,512 million) to 2020 ($4,981 million).\n- The deferred provision, however, shifted from a positive value in 2019 (+$230 million) to a slight benefit in 2020 (-$8 million) and was small in 2018 (+$42 million).[9]\n\n![Table showing current and deferred provision for income taxes from 2018-2020, highlighting a major increase in current provision and negligible deferred contribution in 2020.](image3)\n\n### Deferred Income Tax Assets and Liabilities\n\nDeferred income tax assets and liabilities arise from temporary differences between financial and tax reporting, and their net value affects future tax expense rather than current taxes. As of December 31, 2020:\n- Net deferred income tax liabilities: $(3,367) million in 2020, compared to $(2,993) million in 2019.\n- Total deferred tax assets grew from $2,868 million in 2019 to $3,391 million in 2020.\n- Total deferred tax liabilities also increased, from $5,861 million to $6,758 million.[3]\n\nMajor deferred tax assets include non-U.S. tax loss carryforwards and lease liabilities. Major deferred tax liabilities are due to intangible assets and lease right-of-use assets.\n\n![Table showing detailed components and balances of deferred income tax assets and liabilities for 2019 and 2020, indicating a growing net deferred tax liability.](image8)\n\nThe increasing net deferred tax liability suggests that, over time, the company expects to pay more in future taxes, although the impact on the provision for income taxes year-over-year has been minor from 2018–2020, as seen in the relatively small deferred tax provision in image3.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nFrom 2018 to 2020, the company's provision for income taxes trended upward, primarily due to higher current tax provisions, while the impact of deferred income tax assets and liabilities on these yearly provisions remained minor. The company's total net deferred tax liability is growing, suggesting higher future tax outflows, but this effect is not yet significant in recent annual provisions.\n"}

Specifically, 2020 saw lower net discrete tax benefits primarily due to fewer conversions of employee share-based awards as compared to the prior year, which contributed to the higher effective tax rate [3], [5].\n\n![Effective tax rate increased and net discrete tax benefit decreased from 2019 to 2020.](image5)\n\nThe increase in the effective tax rate is directly connected with both a higher level of earnings and a reduction in net discrete tax benefits, which in 2020 were primarily related to the conversion of employee share-based awards [3]. Net discrete tax benefits in 2019 were notably higher, partly due to the resolution of multi-jurisdiction tax examinations and more significant conversions of employee share-based awards [8], [10], [12].\n\nDuring this same period, compensation and benefits expenses rose by 11%, driven primarily by increased discretionary incentive compensation, higher Wealth Management representative payouts due to higher revenues, and incremental compensation from the E*TRADE acquisition [1].

This loan growth was strong but somewhat less than the growth in billed business, partially due to high paydown rates by cardholders [7].\n- The credit loss reserve for loans decreased by 38%, from $5,344 million to $3,305 million, reflecting improved portfolio quality and macroeconomic outlook, including better unemployment forecasts, but partially offset by higher loan balances [11]. Net write-off rates on loans dropped sharply from 2.4% in 2020 to 0.9% in 2021, indicating better credit performance.\n- Card member receivables increased 23% year-over-year, from $43.7 billion to $53.6 billion.

Operating profit changes varied but generally mirrored net revenue growth, with exceptions, as some segments experienced sharper declines due to cost increases or pandemic effects (e.g., LatAm).\n\n### Distribution of Beverage vs. Food/Snack Categories\n\nThe next key point is how the revenue mix between beverage and food/snack categories breaks down by division:\n\n![The division of beverage and food/snack revenue in 2020 remained constant for PepsiCo overall at 45% beverage and 55% food/snack, but regional mixes varied widely, with LatAm and APAC highly skewed to food/snack, and Europe more balanced.](image6)\n\n- **PepsiCo (Overall):** The mix stays stable at 45% beverage, 55% food/snack from 2018 to 2020.\n- **LatAm and APAC:** Both are heavily tilted toward food/snack (90% and 75% respectively in 2020), consistent over these years.\n- **Europe:** Roughly balanced, at 55% beverage and 45% food/snack in 2020 (with minor changes since 2018).\n- **AMESA:** Shifts slightly toward food/snack (from 55% in 2018 to 70% in 2020).\n\n### Relationship Between Category Distribution and Division Performance\n\n- **Profitability and Category Mix:** FLNA, with a full food/snack focus, shows strong growth in both revenue and operating profit, indicating high profitability for snack products. PBNA (main beverage division) grows in revenue but its operating profit has declined, reflecting either higher costs or lower profitability in the beverage segment despite revenue gains.\n- **Regional Variations:** Divisions skewed toward snacks (LatAm and APAC) have high stability in category mix, but their operating profit does not grow as rapidly, suggesting market or cost pressures specific to those regions.\n- **European Market:** The European division’s balanced split and consistent net revenue/operating profit growth may imply benefits from diversification.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nFrom 2018 to 2020, net revenue increased across most divisions, with the strongest operating profit growth found in food/snack-heavy segments like FLNA. Beverage categories showed revenue growth but generally lower or flat operating profit, highlighting the differing profitability and market dynamics between categories. Stable overall category mix but some regional shifts point to division-level strategy and market differences influencing performance.\n\n**In summary:** Divisions with a higher focus on food/snacks, such as FLNA, achieved stronger and more stable operating profit growth compared to beverage-heavy or mixed divisions, evidencing that product category mix significantly influences divisional financial performance."}

{"q_id": 511, "model": "gpt-4.1", "in_tok": 5989, "out_tok": 799, "total_tok": 6788, "response": "To compare derivative financial instruments and cash flow changes across 2020 and 2019, let's break down the provided data and analyze their impact on financial statements.\n\n### Derivative Financial Instruments\n\nIn 2020, the contract amount for derivative financial instruments was DKK 63,390 million, with a positive fair value of DKK 2,332 million and a negative fair value of DKK 1,365 million. In 2019, the contract amount was DKK 50,455 million, with respective fair values of 188 (positive) and 734 (negative) million. Most of the increase comes from forward contracts, especially in USD and CNH, JPY, GBP, and CAD, and a significant portion is recognized as cash flow hedges and fair value hedges.\n\n![Derivative financial instruments increased substantially in 2020, with higher contract amounts and fair values compared to 2019.](image6)\n\nThese instruments are reflected in the statement of financial position as assets or liabilities, depending on whether their fair value is positive or negative at year-end. Increases in fair value can lead to unrealized gains recognized in the income statement or other comprehensive income, depending on the hedge accounting treatment. Gains and losses on derivatives not designated as hedges impact the income statement directly as financial income or expenses [8]. When hedges are effective, gains and losses are initially recorded in equity and transferred to the income statement when the forecast transaction occurs, further affecting financial results [3].\n\n### Cash Flow Changes in Working Capital\n\nThe cash flow change in working capital for 2020 was negative DKK 4,353 million, a larger outflow compared to negative DKK 3,388 million in 2019. Key components included decreases in trade receivables and inventories, and increases in other liabilities.\n\n![Cash flow from changes in working capital showed a larger net outflow in 2020 than in 2019, mainly due to inventory and receivables movements.](image4)\n\nThis change reflects the operational aspect of cash management. A negative change means more cash is tied up in working capital, reducing the cash available for other uses such as investing or financing. This impact is seen in the cash flow statement under operating activities, indicating less free cash generated from operations during 2020 versus 2019 [12].\n\n### Impact on Financial Statements\n\n- **Statement of Financial Position**: Derivative assets and liabilities are recorded at fair value and can fluctuate significantly year to year, affecting total asset and liability balances [6].\n- **Income Statement**: Changes in the fair value of derivative instruments directly affect financial income and expenses if not hedged. For effective hedges, recognition is deferred to when the underlying transaction impacts the income statement [8], [3].\n- **Cash Flow Statement**: Working capital changes alter the cash from operating activities. More cash tied up in working capital reduces operational cash flow, impacting liquidity and potentially restricting investment or financing capability [12].\n\nIn summary:  \nIn 2020, both derivative financial instruments and working capital changes had a more pronounced effect on Novo Nordisk's financial statements, with derivatives increasing in volume and value, impacting both the balance sheet and income statement, while negative working capital changes reduced cash flows from operations.\n\nDirect answer: In 2020, Novo Nordisk saw a marked increase in derivatives activity and a greater cash outflow from working capital changes compared to 2019, affecting its financial position, income statement volatility (via fair value changes), and reducing operational cash flows.\n\nReferences: [3], [6], [8], [12].  \n![Derivative financial instruments increased substantially in 2020, with higher contract amounts and fair values compared to 2019.](image6)  \n![Cash flow from changes in working capital showed a larger net outflow in 2020 than in 2019, mainly due to inventory and receivables movements.](image4)"}

According to the available data, executive directors such as Mr. K.K. Modi, Mr. S.V. Shanbhag, Mr. Lalit Kumar Modi, and Mr. Samir Kumar Modi received a mix of salary, perquisites, and commissions, while non-executive directors primarily received sitting fees for attending board or committee meetings. Specifically, the highest paid was Mr. K.K. Modi, with a total remuneration of Rs. 10,000,000, comprising salary and commission. Non-executive directors like Mr. Lalit Bhasin, Mr. Anup N.

Remuneration to managing/executive/whole-time directors is decided by the board and recommended for shareholder approval at the Annual General Meeting [5].\n\nWhen considering the connection with financial performance and market conditions, auditors affirmed that the company’s accounts provided a true and fair view of its affairs and complied with applicable accounting standards for the year ending March 31, 2003 [1]. The directors also confirmed that the accounts were prepared prudently and on a going concern basis [11].\n\nFrom a market perspective, the company's share price saw fluctuations during the year—peaking in July at Rs. 420 and falling to Rs. 329 by March—reflecting a decline over the year [4]. Meanwhile, when normalized and compared to the BSE Sensex, GPI underperformed the broader market, with the GPI index declining from 100 in April 2002 to 84 in March 2003, while the Sensex remained relatively more stable at 93 [2].\n\n![The chart illustrates the decline in Godfrey Phillips' stock price relative to the BSE Sensex over 2002-03](image2)\n![Monthly high and low share prices of Godfrey Phillips for 2002-03, showing a downward trend](image4)\n\nIn summary, directors' remuneration in 2002-03 included fixed and variable components for executive directors and sitting fees for non-executive directors.

Despite these expenses, the net carrying amount of intangible assets rose sharply due to large additions, while PPE remained relatively stable due to ongoing capital investment.\n\n**Direct answer:** From 2019 to 2020, depreciation and impairment losses for PPE increased slightly and for intangible assets, amortisation rose while impairment losses fell; this resulted in a significant rise in the net carrying amount of intangible assets (due to major additions) and a stable net carrying amount of property, plant, and equipment."}

The provided data gives the following totals for Level 2 assets:\n\n- In 2022, Level 2 financial assets totaled **$561**.\n- In 2021, Level 2 financial assets totaled **$408**.\n\n![Level 2 assets totaled $561 million in 2022 and $408 million in 2021.](image6)\n\n### Long-term Debt\n\nLong-term debt includes various series of Senior Notes and other long-term borrowings, net of unamortized debt discounts and a current portion. The key reported numbers are:\n\n- As of 2022, total long-term debt (net of discounts and current portion) was **$6,484**.\n- As of 2021, total long-term debt (net of discounts and current portion) was **$6,692**.\n\n![Long-term debt, net of discounts and current portion, was $6,484 million in 2022 and $6,692 million in 2021.](image1)\n\n### Explanation of Differences\n\nThe increase in Level 2 assets from 2021 to 2022, rising by $153 (from $408 to $561), suggests the company may have increased its holdings of financial assets measured using Level 2 inputs, possibly to enhance liquidity or as part of its investment strategy[5][8].\n\nIn contrast, long-term debt decreased by $208 (from $6,692 to $6,484). This reduction is primarily due to the repayment of the $800 million 2.3% Senior Notes in 2021 and possibly other scheduled or early redemptions, as referenced by the company's practice of managing its long-term obligations[3][11]. The company also maintains flexibility to redeem debt early and adjust its capital structure, accounting for part of this decrease[6][12].\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn summary, from 2021 to 2022, Level 2 assets increased by $153 while long-term debt decreased by $208, reflecting the company's strategy to bolster its financial asset base and reduce overall indebtedness."}

For fiscal year 2021, changes in financial assumptions resulted in a loss of €26 million, while for fiscal year 2020, these changes produced a dramatic gain of €72 million. This swing was the largest driver of the difference in total actuarial gains and losses, moving from a total gain of €67 million in 2020 to a total loss of €22 million in 2021. This is directly visible in the actuarial gains and losses summary:\n\n![Changes in financial assumptions were the main contributor to a negative total actuarial result in 2021 and a positive one in 2020.](image1)\n\nSupporting this, the table of discount rates shows an increase in discount rates across most currencies from 2020 to 2021 (for example, from 1.5% to 1.7% overall, euro from 0.9% to 1.0%, and U.S. dollar from 2.4% to 2.7%), which typically reduces the present value of pension obligations and can lead to actuarial gains.

Thus, small changes in the discount rate have a substantial impact on actuarial results:\n\n![A change of half a percentage-point in discount rate causes a significant swing in defined benefit obligation.](image8)\n\nIn summary, the move from a large actuarial gain in 2020 to a loss in 2021 was primarily driven by the €98 million swing (from €72 million gain to €26 million loss) in the effect of changes in financial assumptions, with discount rate changes being a major contributing factor.\n\nTherefore, changes in financial assumptions—most importantly the discount rate—were the principal drivers behind the shift from positive actuarial gains in fiscal year 2020 to negative actuarial gains (losses) in fiscal year 2021."}

AUM stood at $603.0 billion at the start of 2021. However, after the November 1, 2021 sale of WFAM (with $587.1 billion of AUM divested in that transaction), Wells Fargo exited the asset management business, and period-end AUM attributable to WFAM was effectively zero:\n\n![WFAM assets under management dropped to zero following the business sale in November 2021](image8)\n\nThis divestiture had significant implications: it meant the loss of future asset-based fee income, altered the bank’s business mix, and allowed management to redeploy capital to core banking activities or new strategic priorities. As referenced in the text, the company realized a net gain of $269 million from the WFAM sale, and management viewed AUM as a key source of asset-based fees[5][4].\n\nStrategically, the asset stability coupled with the WFAM business sale points to a deliberate financial strategy: \n- Streamlining operations by divesting non-core businesses to enhance focus on core banking.\n- Maintaining a strong, stable asset base to support lending and other banking operations.\n- Monetizing asset management operations at an opportune time, likely aiming to improve capital efficiency and boost capital ratios, while preparing the bank for regulatory and market changes.\n\nIn summary:  \nThe modest decrease in total assets reflects asset optimization, while the sale of WFAM and corresponding AUM elimination allowed Wells Fargo to sharpen its financial strategy, concentrating on core operations and capital redeployment away from asset management."}

For the Euro (primarily relevant to Germany), the discount rate was 1.0% in 2021 (up from 0.9% in 2020), while for the U.S. dollar (relevant for the United States), it was 2.7% in 2021 (up from 2.4% in 2020)![Discount rates in Euro and USD increased from 2020 to 2021.](image1)[4].\n\n### Compensation Increase and Pension Progression\n\n- In the United Kingdom and Switzerland, compensation increases and pension progression were specifically detailed, but for Germany and the United States, the direct percentages are not shown in the table. However, pension progression for Germany remained at 1.5% for both years.[10] \n- Typically, the United States does not have significant compensation increases or pension progression in the actuarial assumptions due to plan-specific features (many U.S. plans are frozen to new accruals)[7].\n\n![Key variables such as compensation increase and pension progression by country and year.](image8)\n\n### Mortality and Demographic Assumptions\n\n- For Germany, Siemens-specific mortality tables are used, updated from Siemens Bio 2017/2020 to Siemens Bio 2017/2021 between 2020 and 2021, with data also from the Federal Statistical Office in Germany.[5]\n- For the United States, mortality assumptions rely on the U.S. Social Security Administration's Pri-2012 generational projection (unchanged year over year).[5]\n![Germany uses Siemens-specific tables; the U.S. uses SSA Pri-2012 generational projections.](image5)\n\n### Financial Impact and Actuarial Gains/Losses\n\n- The impact of actuarial gains and losses, separating demographic and financial assumption changes, shows a substantial fluctuation: Germany’s plans were affected by changes in actuarial assumptions as reflected by an overall net actuarial loss of €67 million in 2020 and a gain of €22 million in 2021. The breakdown shows that in 2021, Germany experienced a €8 million loss due to demographic changes and a €26 million loss from financial changes, while the U.S. would mainly be influenced by the financial assumption changes owing to the frozen nature of most of their plans.[6]\n![Actuarial gains and losses in 2021 were negative due to demographic and financial assumption changes.](image6)\n\n### Funding and Regulation\n\n- In Germany, the defined benefit plans use local actuarial tables and funding follows local regulation.[1][5]\n- In the United States, defined benefit plans are generally frozen for new entrants and accruals (except for interest credits on cash balance accounts) and have a regulatory minimum funding requirement of 80% to avoid benefit restrictions, governed by ERISA.[7]\n\n### Summary Table of Plan Obligations (for context)\n- As of fiscal year-end 2021, Germany had €2,033 million in defined benefit obligation versus the United States with €986 million. The associated fair value of plan assets for Germany was €1,318 million, and for the U.S., €948 million.[3]\n![Plan obligations and assets for Germany and the U.S. in 2021 and 2020.](image3)\n\n### Direct and Concise Answer\nGermany and the United States differ in their actuarial assumptions primarily in the discount rates used (lower in Germany, higher in the U.S.), the bases for demographic (mortality) assumptions, and the regulatory frameworks governing plan funding; in 2021, Germany used Siemens-specific mortality tables and a 1.0% discount rate, while the U.S. used SSA Pri-2012 mortality projections and a 2.7% discount rate."}

This may suggest impacts from broader market conditions.\n- **COVID-19 Pandemic:** The company acknowledged that the continuing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic had an impact and required them to evaluate their assets, though they found \"no triggering event\" for impairment in 2020. Still, market volatility could have pressured net income margins and overall profitability [1].\n- **Depreciation and Amortization:** Depreciation and amortization expenses, which grew steadily each year, would have also put some downward pressure on net income [4].\n- **Balance Sheet Strength:** Both Amberjack and Mars had strong equity positions, suggesting continued investment in these assets, with minor changes in current and non-current liabilities from 2018 to 2020 that could reflect financing or operational shifts ![Amberjack and Mars maintained healthy asset and equity balances throughout 2018-2020, though their liabilities grew slightly in 2020.](image8), ![Balance sheet data show continued investment in assets for Amberjack and Mars into 2020 with modest increases in liabilities.](image4).\n\n#### Summary Table\n\n| Year      | Amberjack Net Income | Mars Net Income |\n|-----------|---------------------|-----------------|\n| 2018      | $157M               | $154M           |\n| 2019      | $243M               | $179M           |\n| 2020      | $201M               | $163M           |\n\n**In conclusion:** Net income for Amberjack and Mars both increased significantly from 2018 to 2019, then decreased in 2020, likely as a result of the pandemic's economic effects and steadily increasing depreciation, though both remained above 2018 levels."}

COVID-19 impacts in 2020 contributed to the year-over-year volatility[8][12].\n\n#### 2. Corporate & Other\nThis segment showed negative and volatile Adjusted EBITDA:\n- 2019: $2 million\n- 2020: $32 million\n- 2021: -$65 million\n![Corporate & Other Adjusted EBITDA declined sharply in 2021](image5)\n\n- **Reason:** The segment includes central corporate costs. The sharp decline in 2021 was likely related to the winding down of cost savings initiatives after 2020’s pandemic-related severance, legal settlements, and ongoing investment in new initiatives such as Sky Glass and XClass TV[7][11].\n\n#### 3. International Segments\nSky and NBCUniversal (Media, Studios, Theme Parks) showed significant fluctuations:\n- Sky, for example, saw improved Adjusted EBITDA as revenue stabilized after the pandemic, supported by direct network costs and FX impacts:\n    - 2019: -$820 million\n    - 2020: -$1,785 million\n    - 2021: -$1,358 million\n![International segment shows negative but improving Adjusted EBITDA in 2021](image8)\n\n- **Reason:** Pandemic disruption in 2020 drove costs and reduced revenue (especially in theme parks and media). Recovery in 2021, especially due to live sporting events and market normalization, helped improve Adjusted EBITDA[10][12].\n\n### Factors Influencing Adjusted EBITDA Trends\n- **Pandemic Impact:** 2020 saw widespread declines due to operational shutdowns and event cancellations.\n- **Recovery in 2021:** Market recovery, increased direct-to-consumer revenue, and higher advertising spend contributed to EBITDA gains.\n- **Cost Initiatives:** Severe cost-cutting in 2020 produced temporary improvements, but costs ramped up again with new investments and business normalization in 2021.\n- **Segment-Specific Factors:** Increased programming, direct network costs, and investment in new products like Sky Glass contributed to expense increases in some segments[11][7].\n\n### Key Definitions and Management Thinking\n- Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure focusing on operational performance by excluding non-cash and certain non-operating items[3][4].\n- It is used for compensation, internal benchmarking, and external comparisons, but readers should note differences in calculation by company[4].\n\n---\n\nIn summary:  \nAdjusted EBITDA for Comcast Corporation dipped in 2020 due to COVID-19 but rebounded in 2021 to slightly above 2019 levels, with segment performance reflecting pandemic challenges and subsequent recovery, cost savings initiatives, and strategic investment cycles."}

This drop is a result of persistently low short-term interest rates throughout 2021, which affected returns on the company's substantial holdings of cash, cash equivalents, and U.S. Treasury Bills[12]. While dividend income increased slightly by 3.5%, this was not sufficient to offset the considerable drop in interest income, leading to an overall 5% decrease in pre-tax net investment income and a 4.6% decline in after-tax net investment income between 2020 and 2021[10].\n\n![Table showing a 44.4% decline in interest and other investment income from 2020 to 2021, with net investment income dropping by 4.6%.](image7)\n\nIn terms of asset allocation, while cash, cash equivalents, and U.S. Treasury Bills increased from $67,082 million in 2020 to $90,688 million in 2021, fixed maturity securities decreased from $20,317 million in 2020 to $16,386 million in 2021.

Meanwhile, a decrease in the expected return on plan assets increases pension expense, which could worsen the net recognized amount; a stable expected return should have a neutralizing effect for Other Retiree Benefits.\n\nTextually, this is supported by:\n- \"A 100 basis point change in the discount rate would impact annual after-tax benefit expense by approximately $135 million (pensions) and $10 million (OPRBs).\" [6]\n- \"The actuarial gain for pension plans in 2022 was primarily related to increases in discount rates.\" [8]\n- \"For 2022, the average return on assets assumptions for pension plan assets and OPRB assets was 5.5% and 8.4%, respectively.\" [4]\n\n### Direct Evidence from Financial Statements\n\nThe net amount recognized in the balance sheet for Pension Benefits improved (the liability decreased in magnitude) from $(5,428)$ million in 2021 to $(2,435)$ million in 2022, while for Other Retiree Benefits, the net asset increased from $2,238$ million to $3,819$ million.

The higher discount rates led to actuarial gains and a substantial improvement in the net amount recognized for both types of benefits, despite the lower expected return for pensions dampening the improvement somewhat. \n\nIn simple terms:  \nDiscount rates went up for both plans (reducing obligations), expected return on assets fell for pensions but stayed the same for other retiree benefits, and overall, the net recognized liabilities decreased, reflecting an improved funded status."}

Total NBCUniversal revenue increased by 26.1% to $34.3 billion in 2021, while Adjusted EBITDA increased by 6.0% to $5.7 billion[10]. This recovery was partly driven by a return to full operations (such as theme parks reopening and major content releases) and one-off contributions such as the Tokyo Olympics broadcast, which contributed $1.8 billion to the media segment[6].\n\n![NBCUniversal’s net income, adjusted EBITDA, and related financials improved, especially in 2021 after the pandemic-induced dip in 2020.](image6)\n\nAcross NBCUniversal’s segments, most divisions showed revenue growth between 2020 and 2021:\n- The Media segment saw revenues rise 20.3% (or 11% excluding Olympics revenue), although Adjusted EBITDA decreased, likely reflecting increased operating costs and continued investments in platforms like Peacock[6].\n- Studios revenue increased by 16.2% as film and television production returned to capacity.\n- Theme Parks revenue surged 141.2% as parks reopened after COVID-19 restrictions[6].\n\n![Media, Studios, and Theme Parks segments all posted strong revenue increases from 2020 to 2021, with especially large growth in Theme Parks.](image3)\n\nCustomer relationships, as measured by total customer relationships (in thousands), remained relatively stable, with a slight decline:\n- 2021: 23,027\n- 2020: 23,224\n- 2019: 23,280\n\nThe net customer relationship loss in 2021 was 198, higher than the 56 lost in 2020, reflecting ongoing challenges in video consumption and competition, though this was offset by higher revenue per customer in some markets[5][11].\n\n![Total customer relationships for NBCUniversal remained largely flat, decreasing slightly year-over-year from 2019 to 2021.](image5)\n\nImportantly, average monthly direct-to-consumer revenue per customer relationship actually grew from $54.56 in 2020 to $59.29 in 2021, an increase of 8.7%, as NBCUniversal increased rates and benefited from product mix improvements, even amid slight customer base declines[8][11].\n\n![The average monthly revenue per customer relationship rose steadily, reaching $59.29 by 2021.](image8)\n\n- The growth in average revenue per customer was key to offsetting customer churn, especially in markets like Italy where broadcast rights losses led to declines in both customer numbers and average rates[11].\n\nIn summary, NBCUniversal’s strong financial performance in 2021 was driven by revenue growth across most businesses (especially as they recovered from pandemic lows), and an increase in average revenue per customer offset stable or slightly decreasing customer relationships. These factors, aided by special events like the Olympics, resulted in substantial EBITDA recovery in 2021.\n\nDirect and concise answer: NBCUniversal’s financial performance from 2019 to 2021 improved noticeably in 2021 due to strong revenue recovery across segments and higher average customer revenue, despite stable or slightly declining customer relationships, leading to increased adjusted EBITDA."}

Equity securities, on the other hand, increased substantially from $269,498 million to $334,907 million [3].\n\n![Asset mix at year-end: cash and Treasury Bills rose sharply, fixed maturities fell, and equity securities grew strongly.](image3)\n\nThe implication of these changes is a shift toward greater liquidity and higher equity exposure. While the defensive increase in cash and Treasury holdings prioritizes safety and flexibility in uncertain markets, it simultaneously exposes the business to lower overall yields during periods of low interest rates, depressing net investment income. The larger allocation to equity securities could increase future earnings volatility, as equity values are inherently more variable, but also offers the potential for higher long-term returns [1][4][7].\n\nIn summary: Net investment income fell in 2021 due to lower interest income, while the insurance business's assets shifted toward more cash and equities and less fixed income, implying greater liquidity but more earnings volatility and potentially lower yield in the current rate environment."}

In 2019, both segments generated positive earnings; however, 2020 saw substantial losses primarily due to global commodity price downturns and the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2021, both upstream and downstream operations rebounded sharply, resulting in a robust return to overall profitability.\n\nLooking at specific segment performance, Chevron’s upstream segment (oil and gas exploration and production) in both the United States and international operations suffered heavy losses in 2020 but saw significant positive earnings in 2021. U.S. upstream swung from a loss of $(1,608) million in 2020 to $7,319 million in 2021, and international upstream went from a loss of $(825) million to $8,499 million in the same period. These improvements were driven mainly by higher realized prices for crude oil and natural gas and increased sales volumes[3][10].\n\nIn the downstream segment (refining and marketing), U.S. downstream posted a loss of $(571) million in 2020 but earned $2,389 million in 2021. International downstream earnings, while remaining positive, were lower in 2021 ($525 million) than in 2020 ($618 million), primarily due to reduced refining margins[7][8].\n\nThis turnaround in operating segments led to a drastic recovery in Chevron’s overall net income. The company reported a net loss of $(5,543) million in 2020, but in 2021, net income surged to $15,625 million, approaching levels similar to or exceeding 2019 profitability.\n\n![Chevron’s segment earnings and net income from 2019–2021 showing sharp losses in 2020 and strong rebound in 2021.](image3)\n\nThese trends highlight how macroeconomic conditions and commodity price cycles significantly impact Chevron’s financial outcomes, with 2020 representing an outlier downturn and 2021 reflecting a recovery driven by favorable market conditions.\n\n![Chevron’s basic financial metrics (net income, dividends, sales) further confirming the sharp dip in 2020 and recovery in 2021.](image4)\n\nIn summary: Chevron’s upstream and downstream operations faced steep losses in 2020 but rebounded strongly in 2021, driving a dramatic improvement in overall net income."}

As shown in the sensitivity analysis for December 31, 2021, if interest rates increase by 100 basis points, the fair value of equity index put option contracts decreases from $99 million to $94 million, and it further decreases with larger rate increases. Conversely, a 100 basis point decrease in rates increases the fair value to $105 million. This indicates that as interest rates rise, the fair value of these liabilities decreases, potentially reducing related losses or liabilities on the balance sheet[8]. However, text evidence clarifies that interest rate risks associated with these contracts are no longer considered significant due to the short duration of remaining exposures as of December 31, 2021[8].\n\n![As interest rates increase, the fair value of equity index put option contracts decreases modestly; a 300 bp increase drops the value from $99 million to $84 million for 2021.](image7)\n\nRegarding non-U.S. denominated debt, the effect on net earnings changed dramatically between 2020 and 2021.

In contrast, 2021 saw a gain of $955 million, a swing of over $1.7 billion year-over-year. This reflects how movements in foreign exchange rates can have significant positive or negative impacts on reported net earnings depending on the direction of currency movements and translation impacts[6].\n\n![Non-U.S. denominated debt shifts from a $764 million loss in 2020 to a $955 million gain in 2021, indicating large year-over-year swing.](image1)\n\nIn summary: Increases in interest rates generally reduce the fair value of equity index put option contract liabilities, though the impact is now modest, and non-U.S. denominated debt shifted from causing significant losses in 2020 to substantial gains in 2021 for net earnings."}

The unfavorable variance was primarily due to lower volumes/mix (down $285 million), further exacerbated by negative currency effects ($164 million), partially offset by increased pricing ($135 million) and cost/other improvements ($191 million cost offset)[5].\n\n![Net revenues in Latin America & Canada dropped 22.9% year-over-year, driven mainly by lower volumes and adverse currency effects.](image5)\n\nIn summary, the steep shipment volume declines and challenging market dynamics in Latin America & Canada during 2020 led to a pronounced drop in PMI’s regional net revenues and contributed to a weaker overall financial performance despite some price and cost-mix mitigation.\n\n**Direct answer:**  \nThe decline in PMI shipment volumes and adverse financial activities in Latin America & Canada from 2019 to 2020 resulted in a significant reduction in net revenues, primarily driven by lower cigarette sales, unfavorable currency impacts, and shifting market dynamics[3][5][12]."}

In 2019, net income stood at $5,895 million, but it dropped significantly in 2020 to $1,076 million, before rebounding in 2021 to $8,555 million. This considerable swing was due to various factors, including higher provisions for credit losses and noninterest expenses in 2020—largely influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic—and their subsequent decrease in 2021 as economic conditions improved and credit quality stabilized [7]; ![Consumer Banking and Lending financial summary with net income from 2019 to 2021](image7).\n\nRegarding selected balance sheet data, total average loans in Consumer Banking and Lending decreased each year, moving from $379.8 billion in 2019, to $376.5 billion in 2020, and then declining sharply to $333.9 billion in 2021—an overall drop of about 12% over the period. This decrease was primarily due to paydowns exceeding new originations, specific actions to curtail certain loan products, and declines in loan balances for both Home Lending and Small Business, particularly as PPP loan activity waned. Most notably, Home Lending average loans dropped from $277.0 billion in 2019 to $224.4 billion in 2021 (a 19% decrease), and Personal Lending decreased from $6.9 billion to $5.1 billion (26%) [5]; ![Consumer Banking and Lending average total loans and deposits from 2019 to 2021, with standout declines in total loans but large deposits growth](image2).\n\nConversely, total average deposits for this business rose substantially: from $629.1 billion in 2019 to $722.1 billion in 2020, and then to $834.7 billion in 2021—an increase of about 33% over three years. This surge in deposits was driven by higher consumer liquidity and savings rates, bolstered by government stimulus and payment deferral programs during the pandemic, as well as continued economic uncertainty [11].\n\nIn summary, between 2019 and 2021, Consumer Banking and Lending at Wells Fargo saw a sharp decrease and subsequent rebound in net income, a marked decline in total loans (especially Home Lending and Personal Lending), and a substantial, consistent increase in deposits.\n"}

Total Tax Provision and Effective Tax Rate\n\nThe total income tax provision decreased sharply from $3,095 million in 2019 to $521 million in 2020, before rising again to $1,231 million in 2021. Correspondingly, the effective tax rate dropped dramatically from 41% in 2019 to 9% in 2020, and then rose to 12% in 2021:\n\n![The effective tax rate fell from 41% in 2019 to 9% in 2020, then rose to 12% in 2021.](image2)\n\n### 2. Drivers Behind Yearly Changes\n\n- **2019:** The exceptionally high tax provision and effective tax rate in 2019 were mainly due to the derecognition of a $2.5 billion deferred tax asset related to distributed intellectual property, following changes in U.S. tax regulations. This adjustment caused a direct, sizeable increase in tax expense[8].\n- **2020:** The drop in tax provision and rate in 2020 reflects the absence of such large one-time write-offs, stabilization of tax items, and the benefit of more favorable tax positions.\n- **2021:** The increase from 2020 but remaining below 2019 levels was influenced by increases in U.S. pre-tax income and lower excess tax benefits from share-based awards.\n\n### 3. Excess Tax Benefits from Share-Based Awards\n\nThe excess tax benefit from share-based awards fluctuated, reducing taxable income by $27 million in 2019, $83 million in 2020, and then a much larger $265 million in 2021, indicating increased share-based compensation and associated tax benefits:\n\n![Excess tax benefits from share-based awards grew significantly to $265 million in 2021.](image2)\n\nThis is supported by the text, which shows similar numbers for total tax benefits from share-based awards: \"$567 million, $273 million, and $237 million, respectively\" over the three years[1].\n\n### 4. Components of Tax Provision\n\nComparing the breakdown of current and deferred provisions, we see that federal taxes were the dominant component, and 2019's current federal provision was unusually high. Deferred provisions were also highly variable, with a notable deferred federal tax expense in 2019 due to the derecognition mentioned above:\n\n![Federal taxes were particularly high in 2019, both in current and deferred components.](image7)\n\n### 5. Unrecognized Tax Benefits\n\nUnrecognized tax benefits grew steadily, from $1.7 billion in 2019 to $1.9 billion in 2020, and $2.1 billion in 2021. The increase in 2021 was largely due to expected refunds related to Korean withholding taxes. Despite changes, the company continues to reserve adequately while under examination by tax authorities[10].\n\n![Unrecognized tax benefits increased each year, reflecting ongoing tax audits and anticipated refunds.](image5)\n\n### 6. Research and Development Tax Credits\n\nQualcomm continued to benefit from R&D tax credits, which reduced taxable income by $110 million in 2019, $125 million in 2020, and $195 million in 2021:\n\n![R&D tax credits contributed to lower income tax provisions each year, growing to $195 million in 2021.](image2)\n\n---\n\n### Direct Answer\n\nOver 2019–2021, Qualcomm's tax provisions and related benefits were highly variable, influenced by one-time tax asset write-offs in 2019, stabilization in 2020, and increased income and share-based compensation benefits in 2021, with unrecognized tax benefits steadily increasing due to ongoing audits and anticipated foreign tax refunds."}

Immediately before the sale, WFAM AUM totaled $603 billion. With the transfer of $587.1 billion (including $191.1 billion from money market funds and $396.0 billion from other assets managed) out of the company's balance sheet due to the sale, the ending balance for WFAM AUM was zero by the end of 2021:\n\n![Sale of WFAM resulted in removal of $587.1B AUM from balance sheet](image2)\n\nThis demonstrates that all assets formerly managed by WFAM were deconsolidated from Wells Fargo’s reporting following the transaction.\n\n### Broader Effects on Company Income\n\nFinancially, the sale of WFAM had two major impacts on the company’s income:\n\n1. **One-time Gain Recognized**: Wells Fargo recognized a one-time net gain of $269 million from the sale of WFAM in its 2021 earnings, contributing positively to noninterest income for the year [1][2][4].\n2. **Reduced Ongoing Fee Income**: Following the sale, Wells Fargo experienced a reduction in asset-based fees, as WFAM had previously contributed substantially to investment advisory and management fees [5][4]. The divestiture is specifically cited as the reason for lower asset-based fee income post-November 1, 2021 [4].\n\n### Broader Effects on the Balance Sheet\n\nThe sale of WFAM and the outflow of $587.1 billion in AUM did not directly impact the balance sheet assets, as AUM are off-balance-sheet items. However, some temporary arrangements meant Wells Fargo continued to administer some IRT (Institutional Retirement and Trust) client assets of $19 billion AUM and $582 billion AUA for a limited period under a transition services agreement, ending in June 2022 [3].\n\nThere were also indirect effects:\n- The loss of a major business unit streamlined the company’s operations and impacted related revenues and expenses.\n- Overall, the elimination of the asset management business reduced fee-generating opportunities but provided a one-time capital inflow boosting noninterest income for 2021 [1][2].\n\n### Financial Statement Reflection\n\nThe significance of the transaction is visible in the company's higher noninterest income for 2021, totaling $10,036 million, more than double that of the previous year, mainly due to gains on sales of business units including WFAM:\n\n![Higher noninterest income in 2021 driven by business sales including WFAM](image1)\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe sale of WFAM on November 1, 2021, removed all WFAM assets under management from Wells Fargo, resulting in a $587.1 billion decline in AUM, a one-time income gain of $269 million, and a subsequent reduction in ongoing asset-based fee income, with limited temporary administration of some client assets remaining until June 2022 [1][2][3][4][5]."}

According to the data:\n\n- Net interest income in 2020 was $43,360 million, down from $48,891 million in 2019—a decrease of $5,531 million[6][5].\n- The net interest yield fell from 2.43% in 2019 to 1.90% in 2020, indicating a decline in profitability from core lending and deposit-taking activities[6][8].\n\n![Net interest income in 2020 dropped significantly compared to 2019.](image5)\n\nLooking closer at the details from the interest income and expense breakdown:\n\n- The decline in net interest income resulted from a substantial decrease in total interest income (due to lower yields on loans, securities, and deposits with banks) that was only partially offset by a drop in interest expense (due to lower funding costs as rates fell)[6][8].\n- For example, interest income from loans and leases and debt securities both declined sharply, mainly due to lower yields/rates, with smaller mitigating effects from higher volumes in some categories.\n- On the expense side, interest expense on both U.S. and non-U.S. interest-bearing deposits fell considerably, again primarily rate-driven, as did long-term debt expense.\n\n![Breakdown showing big declines in both interest income (especially on loans/debt securities) and interest expense (deposits and long-term debt).](image1)\n\nAs a result:\n\n- The net interest spread, which measures the difference between the yield on earning assets and the rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities, dropped from 2.03% in 2019 to 1.75% in 2020[8].\n- This decrease in spread reflects the fact that asset yields fell more than the cost of liabilities did.\n\n![Net interest spread narrowed from 2.03% in 2019 to 1.75% in 2020.](image8)\n\nIn summary, the net interest spread narrowed from 2019 to 2020 because the drop in interest income from earning assets—mainly due to significantly lower interest rates across the market—outpaced the corresponding decline in interest expense on deposits and other funding. The main contributing factors were the lower rate environment and changes in asset and deposit balances, with the rate effect being dominant. \n\n**Direct answer:**  \nThe net interest spread narrowed from 2.03% in 2019 to 1.75% in 2020, primarily because net interest income fell more sharply than the decline in interest expense; this was mainly due to lower yields on earning assets as a result of prevailing lower market interest rates, only partially offset by decreased funding costs[5][6][8]."}

As a result, provisions for onerous leases and straight-line rent or lease incentives are no longer recognised separately. Instead, future lease payments are now included within lease liabilities [4], [9], and lease-related balances, such as prepaid rent and lease incentives, are capitalised into right-of-use assets [7].\n\nThe Group's initial application of AASB 16 resulted in the recognition of a lease liability of $143,621,000 as at 1 July 2019, an amount which did not exist previously under the former accounting standard. During the year, further changes (additions, re-measurements, and lease payments) were reflected, culminating in a lease liability of $167,154,000 at 28 June 2020.

Cash Provided by Operating Activities\n\nIn 2020, net cash provided by operating activities was $9,812 million, compared to $10,090 million in 2019, a decrease of $278 million. This decrease was primarily due to higher working capital requirements and higher cash payments for asset impairment and exit costs, offset partially by higher net earnings and derecognition of trade receivables[6][4].\n\n![Operating cash flows decreased slightly in 2020 relative to 2019.](image1)\n\n### 2. Cash Used in Investing Activities\n\nNet cash used in investing activities declined significantly from $(1,811)$ million in 2019 to $(1,154)$ million in 2020. The primary cause for this decrease in outflows was the absence in 2020 of the large cash outflow related to the deconsolidation of RBH in 2019, partially offset by changes in capital expenditures and derivatives[2][5].\n\n![Investing cash outflows fell largely due to absence of a one-time deconsolidation charge.](image1)\n\n### 3. Cash Used in Financing Activities\n\nNet cash used in financing activities increased from $(8,061)$ million in 2019 to $(8,496)$ million in 2020, an increase of $435 million.

Overall Impact on Cash Balance\n\nStarting from a beginning balance of $6,865 million in 2020 (vs. $6,620 million in 2019), the net effect of these cash flows—less cash provided by operating activities, significantly reduced investing outflows, and higher financing outflows—resulted in a net increase in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash to $7,285 million at the end of 2020 (an increase of $420 million vs. 2019)[4].\n\n![The year-end cash balance increased in 2020, despite lower operating cash and higher financing outflows, due to a much smaller investing cash outflow.](image4)\n\n---\n\n**In summary:** Although operating cash inflows slightly decreased and financing outflows increased in 2020, the overall cash balance at year-end rose by $420 million compared to 2019, primarily because investing cash outflows declined sharply with the absence of a large one-time payment present in 2019."}

Specifically, their system consists of both fixed and performance-linked remuneration, ensuring that executives are incentivized based on the company’s results and their own contributions.\n\nThe performance-linked component of executive remuneration is determined by three key factors: consolidated operating income (reflecting company business performance), the volatility of Toyota’s share price (a shareholder value indicator), and individual performance evaluation. These elements are combined using a formula to set the Annual Total Remuneration. The balance after deducting fixed monthly remuneration forms the performance-based portion, directly linking pay to corporate performance metrics and the creation of shareholder value [1][2][11].\n\n![Toyota’s remuneration criteria are based on consolidated operating income, share price volatility, and individual performance evaluation.](image5)\n\nConsolidated operating income and share price volatility both carry significant weight in this evaluation, with evidence indicating a 50% evaluation weight for each. For consolidated operating income, the method involves evaluating the degree of attainment of operating income relative to a reference value (e.g., ¥1 trillion). For share price volatility, Toyota’s share price and the Nikkei stock average serve as benchmarks to assess performance relative to market expectations, with results directly impacting executive pay [7].\n\n![The evaluation weight for business performance and shareholder value is split equally in executive remuneration calculations.](image7)\n\nThe rationale for using these metrics is to align executive interests with those of shareholders and to motivate improvement in both the short-term and medium- to long-term corporate value of Toyota.

Total revenue, net of interest expense, declined to $18.6 billion in 2020 from $19.5 billion in 2019, reflecting a 5% decrease [7]. This drop was mainly attributed to lower interest rates, partially offset by positive market valuation effects [7][10]. Net income for GWIM fell by 28%, from $4.3 billion in 2019 to $3.1 billion in 2020 [2], as revenue pressure combined with a slight increase in expenses and higher credit loss provisions.\n\n![GWIM revenue and net income also declined, but less drastically than in Consumer Banking, with a 5% fall in revenue and a 28% drop in net income.](image2)\n\n### In Summary\n\n- Consumer Banking experienced a steeper decline in both revenue (-14%) and net income (-50%) primarily due to the pandemic's impact on interest rates, client activity, and credit losses [2].\n- GWIM faced a more moderate revenue decrease (-5%) and net income fall (-28%), with the negative rate environment partly cushioned by higher market valuations and AUM flows [7][10].\n\n**Direct answer:** In 2020, Consumer Banking posted sharper declines in both revenue (down 14%) and net income (down 50%), while GWIM experienced more moderate declines in revenue (down 5%) and net income (down 28%) compared to 2019."}

These assumptions, especially changes in financial (like discount rates) and demographic assumptions (like mortality), directly impact the value of the defined benefit obligation (DBO) from year to year [3].\n\nAccording to the summary table of actuarial gains and losses, in fiscal year 2021, changes in financial assumptions resulted in a €26 million decrease in the DBO, while demographic assumption changes caused an €8 million decrease. However, experience gains and losses increased the obligation by €12 million, leading to a net total actuarial loss of €–22 million in 2021, in contrast to a €67 million actuarial gain in 2020.\n\n![Actuarial gains and losses breakdown for 2020 and 2021, showing shifts due to demographic and financial assumptions](image4)\n\nFurther, the sensitivity analysis demonstrates that a half percentage-point change in key assumptions has significant effects on the DBO as of September 30, 2021: a 0.5% increase in the discount rate reduces the obligation by €242 million, while a 0.5% decrease increases it by €271 million.

Over the course of the year, WFAM saw inflows of $69.3 billion and outflows of $96.8 billion. However, on November 1, 2021, the sale of WFAM resulted in a removal of $587.1 billion in AUM from Wells Fargo’s books, leaving a balance of zero at year-end since the business was no longer part of Wells Fargo[4].\n\n![WFAM assets under management dropped to zero after the sale in November 2021.](image5)\n\nThe disposition of WFAM meant that Wells Fargo’s consolidated balance sheet no longer included these assets. However, the core consolidated financial results, such as ‘Total assets’ and ‘Total deposits,’ were only modestly affected compared to the dramatic shift in AUM, reflecting the nature of asset management operations—where assets under management are off-balance-sheet and primarily impact only fee income[1][4].\n\nFrom the selected balance sheet data, total assets at year-end 2021 decreased slightly to $721.3 billion from $728.7 billion in 2020—a 1% decline—with only a modest effect attributable to the timing of investment portfolio deployment, not directly to the WFAM disposition.

Instead, the main impacts were on noninterest income from asset management fees, not directly on the assets reported on the balance sheet[4][1].\n\nThus: The drop of WFAM assets under management to zero after the sale had minimal direct impact on Wells Fargo's reported balance sheet totals for 2021 compared to previous years, as these were off-balance-sheet assets."}

The company evolved from a regional retailer to a truly global player, operating 435 stores in 15 countries by 2020 [1], emphasizing a nimble and opportunistic approach to entering and growing in new territories [12].\n\nFrom 2016 to 2020, Lovisa steadily increased its international presence. In 2016, most stores were based in Australia and a handful of overseas markets. Over the next four years, the number of international stores grew rapidly, particularly in the United Kingdom, France, and the USA. For example, Lovisa’s US stores went from zero to 48 and its French stores from zero to 21 over this period. The total store count more than doubled from 250 in 2016 to 435 by 2020. This expansion included both company-owned and franchise locations, as seen in the Middle East and Vietnam. The company also closed some stores in less optimal locations to optimize its footprint [9], [11].\n\n![Lovisa expanded its international store network significantly from 2016 to 2020, particularly in the UK, France, and USA.](image1)\n\nA key pillar of Lovisa’s strategy was leveraging its capital to access large international markets, while also using franchise partners in selected territories for rapid expansion. The company aimed to trial at least one new market per annum and streamlined its international supply chain base to support its operating model [12], [2].\n\nAchievements during this period include the net opening of 47 new stores outside Australia in a single year, the successful roll-out of store rollouts in high-traffic locations, and optimizing store fit-outs to facilitate rapid expansion at low cost [8], [3]. Additionally, Lovisa’s expansion was supported by its ability to identify new opportunities, close underperforming stores, and optimize supply chain routes, with over 56% of its product moved through the China warehouse in FY20 [10].\n\n![Lovisa’s strategic growth pillars highlighted international expansion and streamlining of the supply chain as core achievements.](image2)\n\nHowever, Lovisa faced several challenges:\n- The retail environment remained highly competitive with low industry barriers to entry and ever-changing customer preferences [2].\n- The availability of good quality sites in prime locations was a risk, as was competition from local and global players.\n- The COVID-19 pandemic impacted expansion, particularly in FY20, affecting both store operations and supply chain logistics [4], [6], [12].\n- Economic conditions and exchange rates added external risks, and the company had to remain adaptable in its market entry and development strategies.\n\nTo summarize, Lovisa’s international store expansion from 2016 to 2020 was driven by rapid and targeted growth, opportunistic market entry, and supply chain optimization, with achievements in scale and geographic diversity, but encountered challenges from competition, market volatility, and global disruptions. \n\nIn simple terms: Lovisa more than doubled its store network worldwide from 2016 to 2020, using a flexible and fast expansion approach that brought both notable successes and significant challenges, especially in adapting to competitive and unpredictable markets."}

This increase coincides with a rise in total operating lease liabilities from $797 million in 2019 to $974 million in 2020, maintaining a similar weighted average lease term of 7 years and a slightly lower discount rate of 2.8% (down from 3.1%)—indicating new or renewed leases under slightly more favorable terms. The cash paid for amounts included in the measurement of operating lease liabilities also increased from $202 million to $221 million, and new ROU assets obtained in exchange for lease obligations rose from $145 million to $246 million, suggesting heightened leasing activity or expansion.[8]\n\n![Lease assets grew substantially and lease liabilities increased, reflecting higher leasing activity and more assets under lease contracts.](image4)\n\n**Inventories:**\n\nThe total value of inventories rose from $1,628 million in 2019 to $2,292 million in 2020. This increase was seen across all major components: finished goods increased from $833 million to $1,232 million, work-in-process from $285 million to $369 million, and raw materials from $510 million to $691 million. The overall jump in inventory values can be attributed to higher sales volumes and possibly acquisition-driven growth, as supported by contextual notes in the text which link higher cost of sales to both increased sales and acquisitions, specifically the Cytiva Acquisition.[2]\n\n![Inventories increased significantly across all categories, driven by higher sales volume and acquisitions.](image6)\n\n**Reflection on Financial Statements:**\n\n- The growth in operating lease assets and liabilities reflects the adoption of new or additional leases, possibly to support operational expansion following business acquisitions or organic growth. This increases leverage and fixed obligations on the balance sheet, while also raising the asset base. The increased lease-related cash flows emphasize the expansion and operational scale.\n- The growth in inventories suggests increased business activity—both from organic sales growth and acquisitions. This would correspond to higher current assets and potentially higher cost of goods sold, affecting the income statement and cash conversion cycle metrics.\n\n**In summary:**  \nBetween 2019 and 2020, the company increased both its lease assets (ROU assets up by $178 million) and inventories (up by $664 million), reflecting greater operational scale due to acquisitions and sales growth, with these changes meaningfully expanding both the asset base and financial commitments on the balance sheet."}

This large reduction in liabilities for uncertain tax positions, if recognized, would directly lower the effective tax rate and impact deferred tax assets. If these liabilities are realized, $2 million of existing deferred tax assets in both 2020 and 2019 would also be realized[1].\n\n![Reconciliation of uncertain tax positions, showing a large reduction due to settlements in 2020](image1)\n\nLooking at the net deferred tax asset, it increased from $119 million in 2019 to $253 million in 2020[image4][image5]. This increase is primarily driven by a decrease in deferred tax liabilities (from $363 million in 2019 to $213 million in 2020) and only a slight decrease in gross deferred tax assets before the valuation allowance (from $662 million to $645 million)[image4]. The valuation allowance also slightly decreased from $180 million to $179 million. Tax positions, such as the settlement of prior depreciation-related uncertainties, likely played a role in reducing the deferred liabilities and contributing to the rise in net deferred tax assets[1].\n\n![Deferred tax assets and liabilities breakdown, showing growth in net deferred tax asset](image4)\n![Summary of net deferred tax asset rising from $119 million to $253 million](image5)\n\nOther relevant disclosures indicate that tax position changes—including reductions for positions of prior years and expirations—had a material effect in 2020, as also reflected in the significant benefit from uncertain tax positions in the reconciliation of the effective tax rate[image6].\n\nIn summary, the net deferred tax asset increased from $119 million in 2019 to $253 million in 2020 due to the resolution and reduction of uncertain tax positions, along with a decrease in deferred tax liabilities[1][image1][image4][image5]."}

Cost of Revenues Breakdown\n\nThe company’s cost of revenues is primarily composed of service costs and other costs. Over the years, both elements have increased, but the share of \"other cost of revenues\" has risen faster relative to service costs:\n\n![Cost of revenues breakdown over 2019-2021, highlighting growth in 'Service costs' and 'Other cost of revenues'](image6)\n\n- In 2019, total cost of revenues was RMB 16,761m (service costs: 89.3%, other: 10.7%)\n- In 2020, it rose to RMB 19,851m (service: 88.0%, other: 12.0%)\n- In 2021, it reached RMB 21,840m (service: 87.0%, other: 13.0%)\n\nThe share and absolute amount of \"other cost of revenues,\" which includes agency and payment channel fees, grew significantly, largely due to higher agency fees and payment fees [2][7].\n\n### 2. Operating Expenses Breakdown\n\nOperating expenses consist of selling and marketing expenses, and general and administrative expenses:\n\n![Operating expenses over 2019-2021, showing a notable increase in G&A expenses in 2021](image2)\n\n- Selling and marketing expenses grew only moderately: from RMB 2,041m (2019) to RMB 2,678m (2021)\n- General and administrative expenses rose significantly: RMB 2,703m (2019) to RMB 4,009m (2021), with a larger jump in 2021\n\nBy 2021, general and administrative expenses accounted for 60% of total operating expenses (up from 57% in 2019).\n\n### 3. Total Cost and Operating Expense Ratios\n\nThe overall cost of revenues increased, but as a percentage of total revenue remained relatively stable (65.9% in 2019 to 69.9% in 2021):\n\n![Income statement summary showing revenue, cost, and profit dynamics](image3)\n\nOperating expenses as a portion of revenue increased slightly:\n\n- 2019: 18.7% of revenues\n- 2021: 21.4% of revenues\n\n### 4. Explanations Behind the Numbers\n\n- Growth in service costs is tied mainly to content acquisition, creator revenue-sharing, and technology infrastructure, which are crucial for both music and social entertainment services [8][3].\n- The increase in \"other cost of revenues\" is mainly explained by higher agency and payment fees as the company expanded its platform operations [2][7].\n- General and administrative expense increases are linked to greater investment in research and development, as well as higher salaries and benefits for administrative, management, and R&D staff [6][5][10].\n\n### Conclusion\n\nOver 2019–2021, the company's cost structure shows an increase in both operating and revenue-related expenses, especially in \"other cost of revenues\" and general and administrative costs. These changes suggest that while the company maintains operational efficiency in its core areas, it is investing more into R&D, infrastructure, and platform support—indicating a focus on long-term growth and innovation, at the expense of slightly higher short-term costs.\n\nIn short:  \nThe company's cost structure shifted toward higher general and administrative and other operational costs from 2019 to 2021, reflecting a focus on platform investment and future growth in its financial management."}

This increase was driven by a $4,060 million increase in deferred taxes and higher prepaid pension assets, partially offset by decreases in long-term financing receivables and net intangible assets and goodwill. The increases indicate that IBM strengthened its asset base, improving its long-term resource position for future operations and stability [7][9].\n\n![Noncurrent assets and long-term debt comparison, showing increases in both for 2020.](image8)\n\nMeanwhile, IBM’s long-term debt grew slightly from $54,102 million to $54,355 million. While this represents a marginal rise, it is important in the context of IBM’s overall strategy and cash position. The company’s total debt actually decreased by $1,361 million primarily due to early retirements and debt maturities, albeit partially offset by new debt issuances [12]. The targeted reduction in some areas of debt (especially Global Financing debt, which decreased by $3,560 million) reflects prudent balance sheet management as IBM disbursed or refinanced higher-cost or unnecessary debt, consistent with a decline in financing assets [5][12].\n\n![Total debt and Global Financing segment debt decreased in 2020, indicating active debt management.](image6)\n\nOn the cash flow front, IBM demonstrated strong operational cash flows. Net cash provided by operating activities increased to $18,197 million in 2020 from $14,770 million in 2019. However, financing activities were a net use of cash—$9,721 million in 2020 compared to a net source of $9,042 million the prior year, reflecting reduced borrowing/reduced reliance on debt, likely as part of their deleveraging efforts [2]. These positive operating cash flows enabled IBM to absorb its debt obligations and maintain investments in long-term assets without overly stressing equity or working capital [5].\n\n![2020 saw an increase in net operating cash flows and a reduction in investing and financing outflows.](image5)\n\nHowever, total equity decreased from $2,749 million in 2019 to $2,352 million in 2020. This decline was mainly due to dividends paid out and adverse currency translation, partially countered by positive net income [6]. While equity contracted, IBM’s robust cash position and increased noncurrent assets helped to reinforce its financial stability, mitigating some negative impact of the reduced equity base.\n\n![Both total debt and total equity decreased in 2020, though debt reduction was the focus.](image2)\n\nIn summary, IBM’s increase in noncurrent assets combined with prudent debt management (slight rise in long-term, overall debt reduction) and strong operating cash flows improved its asset strength and liquidity, even as equity declined mainly due to dividends and currency effects.\n\n**Direct answer:**  \nIBM’s increase in noncurrent assets and careful management of long-term debt, combined with strong operating cash flows, improved its underlying financial stability, even though overall equity slightly decreased due to dividends and currency impacts."}

With uncertainty and economic stress, consumers:\n- Paid down debt faster than they borrowed (reflected in both credit card and home equity balances).\n- Reduced use of credit cards, possibly preferring debit cards for spending—this switch may reflect a desire to avoid incurring new debt and to maintain tighter control over budgets.\n\nIn summary: Both home equity and credit card outstanding balances and new originations or purchase volumes declined sharply in 2020 versus 2019, which suggests that consumers were paying down debt, borrowing less, and shifting spending toward debit rather than credit in response to economic uncertainty during the pandemic [1][2][10][11]."}

Increased maintenance and stripping costs also contributed, demonstrating that both market prices and operational costs are critical drivers of financial results for coal operations [2]. This is reflected in unit cost data, with Queensland Coal’s cost per tonne rising from $67.59 in FY2020 to $81.81 in FY2021, while revenue also fell from $5,357 million to $4,315 million, highlighting the sensitivity to market conditions and costs.\n\n![Financial table showing coal revenue, EBITDA, and costs for Queensland and NSWEC](image8)\n\nSimilarly, for nickel, higher market prices and sales volumes lead to improved results, as observed with BHP’s Nickel West operation, where underlying EBITDA increased by $296 million to $259 million, driven by stronger prices, increased sales, and lower maintenance and contractor costs. However, unfavorable exchange rate movements and higher input costs associated with increased nickel prices partially offset these gains [9]. Realized nickel prices rose from $13,860 per tonne in FY2020 to $16,250 per tonne in FY2021, underscoring the positive effect of pricing power on performance [6].\n\nThe table below underscores the direct quantifiable effect of price changes on BHP’s profit after tax and underlying EBITDA, with a $1 per tonne change in coal or a $1 per pound change in nickel prices translating into measurable millions in profits:\n\n![Table quantifying the impact of price changes for various commodities, including coal and nickel, on profit and EBITDA](image5)\n\nKey drivers behind these impacts include global market price volatility, supply and demand dynamics, production volumes, operational costs (such as maintenance and stripping), and exchange rate movements. BHP’s policy of selling at prevailing market prices means they are highly exposed to these fluctuations, and as stated in the report, long-term low prices or sustained volatility may adversely affect financial performance and feasibility of asset development [1][4][10].\n\nIn summary, BHP’s financial results for coal and nickel are strongly influenced by movements in commodity prices, with operational efficiency, production volumes, and market volatility as key underlying drivers [2][6][9][10]."}

This improvement was mainly attributed to the reduction of financing receivables due to sales of receivables and other working capital movements, partially related to tax deferrals and performance-related declines in net income [1][4][10].\n\n**Investing Activities:**  \nNet cash used in investing activities decreased dramatically by $23,908 million, mainly because IBM incurred major acquisition expenses in 2019 (notably the Red Hat acquisition) that did not recur in 2020. The 2020 investing outflows were much smaller [6][9].\n\n**Financing Activities:**  \nThere was a major swing with financing activities moving from a net source of cash in 2019 ($9,042M) to a net use of cash in 2020 (-$9,721M). This change (a swing of $18,763 million) was primarily due to IBM focusing on debt repayments and suspending its share repurchase program to strengthen its balance sheet after the Red Hat acquisition [2][10].\n\n### Net Impact on Overall Cash Flow\n\nThe combined effect of improved operating cash flow, much lower cash outflows from investing, but higher outflows from financing, led to an overall increase in IBM’s cash balance by $5,361 million in 2020, compared to a decrease of $3,290 million in 2019. This strengthened IBM’s liquidity position heading into 2021.\n\n**In summary:**  \nIBM’s overall cash flow improved in 2020 due to higher operating cash generation and sharply reduced investing outflows, despite a large outflow in financing activities."}

The table below summarizes these amounts:\n\n- In 2022, stock-based compensation expense was $333 million, with a related tax benefit of $94 million.\n- In 2021, the expense was $265 million, with a $75 million tax benefit.\n- In 2020, the expense was $230 million, with a $77 million tax benefit.\n\nThese numbers are clarified further in the explicit summary of total tax benefits received by the company each year, highlighting the portion due to stock-based compensation:\n\n> The Company recognized total net tax benefits of $130, $163, and $81 in 2022, 2021 and 2020.

This signals its integration into overall compensation and incentive structures [6].\n\n### Interpretation\n\nThe data show a consistent increase in stock-based compensation expense from $230 million (2020) to $333 million (2022). Correspondingly, the related income tax benefit rose from $77 million in 2020 to $94 million in 2022. This upward trajectory in both expense and tax benefit likely indicates the company is placing a greater emphasis on equity-based incentives for employees and executives, possibly to enhance retention, align employee interests with shareholder value, and remain competitive in talent markets.\n\nStrategically, growing stock-based compensation can also act as a non-cash expense, preserving cash flow while rewarding employees, and boosting the company’s ability to attract and retain key talent during periods of expansion or heightened competition.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nFrom 2020 to 2022, both stock-based compensation expense and related tax benefits increased consistently, suggesting a strategic emphasis on equity incentives to support talent retention, align interests, and manage cash outflows in compensation."}

The store optimization plan was in its final stages, and the company specifically aimed to streamline locations that had reached the end of their useful life, shifting sales to local shops and online channels when possible [1][12].

This was attributed to higher paydown rates, reflecting the strong liquidity and financial health of customers.[2]\n3. **Interest Revenue and Expense Patterns:** While interest rates on loans and the cost of funds both affect net interest income, the change in payment behavior (greater paydowns) had a stronger negative impact on yields in 2021 despite loan growth.[7][10]\n\nIn summary, the net interest yield decreased from 11.1% in 2019 to 10.7% in 2021, after a temporary increase in 2020.

ENBREL continued to lose market share, and the decline was exacerbated by a reduction in the rheumatology market's growth rate due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The impact is evident in both the year-over-year changes in the provision for income taxes and the amounts directly attributed to the R&D tax credit shown in the financial statements.\n\nIn 2013, the R&D tax credit reduced the provision by $13,841,000. This effect grew in subsequent years, with the credit reducing the provision by $18,655,000 in 2014 and by $29,363,000 in 2015, reflecting both an increase in eligible R&D activities and favorable legislative changes that reinstated and expanded the credit[8]. The significant increase in 2015 corresponds with the retroactive and permanent extension of the Federal R&D credit, resulting in a discrete benefit recognized in that year as described in the company's disclosures [5][9][11]. These credits were among the primary reasons for the decrease in the effective tax rate and provision for income taxes during these years, particularly in 2015[7][11].\n\n![The R&D tax credit line in the reconciliation shows progressively larger negative values, increasing the reduction to the tax provision each year from 2013 to 2015.](image8)\n\nThe connection between the R&D credits and deferred tax assets further underscores their significance.

Retained earnings decreased from $13,837 million in 2020 to $13,474 million in 2021. Despite reporting strong net income of $8,060 million in 2021, retained earnings declined due to substantial dividends and share repurchases:\n- 2021 net income: $8,060 million\n- Common share repurchases: $(7,598) million\n- Cash dividends declared (common and preferred): over $(1,400) million[^1]\nThese outflows more than offset the net income, reducing retained earnings.\n\nNext, accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI), which includes unrealized gains/losses on debt securities, foreign currency translations, and pension adjustments, also contributed negatively:\n- AOCI decreased from $(2,895) million in 2020 to $(2,945) million in 2021, a further loss of $50 million.\n- The largest negative contributor was foreign currency translation adjustments at $(163) million in 2021, as seen in the reconciliation statement.\n![Other comprehensive income saw a $50 million total loss in 2021, driven mostly by foreign currency translation.](image6)\n\nWhile additional paid-in capital decreased ($11,881 million to $11,495 million), this was less significant than movements in retained earnings and AOCI.\n\nFrom the company's overall financial position, the decline in total equity ($807 million) means a reduced cushion for creditors and less capital for future growth. This decrease stemmed from significant shareholder returns (buybacks and dividends) rather than operating losses, as net income remained strong. The modest negative movement in AOCI also suggests minor impacts from market value changes on investments and foreign exchange.\n\nIn summary, the company’s strong profits in 2021 were outweighed by large share repurchases and dividend payments, causing shareholders’ equity to decrease. The modest increase in other comprehensive losses further contributed to the reduction.\n\n**Direct answer:**  \nBetween 2020 and 2021, the company’s shareholders' equity decreased mainly because shareholder distributions (dividends and buybacks) and comprehensive losses outweighed net income, reducing retained earnings and slightly increasing accumulated other comprehensive loss, which in turn weakened the company's overall financial position.\n\n---\n[^1]: Refer to cash dividends declared on image5.\n\nReferences:  \n[image3]  \n[image5]  \n[image6]"}

In 1870, the population was just 130, but by 1890 it had reached a peak of 14,096, driven by several key factors: the introduction of the railroad, land available under the Homestead Act, and significant immigration from other states and abroad. After this peak, however, the population entered a gradual decline throughout the 20th century, reaching 9,403 by the year 2000 [1].\n\n![Table charting the population of Hamilton County from 1870 to 2000, showing a steep rise and subsequent steady decline.](image2)\n\nThe explosive growth in the late 1800s was due to the arrival of settlers—many via the new railroads—from states like Missouri, Iowa, and Illinois, as well as immigrants from Germany, Sweden, England, and Russia. The completion of the Union Pacific Railroad and the opportunities provided by the Homestead Act made Nebraska attractive to these groups, transforming it into a thriving agricultural state [1][2][5]. \n\nHowever, after reaching its population zenith in 1890, several factors contributed to population decline. As agricultural mechanization increased, fewer people were needed on farms, resulting in farm consolidation and a reduction in rural population [6]. This trend is documented as the number of farms dropped and average farm size grew, making small-scale farming and school districts less viable [6][11].\n\n![Map showing location and distribution of towns in Hamilton County, Nebraska.](image3)\n\nAdditionally, transportation changes and shifting economic patterns led to the decline or disappearance of many small towns, particularly those not served by railroad lines [10]. Despite these declines, some towns like Aurora have experienced modest growth in recent years, but the overall county trend since 1890 has been downward [8].\n\nIn summary, dramatic population growth in Hamilton County through the 19th century was driven by railroad expansion and homesteading, but the 20th century brought a steady decline due to mechanization, farm consolidation, and changing transportation routes [1][5][6].\n\n**Direct answer:** Hamilton County’s population rose sharply from 1870 to a peak in 1890 due to railroads and homesteading, but then steadily declined to 2000 because of farm consolidation, mechanization, and the loss of small towns."}

Results from image7 demonstrate that adding the source to the reference (i.e., including both) leads to consistent improvements in the Kendall Tau (τ) correlation scores across all language pairs tested. Notably, the improvement is more pronounced when English is the target language—that is, for translations from another language into English. For example, the improvement (Δτ) ranges from 0.024 (en-tr) to as much as 0.155 (de-en), with all \"into English\" directions showing notably higher gains compared to \"from English\" directions (e.g., de-en Δτ 0.155 versus en-de Δτ 0.035) [9][7][12].\n\nThis pattern is reinforced by statements in the text indicating that the COMET framework benefits from leveraging the source text alongside the reference, especially in multilingual settings, resulting in \"zero-shot\" capabilities when English is used as a target language [4].\n\n![COMET-RANK shows largest gains from including the source when English is the target.](image7)\n\nThe underlying rationale is that reference-only models lack information from the source, limiting their ability to accurately assess translation quality, especially in multilingual contexts. By incorporating both the source and reference, the model can make more reliable and context-aware judgments. This is particularly impactful for language pairs where English is the unobserved target during training, as the additional source signal helps bridge the gap [9][4].\n\nIn summary, including reference translations (plus the source) in COMET-RANK enhances metric performance for all English-involved language pairs, but the effect is most marked when translating into English, with the size of improvement varying by direction and language pair.\n\nDirect answer:  \nThe inclusion of reference translations (especially when combined with the source) leads to higher COMET-RANK scores for language pairs involving English, with the largest improvement seen for translations into English, and the magnitude of the effect depending on the specific language pair."}

Specifically, \"LLM-based reranking (blue lines) enhances performance on hard samples (left areas in the figure)\" while it can hinder performance on easy samples (right areas), where SLMs already do well on their own [2]. Therefore, the main benefit of LLM reranking emerges for samples with low confidence, which are typically the harder cases.\n\n![LLM reranking improves micro-F1 on hard (low-confidence) samples, but may decrease it on easy (high-confidence) samples.](image6)\n\nThe chart for FewNERD in image6 visually confirms this:  \n- For low confidence scores (left of the plot), micro-F1 is significantly higher \"with LLM reranking\" (blue line) compared to \"without LLM reranking\" (red line).\n- For high confidence scores (right of the plot), micro-F1 is higher \"without LLM reranking\" (red line), indicating that reranking can lower performance for these easier samples.\n\nTherefore, for the FewNERD dataset, LLM reranking notably boosts micro-F1 on hard, low-confidence samples, but may worsen micro-F1 for easy, high-confidence samples. This supports the notion that LLM reranking is most valuable for challenging cases identified by the SLM, while it is best avoided for samples where the SLM is already confident and accurate.\n\nIn summary:  \nLLM reranking increases micro-F1 for hard (low-confidence) FewNERD samples but can decrease it for easy (high-confidence) samples [2]."}

The triplet margin loss is then applied such that the distance between the anchors (source and reference) and the \"worse\" hypothesis is greater than the distance to the \"better\" hypothesis by at least a specified margin, ε. This structure directly trains the model to make the embedding space discriminative for translation quality ranking [5][10].\n\n![Triplet margin loss pushes \"better\" hypothesis embeddings closer to source/reference and \"worse\" ones further away.](image7)\n\nIn summary:  \nThe triplet margin loss in the Translation Ranking model ensures that \"better\" translations are embedded closer to the source and reference than \"worse\" translations, facilitating effective translation quality ranking [5][10]."}

After an initial output is produced, a separate critic model (which can leverage these external sources) assesses the output and provides detailed, often natural language feedback. This feedback guides a subsequent refinement model to iteratively improve the output’s factuality, coherence, and task relevance—without updating the original model’s parameters, thereby offering transparency and flexibility[6][9].\n\n![Post-hoc correction with external feedback involves using critic and refinement models, often leveraging knowledge bases, trained models, or tools, to iteratively improve outputs based on external signals.](image3)\n\nThis approach is effective across various applications—such as question answering, reasoning, code generation, and toxicity detection—because external feedback enriches the model’s ability to identify and correct subtle or complex issues that might be missed by the language model alone. Recent advances like FACTOOL and LLM-Augmenter demonstrate how integrating external retrievers and feedback tools can boost the factual accuracy and robustness of LLM-generated content[2].\n\n![Many methods for post-hoc correction utilize external feedback sources—such as trained models or external tools—to guide refinement across a diverse set of applications.](image4)\n\nIn summary, 'Post-hoc Correction with External Feedback' improves output refinement by leveraging external evaluators for insightful feedback, which enables iterative, targeted corrections beyond the original capabilities of the language model itself."}

At each layer, it selects the top-k nodes most similar to the query based on cosine similarity, then examines the children of these nodes at the next layer, repeating this process until the leaf nodes are reached. Ultimately, the retrieved context is formed by concatenating the text from all selected nodes. This approach allows control over the specificity and breadth of information retrieved by adjusting parameters like the depth (d) and number of nodes (k) selected at each level. It starts broad at higher layers and narrows down to finer details lower in the tree, maintaining a constant ratio of higher-order thematic information to granular details[8][9][11].\n\nCollapsed Tree Retrieval, in contrast, flattens the hierarchical tree into a single layer, placing all nodes from different layers on the same level. Rather than traversing the tree step by step, it searches all nodes simultaneously and selects those most relevant to the query, regardless of their original position in the hierarchy. This method provides greater flexibility and can retrieve information at the optimal level of granularity for a given question. It has been found to consistently perform better in experiments, as it is not constrained by a preset ratio of hierarchical information and can adapt to the needs of complex queries[3][10][11].\n\n![Tree Traversal navigates layer-by-layer, while Collapsed Tree searches all nodes simultaneously for retrieval.](image3)\n\nA performance comparison further illustrates the advantage of Collapsed Tree Retrieval, especially as context length increases, where it consistently yields higher F1 scores on evaluated tasks.\n\n![Collapsed Tree Retrieval outperforms Tree Traversal Retrieval in F1 score across context lengths.](image4)\n\nIn summary, Tree Traversal Retrieval searches the tree level-by-level, while Collapsed Tree Retrieval evaluates all nodes together, often resulting in improved and more flexible retrieval."}

When only conditional training (CT) is applied to control question-asking, the model can achieve near the full range of question frequencies, from about 1.4% up to 97.7%. However, when repetition control is added, the maximum achievable question frequency drops significantly—for example, at the highest setting (z=10), question-asking rate falls from 97.7% (CT only) to about 79.7% (CT with repetition control)[10]. This occurs because repetition control mechanisms (like discouraging repeated bigrams) inadvertently block common question-phrasing bigrams such as \"do you\" and \"what is\", thus limiting the generation of questions[10]. \n\nThis effect is clearly illustrated by the following evidence:\n\n- The combination of question-control and repetition control produces lower rates of question-asking at all control levels compared to question-control alone.[10]\n- At the highest control setting (z=10), the question-asking rate is only 79.7% with repetition control, compared to 97.7% without it.

For example, in the open-domain setting, the addition of two gold paragraphs to 500 retrieved paragraphs causes the F1 score to jump from 39.12 to 53.12—a substantial improvement—demonstrating that retrieval failures are a major bottleneck for QA performance. In contrast, in the standard distractor setting (where the two gold paragraphs are given with eight TF-IDF-selected distractors), the single-paragraph BERT model achieves an even higher F1 of 67.08, demonstrating that controlled inclusion of gold paragraphs makes questions much more answerable[5][4].\n\n![Including gold paragraphs with retrieved candidates significantly increases the F1 score, as shown in the table.](image4)\n\nThe distractor selection method also matters. Using standard TF-IDF retrieval for distractors often results in \"weak\" distractors, making single-hop shortcuts possible and leading to inflated F1 scores that do not reflect genuine multi-hop reasoning ability[12][9]. However, when distractors are selected adversarially—specifically chosen to be harder or more confusing—the original model’s F1 drops sharply (e.g., from 67.08 F1 to 46.84 F1). Notably, if the model is retrained with these adversarial distractors, it can partially recover, reaching 60.10 F1, indicating that models can adapt to more challenging settings if exposed to them during training[2][3].\n\n![Adversarial distractors lower accuracy unless the model is retrained on similar examples.](image2)\n\nThe implication is that current evaluation strategies may overstate performance by making the task artificially easy through weak distractors; robust evaluation must ensure distractors require true multi-hop reasoning. Furthermore, much of the performance bottleneck in open-domain settings stems from the retrieval stage rather than the reading comprehension model itself. This suggests a need for improved retrieval systems and more sophisticated distractor selection to accurately measure and boost multi-hop reasoning abilities in QA models[5][11][6].\n\nIn summary:  \nIncluding gold paragraphs and having weaker distractors greatly boost F1 scores, not necessarily reflecting true multi-hop capability, while strong distractors and retrieval issues expose the real limitations of current models, emphasizing the need for better distractor selection and retrieval methods to achieve reliable evaluation and model improvement."}

Each token in the sentence is aligned with its corresponding entity mention, mention type, parent entity, and the specific relation that explains its occurrence relative to other entities already introduced in the discourse.\n\nThe annotation table distinguishes tokens by:\n- The entity they mention, linking text spans to unique Wikidata entities.\n- The mention type: whether the token refers to a new entity (not previously mentioned) or is related to an existing one.\n- The relation connecting an entity to its parent in the graph (e.g., \"pub date\" or \"genre\").\n- The parent entity, which is either an earlier mentioned entity or null if applicable.\n\nFor example, the token \"Super Mario Land\" is annotated as a new entity mention, while \"1989\" is annotated as related to \"Super Mario Land\" via the \"pub date\" relation. Each row in the annotation helps trace factual references and coreference links across the sentence, which aids in both capturing complex inter-entity relationships and improving entity disambiguation [4].\n\nThis structured representation leverages human-provided Wikipedia/Wikidata links, as well as automated coreference and entity linking methods to fill in additional connections or to resolve pronouns and related expressions. The annotation further accommodates multiple plausible relations for ambiguous cases, and uses expanded string matching to account for entities, dates, and numerical values that may have varied surface forms [2][5].\n\nBelow is a visual example of such an annotation:\n![An example annotation table aligning tokens with entity mentions, relations, and parent entities.](image4)\n\nThis approach is complemented by a graphical knowledge representation, linking entities like \"Super Mario Land,\" \"Nintendo,\" \"Game Boy,\" and others with labeled directed edges representing their relations:\n![A knowledge graph illustrating entities (e.g., Super Mario Land, Nintendo, Game Boy) and labeled relations (e.g., PUBLISHER, PLATFORM, MANUFACTURER) among them.](image7)\n\nIn summary, entities and their relationships are represented as richly annotated tables and structured graphs, tracing tokens in text to knowledge graph entities and explicitly listing their semantic relations and parentage for precise factual modeling."}

A better initial query “sets up” the active learning loop for better outcomes, and HTC maximizes the value of the first labeled data [4][9].\n\nIn conclusion:\n\nThe ‘Hard-to-Contrast’ querying strategy consistently achieves higher AUC compared to other active learning methods across all labeling stages and datasets, highlighting the critical value of careful initial query selection in active learning."}

This is demonstrated by tasks such as applying Fourier Transforms, solving equilibrium problems, interpreting complex diagrams, and analyzing medical scans, all of which go far beyond traditional visual question answering [1][2][6][10].\n\n![MMMU supports interleaved text and image inputs, requiring complex perceptual and reasoning skills.](image8)\n![Contrasted with other benchmarks, MMMU stands out for both reasoning depth and breadth of knowledge.](image4)\n\n### Practical Implications\n\nThe implication is that MMMU provides a more realistic and challenging assessment of LMM performance, especially for systems aspiring to expert-level or AGI-relevant capabilities. It tests not just basic perceptual ability, but integration of perception, domain expertise, and complex reasoning—traits considered essential for advanced AI [3][12]. Its difficulty (e.g., GPT-4V’s accuracy is only 55.7%) highlights substantial headroom for progress among even the most advanced models [8]. Therefore, strong performance on MMMU is argued to be a necessary milestone for demonstrating truly expert multimodal understanding.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nMMMU surpasses previous benchmarks by requiring both broad interdisciplinary coverage and deep, expert-level reasoning with diverse and interleaved modalities, making it a state-of-the-art challenge for evaluating the true competence of large multimodal models."}

This is achieved by prompting the LLM to identify entities, relevant facts, rules, and the specific logic needed to represent the problem symbolically, often using notations such as Logic Programming (LP), First-Order Logic (FOL), Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSP), or SAT formulations, depending on the task at hand [1][5]. For example, a natural language statement about a TV show and user actions gets converted into predicates, premises, and a query in symbolic logic, as illustrated below:\n\n![A problem is translated into symbolic formulas including predicates, premises, and conclusions.](image3)\n\nOnce the symbolic formulation is generated, the Symbolic Reasoner module takes over. This module passes the symbolic problem to an appropriate external symbolic solver—such as a logic programming engine, first-order logic prover, constraint optimizer, or SMT solver. The solver performs deterministic inference to derive the answer, ensuring that the reasoning process is faithful and interpretable, as long as the input symbolic formulation is correct [2][9]. The symbolic solver’s output is an answer in symbolic form, such as ConductElectricity(Nail, True).\n\nFinally, the Result Interpreter module translates the symbolic result back into natural language, presenting an answer that is directly understandable. This stage ensures that users receive clear explanations linked to the initial question [2][12]. The system can also use error messages from the symbolic solver for self-refinement, iteratively improving the symbolic formulation if an initial attempt was incorrect [10][12].\n\nThe overall workflow, illustrated below, shows how each of these modules interacts—starting with natural language, going through symbolic translation and reasoning, and ending with a human-readable answer:\n\n![The LOGIC-LM architecture operates via problem formulation, symbolic reasoning, and result interpretation, integrating LLMs and symbolic solvers for faithful reasoning.](image5)\n\nIn summary, LOGIC-LM decomposes problem-solving into (1) translating NL to symbolic logic, (2) using deterministic symbolic solvers for reasoning, and (3) interpreting the results back to NL, thus leveraging both the language understanding of LLMs and the accuracy of symbolic reasoning modules."}

As detailed in the sources, in object detection datasets, the system begins by cropping image regions based on proposal bounding boxes and then resizing them to a fixed proportion. This isolates individual objects of varying sizes and locations within an image, ensuring that the encoded embeddings focus specifically on the objects of interest rather than irrelevant background details. Additionally, a blurring technique is applied to the non-target areas surrounding each object, which helps to further direct the attention of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to the relevant objects—thereby improving identification accuracy in challenging detection scenarios [8].\n\nThis pre-processed input is then passed through the image encoder to generate embeddings for each object region, which are subsequently used for retrieval against a memory bank. The retrieval and ranking steps that follow, leveraging these focused embeddings, result in much more contextually accurate predictions in zero-shot object recognition [3][8][7]. Overall, pre-processing refines the input so that embeddings best represent each object, boosting the capability of the system to handle small, variably placed targets.\n\n![Pre-processing consists of cropping proposed regions and blurring non-target areas to isolate objects for embedding and retrieval.](image8)\n\nIn summary, pre-processing with cropping and blurring tailors the input for the recognition pipeline, directly enabling more precise zero-shot recognition by focusing on the objects of interest."}

Research also introduced and examined statistical \"laws of semantic change,\" local measures for cultural shifts, and began to address challenges such as joint learning across time spans and the criticism of existing laws [6].\n\nThus, the key milestones from 2010 to 2017 in tracing diachronic semantic shifts are: (1) time tensor modeling, (2) availability of large diachronic corpora, (3) development of temporal evaluation methods, (4) adoption of prediction-based and embedding models (especially word2vec), (5) incremental updates to embeddings, (6) alignment of models across time, and (7) theoretical and empirical advances in understanding and critiquing semantic change laws, all visualized chronologically in the provided figure.\n\nIn summary: The principal milestones from 2010 to 2017 in tracing diachronic semantic shifts include the introduction of time tensor methods, large-scale textual corpora (like Google Ngrams), word2vec and related neural embeddings, incremental update techniques, model alignment, and a series of empirical and theoretical advancements in evaluating and understanding semantic change [1][3][8][10][12].\n"}

According to the ablation study, removing the abstract from the input significantly reduces performance across tasks, as relying solely on the title leads to markedly lower scores. Conversely, supplementing the input with venue information has a minimal impact overall but slightly benefits document classification. Interestingly, adding author names tends to hurt performance, likely due to their sparsity, inadequate tokenization, and poor semantic informativeness for document relatedness. The inclusion of \"hard negatives\" during training is also crucial—excluding them lowers the model's effectiveness in all evaluated tasks. Moreover, initializing SPECTER with SciBERT rather than BERT-Large yields considerably better results, as SciBERT is pretrained on scientific text and thus more aligned with SPECTER's target domain [2][8].\n\n![Table showing ablation results for features like \"no abstract\", \"+venue\", \"+author\", \"no hard negatives\", and BERT-Large initialization, with SPECTER (title+abstract) achieving the best average.](image1)\n\nTextual evidence further explains that removing the abstract leads to substantial drops in performance, adding venues only helps slightly (mainly for classification), and including authors introduces noise. The necessity of hard negatives is reinforced, as omitting them reduces performance on all tasks [8][2]. Performance metrics illustrate improvements or degradations as features are modified.\n\nIn summary, including the abstract and hard negative distractors is essential for strong SPECTER performance, while adding author names is detrimental, and venues have a task-dependent effect.

In contrast, the collapsed tree method flattens the hierarchical tree structure, allowing a simultaneous comparison of all nodes irrespective of their tree level, and thus enables flexible selection of context at varying granularity depending on the query requirements [4][9][10][11]. This greater flexibility is suggested to provide the collapsed tree method with an advantage in adaptive information retrieval [6].\n\nEmpirical evidence further demonstrates this point:\n\n- Figure 8 shows F1 scores for both methods across varying context lengths. The collapsed tree approach consistently outperforms tree traversal at all tested context lengths. The F1 score for the collapsed tree method rises sharply as context increases and levels off, maintaining a lead over tree traversal, which also improves with context but never surpasses the collapsed tree [6].\n- The context length represents the amount of retrieved text provided to the model. The superior and consistent performance of the collapsed tree approach is attributed to its flexibility in context selection, as it is not bound by layer-wise ratios like in tree traversal [6].\n\n![Collapsed tree has higher F1 across all context lengths compared to tree traversal](image8)\n\nIn summary, the collapsed tree querying method achieves higher F1 scores across all tested context lengths compared to tree traversal, due to its ability to flexibly select the most relevant nodes without layer constraints [6]."}

According to the available evidence, these areas are:\n\n- **Identifying talent: Search** – mastering effective searching, including Boolean search strategies.\n- **Engaging talent: LinkedIn presence and InMail**.\n- **Building a talent pipeline: Talent Pipeline and pipelining**.\n- **Posting jobs: Jobs**.\n- **Maximizing efficiency: Tools for organization and collaboration**.\n\nThis is visually summarized in the following diagram:\n\n![The LinkedIn Recruiter Certification exam covers search, engagement, pipelining, job postings, and efficiency tools.](image4)\n\nOne essential skill under \"Identifying talent: Search\" is constructing accurate Boolean search strings. For instance, understanding a query like \"Engineering AND Java NOT Manager\" allows recruiters to narrow down results to only those candidates who match all specified criteria—an essential part of sourcing the right talent. The connection to Venn diagrams comes into play as such diagrams visually represent the logic of Boolean searches, making it easier to determine exactly which group of candidates meet the criteria.\n\nFor example, applying the search \"Engineering AND Java NOT Manager\" to a Venn diagram (see below), the relevant areas are those that are in both the \"Engineering\" and \"Java\" circles but exclude any overlap with \"Manager.\" In the sample diagram, this corresponds specifically to area E:\n\n![In a Venn diagram, area E represents candidates with both Engineering and Java experience, excluding Managers.](image7)\n\nMastering how Boolean logic translates visually through Venn diagrams helps recruiters clearly understand the outcomes of their search queries and efficiently identify the right candidates, which is a core part of the exam and real-world recruiting situations [4].\n\n**In summary:**\nCandidates need to focus on sourcing/search strategies (including Boolean search and its representation in Venn diagrams), candidate engagement, talent pipelining, job postings, and maximizing recruiting efficiency—all fundamental for the LinkedIn Recruiter Certification exam [4]. \n\nUnderstanding how Boolean logic maps to Venn diagrams (such as isolating qualified candidate pools) is crucial for the \"Identifying talent: Search\" portion of the exam."}

The top three reported challenges in 2006 were:\n\n- Lack of Financial Support (increased to 20% in 2006 from 18% in 2005)\n- Lack of Staffing Resources (rose from 13% to 17%)\n- Vendor's Inability to Effectively Deliver Product (jumped from 12% to 18%)\n\nOther notable, though less significant challenges, included proving IT quantifiable benefits/ROI, achieving end-user acceptance, and lack of clinical leadership—all of which saw minor increases or remained static over the two years. Interestingly, lack of common data standards and laws prohibiting technology sharing remained less significant barriers, but ticked upwards slightly, suggesting growing concern as adoption becomes broader.\n![The leading barriers to healthcare IT adoption in 2005 and 2006 were financial support, staffing resources, and vendor effectiveness, all with increased concern in 2006.](image8)\n\n**Key Applications of Health IT (2006 vs. 2005):**\n\nOver these years, the healthcare sector continued to prioritize applications that facilitate efficiency, safety, and integration. The most important applications in both years were:\n\n- Electronic Medical Records (EMR): Notably the highest, rising slightly to 62% in 2006 from 61% in 2005.\n- Bar Coded Medication Management and Computerized Practitioner Order Entry (CPOE): Both increased as priorities.\n- Enterprise-wide clinical information sharing, clinical data repositories, point-of-care decision support, and digital picture archiving systems saw consistent or increased adoption rates as well.\n\nAmbulatory systems, although lowest in priority, still saw a slight increase in 2006.\n![Top health IT applications in 2006 and 2005 were EMRs, bar-coded medication management, and CPOE, showing increased adoption rates.](image6)\n\n**Broader Trends and Changes Over the Years:**\n\nThe evidence shows the industry still lagged behind others in IT adoption by about a decade or more in 2006 [1]. However, the incremental year-on-year increases in both priority and reported usage/adoption across key applications and security tools (such as firewalls and data encryption) indicate a gradual but persistent move towards digitization, integration, and security hardening.\n\n**Direct Answer:**  \nThe major challenges in healthcare IT in 2006 compared to 2005 were primarily increased concerns about financial support, staffing, and vendor effectiveness, while the most important applications shifted toward greater adoption of EMRs, medication management, and order entry systems, reflecting the industry's steady move toward digitization and integration."}

However, these numbers are expected to increase substantially within two years, with access to patient clinical information projected at 53% and physician clinical order access at 57%![Use of patient information and clinical order functions is expected to rise significantly in the next two years](image1). This trend shows a clear movement towards broader availability and integration of vital clinical data.\n\nThe drive for these changes is largely due to issues in the current system: fragmentation of patient information and the creation of redundant, inefficient efforts, which can compromise care and resource use [2]. The anticipated future system aims to consolidate information and serve as a foundation for more unified healthcare processes [10].\n\nSupporting this, the adoption of core clinical systems—such as Electronic Medical Records (EMRs), Computerized Practitioner Order Entry (CPOE), and enterprise-wide clinical information sharing—tends to rise over time.

Reporting typically raises questions but doesn’t provide context or action steps; it generally offers data in the form of dashboards or alerts [2]. \n\n![Reporting provides descriptive data and information, forming the initial step in the analytics value chain.](image2)\n\nThe next step is **analysis**, which is prescriptive and answers \"why did this happen?\", moving toward \"what should we do?\". Analysis transforms data and information into insights, provides findings and recommendations, and incorporates storytelling to supply context to the reports [2]. \n\n![As the analytics process progresses, analysis generates insights, recommendations, and actionable context from the data.](image2)\n\nAs shown in the analytics value chain, moving from reporting and analysis to **action** is essential for generating tangible business value. Actions taken based on insights close the loop, allowing organizations to realize true value from their data investments [3]. If insights are not acted upon, value is not created, as highlighted by Zynga’s philosophy: \"If you have brilliant insight and you did great research and no one changes, you get zero credit\" [4].\n\n![The analytics value chain visualizes the progression from raw data through reporting, analysis, action, and finally to business value.](image1)\n\nThe levels of analytics further define this progression from basic **standard and ad-hoc reports** (describing what happened and raising alerts when necessary); to **query drilldown** (diagnosing the root of a problem); and advancing to **statistical analysis, forecasting, predictive modeling, and optimization**.

Level of Detail\n- The framework advocates for a **goals-driven** approach and typically employs **requirements envisioning (light specification)** over comprehensive, upfront specification. This means identifying high-level requirements to maintain flexibility and adaptability, avoiding “big design up front” and reducing waste.\n\n#### 2. View Types\n- Multiple perspectives may be employed, including **usage modeling, domain modeling, process modeling, user interface modeling, and non-functional requirements**. This holistic view ensures that both the business and technical aspects, as well as usability and performance criteria, are considered from the outset.\n\n#### 3. Modeling Strategy\n- Agile teams are encouraged to prefer **informal modeling sessions** (such as whiteboard discussions or quick diagramming) to quickly clarify ideas, though formal sessions and interviews may be used as needed.\n\n#### 4. Work Item Management Strategy\n- Work items are typically organized in a **work item list** or **requirements backlog**, supporting transparent and adaptive scope management. This allows for incremental elaboration and re-prioritization as more is learned throughout the lifecycle.\n\n#### 5. Non-Functional Requirements\n- Explicit attention is paid to **acceptance criteria** and technical stories, ensuring that non-functional requirements (like performance, security, reliability) are tracked alongside functional needs.\n\n### Related Practices and Tools\n\nThese strategies are supported by agile modeling practices such as **requirements envisioning, active stakeholder participation, and just-in-time (JIT) model storming**:\n![Disciplined Agile leverages just-in-time modeling, active stakeholder participation, and high-level requirements specification in needs exploration.](image8)\n\nThis interplay of approaches ensures that the scope is well-understood enough to proceed, but not overly specified early, maintaining agility.

Gregor Mendel showed that each parent passes on heritable factors (now known as genes) to their offspring and that these factors can exist in different forms called alleles [4]. During the formation of gametes, the alleles segregate so that each gamete carries only one allele for each gene [11].\n\nIn a typical Mendelian monohybrid cross involving purple (dominant, P) and white (recessive, p) flower color, true-breeding parents (PP and pp) are crossed to produce F1 hybrids (all Pp) which all express the dominant purple flower phenotype.

Management and cultural resistance, as well as a deficit in clear processes, roles, and skilled resources, also play significant roles [11]. \n\nIn summary, the major barriers to adopting an integrated customer management approach are organizational silos, misaligned and incomplete measurement strategies, an overreliance on single-touchpoint attribution, lack of leadership commitment, resource deficiencies, and insufficient integration of customer-focused metrics."}

This process reduces the chromosome number by half, converting diploid cells to haploid cells. Homologous chromosomes separate in meiosis I, but sister chromatids remain attached [1], [3], [11].\n\n![Homologous chromosomes are separated in meiosis I, reducing chromosome number](image4)\nThis image shows homologous pairs coming together, crossing over, aligning, and finally being pulled apart into separate cells after metaphase I.\n\nFollowing meiosis I, meiosis II resembles a typical mitotic division, where the sister chromatids of each chromosome are finally separated. Each of the two haploid cells from meiosis I divides again, splitting the sister chromatids and resulting in four haploid daughter cells. Here, no further reduction in chromosome number occurs; instead, the number of chromosomes stays the same, but each chromatid ends up in a separate cell [6], [11].\n\n![Sister chromatids are separated in meiosis II to form four haploid daughter cells](image2)\nThis image diagrammatically shows how, after homologous chromosomes have been separated, the sister chromatids are pulled apart in each haploid cell during meiosis II.\n\nIn summary, meiosis I separates homologous chromosomes and halves the chromosome number, while meiosis II separates sister chromatids without changing chromosome number, resulting in four haploid cells."}

Using this information, the ECU determines the quantity of fuel to inject (by controlling the injectors), adjusts ignition timing for optimal performance, and regulates idle speed to keep the engine running smoothly [4][3][5][6]. All these actions are taken with the goal of maintaining efficient combustion, improving power output, and reducing emissions.\n\nThe connections and flow of information between the sensors, ECU, and injectors are visually summarized in the following block diagram:\n![The ECU receives signals from various engine sensors and sends control signals to multiple injectors for precise engine management.](image1)\n\nTherefore, the ECU serves as the \"brain\" of the engine management system, integrating sensor data to control fuel, spark, and idle for optimal engine operation."}

In standard consumption settings, after a certain point, each additional hot dog provides less and eventually negative utility—eating more becomes unpleasant, as shown by the steadily decreasing utility values in the left table (\"Diminishing marginal utility\") in the image below:\n\n![In standard consumption, utility for each additional hot dog consistently decreases, even turning negative.](image1)\n\nThis is clearly visible in the table: the utility from each hot dog goes from +6 to increasingly negative values as more are eaten. This reflects what typically happens when people eat for pleasure rather than competition: enjoyment drops off, and negative consequences (like discomfort) increase. This concept is directly described in [2], which explains the logic behind switching choices when enjoyment drops.\n\nHowever, in a competitive context, the evaluation of each additional hot dog changes dramatically. Instead of a steady decline, the marginal utility of certain hot dogs spikes at significant milestones (for example, breaking or tying a record in an eating competition). In the right table of the same image (\"Differential outcome\"), while most additional hot dogs continue to decrease in utility, reaching a milestone—such as the 64th or 65th hot dog—suddenly confers immense utility due to the competitive reward or recognition. At 64 hot dogs, utility jumps to +5000, and at 65 it soars to +10000. This is because the competitive outcome (victory, record, or prize) is all-or-nothing, not smooth and incremental.\n\n![In competition, utility spikes at milestone hot dogs, highlighting the impact of competitive goals over standard enjoyment.](image1)\n\nIn summary, while diminishing marginal utility in standard consumption leads to consistently lower and more negative utility per extra unit, in competitive contexts the utility may spike sharply at crucial achievement points due to the value of winning or record-setting, overriding the typical decline in personal enjoyment. \n\nDirectly: In standard consumption, utility declines for each extra hot dog, but in competition, utility can spike at key milestones due to the significance of those achievements [2]."}
