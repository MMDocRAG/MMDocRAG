In contrast, the percentage of Democrats who hold this view has dropped from 42% in September 2014 to 30% in the most recent survey [1].\n\nThe trends over time can be visualized in a line graph showing the percentages for Republicans, Democrats, and Independents from 2002 to 2015 [image2]. The Republican line shows a significant increase from 33% in 2002 to 68% in 2015, while the Democratic line demonstrates a slight decrease from 22% in 2002 to 30% in 2015. Independents' views show a moderate increase from 26% in 2002 to 45% in 2015.\n\nFurthermore, ideological divides have become starker, with 77% of conservative Republicans believing that Islam encourages violence more than other religions, compared to only 16% who disagree [4]. On the other hand, liberal Democrats are nearly inverse, with 73% saying Islam does not encourage violence more than other religions [4].\n\nA detailed breakdown by demographic and political groups also reveals significant shifts. For example, white evangelical Protestants remain the highest group at 70% who think Islam encourages violence, while Catholics and white mainline Protestants stand at 49% and 51%, respectively [9]. Age also plays a role, with only 32% of those aged 18 to 29 associating Islam with violence, compared to 51% of Americans 65 and older [3].\n\nOverall, perceptions about the relationship between Islam and violence have remained politically polarized and have shown little change since last year, although they have fluctuated over the past decade [6]. The partisan divide over this issue is now as wide as it has ever been [11].\n\nIn conclusion, perceptions of whether Islam encourages violence more than other religions have become increasingly divided along political lines, with Republicans holding stronger associations between Islam and violence and Democrats showing a decreasing trend in this belief. ![Perceptions of Islam and violence have diverged sharply between Republicans and Democrats over time](image2)"}

According to surveys, 72% of Americans are worried about robots and computers taking over many human jobs, compared to only 33% who are enthusiastic [1]. This sentiment is echoed in another finding where 67% express worry about algorithms making hiring decisions without human involvement, while just 22% are enthusiastic [1].\n\nThe level of familiarity with this concept also plays a significant role in shaping perceptions. A substantial majority (85%) of Americans have heard or read about automation impacting employment, and 77% consider this idea at least somewhat realistic [2]. Among those who have heard a lot about this concept, nearly half (48%) find it extremely realistic that machines might one day do many of the jobs currently done by humans, which is significantly higher than those with less awareness ![{Higher awareness leads to higher realism perception}](image6).\n\nMoreover, public opinion tends to anticipate more negative outcomes from automation. For instance, 76% believe that inequality between rich and poor will worsen, and 64% think people will struggle to find purpose in life ![{Majority see negative outcomes as likely}](image1). Despite these concerns, there is some optimism regarding positive changes, such as the economy becoming more efficient or people focusing less on work, although fewer respondents expect these benefits.\n\nIn summary, Americans are more worried than enthusiastic about machines potentially doing many human jobs, with a significant portion anticipating negative consequences."}

This sentiment is echoed across party lines, with just over half of Republicans (54%) and a slightly higher percentage of Democrats (60%) agreeing that there should be such limits [7].\n\nMoreover, when it comes to specific policies, the public shows strong support for restricting machines to jobs that are dangerous or unhealthy for humans. According to a survey, 85% of Americans favor this type of policy, with nearly half (47%) expressing strong support ![{Strong support for limiting machines to dangerous or unhealthy jobs}](image1). This indicates a clear preference for protecting workers from harm while allowing automation where it can provide safety benefits.\n\nAdditionally, the public expresses more measured support for other interventions aimed at mitigating the impact of widespread automation. For instance, there is considerable backing for providing all Americans with a guaranteed income to meet basic needs (60% in favor) and establishing a national service program that would pay humans to perform jobs even if machines could do them faster or cheaper (58% in favor) [4]. These policies suggest a desire to balance the benefits of automation with protections for displaced workers.\n\nIn conclusion, the majority of the public supports placing limits on the number of jobs businesses can replace with machines and favors policies that restrict automation to dangerous or unhealthy jobs."}

Many Americans believe that a lack of encouragement for girls and minorities to pursue STEM from an early age is a significant factor; 39% attribute this as a major reason for the lack of women in some STEM areas, and 41% say it's a major reason for the underrepresentation of blacks and Hispanics [1].\n\nAdditionally, limited access to quality education plays a crucial role. About half of STEM workers see this as a major reason why blacks and Hispanics are underrepresented in these fields [3]. Specifically, 42% of Americans cite limited access to quality education as a major reason for the underrepresentation of blacks and Hispanics in the STEM workforce [11]. This view is particularly strong among black STEM workers, with 73% holding this belief [11].\n\nDiscrimination also emerges as a critical issue. According to the data, 62% of black STEM workers report experiencing discrimination at work due to their race or ethnicity [2]. Moreover, 72% of black STEM employees believe that discrimination in recruiting, hiring, and promotions is a major reason for the underrepresentation of blacks and Hispanics [4]. In contrast, only about a quarter of whites (27%) and Asians (28%) share this view [4].\n\nFurthermore, perceptions around self-belief and role models impact representation. Around a third of people working in STEM think that the underrepresentation is partly because these groups do not believe in their ability to succeed in these fields (34%), there is a lack of black and Hispanic role models (32%), and there is racial/ethnic discrimination in recruitment, hiring, and promotions (32%) [7].\n\nThe image data supports these findings, showing that both women and minorities face specific challenges in STEM fields. For instance, ![{Women in STEM value making a meaningful contribution to society more than men}](image1) highlights that women in STEM jobs value making a meaningful contribution to society more than men, which might influence career choices. Additionally, ![{Blacks and Hispanics are less likely to have access to quality education to prepare them for STEM fields}](image5) underscores that a lack of access to quality education is seen as a major barrier by both women and minorities.\n\nIn conclusion, the major reasons for the underrepresentation of women, blacks, and Hispanics in STEM jobs include a lack of early encouragement, limited access to quality education, and experiences of discrimination."}

The \"Later\" stage investments peaked around 2007-2008, reaching approximately €6M, while the other stages—Seed, First, and Second—showed relatively stable or less pronounced variations throughout the years. This stability suggests that early-stage investments maintained a consistent level of funding during this period.\n\nIn contrast, the trend of median U.S. investments [image6] reveals a more dynamic pattern. For instance, Seed investments remained fairly stable around €2M but saw a slight decline by 2009. The First and Second investment stages experienced peaks around 2007, with subsequent declines. Notably, Later stage investments also peaked around 2007 at just under €10M before sharply declining to near €6M by 2009. This indicates a significant fluctuation in later-stage funding in the U.S., particularly during the peak year of 2007.\n\nThe differences in investment trends between Europe and the U.S. can be attributed to several factors. European venture capital is characterized by a scarcity of VC money, leading to higher capital efficiency and selectivity among investors [1]. This environment may contribute to the relatively stable levels of early-stage investments observed in Europe. Conversely, the U.S. market, with its larger pool of available funds and fewer constraints on investment, experienced more pronounced fluctuations, especially in later-stage investments [5].\n\n![{European median investments showed stability in early stages while U.S. investments had significant fluctuations, especially in later stages}](image4)\n![{U.S. median investments displayed significant peaks in 2007 followed by declines across all stages}](image6)\n\nIn summary, European median investments were more stable, particularly in early stages, while U.S. investments showed greater variability, especially in later stages, peaking in 2007 and then declining."}

For instance, among those with at least a college degree, 31% believe that \"high ethical standards\" do not describe either the GOP or the Democratic Party [12]. In contrast, fewer individuals with some college experience (26%) or a high school degree or less (20%) think neither party has high ethical standards [4]. This trend is visually represented in a bar chart where the percentages for each education level are clearly displayed ![{Higher education correlates with greater skepticism about party ethics}](image6).\n\nPolitical affiliation also plays a crucial role in shaping these perceptions. Independents are significantly more likely than partisans to say neither party has \"high ethical standards.\" About a third of independents (34%), including equal shares of Republican leaners and Democratic leaners (33% each) hold this view, compared to only about two-in-ten Republicans (19%) or Democrats (18%) [9]. The bar chart further emphasizes this divide by showing the varying degrees of skepticism among different political groups ![{Independents are more skeptical of party ethics than partisans}](image6).\n\nIn terms of Trump's approval ratings, significant differences exist based on demographics such as race, age, and education. Younger adults, those with higher levels of education, and non-whites are more likely to disapprove of the job Trump is doing [2]. Among those with at least a college degree, there is a notable disapproval trend, reinforcing the notion that education influences political views. A bar graph illustrating disapproval and approval ratings among different demographic groups highlights these disparities ![{Disapproval rates are higher among younger, more educated, and non-white groups}](image1).\n\nMoreover, the overall balance of opinion among independents leans more negative than positive towards Trump’s administration. Two-thirds (65%) say the administration’s ethical standards are “not good” or “poor,” while 31% say they are “excellent” or “good.” Among independents who lean toward the GOP, 67% say the administration’s ethical standards are excellent or good, while nearly nine-in-ten independents who lean toward the Democratic Party (88%) rate the standards as not good or poor [7].

Among Trump voters, health care emerges as the top priority with 29% naming it as such [5], which aligns with the higher confidence they express in Trump handling this issue compared to Clinton voters who only 12% prioritize health care [image5]. This discrepancy is further emphasized by the fact that among those who mentioned what they would like to see done regarding health care, Trump voters were more inclined to mention repealing the Affordable Care Act, while Clinton voters preferred maintaining or fixing it [10].\n\nEconomy and immigration are also areas where Trump voters show a stronger focus; 15% of Trump voters prioritize the economy versus 9% of Clinton voters, and 15% of Trump voters prioritize immigration against just 6% of Clinton voters [image5].

About a quarter (23%) of Clinton voters suggest healing divisions as a top priority for Trump, with 12% wanting him to prioritize unifying the country and 11% urging him to change his personal behavior and address campaign-created divisions [6].

This disparity is further emphasized when examining how these views have evolved over time.\n\nHistorically, the partisan divide on this issue was less pronounced, but it has widened significantly in recent years [5]. For instance, image7 shows a line graph indicating that the \"Too much\" category for Republican views increased from 52% in 2013 to 62% in 2020, while the \"Too little\" category dropped sharply from 19% in 2013 to just 8% in 2020 ![The orange line representing \"Too much\" rises significantly over time](image7). \n\nOn the other hand, Democrats are more likely to think the U.S. should do more to address global challenges.

Image1 provides additional context by showing that among Democrats, especially liberal Democrats, there is a higher inclination towards supporting international aid, with 64% believing the U.S. should help other countries deal with their problems [12].

The \"Too little\" category saw an increase from 16% in 2013 to 46% in 2020, reflecting a growing sentiment among some groups that the U.S. needs to be more involved internationally. Meanwhile, the \"Too much\" category, which was at 48% in 2013, decreased to 26% in 2020, suggesting a shift in perception even within those who initially felt the U.S. was overly involved ![The green line for \"Too little\" increases significantly over time](image6).\n\nIn conclusion, perceptions of the U.S. role in solving world problems have become increasingly polarized along party lines, with Republicans generally feeling the U.S. does too much and Democrats believing the U.S. should do more, and these views have changed notably over the past few years."}

Around three-quarters of Democrats are critical of the U.S.’s response (73%), while similar shares of Republicans praise the country’s handling of the outbreak (71%) [5]. Higher education correlates with more critical evaluations of the U.S. response, with two-thirds of those with a postgraduate degree saying the U.S. has done a poor job [6]. ![Critical evaluations increase with higher education](image5).\n\nIn summary, Republicans tend to favor focusing on domestic issues and perceive U.S. global engagement as excessive, while Democrats are more inclined to support international assistance and have more critical views of the U.S. response to global challenges. Educational attainment generally aligns with greater support for global engagement and more critical assessments of U.S. policies.\n\nTo directly answer your question: Views on U.S. global engagement and dealing with domestic issues are starkly divided by political affiliation, with Republicans preferring a focus on domestic issues and Democrats supporting more international involvement.

For example, younger users (ages 18-49) are more accepting of using their data to recommend events in their area or show advertisements for products, whereas older users (ages 65+) are less accepting of these practices [11].\n\nIn conclusion, understanding these gender-based differences in perceptions can help social media platforms tailor their content and advertisements more effectively, thereby enhancing user satisfaction and engagement. Social media platforms should aim to mitigate negative experiences particularly for men who are more likely to encounter them and promote positive interactions for all users."}

For instance, younger users (ages 18-49) are more accepting of social media sites recommending people they might want to know compared to older users (ages 65 and older), with a two-to-one margin [4]. This trend is visually represented in the chart where dots indicate higher percentages for younger age groups approving recommendations of potential friends `![{younger users are more likely to approve friend recommendations}](image3)`.\n\nRegarding advertisements, while about half of all users find it acceptable for social media platforms to show ads, this acceptance decreases with age. The bar chart shows that only 39% of users aged 65 and older find ads acceptable, whereas 60% of users aged 30-49 do [2]; `![{acceptance of ads decreases with age}](image3)`.\n\nWhen it comes to political messages, there is even less tolerance across all age groups, but especially among older adults. A substantial majority of users think it is not acceptable for social media platforms to use their data to deliver political campaign messages, with 31% of users aged 65 and older finding this practice not at all acceptable [2]. This sentiment is echoed in the visual representation where the lowest approval rates are seen for older age groups concerning political messaging `![{older adults have lower approval for political messaging}](image3)`.\n\nOverall, user comfort with social media platforms using their data depends heavily on context and purpose [5]. Users are generally more comfortable when their data is used for positive or neutral purposes like recommending local events, which has broad acceptance across all age groups. For example, 78% of users aged 18-29 and 67% of those aged 65 and older find event recommendations acceptable [12]; `![{event recommendations are broadly accepted}](image3)`.\n\nIn conclusion, different age groups perceive the acceptability of social media platforms using their data differently, with younger users being more accepting of most uses, while older users tend to be more wary, especially concerning ads and political messages.

While 49% find it effective, 50% consider it fair, resulting in a minimal difference of -1 percentage point [8]. This suggests that the public views this system with less skepticism compared to the personal finance score.\n\nFor the automated video analysis of job interviews, 39% find it effective, while 33% see it as fair [8]. The relatively small difference of +6 percentage points implies moderate concerns about its fairness, especially considering that 67% overall find this process unacceptable ![67% find it unacceptable](image2).\n\nAutomated resume screening of job applicants is viewed as effective by 47% and fair by 43%, with an even smaller difference of +4 percentage points [8]. This slight gap suggests that the public generally perceives this system as both somewhat effective and fair, though still with reservations.\n\nThese differences imply varying levels of public trust in these systems. Systems with larger gaps between perceived effectiveness and fairness, like the personal finance score, indicate lower public trust due to significant concerns over fairness. Conversely, systems with smaller or negative gaps, such as the automated scoring for parole, suggest higher public trust as they are perceived as more balanced.\n\nOverall, the public's trust in automated decision-making systems seems to hinge critically on perceptions of fairness. Even if a system is seen as effective, substantial doubts about its fairness can undermine public confidence, as evidenced by the large disparity in views on the personal finance score [11].\n\nIn conclusion, the differences in perceptions of fairness and effectiveness across various automated systems highlight the importance of addressing public concerns about fairness to build greater trust in these technologies."}

Nearly half of Americans (48%) rate Trump’s response as \"poor,\" which has increased by 16 points since March [9]. Additionally, positive evaluations of Trump have declined significantly, reflecting growing criticism [7].\n\nFurthermore, trust in state and local governments remains higher than in the federal government across political affiliations. For instance, while 51% of the total population trust state and local governments, only 48% trust the federal government `![{Trust in state and local governments is higher than in the federal government}](image5)`. Among Republicans/Lean Republican, this difference is even more pronounced, with 68% trusting state and local governments compared to just 30% trusting the federal government.\n\nMoreover, when evaluating the effectiveness of responses, there is a clear disparity between views on public health officials and Trump. While 63% of Americans still give positive ratings to public health officials like those at the CDC [12], only 37% view Trump's performance positively `![{Public health officials receive higher positive ratings than Trump}](image8)`.\n\nIn summary, American perceptions of state government's response to COVID-19 are marked by concerns over the speed of lifting restrictions but generally retain higher levels of trust compared to their highly critical views on Trump's handling of the pandemic."}

This sentiment is particularly strong among Latino Democrats and Democratic leaners, with 94% opposing his continued involvement in politics [6]. Conversely, Hispanic Republicans and GOP leaners are more supportive, with 63% wanting Trump to remain a political figure [11]. The image data reinforces this divide, showing that among Hispanic registered voters, 54% disapprove of Trump remaining a political figure, while 45% approve ![{Hispanic registered voters have mixed opinions on Trump's political role}](image1).\n\nConcerning racial discrimination, the data reveals that Hispanics who prioritize their Hispanic identity are more likely to view the failure to recognize racial discrimination as a significant problem. Specifically, two-thirds of Hispanics who find being Hispanic important to their self-identity believe that people not seeing racial discrimination where it exists is a major issue [8]. Image data also supports this trend, indicating that 61% of all Latinos feel that people often miss recognizing racial discrimination ![{Majority of Latinos perceive under-recognition of racial discrimination as a problem}](image8).\n\nOn gun rights, there is a clear preference among Hispanics for prioritizing gun control over protecting gun ownership rights. Approximately 73% of Hispanics favor controlling gun ownership, compared to just 26% who prioritize gun rights [9]. This aligns with the broader U.S. population but shows a stronger inclination towards gun control among Hispanic Democrats [7]. The bar chart confirms this trend, demonstrating that 73% of all Hispanics support gun control, while only 26% prioritize gun rights ![{Hispanics predominantly support gun control measures}](image7).\n\nIn conclusion, Hispanic registered voters' views on Trump's political future, racial discrimination, and gun rights reflect a complex interplay of political affiliation and cultural identity. Generally, they oppose Trump's continued political involvement, are concerned about the under-recognition of racial discrimination, and strongly support gun control measures."}

According to the multi-bar chart, the USA accounts for 82% of the total capital invested, while Europe only represents 18% [7]. This substantial disparity in investment volume is a reflection of the more mature and robust venture capital market in the USA.\n\nHowever, despite the lower overall investment, Europe has shown remarkable performance in terms of exit multiples and capital efficiency. The median multiple of cash invested in Europe stands at 7.2, which is notably higher than the USA's median multiple of 4.5 ![Europe has a higher median multiple of cash invested](image4). This suggests that European ventures are generating higher returns relative to the amount of capital invested.\n\nMoreover, the distribution of venture capital funds shows a different pattern when benchmarked against the US. In Europe, a higher percentage of funds fall into the top quartile, with 35% of EU VC funds in the top quartile compared to a uniform 25% across all quartiles in the US ![A higher share of EU VC funds in the top quartile](image3). This indicates better performance among the leading European venture capital funds.\n\nIn terms of specific liquidity events, the bar chart comparing venture capital investments and exits in different European regions highlights significant exit values. For instance, Germany had venture exits totaling $4.4 billion, significantly higher than its venture investments of $0.8 billion ![Higher exit values in Germany](image1). Similar trends can be observed in the UK and France, where exit values also exceeded investment amounts, indicating strong liquidity events.\n\nAdditionally, the post-IPO performance of European venture capital-backed IPOs from March 2004 to July 2011 was generally better than that of U.S. IPOs. The line graph shows that the index value of European IPOs remained consistently higher than U.S. IPOs during this period ![Better post-IPO performance in Europe](image2).\n\nIn conclusion, while the USA dominates in total capital invested, Europe demonstrates superior capital efficiency and higher exit multiples, leading to better overall performance in venture-backed liquidity events."}

According to the data, European VC has demonstrated a higher median multiple of cash invested, with a median multiple of 7.2 compared to the USA's 4.5 ![{Europe has a higher median multiple of cash invested}](image4). Additionally, a greater percentage of European investments reach a multiple of 5 or more, at 57.26% versus 47.27% for the USA [4].\n\nWhile the median exit valuation is higher in the USA at $236 million compared to Europe's $173 million, the higher capital efficiency in Europe compensates for this difference [9]. This capital efficiency results from lower entry valuations and allows European investors to be more selective, leading to better performance [11]. \n\nFurthermore, the post-IPO performance of European venture-backed companies has generally outperformed their US counterparts during the period from March 2004 to July 2011 ![{European IPOs showed better post-IPO performance}](image7). Despite having fewer exits over $100 million, Europe's exits are proportionally more successful in generating higher multiples [8]. \n\nIn summary, European venture capital performance yields higher investment multiples and capital efficiency, despite slightly lower average exit values."}

This trend continued into 2013-2014 as indicated by the line graph depicting the ARPU trends for different services [5]. Specifically, the Voice ARPU and SMS ARPU both showed a gradual decline during this period, which aligns with the reduced ARPUs observed earlier.\n\nThe significant drop in ARPU can be attributed to several factors. One key factor was the shift towards data-based communication tools like instant messaging (IM) and VoIP services, which led to less usage of traditional SMS and voice calls [9]. Additionally, the massive price war initiated by the government also contributed to reduced tariffs and subsequently lower ARPU [7].\n\nDespite the declining ARPU, Telkomsel's subscriber base grew significantly.

By early 2014, there were approximately 240 million Indonesian mobile subscribers with continuous growth throughout the year [10]. This increase in subscriber numbers likely included a rise in smartphone users as well. For instance, Telkomsel had 35.4 million smartphone users by this time ![{Telkomsel had 35.4 million smartphone users}](image3), while XL had 15 million smartphone users ![{XL had 15 million smartphone users}](image3). The rapid adoption of smartphones was influenced by factors such as increased availability of affordable devices and growing popularity of data-based services like IM and VoIP [4].\n\nRegarding ARPU trends, both Telkomsel and XL experienced a decline in their ARPU values. Voice ARPU showed a gradual decline over the years, and SMS ARPU also decreased continuously [5]. Specifically, the prepaid ARPU for Telkomsel dropped from 53 Rp'000 in 2008 to 34 Rp'000 in 2012 ![{Telkomsel's prepaid ARPU declined from 53 Rp'000 in 2008 to 34 Rp'000 in 2012}](image2), and for XL, it went from 35 Rp'000 in 2008 to 31 Rp'000 in 2012 ![{XL's prepaid ARPU declined from 35 Rp'000 in 2008 to 31 Rp'000 in 2012}](image2).

Initially, reduced ARPU was due to massive price wars initiated by the government [11], which forced GSM operators to reduce tariffs further [8]. Additionally, the shift towards data-based services led to less usage of traditional voice calls and SMS, impacting ARPU negatively [7]. However, it is noted that data ARPU initially declined but started picking up later as users' data consumption increased [5].\n\nIn conclusion, between 2013 and 2014, both Telkomsel and XL saw an increase in smartphone users but a decline in ARPU, primarily driven by the shift towards data-based services and intense competition leading to lower tariffs."}

Some formats achieve notably higher F1 scores than others, indicating that the specific wording and structure of instructions can greatly affect outcomes [7].\n\nRegarding **demonstration numbers**, the middle graph illustrates that ChatGPT tends to perform better as the number of demonstrations increases. This suggests that providing more examples within the context length limits can enhance ChatGPT's understanding and thus its performance [11]. However, this improvement is not indefinite; there is a point where additional demonstrations do not contribute further gains due to input length constraints [6].\n\nFor **demonstration selection strategies**, the right graph compares three methods: random sampling, sentence embedding, and Efficient Prompt Retriever (EPR). The EPR strategy consistently outperforms the other two, followed by sentence embedding, with random sampling being the least effective. This aligns with previous findings that retrieval-based strategies improve performance over random sampling [2].\n\nComparing ChatGPT and Codex with other models, the overall trend is that proprietary LLMs like ChatGPT and Codex show competitive but not superior performance compared to fine-tuned SLMs such as UIE or PAIE, especially as more data becomes available [4]. On fine-grained datasets like FewNERD, SLMs tend to outperform LLMs once the sample size grows beyond extremely limited settings [1]. Additionally, while LLMs may initially benefit from more demonstrations, their performance plateaus sooner than SLMs [5].\n\nIn conclusion, the performance of ChatGPT and Codex on the FewNERD dataset is highly sensitive to the choice of instruction format and demonstration selection strategy, with EPR and increasing demonstration numbers improving results up to a certain point.

One of the most common reasoning steps involves **simple lookup**, which accounts for 20.6% of the tasks, where specific cell values are retrieved from the table [6]. Another frequent step is **comparison**, making up 19.5% of the tasks, where two numbers are compared to assess the claim's validity ![Simple lookup and comparison are frequently used reasoning steps](image6).\n\nFor deeper analysis, **closed-domain knowledge** (12.1%) plays a crucial role by extracting information from context sentences in the table caption or article [6]. This type of reasoning is essential because it bridges the gap between the table data and the claim's context. Additionally, **commonsense knowledge** (5.3%), such as understanding that \"random chance\" means 50% accuracy, is necessary for verifying claims [4].\n\nHowever, the dataset also poses significant challenges. One major challenge is the necessity for multiple reasoning steps; some claims require up to 11 reasoning steps for verification [12]. For instance, the histogram in the dataset shows that while 6% of claims involve just one reasoning step, a substantial portion requires more complex reasoning with 15% involving three steps and increasing percentages for deeper claims ![Many claims require multiple reasoning steps, indicating complexity](image4).\n\nAnother challenge is the diversity and complexity of errors in refuted claims. The dataset exhibits a greater diversity in refuted claims compared to other datasets like Sci-Fact. For example, 41.7% of refuted claims result from incorrect calculation results, and 33.3% contain incorrect approximation words [5]. These errors reflect the complexities in real-world scientific claims and demand nuanced reasoning skills.\n\nMoreover, unverifiable (NEI) claims present unique challenges due to insufficient evidence in the table or lack of background knowledge [8]. Specifically, 33.3% of NEI claims do not have enough matching evidence, and 25% lack open-domain knowledge ![Reasons for NEI claims include insufficient evidence and lack of background knowledge](image8).\n\nIn conclusion, the most common reasoning steps in verifying claims in the SciTAB dataset include simple lookup, comparison, closed-domain knowledge, and commonsense knowledge.

According to the provided data, the distribution of reasoning steps and common error types reveals the complexity involved in verifying claims within this dataset.\n\nFirstly, let's examine the reasoning types and their proportions. The histogram depicted in `![{the majority of claims require deep reasoning with 3 or more steps}](image2)` illustrates that only a small fraction of claims (14%) involve shallow reasoning with just 1–2 steps. In contrast, the majority of claims (86%) require deep reasoning involving 3 or more steps. Specifically, 15% of claims involve 3 steps, 18% involve 4 steps, 20% involve 5 steps, and the percentages gradually decrease for higher numbers of steps.\n\nThese deep reasoning requirements align closely with the complex nature of scientific claims, as evidenced by the example from the S CI T AB dataset where a claim about productivity is verified using commonsense and closed-domain knowledge [1]. This indicates that many claims necessitate not only simple lookups but also more sophisticated reasoning processes such as comparisons, calculations, and the application of domain-specific knowledge.\n\nFurthermore, the table listing common error types in the PoT model provides insights into the challenges faced during fact-checking `![{grounding errors are the most common, followed by ambiguity and calculation errors}](image5)`. Grounding errors, which occur when the program incorrectly associates data with the respective cells in the table, account for 50% of all errors. Ambiguity errors, where claims contain ambiguous expressions, make up 22%, and calculation errors contribute 20%. These error types underscore the difficulties in accurately referencing specific cells and interpreting ambiguous scientific claims.\n\nAdditionally, the breakdown of functions related to data analysis tasks highlights the frequency of operations used in reasoning `![{simple lookup and comparison are the most frequently used functions}](image6)`. Simple lookups and comparisons are the most common, occurring at rates of 20.6% and 19.5%, respectively. This suggests that while these basic operations are frequent, they often form part of more complex multi-step reasoning processes.\n\nIn summary, the main reasoning types in the ScITab dataset are characterized by deep reasoning involving multiple steps, with a significant proportion requiring advanced operations beyond simple lookups. Common error types, particularly grounding and ambiguity errors, reflect the intricate nature of scientific claims and the challenges associated with their verification.

Notably, incorporating logical constraints into the instructions provides stable enhancements, especially with more demonstrations. For instance, using 5 demonstrations with logical constraints achieves a performance of 25.7% on MAVEN-ERE, surpassing the 24.5% achieved with 10 demonstrations without logical constraints. This underscores the importance of providing both \"What\" (demonstrations) and \"How\" (logical constraints) to LLMs.\n\n![{Incorporating logical constraints significantly improves performance with fewer demonstrations}](image1)\n\nMoreover, the left graph in image1 visually confirms this trend by showing higher Micro-F1 scores when logical constraints are applied, particularly evident at lower numbers of demonstration samples. The right graph in the same image illustrates that iterative retrieval decreases logical inconsistency over multiple iterations, although the overall Micro-F1 remains relatively stable. This suggests that while logical consistency improves with iterations, the improvement in performance plateaus after a certain point.\n\nAdditionally, image3 presents a detailed comparison of two models, Vicuna-13B-PT and Llama2-13B-PT, on MAVEN-ERE and Causal-TimeBank under various conditions. For MAVEN-ERE, the best Micro-F1 score (26.4%) is achieved with CoT and logical constraints for Llama2-13B-PT, while the lowest Logical Inconsistency (0%) is obtained with post-processing. Similarly, for Causal-TimeBank, the highest Micro-F1 (13.3%) is achieved with logical constraints for Llama2-13B-PT, again with the lowest LI (0%) from post-processing. These results highlight that logical constraints not only improve performance but also reduce logical inconsistencies.\n\n![{Logical constraints enhance performance and reduce inconsistencies for MAVEN-ERE and Causal-TimeBank tasks}](image3)\n\nIn summary, incorporating logical constraints into the instructions of LLMs, especially with a moderate number of demonstrations, significantly enhances performance on the MAVEN-ERE and Causal-TimeBank datasets while reducing logical inconsistencies."}

However, post-processing methods, although effective in eliminating logical conflicts, can severely affect the quality of the generated output due to potential semantic deviations from the ground truth [1].\n\n![{The table shows a comparison of model performance on MAVEN-ERE and Causal-TimeBank under different conditions, including with all logical constraints, retrieved logical constraints, and post-processing}](image1)\n\nIn the table shown in image1, we observe that for MAVEN-ERE and Causal-TimeBank, using logical constraints consistently leads to lower Logical Inconsistency (LI) percentages compared to post-processing. For instance, with all logical constraints, Turbo achieves an LI of 20.8% on MAVEN-ERE, whereas post-processing results in an LI of 0%, but at the cost of potentially lower Micro-F1 scores [image1].\n\nAdditionally, image7 provides detailed performance metrics for Vicuna-13B-PT and Llama2-13B-PT under various conditions. For MAVEN-ERE, the lowest LI (0%) is achieved through post-processing, but the highest Micro-F1 (26.4%) is obtained with CoT plus logical constraints for Llama2-13B-PT [image7]. Similarly, for Causal-TimeBank, the best Micro-F1 (13.3%) is achieved with logical constraints, while post-processing yields the lowest LI (0%).\n\nThese findings suggest that while post-processing guarantees the absence of logical conflicts, it may compromise the overall quality and relevance of the generated answers. In contrast, integrating logical constraints directly into the LLM instruction not only reduces logical inconsistency but also enhances performance metrics [1].\n\nIn conclusion, logical constraints are more effective than post-processing in reducing logical inconsistency while maintaining or improving the quality of the generated outputs across different LLM models on the MAVEN-ERE and Causal-TimeBank datasets."}

These retrieved categories serve as a preliminary filter, narrowing down possibilities to those most likely relevant based on historical data and semantic closeness [4]. \n\nSubsequently, the multimodal large language models (MLLMs) rank these retrieved results [7]. Unlike traditional approaches that rely solely on initial retrieval order, MLLMs employ advanced linguistic and semantic analysis to assess the contextual appropriateness of each class name with the input image [4]. This ranking process significantly enhances the accuracy and context-awareness of the final predictions.\n\nIn summary, the multimodal retriever system combines efficient pre-processing, robust embedding storage, and sophisticated ranking by MLLMs to accurately recognize and categorize objects in detection datasets."}

The effects are measured using various metrics such as F1 score, precision, recall, and accuracy across different tasks including sentiment analysis and named entity recognition.\n\nFirstly, consider the performance of BERT models with different training objectives on the QQP dataset. According to Table 9, which shows the experimental results for sentiment classification tasks [4], BERT with cross-entropy (CE) achieves an accuracy of 91.3% on the QQP dataset [6]. When using dice loss (DL) or dynamic soft Dice loss (DSC), the performance varies. For instance, BERT+DL achieves a slightly lower accuracy compared to BERT+CE, while BERT+DSC provides a marginal improvement over BERT+CE [2].\n\nThe impact of data augmentation techniques can be seen more clearly in image-based data. ![BERT variants show improvements with FL, DL, DSC enhancements, providing small incremental gains in EM and F1](image5). Specifically, BERT+DSC achieves the highest scores among BERT variants on the QQP dataset. This indicates that the dynamic soft Dice loss is effective in handling imbalanced datasets like QQP, where the positive-negative ratio is skewed [12].\n\nFor sentiment analysis tasks, particularly on SST-2 and SST-5 datasets, BERT+CE outperforms both BERT+DL and BERT+DSC in terms of accuracy [6]. However, this does not necessarily mean that CE is always superior. The choice of loss function should align with the specific characteristics of the dataset. For example, on more balanced datasets, CE might perform better due to its straightforward nature, whereas on imbalanced datasets, DSC can mitigate the bias towards the majority class [8].\n\nIn the context of named entity recognition (NER) tasks, the influence of data augmentation techniques is also significant. Image evidence from Chinese MSRA and Chinese OntoNotes 4.0 datasets reveals that BERT-MRC+DSC consistently outperforms other models in terms of F1-score [1]. This suggests that DSC effectively addresses the issue of easy-negative examples overwhelming the training process, thereby improving the model's ability to distinguish between hard-negative and positive examples [7].\n\nMoreover, the table comparing models on the English OntoNotes 5.0 dataset further supports this observation. BERT-MRC+DSC achieves the highest F1-score, indicating its superiority in handling NER tasks [7]. Similarly, on the English CoNLL 2003 dataset, BERT-MRC+DSC shows a notable improvement in F1-score over other variants [8].\n\nIn conclusion, different data augmentation techniques impact the performance of BERT models differently depending on the dataset's characteristics. Dynamic soft Dice loss (DSC) generally performs best on imbalanced datasets by mitigating the dominating effect of easy-negative examples, leading to improved F1 scores in both sentiment analysis and named entity recognition tasks. Therefore, for the QQP dataset, DSC is the most effective augmentation technique among those evaluated."}

The data provided in both text and images offer insights into these differences.\n\nFirstly, let's look at the impact of different training objectives on BERT's performance. According to Table 8 [4], when using the Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) objective, adding positive examples (`+positive`) improves performance over the original dataset, while adding negative examples (`+negative`) leads to inferior results. Removing negative examples (`-negative`) also decreases performance due to a reduction in the number of training samples. This indicates that balancing the dataset positively impacts model performance.\n\nNext, consider the effects of different loss functions. The DSC (Dice-based Softmax Cross-entropy) loss function shows significant improvements over traditional methods like Focal Loss (FL) and Dice Loss (DL). For instance, in the MRPC and QQP datasets, the table in image1 shows that BERT and XLNet with DSC achieve the highest F1 scores compared to their FL and DL counterparts. Specifically, for MRPC, BERT+DSC achieves an F1 score of 90.7 (+2.7 over baseline), and for QQP, it reaches 93.5 (+2.2 over baseline) ![{BERT and XLNet with DSC show the most significant improvements}](image1).\n\nMoreover, on the English CoNLL 2003 dataset, BERT-MRC with DSC enhancements yields the best F1 score of 93.33, improving by +0.29 over the base BERT-MRC model ![{BERT-MRC+DSC shows the highest F1-score improvement}](image3).\n\nIn the context of question answering tasks, as shown in image4, BERT and XLNet models with DSC enhancements consistently outperform their base versions on SQuAD v1.1, SQuAD v2.0, and QuoRef datasets. For example, BERT+DSC achieves higher EM and F1 scores than BERT alone, and similarly, XLNet+DSC surpasses XLNet on all metrics ![{XLNet+DSC achieves the highest scores overall}](image4).\n\nHowever, it is important to note that the dice loss is not suitable for accuracy-oriented tasks such as sentiment classification. As mentioned in [10], BERT fine-tuned with cross-entropy (CE) achieves higher accuracy on SST-2 and SST-5 datasets compared to BERT with DL or DSC ![{BERT+CE achieves the highest accuracy for both datasets}](image8).\n\nIn summary, the BERT model configurations with DSC generally show superior performance across multiple NLP tasks, especially in terms of F1 scores, but may not be ideal for accuracy-focused tasks."}

The model's decomposition into goal prediction and action generation can lead to cascading errors if the predicted goal is incorrect, impacting the subsequent action generation [4]. Additionally, the model struggles with instructions that include constraints on the execution trajectory, which are common in both datasets but more pronounced in C HAI [4].\n\nFurthermore, the evaluation metrics used might not fully capture the nuances of task completion, especially for complex tasks like those in C HAI. Automated metrics may fail to account for intermediate trajectory constraints, leading to less accurate assessments of performance [8]. ![The histogram shows that while humans generally score higher, there is a significant overlap in ratings between \"Human\" and \"Our Approach\", indicating some level of parity in performance](image4).\n\nIn conclusion, 'Our Approach' performs well on L ANI and shows improvements over baselines on C HAI, particularly in navigation-related tasks, but faces challenges with manipulation and execution constraints."}

It is evident that certain categories like spatial relations and temporal coordination are more common in both datasets, suggesting their significance in navigation instructions.\n\nFurther insight into the impact of these categories on performance can be derived from Table 8, which presents statistics comparing the \"Present\" and \"Absent\" groups for different linguistic or semantic features [8]. For instance, \"Temporal coordination\" and \"Co-reference\" show statistically significant differences between the \"Present\" and \"Absent\" groups, indicating that these categories have a meaningful effect on the execution of instructions. This implies that the presence of these categories likely increases the complexity of goal prediction, potentially leading to higher errors if not properly handled by the model.\n\nComparing our approach to human performance, image2 provides a histogram illustrating the distribution of Likert scale ratings for both humans and \"Our Approach\" concerning L ANI [image2]. The histogram shows that at rating 5, \"Our Approach\" has a higher percentage than \"Human,\" indicating that the model performs well in some cases. However, it also reveals that \"Human\" ratings are generally higher across all ratings except for rating 5. This suggests that while our model can achieve high ratings, it does not consistently match human-level performance.\n\nAdditionally, Table 6 reports mean goal prediction errors for L ANI instructions with and without analysis categories [2]. The $p$-values from two-sided $t$-tests comparing the means in each row indicate that the presence of certain linguistic categories significantly affects the prediction error. Our approach aims to address this challenge by decomposing goal prediction and action generation, which improves instruction execution performance as shown in experiments on the L ANI navigation task [10].\n\nIn conclusion, the presence of specific linguistic categories significantly impacts goal prediction error, making it more challenging for models to perform as accurately as humans. While our approach demonstrates competitive performance, especially in scenarios where it achieves high ratings, it still falls short of consistent human-level accuracy."}

When examining the effect of aligning word embeddings, it is important to consider both the similarity between the languages involved and the size of the training datasets.\n\nIn some cases, aligning word embeddings can lead to improvements in BLEU scores. For instance, when translating from Galician (GL) and Portuguese (PT) into English (EN), the alignment method resulted in notable gains [2]. The table in image2 shows that for GL + PT evaluated on GL, the alignment score (align) was 22.4, which is higher than both the baseline (bi: 2.2) and standard (std: 17.5) scores. This suggests that for closely related languages like Galician and Portuguese, aligning embeddings can be particularly beneficial.\n\nHowever, this trend does not hold universally. Image3 provides data showing that for several language pairs translating into English, the aligned condition did not consistently outperform the unaligned one. For example, for Galician to English (GL → EN), the BLEU score decreased slightly from 12.8 (unaligned) to 11.5 (aligned). Similarly, for Portuguese to English (PT → EN), the change was minimal, dropping from 30.8 to 30.6. These results indicate that while alignment can sometimes improve performance, it may not always provide a significant advantage, especially for more robust translation systems [7].\n\nMoreover, the effectiveness of alignment appears to depend on the specific languages being translated. As noted in text quote [8], a priori alignment of embeddings may not be necessary in bilingual scenarios but can be helpful in multilingual training scenarios. This is supported by the data in image5, where the improvement in BLEU scores from pre-training is more pronounced for less similar language pairs like Hebrew to Portuguese (HE → PT) with an increase of +8.9, compared to more similar pairs like Spanish to Portuguese (ES → PT) with +7.0 [5].\n\nAdditionally, the size of the training dataset plays a role in determining the impact of alignment. Image6's graphs illustrate that pre-training generally offers greater benefits when the training set is smaller, indicating that with limited data, alignment might help bridge gaps in learning effective translations [1].\n\nIn conclusion, the alignment of word embeddings impacts BLEU scores differently depending on the languages involved and the amount of training data available. While alignment can enhance performance for certain language pairs and under low-resource conditions, it is not universally advantageous and its benefits vary significantly across different scenarios ![the alignment impact varies across different language pairs](image3)."}

According to Table 3 [1], BLEU scores for more linguistically similar languages such as ES, FR, and IT (all part of the Romance family) show moderate improvements with pre-training. However, when translating from very different languages like RU and HE, there are larger accuracy gains [1]. This aligns with the hypothesis that systems with larger headroom to improve tend to see greater increases due to their initially lower baseline BLEU scores. ![{The table shows improvements in BLEU scores for various language pairs translating into Portuguese, with higher gains for less similar languages}](image1)\n\nFurthermore, the size of the training dataset also plays a crucial role in how effective pre-training is. The line graphs comparing standard training with pre-trained models illustrate this point [2]. For smaller training sets, pre-training leads to significant improvements in BLEU scores, particularly noticeable in translations from Pt, Tr, and Ru to En [2]. As the training set size increases, the benefit of pre-training diminishes, suggesting that pre-training is most beneficial when there is limited data but enough to establish a moderately effective system [4].\n\nAdditionally, the qualitative analysis of translations from GL to EN provides insights into the practical benefits of pre-training [6]. Pre-trained embeddings not only help capture rarer vocabulary but also generate more grammatically well-formed sentences, especially useful for low-resource languages. ![{Graphs show BLEU score improvements from pre-training, especially notable at smaller training set sizes}](image2)\n\nMoreover, Figure 2 demonstrates that pre-training improves the accuracy of translation for the entire vocabulary, with particularly strong gains for low-frequency words [7]. ![{Bar chart shows that pre-trained embeddings outperform standard embeddings in F-measure scores for low-frequency words}](image4)\n\nIn multilingual scenarios, alignment of embedding spaces between source and target languages further enhances the effectiveness of pre-training [11]. For instance, in Table 5, the gain in BLEU scores is roughly proportional to the similarity of the translation pair, with GL/PT showing the largest gains and BE/RU showing minimal improvement [11]. ![{Table compares evaluation metrics for different training setups, showing the highest scores with aligned embeddings}](image8)\n\nIn conclusion, pre-training significantly affects translation accuracy, with greater improvements observed for less similar languages and smaller training datasets.

According to the data presented in Table 5 [4], aligning word embeddings generally helps increase BLEU scores for all three tasks, which suggests that pre-training and alignment ensure that word embeddings of source languages are placed into similar vector spaces. This allows the model to learn more effectively, as it would if training on a single language.\n\nHowever, this effect varies depending on the language pair. For instance, ![{alignment effects vary by language pair}](image4) shows that while some language pairs like GL→EN experience a slight decrease in performance after alignment (from 12.8 to 11.5), others like RU→EN see an improvement (from 21.1 to 21.4). The differences in these outcomes could be attributed to the inherent similarities or differences between the languages involved. When languages are more closely related, alignment may yield better results due to shared linguistic features.\n\nRegarding the F-measure scores for target words based on their frequency in the training corpus, Figure 2 ![{pre-trained models improve F-measure especially for low-frequency words}](image6) provides insight. It illustrates that pre-training manages to improve the accuracy of translation for the entire vocabulary but particularly benefits low-frequency words.

Specifically, the accuracy drops by 6.1% in the unmasked setting and 8.4% in the masked setting [12]. This highlights the importance of the R-GCN for multi-hop reasoning and leveraging structural information within the graph.\n\nNext, let's consider the removal of relation types altogether. According to Table 3, removing all relation types (No relation types) results in accuracies of 62.7% (unmasked) and 63.9% (masked), which are slightly lower than the baseline with R-GCN but still better than without it [4]. This suggests that while relation types provide some benefit, they are not as critical as the R-GCN itself.\n\nWhen examining the ablation of individual relation types, we find:\n\n- Removing DOC-BASED connections leads to accuracies of 62.9% (unmasked) and 65.8% (masked). Since these connections represent mentions co-occurring in the same document, their removal significantly impacts performance because it removes important contextual information [7].\n  \n- Eliminating MATCH connections yields accuracies of 64.3% (unmasked) and 67.4% (masked). MATCH connections capture exact matches between mentions, which are crucial for easier coreference cases [7].\n\n- Removing COREF connections results in an accuracy of 64.8% (unmasked) but no data is provided for the masked condition. COREF connections, while useful, do not seem as vital as DOC-BASED or MATCH connections due to the heuristic capturing easy cases and potential unreliability of the coreference system [7].\n\nThese observations are further supported by the performance metrics shown in ![{the ensemble model outperforms single models and other configurations consistently across different settings}](image4).\n\nIn summary, the removal of the R-GCN component has the most significant negative impact on model performance under both unmasked and masked conditions.

The masked version uses unique identifiers for entities consistently across documents, which simplifies coreference linking [5].

In contrast, the 'GloVe with R-GCN' model scores 59.2% for the unmasked condition and a drastically lower 11.1% for the masked condition.\n\nThese discrepancies highlight the importance of using deep contextualized embeddings like ELMo over static word embeddings such as GloVe. The 'full (ensemble)' model benefits from the rich context provided by ELMo, which allows it to capture more nuanced relationships between entities and mentions [9]. This is further supported by the observation that removing ELMo leads to a substantial drop in performance, especially in the masked setting where all mentions become 'unknown' tokens with GloVe [10].\n\nMoreover, the impact of the R-GCN component is evident when comparing 'GloVe with R-GCN' to 'GloVe w/o R-GCN'. While 'GloVe with R-GCN' still manages to outperform models without R-GCN, the performance gap underscores the critical role of the R-GCN in updating mention representations based on their relational structure [12].\n\nIn terms of relation-based accuracy and precision, the 'full (ensemble)' model not only excels in overall accuracy but also shows superior performance in precision at 2 (P@2) and precision at 5 (P@5).

For entity extraction, DyGIE achieves an F1 score of 68.2, which slightly decreases to 68.0 when CorefProp is removed, indicating that CorefProp has a minor positive effect on entity extraction [4]. However, for relation extraction, removing CorefProp increases the F1 score from 42.0 to 41.2, suggesting that CorefProp may not always enhance relation extraction [4].\n\n![{Performance comparison shows that DyGIE generally outperforms DyGIE-RelProp, especially as the number of entities in sentences increases.}](image6)\n\nMoreover, the addition of relation propagation significantly benefits both entity and relation extraction, particularly in scenarios with multiple relation instances across different entities [8].

Adjustments that provide clearer context, such as using gender-specific adjectives, can reduce bias and enhance the accuracy of gender identification in translations. Stereotype-based adjustments impact gender bias accuracy by improving it in some cases but also reveal the need for more sophisticated methods to handle gender nuances in machine translation systems."}

Specifically, when models trained and validated on the original data were tested on the adversarial set, they performed worse than random due to overfitting to the cues in the original training set [6]. In contrast, when models were trained from scratch on the adversarial training and validation sets, BERT's peak performance reduced to $53\\%$, with mean and median accuracies at $50\\%$ [6]. This indicates that the adversarial setup has successfully removed the exploitable cues, leading to a more robust evaluation of machine argument comprehension.\n\nTo illustrate this further, consider the performance metrics shown in the table ![{BERT's performance metrics drop significantly on adversarial setups}](image1). The table demonstrates that while BERT originally had a mean score of $0.671 \\pm 0.09$ and a maximum score of $0.770$, its performance on adversarial configurations (like BERT (C, W)) drops to a mean of $0.532 \\pm 0.09$ and a maximum of $0.732$.

This suggests that FastQA, with fewer latent interactions than BiDAF, has more difficulty integrating cross-document information.\n\nFurthermore, Table 6, which compares test accuracy when only using documents leading to the correct answer (gold chain), reveals that BiDAF achieves much higher scores compared to FastQA. For instance, in the gold chain setup on W IKI H OP, BiDAF reaches up to 81.2%/85.7% in the masked setting, while FastQA achieves 44.5%/53.5% [12]. Similarly, on M ED H OP, BiDAF scores 86.4%/89.8% and 99.3%/100.0% in unmasked and masked settings respectively, whereas FastQA scores 54.6%/59.2% and 51.8%/55.1% [image1].\n\nIn summary, ![BiDAF generally outperforms FastQA, especially in scenarios requiring multi-step inference and integration of information across multiple documents](image1)."}

This change can be attributed to several factors, as shown in the detailed breakdown of the intangible assets.\n\nFor developed technology, the net carrying amount dropped from $220 million in 2019 to $194 million in 2020. This reduction is primarily due to a higher accumulated amortization in 2020 ($111 million) compared to 2019 ($72 million).

One major factor is the strong performance in QCT revenues, which saw a 64% increase primarily due to heightened demand for 5G products across various segments including handsets and RFFE, reflecting recovery from the negative impacts of COVID-19 [10].\n\nAdditionally, the comprehensive income for 2021 was $8,964 million, also showing an increase from $5,305 million in 2020 and $4,272 million in 2019 ![Comprehensive income increased steadily over the three years](image7). The comprehensive income incorporates not only the net income but also other comprehensive (loss) income items such as foreign currency translation gains, unrealized gains or losses on securities, and derivative instruments. For instance, while there were some losses in these areas in 2021, they were less impactful compared to the overall positive net income.\n\nFurthermore, the acquisition of NUVIA in March 2021 for $1.1 billion contributed to both operational and strategic advancements, enhancing Qualcomm's capabilities in high-performance processors and SoC design [7]. This strategic move likely bolstered Qualcomm's competitive edge and revenue streams, contributing to the improved financial performance.\n\nIn summary, the net income and comprehensive income for fiscal year 2021 showed considerable improvements over the previous years, driven by increased demand for 5G products, recovery from pandemic effects, and strategic acquisitions like NUVIA."}

The total liabilities increased from $422,393 million in 2020 to $443,854 million in 2021 [image1]. This increase can be attributed to various factors within the company's operations.\n\nIn the \"Insurance and Other\" segment, unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses rose from $79,854 million in 2020 to $86,664 million in 2021 [image1]. Additionally, the notes payable and other borrowings under this segment decreased slightly from $41,522 million in 2020 to $39,272 million in 2021 [image1]. These shifts indicate a rise in claims and a reduction in borrowing activities, possibly due to better financial management or lower funding needs.\n\nFor the \"Railroad, Utilities and Energy\" segment, there was a marginal decrease in total liabilities from $98,072 million in 2020 to $97,900 million in 2021 [image1]. The accounts payable, accruals, and other liabilities also saw a slight drop from $15,224 million in 2020 to $15,696 million in 2021 [image1]. This minor fluctuation suggests stable operational conditions within this sector.\n\nRegarding shareholders' equity, it significantly increased from $384,597 million in 2020 to $469,138 million in 2021 [image1]. This substantial growth is primarily due to an increase in retained earnings and capital surplus. Specifically, the consolidated shareholders’ equity grew by $63.0 billion, reaching $506.2 billion at the end of 2021 [1].\n\nKey factors contributing to these changes include:\n- **Earnings and Investment Gains**: Berkshire reported net earnings attributable to shareholders of $89.8 billion in 2021, which included after-tax gains on investments of approximately $61.6 billion [1]. These significant investment gains contributed to the increase in shareholders' equity.\n- **Reduction in Claim Liabilities**: The estimated ultimate liabilities for prior years' retroactive reinsurance contracts were reduced by $974 million in 2021, resulting in pre-tax earnings of $142 million [12]. This reduction positively impacted shareholders' equity.\n- **Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Changes**: Berkshire repaid Euro and U.S. Dollar denominated debt aggregating approximately $2.2 billion of maturing senior notes and issued new debt with a weighted average interest rate of 0.5% [5]. These actions influenced the foreign currency translation adjustments, impacting both liabilities and equity [image2].\n\nIn summary, the increase in liabilities was driven by higher claims and operational costs, while the significant rise in shareholders' equity was fueled by robust earnings, substantial investment gains, and prudent financial management practices."}

According to the financial highlights [5], Chevron Corporation reported a significant improvement in its earnings. The U.S. upstream segment saw an increase in earnings from a loss of $1.6 billion in 2020 to earnings of $7.3 billion in 2021 [4]. Similarly, the international upstream segment turned around from a loss of $825 million in 2020 to earnings of $8.5 billion in 2021 [7]. On the downstream side, U.S. downstream improved from a loss of $571 million in 2020 to earnings of $2.4 billion in 2021 [12], while international downstream decreased slightly from $618 million in 2020 to $525 million in 2021 [2].\n\nCombining these figures, it is evident that Chevron's overall net income significantly increased in 2021 compared to 2020. This substantial improvement can be attributed to higher realizations in both upstream segments and better margins in the U.S. downstream operations.\n\nNext, let's examine the return on stockholders' equity (ROE). ROE is calculated by dividing net income by stockholders' equity. While specific ROE values are not directly provided in the text quotes, we can infer changes based on net income trends and the balance sheet items [3]. Given the substantial rise in net income and stable stockholders' equity, it is reasonable to conclude that ROE also improved in 2021.\n\nAdditionally, the indexed dividend growth graph shows a steady increase in dividends over the years ![Chevron's compound annual growth rate of dividends was 6.7% from 2006 to 2021](image5). This supports the notion of improved financial performance and shareholder returns.\n\nIn summary, Chevron Corporation's net income significantly increased from 2020 to 2021 due to improved earnings across most business segments, and consequently, its return on stockholders' equity also improved during this period."}

However, this figure includes various adjustments that affect comparability. When considering the core non-GAAP measure, which adjusts for items affecting comparability, the organic percentage change is significantly lower at 8% [image4].\n\nThe main factors influencing these changes can be identified from the detailed breakdown of adjustments:\n\n1. **Impact of Foreign Exchange Translation**: The foreign exchange translation had a negligible impact on the APAC segment, with no specific percentage change mentioned [image4].\n   \n2. **Impact of Acquisitions and Divestitures**: There was a significant negative impact due to acquisitions and divestitures, reducing the growth by 10 percentage points [image4].\n\n3. **Impact of Organic Volume**: The organic volume contributed positively to the growth, but the exact impact is not specified directly in the table [image4].\n\n4. **Impact of Effective Net Pricing**: The effective net pricing also had a positive effect, contributing to the overall growth [image4].\n\nAdditionally, looking at the broader context of adjustments affecting comparability, we see that restructuring and impairment charges, as well as inventory fair value adjustments and merger and integration charges, were significant factors across segments. For APAC specifically, these adjustments likely played a role in the difference between the reported GAAP measure and the core non-GAAP measure [image7].\n\nIn summary, while the APAC segment reported an 18% increase in GAAP measures, the core non-GAAP measure showed a more modest 8% growth due to the negative impact of acquisitions and divestitures, along with other adjustments affecting comparability ![the core non-GAAP measure shows a more modest growth after adjusting for items affecting comparability](image4)."}

The decrease in comprehensive income from 2019 to 2020 can be attributed to several factors.\n\nFirstly, the net income for 2020 was $4,730.5 million, a substantial drop from $6,025.4 million in 2019 and slightly higher than $5,924.3 million in 2018 ![Comprehensive income details over three years](image7). This decline in net income is indicative of the overall financial performance challenges faced by McDonald's in 2020, likely exacerbated by the global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nSecondly, other comprehensive income (loss) also played a crucial role in this difference. In 2020, McDonald's reported an other comprehensive loss of $(104.1) million, contrasting with gains of $126.8 million in 2019 and a significant loss of $(431.1) million in 2018. Specifically, foreign currency translation adjustments contributed positively in 2020 with a gain of $63.1 million, compared to $174.3 million in 2019 and a major loss of $(453.6) million in 2018. However, cash flow hedges resulted in a notable loss of $(123.3) million in 2020, while there were smaller losses or gains in previous years ![Details on components of other comprehensive income](image7).\n\nAdditionally, changes in operating costs and expenses, including those related to company-operated restaurant expenses and franchised restaurants' occupancy expenses, impacted the overall profitability ![Operating costs and expenses over three years](image3).\n\nIn conclusion, McDonald's comprehensive income decreased in 2020 primarily due to lower net income and a shift from other comprehensive income to a loss, influenced by various financial adjustments and global economic conditions."}

This decline can be attributed to a few key factors:\n- **Interest Income Decline**: Interest income fell from $9,414 million in 2019 to $7,391 million in 2021, representing a decrease of 21.5% [7].\n- **Lower Cost of Funds**: Despite the drop in interest income, there was a significant reduction in interest expense from $1,731 million in 2019 to $717 million in 2021, a decrease of 58.6%. This lower cost of funds helped mitigate some of the impact on net interest income [7].\n\n![Net interest income and interest expenses have generally decreased over the years](image6)\n\n### Card Member Receivables\nCard member receivables showed an increase from 2020 to 2021 but remained below the 2019 levels. Specifically:\n- **Total Receivables**: The total card member receivables grew from $18.7 billion in 2020 to $22.4 billion in 2021, marking a 20% increase. However, this figure is still slightly lower than the $22.8 billion reported in 2019 [5].\n- **U.S. Receivables**: In the U.S., receivables increased from $11.9 billion in 2020 to $14.7 billion in 2021, a rise of 24%. Outside the U.S., they rose from $6.8 billion in 2020 to $7.7 billion in 2021, an increase of 13% [5].\n\n![{Card member receivables saw a recovery in 2021 compared to 2020 but were still slightly below 2019 levels}](image5)\n\n### Contributing Factors\nSeveral factors contributed to these changes:\n- **Economic Recovery**: Post-pandemic economic recovery led to improved portfolio quality and macroeconomic outlook, driving higher billed business and card usage [7].\n- **Provisions for Credit Losses**: There was a significant shift in provisions for credit losses, moving from a provision of $3,150 million in 2020 to a benefit of $945 million in 2021 due to reserve releases and lower net write-offs [7].\n- **Marketing and Business Development**: Increased marketing investments aimed at building growth momentum also played a role in boosting card usage and receivables [4].\n\nIn summary, while net interest income declined primarily due to lower interest income and despite reduced interest expenses, card member receivables rebounded significantly from 2020 to 2021 but did not fully recover to 2019 levels."}

However, focusing on the change from 2019 to 2020, we can see that retained earnings grew from RMB 7,007 million to RMB 11,111 million in 2020 [image6]. This substantial increase can be attributed primarily to the profit for the year, which was RMB 3,977 million in 2019 and RMB 4,176 million in 2020 [8].\n\nRegarding the 'Total Comprehensive Income for the Year', it rose dramatically from RMB 5,268 million in 2019 to RMB 8,100 million in 2020 [image8]. This increase is due to several factors. Firstly, the profit for the year contributed positively, increasing from RMB 3,977 million in 2019 to RMB 4,176 million in 2020. Additionally, other comprehensive income, particularly the fair value changes on financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income, saw a significant rise from RMB 1,031 million in 2019 to RMB 5,219 million in 2020 [image8]. \n\nHowever, it's important to note that currency translation differences had a negative impact in 2020, reducing the total comprehensive income by RMB 1,363 million [image8]. Despite this, the overall comprehensive income still showed a robust growth due to the strong performance in profit and fair value gains.\n\nIn summary, the increase in both 'Retained Earnings' and 'Total Comprehensive Income for the Year' from 2019 to 2020 was mainly driven by higher profits and significant gains in fair value changes on financial assets, despite some adverse effects from currency translation differences. ![The table outlines various components of equity attributable to the equity holders of the company](image6)"}

According to the financial data [3], the total provision for income taxes increased from $3,562 million in 2018 to $4,973 million in 2020. This increase is primarily driven by a significant rise in the current provision for income taxes, which grew from $3,520 million in 2018 to $4,981 million in 2020 ![{Total current provision increased significantly over the years}](image3).\n\nThe deferred income tax provision, on the other hand, showed variability. In 2018, it was $42 million; it increased to $230 million in 2019 but then dropped to $(8) million in 2020. The decrease in the deferred tax provision in 2020 indicates that the company had more deferred tax assets than liabilities during this period, leading to a net benefit rather than a provision [9].\n\nDeferred income tax assets and liabilities play a crucial role in shaping these trends. For instance, the deferred income tax assets increased from $2,868 million in 2019 to $3,391 million in 2020, mainly due to higher accrued expenses and allowances, lease liability, and non-U.S. tax loss carryforwards ![{Deferred tax assets rose notably, especially in lease liability and non-U.S. tax losses}](image8). Conversely, deferred income tax liabilities also increased from $(5,861) million in 2019 to $(6,758) million in 2020, primarily attributed to U.S. federal and state intangible assets, capitalized software, and lease right-of-use assets.\n\nThe net deferred income tax liabilities thus increased from $(2,993) million in 2019 to $(3,367) million in 2020. Despite this increase in liabilities, the overall impact on the total provision for income taxes was lessened by the substantial growth in deferred tax assets, contributing to the net deferred tax benefit in 2020.\n\nIn summary, the trends in the company's provisions for income taxes from 2018 to 2020 show an increasing total provision primarily driven by higher current tax provisions, while the deferred tax provisions fluctuated, influenced by changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities."}

This represents an increase in total liabilities by $4,575 million from 2019 to 2020.\n\nThe rise in liabilities is closely related to the changes in total debt during this period. As indicated in the financial instruments table, the total debt was approximately $21.2 billion as of December 31, 2020, compared to $21.7 billion in 2019 [4]. However, it's important to note that the classification between current and long-term debt can shift based on the company's intent and ability to refinance. For instance, $611 million of borrowings under the euro-denominated commercial paper program and $290 million of borrowings under the 2021 Yen Notes were classified as long-term debt because Danaher had the intent and ability to refinance these borrowings for at least one year using the Five-Year Facility [4].\n\nMoreover, the availability under the Five-Year Facility also played a crucial role in managing debt levels. The facility allowed Danaher to incur approximately $4.4 billion of additional indebtedness as of December 31, 2020, supporting its liquidity and refinancing needs [4].\n\nIn conclusion, the total current and noncurrent liabilities increased significantly from 2019 to 2020, reflecting higher debt levels and refinancing activities supported by the Five-Year Facility."}

Compensation and benefits expenses rose by 11% from the prior year to $20,854 million in 2020 [1]. A significant portion of this increase can be attributed to discretionary incentive compensation, formulaic payouts to Wealth Management representatives driven by higher revenues, and expenses related to deferred compensation plans linked to investment performance [1].\n\nFurthermore, the compensation expense recognized in 2020 was $2,119 million, up from $1,878 million in 2019 ![{Total recognized in compensation expense increased from $1,878 million in 2019 to $2,119 million in 2020}](image1).

For instance, FLNA (Frito-Lay North America) and PBNA (PepsiCo Beverages North America) showed varying degrees of profitability [image2]. FLNA maintained a consistent performance with slight increases in net revenue and operating profit, while PBNA faced challenges, particularly due to higher operating costs and charges related to the COVID-19 pandemic [9].\n\nThe distribution between beverage and food/snack categories provides further insight into these financial shifts [image6]. Globally, PepsiCo has maintained a balanced approach with 45% of its business in beverages and 55% in food/snacks since 2018. However, regional variations are evident. For example, LatAm consistently focused on food/snacks (90%), which aligns with its stable net revenue but lower operating profit margins [image2]. In contrast, Europe had a more balanced split, shifting slightly towards beverages (55%) in 2020, which might correlate with its fluctuating operating profit [image6].\n\nAdditionally, AMESA and APAC regions adjusted their focus over the years. AMESA reduced its beverage percentage from 45% in 2018 to 30% in 2020, possibly reflecting strategic realignments or market demands. APAC remained steady at 25% beverages and 75% food/snacks, suggesting a well-established market preference [image6].\n\nThese changes in product category distribution likely influenced the financial outcomes. Regions with a higher proportion of food/snacks, like LatAm and APAC, may have benefited from the resilience of snack products during economic downturns, contributing to stable net revenue despite operational challenges [image2]. Conversely, regions with a greater emphasis on beverages, such as Europe, faced more volatility in operating profit, possibly due to competitive pressures and consumer behavior shifts [image6].\n\nIn summary, the changes in net revenue and operating profit across divisions from 2018 to 2020 are closely linked to the distribution of beverage and food/snack categories, highlighting the importance of regional market strategies in shaping financial performance. The overall financial health of PepsiCo reflects a strategic balance between these two major product categories ![Net Revenue Growth Across Years](image1)."}

According to the financial data, cash outflows from investing activities increased dramatically from €-1,912 million in 2020 to €-14,140 million in 2021 [3]. This substantial increase was primarily due to the acquisition of Varian, which required a payout of €12,087 million [5].\n\nOn the financing side, cash inflows changed from €-249 million in 2020 to €11,839 million in 2021 [5]. The significant positive shift in cash flows from financing activities can be attributed to several factors. Firstly, the company received inflows from borrowings amounting to $10 billion, provided by the Siemens Group to finance the acquisition of Varian [9]. Additionally, there was an additional financing of €850 million from the Siemens Group, partly offset by repayments of matured loans totaling €730 million and €300 million in other outflows [9].\n\nThe overall trend indicates that the acquisition of Varian was the key driver behind these changes, significantly impacting both investing and financing activities. Cash flows from operating activities remained robust, increasing from €1,928 million in 2020 to €2,933 million in 2021 [4], supporting the company's ability to manage these large-scale financial maneuvers.\n\nIn summary, the key factor driving the changes in cash flows from financing and investing activities was the acquisition of Varian, leading to substantial increases in cash outflows for investing activities and inflows for financing activities ![The table shows the equity details of Siemens Healthineers AG as of September 30 for the years 2021 and 2020, highlighting significant changes in financing activities](image5). \n\nTo directly answer your question: Siemens Healthineers' cash flows from financing activities increased significantly due to financing the Varian acquisition, while cash outflows from investing activities surged mainly because of the Varian acquisition costs."}

In 2018, the company reported a comprehensive loss of $(1,018) million [3]. By 2019, this improved slightly to a comprehensive loss of $(890) million, and in 2020, it turned into a comprehensive income of $1,120 million ![Comprehensive income evolution over three years](image3).\n\nSeveral factors contributed to this dramatic change:\n\n1. **Net Income Improvement**: The net income (loss) significantly improved from a loss of $(775) million in 2019 to a profit of $862 million in 2020 [3]. This substantial turnaround was driven by increased revenues and operational efficiencies. For instance, automotive sales without resale value guarantee grew from $19,212 million in 2019 to $24,053 million in 2020 ![Revenue growth across different segments](image1).\n\n2. **Foreign Currency Translation Adjustment**: Another contributing factor was the foreign currency translation adjustment, which swung from a loss of $(42) million in 2018 and $(28) million in 2019 to a gain of $399 million in 2020 ![Significant positive impact from foreign currency adjustments](image3). This suggests that favorable exchange rate movements positively impacted the company's financial statements.\n\n3. **Stock-Based Compensation Expense**: While stock-based compensation expense increased due to higher market capitalization and updates to business outlook, leading to an additional $\\S542$ million for the CEO Performance Award in 2020, it did not offset the overall profitability improvements [1].\n\n4. **Reduction in Operating Expenses**: There was also a reduction in operating expenses, including customer promotional costs, facilities-related expenses, and sales and marketing activities, which collectively decreased by $\\S90$ million [1]. Additionally, there was a one-time reduction in operating expenses for the settlement of securities litigation relating to the SolarCity acquisition by $\\S43$ million [1].\n\nIn summary, the comprehensive income attributable to common stockholders evolved from a significant loss in 2018 to a notable profit in 2020, primarily due to increased revenues, favorable foreign currency adjustments, and cost reductions."}

According to the data [8], gross assets under capital leases were $26.4 billion as of December 31, 2017. The corresponding long-term liability is detailed in ![{the structure of capital lease obligations including gross obligations, imputed interest, and current portion}](image8). The table shows that the gross capital lease obligations are $14,811 million. From this amount, imputed interest of $534 million is subtracted, resulting in a present value of net minimum lease payments of $14,277 million. Further, the current portion of capital lease obligations, which is $5,839 million, is deducted to arrive at the total long-term capital lease obligations of $8,438 million.\n\nNext, for finance lease obligations, similar calculations apply. Image ![{the structure of finance lease obligations including gross obligations, imputed interest, and current portion}](image6) provides the necessary details. It indicates that the gross finance lease obligations are $6,265 million. Imputed interest of $1,238 million is subtracted, leading to a present value of net minimum lease payments of $5,027 million. Deducting the current portion of finance lease obligations, which is $282 million, results in total long-term finance lease obligations of $4,745 million.\n\nCombining both types of lease obligations, we get the total long-term capital and finance lease obligations for December 31, 2017, as follows: the sum of long-term capital lease obligations ($8,438 million) and long-term finance lease obligations ($4,745 million), totaling $13,183 million.\n\nThus, the total long-term capital and finance lease obligations for December 31, 2017, are $13,183 million."}

Specifically, the Tata group companies collectively held 72% of the total shares [image1]. This includes:\n- **Tata Sons Private Limited**: Holding 2,702,450,947 shares (72.0%).\n- Other Tata entities such as Tata Industries Limited, Tata Investment Corporation Limited, Tata Steel Limited, and The Tata Power Company Limited also contributed to this percentage but held much smaller numbers of shares.\n\nBy the end of the fiscal year on March 31, 2020, the shareholding pattern among the promoters remained unchanged in terms of both the number of shares and the percentage held [image6].

In 2020, the upstream segment reported a substantial loss of $2,433 million [6]. However, in 2021, it generated earnings of $15,818 million, reflecting a remarkable recovery [6]. This dramatic improvement can be attributed to factors such as higher crude oil prices and increased production volumes, which are critical for upstream operations [3].\n\nOn the other hand, the downstream segment also showed a positive shift but on a smaller scale. In 2020, the downstream segment barely broke even with earnings of $47 million [6]. By 2021, its earnings rose to $2,914 million [6]. This increase is likely due to improved margins on refining, manufacturing, and marketing activities [5]. The volatility in industry margins, influenced by supply-demand balance and crude oil prices, played a crucial role in this fluctuation [5].\n\nNext, let’s look at the asset values. For the upstream segment, total assets slightly decreased from $191,309 million in 2020 to $184,412 million in 2021 [8]. Despite this decrease, the segment managed to achieve higher earnings in 2021, indicating efficient utilization of existing assets or possibly divestitures of less profitable assets [7].\n\nFor the downstream segment, total assets increased from $39,586 million in 2020 to $45,224 million in 2021 [8]. This growth in asset value aligns with the segment's improved earnings, suggesting investments in infrastructure or operational improvements that enhanced productivity and profitability.\n\nIn summary, the major differences in the financial performance of Chevron Corporation's Upstream and Downstream segments between 2020 and 2021 are characterized by a significant recovery in upstream earnings from a loss to a substantial profit, while downstream earnings improved modestly. Additionally, upstream assets slightly decreased, whereas downstream assets increased, reflecting strategic adjustments and investments in different areas of operation ![Chevron's upstream and downstream segments showed contrasting trends in earnings and asset values](image6). \n\nThe major difference in their earnings and asset values lies in the upstream segment's dramatic recovery from a loss to high profits, coupled with a slight reduction in assets, while the downstream segment experienced moderate earnings growth with an increase in asset values."}

According to the financial data provided [10], net earnings attributable to P&G rose from $13,027 million in 2020 to $14,742 million in 2022. This increase was primarily due to a prior year loss on early debt extinguishment, lower taxes and interest expense in the current year, as well as foreign exchange impacts that negatively affected net earnings by approximately $274 million in fiscal 2022 [image5]. The rise in net earnings also contributed to an increase in diluted net earnings per share from $4.96 in 2020 to $5.81 in 2022.\n\nRegarding stock-based expenses, these expenses slightly decreased over the same period. Total stock-based expense was $558 million in 2020, then dropped to $540 million in 2021, and further decreased to $528 million in 2022 [image1]. This reduction can be attributed to changes in the components of stock-based compensation, particularly in the RSUs and PSUs expenses, which saw a decline from $309 million in 2020 to $257 million in 2022. Additionally, the income tax benefit associated with these expenses also decreased from $97 million in 2020 to $88 million in 2022 [image1].\n\nThe decrease in stock-based expenses likely reflects adjustments in the grant date fair value of shares vested and changes in the number of options exercised and their intrinsic values [image4].

The Systems revenue decreased by 17.8% as reported (19% adjusted for currency) in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 [3]. For the full year, Systems revenue decreased 8.2% year to year as reported (9% adjusted for currency) [6].\n\nRegarding pre-tax income, the pre-tax income for Systems declined by 36.0% year to year, dropping from $701 million in 2019 to $449 million in 2020 [8], ![Total pre-tax income decreased by 36.0% year to year](image1).\n\nNext, let's break down the performance by hardware and software components.

According to this table, the gross profit under IFRS was $29,896 million, and after adjustments including amortization and impairments, the core gross profit became $33,275 million. Similarly, the operating income under IFRS was $9,172 million, which adjusted to $13,645 million as core results. The adjustments primarily involved adding back amortization expenses and adjusting for impairments.\n\n![{The table provides a detailed breakdown of adjustments from IFRS to core results for 2020}](image7)\n\nIn **2021**, the adjustments are even more pronounced. The gross profit under IFRS was $32,218 million, and after accounting for amortization of intangible assets ($3,419 million) and other items ($344 million), the core gross profit reached $35,981 million [8]. For operating income, the IFRS result was $10,688 million. After incorporating significant adjustments such as amortization of intangible assets ($3,528 million), impairments ($619 million), and other items ($381 million), the core operating income came to $15,215 million.\n\n![{The table details the adjustments made from IFRS to core results for 2021}](image8)\n\nBreaking it down further, the cost of goods sold (COGS) for 2021 saw an adjustment of $3,419 million for amortization of intangible assets and $344 million for other items, leading to a core COGS of -$7,988 million [8]. In selling, general, and administration (SG&A), there was a minor adjustment of $71 million for amortization, resulting in a core SG&A expense of -$12,235 million. Research and development (R&D) expenses also had adjustments, notably $109 million for impairments and $360 million for other items, bringing the core R&D expense to -$8,150 million. Other income and expense categories similarly underwent adjustments to reach their core figures.\n\nThese adjustments indicate that the inclusion of amortization of intangible assets and impairments significantly increased both the gross profit and operating income when transitioning from IFRS to core results for both years. Specifically, these adjustments led to higher core results by excluding non-recurring or non-core items, thereby providing a clearer view of the underlying business performance.\n\nIn summary, the adjustments in amortization of intangible assets and impairments substantially boosted the operating income from IFRS results to core results for both 2020 and 2021, reflecting a more stable and recurring operational performance."}
{"q_id": 511, "model": "qwen-plus", "in_tok": 4366, "out_tok": 698, "total_tok": 5064, "response": "To compare the derivative financial instruments and cash flow changes across 2020 and 2019, we need to analyze how these elements impact Novo Nordisk's financial statements. \n\nFirst, let’s examine the derivative financial instruments. The table in image6 provides detailed data on derivative financial instruments for both years. In 2020, the total fair value of derivative financial instruments was significantly higher compared to 2019. Specifically, the positive fair values for forward contracts increased from DKK 734 million in 2019 to DKK 1,365 million in 2020 [image6]. This increase can be attributed to the rise in the number and value of forward contracts used for hedging purposes, as noted in the text quote that states, \"The fair value of derivative financial instruments is measured on the basis of quoted market prices of financial instruments traded in active markets\" [10].\n\nAdditionally, image7 shows the breakdown of financial assets at fair value. In 2020, the directly or indirectly observable market data for financial assets increased from DKK 188 million in 2019 to DKK 2,332 million in 2020 [image7]. This substantial increase indicates a growing reliance on observable market data for valuing financial instruments, aligning with the statement that there were no transfers between categories during this period [6].\n\nNow, turning to cash flow changes, image4 provides insights into working capital adjustments and their effects on cash flows. In 2020, there was a significant decrease in trade receivables by DKK 2,822 million compared to DKK 2,126 million in 2019 [image4]. This reduction reflects a decline in the inflow of cash from sales, which negatively impacted the overall cash flow from operating activities. Similarly, inventories decreased by DKK 895 million in 2020, compared to DKK 1,305 million in 2019, indicating improved inventory management but still contributing to negative cash flow changes.\n\nThe change in working capital, including exchange rate adjustments, also saw a substantial shift from DKK (3,564) million in 2019 to DKK (4,353) million in 2020 [image4]. This further strained the company's liquidity position. Exchange rate adjustments alone worsened from a positive DKK 176 million in 2019 to a negative DKK 1,729 million in 2020, highlighting the adverse impact of currency fluctuations on cash flows [image4].\n\nIn summary, the increase in derivative financial instruments and the changes in cash flows have significant implications for Novo Nordisk's financial statements. The rise in derivative financial instruments suggests enhanced hedging activities, while the negative cash flow changes reflect challenges in managing working capital and currency risks. These elements collectively affect the company's profitability and liquidity, as seen in the financial data provided ![Derivative financial instruments increased significantly in 2020](image6) and ![Working capital and cash flow changes had a negative impact in 2020](image4).\n\nThus, the financial elements notably affected the company's financial statements by increasing hedging costs and reducing operational cash inflows."}

Specifically, SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales excluding the impact of gasoline price inflation was 9.26%, a decrease of 39 basis points [9]. This trend indicates that despite wage increases and additional employee benefits, the company managed to leverage increased sales effectively, leading to a more efficient cost structure. The reduction in SG&A expenses can be attributed to better operational efficiency and leveraging higher sales volumes [9].\n\nNow, turning to Interest Income and Other, Net, the increase in interest income in 2022 was primarily due to higher global interest rates [3]. Additionally, foreign-currency transaction gains also contributed positively to this category [3]. To visualize the overall financial performance, including interest income, consider the following table which shows key financial metrics for 2022, 2021, and 2020:\n\n![{Financial data showing increasing interest income over the years}](image2)\n\nThe table in image2 demonstrates that while revenue increased significantly from 2020 to 2022, there were corresponding changes in expenses and losses.

Meanwhile, Interest Income and Other, Net saw an upward trend, driven by higher global interest rates and favorable foreign currency transactions. \n\nTherefore, both SG&A expenses and Interest Income and Other, Net showed positive trends from 2020 to 2022, with SG&A becoming more efficient as a percentage of sales and interest income increasing due to external economic factors."}

The table in image6 shows that the total financial debt increased to €14,315 million by the end of fiscal year 2021.\n\nThis substantial increase can be attributed to several factors mentioned in the text quotes. For instance, there were significant finance transactions related to the acquisition of Varian which led to an increase in net debt by €10,416 million [12]. Additionally, the loans assumed in previous years and their subsequent repayments also influenced the overall financial debt [1].\n\nFurthermore, the liabilities from share-based payments decreased from €72 million in September 2020 to €46 million as of September 30, 2021 [4], but this reduction is minor compared to the overall increase in total financial debt.\n\nThe foreign currency risks associated with U.S. dollar-denominated loans were hedged using forward exchange contracts, effectively converting them into synthetic euro-denominated loans, which impacted the interest expenses positively [7].\n\nTherefore, combining all these factors, it is evident that the total financial debt increased significantly from fiscal year 2020 to fiscal year 2021 due to major financing activities and acquisitions. \n\n![{Total financial debt increased from €5,503 million in 2020 to €14,315 million in 2021}](image6)\n\nIn conclusion, the total financial debt increased from €5,503 million in fiscal year 2020 to €14,315 million in fiscal year 2021."}

Over the fiscal years 2018 to 2020, several trends can be observed.\n\nFirstly, let's examine the comprehensive income figures:\n- In 2018, the comprehensive income was $3,730,974.\n- In 2019, it increased to $4,575,086.\n- By 2020, it further rose to $5,472,296 [image5].\n\nThe increase in comprehensive income is primarily driven by the rise in net income from $4,214,594 in 2018 to $5,185,313 in 2020 [image6]. Additionally, other comprehensive income (OCI) also showed significant changes over these years. OCI includes items like foreign currency translation adjustments, defined benefit plan adjustments, and cash flow hedges.\n\nFor instance, foreign currency translation had a substantial impact:\n- In 2018, it was a loss of $(305,225).\n- In 2019, it improved slightly to a loss of $(132,707).\n- By 2020, it turned into a gain of $197,696 [image5].\n\nDefined benefit plans also contributed positively in 2020 with an income of $57,100, compared to losses in previous years [image5]. These improvements in OCI components reflect better management of foreign exchange risks and pension liabilities.\n\nThese trends in comprehensive income directly influence shareholders' equity. The increases in both net income and OCI add to retained earnings and accumulated other comprehensive income, thereby boosting total shareholders' equity. For example, the table detailing shareholders' equity shows that net income for 2020 added $5,107,839 to retained earnings, significantly impacting total shareholders' equity, which ended at $17,499,173 as of August 31, 2020 ![Shareholders' equity was impacted by net income and OCI](image3).\n\nIn summary, the trends in Accenture's comprehensive income and its components over the fiscal years 2018 to 2020 show a positive trajectory, with increasing net income and improvements in OCI items, leading to a substantial increase in shareholders' equity."}

However, the distribution of these losses across different categories provides more insight.\n\nFor intangible assets, specifically patents and licences not yet in use, the impairment losses were significantly lower in 2020 compared to 2019. In 2019, an impairment loss of DKK 982 million was recognized, primarily related to patents and licences [10]. In contrast, in 2020, the impairment loss was DKK 350 million, indicating a reduction in impairment losses for these assets [10].\n\nThis decrease in impairment losses has positively impacted the net carrying amount of intangible assets. As shown in the financial details of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment ![{intangible assets and property, plant and equipment financial details}](image5), the carrying amount of intangible assets increased from DKK 3,380 million in 2019 to DKK 9,607 million in 2020 [6]. This substantial increase suggests that fewer impairments allowed for higher net carrying amounts of intangible assets.\n\nRegarding property, plant, and equipment, the depreciation charges also changed. The depreciation expense for land and buildings and other equipment can be seen in the table ![{depreciation details for land and buildings and other equipment}](image6). For instance, the depreciation for land and buildings was DKK 644 million in 2020 compared to DKK 564 million in 2019. Despite this increase in depreciation, the net carrying amount at the end of 2020 remained relatively stable at DKK 2,901 million for land and buildings and DKK 479 million for other equipment.\n\nIn summary, the reduction in impairment losses on intangible assets, particularly patents and licences, coupled with controlled depreciation expenses on property, plant, and equipment, has led to higher net carrying amounts for these asset categories in 2020 compared to 2019. \n\nThe evolution of depreciation and impairment losses has had a positive impact on the net carrying amounts of intangible assets and property, plant, and equipment, resulting in higher net carrying values in 2020."}

In 2019, premiums earned stood at $9,911 million [4]. By 2020, despite the impact of the GEICO Giveback program which reduced premiums earned by approximately $\\S2.5$ billion [1], premiums still managed to reach $12,214 million [4]. This was followed by a further increase to $13,740 million in 2021 [4]. The growth in premiums earned can be attributed to an increase in voluntary auto policies-in-force and overall business volume [1].\n\nRegarding **net investment income**, the trend shows a decline over the same period.

The acquired contract asset balance from Tableau added $131 million to the contract assets as of January 31, 2020 [5]. Additionally, the remaining performance obligation, which includes unearned revenue and unbilled amounts, was influenced by factors such as seasonality, timing of renewals, and foreign currency exchange rates [1].\n\nThe implications of these changes suggest strong business momentum and successful execution of strategic acquisitions. The rise in unearned revenue indicates that the company has effectively secured future revenue streams through customer commitments, which bodes well for its financial stability and growth prospects.

Specifically, the VIEs generated 99.8% of total net revenues in 2020 and 99.1% in 2021. This slight decline from 2020 to 2021 suggests a marginal decrease in the contribution percentage but still indicates that the VIEs remained the primary source of revenue for the company.\n\nNext, consider the total assets of the VIEs.

In 2020, the diluted EPS was $4.96, increasing to $5.50 in 2021, and reaching $5.81 in 2022 [image3]. This growth in EPS can be attributed to several factors, including increased net earnings, reduced shares outstanding due to repurchases, and improvements in operational efficiency [9].\n\nThe increase in net earnings is notable, with net earnings attributable to P&G rising from $13.027 billion in 2020 to $14.742 billion in 2022 [image3].

According to the financial data presented in the table [image9], the foreign currency translation adjustments for the year ended September 26, 2021, were $6, whereas for the year ended September 27, 2020, these adjustments were not specified but had a previous balance adjustment of $41 in the prior period (September 29, 2019). This indicates a significant decrease in the adjustments from an unspecified amount in 2020 to a minimal $6 in 2021 [image9].\n\nNext, examining the components of income before income taxes by U.S. and foreign jurisdictions, we can refer to the detailed breakdown provided in the table [image1]. The total current provision (benefit) for 2021 was $1,468 million, which includes Federal ($942 million), State ($8 million), and Foreign ($518 million). In comparison, for 2020, the total current provision (benefit) was $737 million, with Federal ($210 million), State ($1 million), and Foreign ($526 million). For the deferred provision (benefit), the totals were ($237) million for 2021 and ($216) million for 2020. Therefore, the grand total for the provision (benefit) was $1,231 million for 2021 and $521 million for 2020 ![foreign currency translation adjustments decreased significantly](image9).\n\nCombining this information, it is evident that the foreign currency translation adjustments saw a notable reduction from 2020 to 2021, while the components of income before income taxes showed an increase in both current and deferred provisions, leading to a higher overall provision in 2021 compared to 2020.\n\nThe changes in the foreign currency translation adjustments and the components of income before income taxes from 2020 to 2021 are characterized by a significant decrease in translation adjustments and an increase in the overall tax provision."}

From the data provided [5], we see that the comprehensive income figures are as follows:\n- 2021: $8,010 million\n- 2020: $2,977 million\n- 2019: $6,619 million\n\nOther comprehensive income (loss) includes unrealized gains or losses on debt securities, foreign currency translation adjustments, and pension and postretirement benefits [image5]. For instance, in 2021, the net unrealized debt securities losses were $(42) million, foreign currency translation adjustments were $(163) million, and net unrealized pension and postretirement benefits were $155 million, resulting in a total other comprehensive loss of $(50) million for 2021. Similar calculations can be made for 2020 and 2019.\n\nNow, let's look at the shareholders' equity section. The table detailing shareholders' equity shows changes in retained earnings, additional paid-in capital, and accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) [image4]. Retained earnings increased from $11,881 million in 2020 to $11,495 million in 2021, indicating a decrease despite higher net income. This suggests that more dividends were paid out or there were significant repurchases of shares during this period.\n\nAdditionally, accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) decreased from $(2,895) million in 2020 to $(2,945) million in 2021, reflecting an increase in losses that directly impacted shareholders' equity but did not pass through the income statement. These losses primarily came from foreign currency translation adjustments, which worsened from $(2,229) million in 2020 to $(2,392) million in 2021 [image5].\n\nThe interplay between these components reveals that while net income significantly improved in 2021, the overall comprehensive income was slightly lower due to the negative impact of other comprehensive losses, particularly from foreign currency translation adjustments. This reduction in comprehensive income also influenced the decrease in retained earnings within shareholders' equity.\n\nIn conclusion, the changes in shareholders' equity, especially the decline in accumulated other comprehensive income and retained earnings, had a moderating effect on the comprehensive income of the company from 2019 to 2021 ![comprehensive income and equity changes](image5)."}

This represents an increase of €3,823 million, which aligns with the statement in the text that equity rose by €3,828 million to €16,339 million [3]. Additionally, this significant rise in equity is mainly attributed to the capital increase in March 2021 for financing the acquisition of Varian [7].\n\nNext, focusing on the cash flows from operating activities, the data shows a substantial improvement. The cash generated from operating activities was €2,933 million in 2021, up from €1,928 million in 2020 ![Cash flows from operating activities increased significantly](image6).

According to the financial data [image2], the operating income for 2020 was $358 million, compared to $346 million in 2019, marking an increase of $12 million.\n\nThe rise in operating income can be attributed to several factors. Firstly, there was a significant increase in investment, dividend, and other income by $34 million in 2020 as compared to 2019 [5]. This increase primarily resulted from equity earnings associated with acquisitions of additional interests in Explorer and Colonial in June 2019, and the acquisition of an interest in Mattox in April 2020. Additionally, higher distributions from Poseidon also contributed to this increase [5].\n\nRegarding cash from investing activities, the company saw a shift from a net cash outflow of $87 million in 2019 to a net cash inflow of $64 million in 2020 [image6]. This change is primarily due to a decrease in capital expenditures from $51 million in 2018 to $35 million in 2019 and further down to $22 million in 2020 [2]. The reduction in capital spending is mainly because of the completion of major projects such as the Houma tank expansion and directional drill projects for Zydeco [2].\n\nFurthermore, the company had no contributions to investments in 2020, which contrasts with previous years when it had made substantial investments [2]. This lack of new investment commitments likely contributed to the positive cash flow from investing activities in 2020.\n\nIn summary, Shell Midstream Partners, L.P.'s operating income increased from 2019 to 2020 due to higher investment earnings and other income, while cash from investing activities improved significantly due to reduced capital expenditures and no new investment contributions."}

This improvement was driven by higher sales volumes and better operational efficiency despite a slight decrease in sales volume from 1,164 kt in FY2020 to 1,066 kt in FY2021 [image1].\n\nOn the other hand, WAIO's performance was even more robust. Revenue surged from $20,663 million in FY2020 to $34,337 million in FY2021, with underlying EBITDA jumping from $14,508 million to $26,270 million [image6]. This remarkable growth can be attributed to higher average realized prices for iron ore and an increase in production volume from 250,598 kt to 252,052 kt [image6].\n\nThe impact of commodity price changes on these operations is notable. For copper, a US¢1 per pound increase in the price impacts profit after taxation by $23 million and underlying EBITDA by $33 million [image5]. Given that the average realized price for copper increased from $2.50 US$/lb in FY2020 to $3.81 US$/lb in FY2021 [image7], this price rise significantly boosted Escondida’s profitability.\n\nFor iron ore, a US$1 per ton increase in the price impacts profit after taxation by $163 million and underlying EBITDA by $233 million [image5].

The net cash flows from operating activities amounted to USD 15.1 billion in 2021, up from USD 13.6 billion in 2020 [5]. This rise was primarily driven by higher net income and divestment gains, as well as lower payments out of provisions, mainly due to legal matters resolved in the prior year [5].\n\nAdditionally, there were lower payments related to provisions, particularly those stemming from legal matters that occurred in the previous year [9].

Additionally, the deferred tax provision for foreign jurisdictions went from a benefit of ($117 million) in 2019 to an expense of $12 million in 2021. Thus, the total foreign tax provision shifted from a net benefit of ($524 million) in 2019 to a net expense of $530 million in 2021.\n\nThese changes reflect a significant shift in the company’s international tax landscape. The increase in foreign income suggests stronger international business performance, which could be attributed to various factors such as market expansion or favorable economic conditions abroad. However, the shift from a net tax benefit to a net tax expense in foreign jurisdictions implies higher tax costs associated with this increased income.\n\nThis transition impacts the company's financial strategy in several ways. First, the company must now manage higher tax expenses on its growing foreign income, potentially affecting overall profitability. Second, as mentioned in [1], the effective tax rate for FDII increases from 13% to 16% beginning in fiscal 2027, adding another layer of complexity to tax planning. Moreover, the company needs to ensure compliance with changing tax regulations and possibly adjust its international operations to optimize tax efficiency.\n\nIn conclusion, the increase in foreign income before taxes from 2019 to 2021, coupled with the shift from a tax benefit to a tax expense, necessitates strategic adjustments in tax planning and operational management to mitigate the impact on profitability and cash flow."}

The U.S. also experienced a rise in the discount rate, moving from 2.4% in 2020 to 2.7% in 2021 ![Discount rate changes](image1).\n\nMoreover, the compensation increase in the United Kingdom, which may influence assumptions in nearby countries like Germany, was 3.0% in 2021 compared to 2.6% in 2020, while Switzerland saw an increase from 1.4% to 1.5% over the same period ![Compensation and pension progression rates](image8). However, these figures specifically pertain to the UK and Switzerland, not directly impacting the U.S. assumptions.\n\nFinancially, changes in the discount rate have substantial effects on the defined benefit obligation. A half-percentage-point decrease in the discount rate would increase the obligation by €271 million in 2021 and €266 million in 2020 for Siemens Healthineers overall ![Effects of changes in assumptions](image4). This underscores the sensitivity of the defined benefit plans to such financial indicators.\n\nThe differences in actuarial assumptions between Germany and the United States reflect the distinct regulatory environments and demographic trends in each country. \n\nTo summarize, the key differences lie in the mortality tables used, the discount rates applied, and the impact of changes in these rates on the defined benefit obligations."}

This overall positive trend in net operating income is influenced by various segments within the bank. For instance, the Global Markets segment saw a significant increase in revenue by $1,562 million or 27% [image7], primarily driven by strong performances in FICC (Fixed Income, Currencies, and Commodities) with a 33% revenue increase [image7].\n\nHowever, not all segments performed equally well. The Global Liquidity and Cash Management segment experienced a substantial decrease in revenue by $1,754 million or 30% [image10]. Additionally, the Markets products, Insurance, and Investments segment also saw a decline in revenue by $427 million or 21% [image10]. These declines were largely due to lower interest rates on capital held in the business and reduced revaluation gains on shares [6].\n\nTurning to profit before tax, the overall figure for 2020 was $4,830 million, marking a decrease of $342 million or 7% from 2019 [image1]. A notable contributor to this decrease was the rise in expected credit losses (ECL), which increased by $3.6 billion compared to 2019 [9]. This rise reflects the global impact of the Covid-19 outbreak on the forward economic outlook, particularly affecting regions like the UK and Asia.\n\nDespite these challenges, certain segments managed to improve their profitability. For example, the profit before tax for Global Banking improved by $387 million or 42% [image11]. This improvement can be attributed to management actions that delivered gross RWA reductions of $37 billion globally and strong performance in Global Markets without increasing trading value at risk (VaR) [8].\n\nIn summary, while the adjusted net operating income showed an overall positive trend with some segments performing exceptionally well, the profit before tax was negatively impacted by higher ECL and varying segmental performances. The Global Markets segment contributed significantly to both metrics, whereas segments like Global Liquidity and Cash Management faced considerable challenges [image7].\n\nTherefore, the impact of adjusted net operating income and profit before tax varied across different banking segments in 2020, with some segments thriving while others struggled amidst the economic uncertainties caused by the pandemic."}

Let's delve into these changes and their implications.\n\n### Loans\n\nThe total loan portfolio saw a modest increase from $887,637 million in 2020 to $895,394 million in 2021, representing an increase of $7,757 million [4]. This growth was driven by commercial loans, which increased from $478,417 million to $513,120 million over the same period [4]. The rise in commercial loans can be attributed to higher loan demand, resulting in increased originations and loan draws, partially offset by paydowns and PPP loan forgiveness [8]. Specifically, the commercial and industrial loan portfolio saw significant activity within one year ($127,237 million) and between one to five years ($199,907 million), indicating short-term liquidity and medium-term investment strategies ![Commercial and Industrial Loans: Within one year: $127,237 million; After one year through five years: $199,907 million](image1).\n\nIn contrast, consumer loans decreased from $409,220 million in 2020 to $382,274 million in 2021 [4]. This decline was primarily due to a reduction in the residential mortgage – first lien portfolio, driven by loan paydowns reflecting the low interest rate environment and the transfer of $17.8 billion of first lien mortgage loans to loans held for sale [8].\n\n### Deposits\n\nTotal deposits grew from $1,404,381 million in 2020 to $1,482,479 million in 2021, marking a 6% increase [3]. This growth was largely fueled by increases in noninterest-bearing demand deposits (from $467,068 million to $527,748 million, a 13% increase) and savings deposits (from $404,935 million to $439,600 million, a 9% increase) ![Noninterest-bearing demand deposits increased by 13%; Savings deposits increased by 9%](image3). These increases suggest a strategic shift towards attracting more stable, lower-cost funding sources.\n\nHowever, time deposits showed a significant decline, decreasing from $49,775 million in 2020 to $29,461 million in 2021, a 41% drop [3]. Similarly, interest-bearing deposits in non-U.S. offices also fell by 44% [3]. These reductions can be linked to actions taken to manage under the asset cap, leading to declines in time deposits such as brokered certificates of deposit (CDs) and interest-bearing deposits in non-U.S. offices [10].\n\n### Inference on Financial Strategy\n\nThe data suggests that the financial entity focused on strengthening its liquidity position and optimizing its balance sheet. By increasing noninterest-bearing demand deposits and savings deposits, it secured more stable and cost-effective funding. The decrease in time deposits and interest-bearing deposits in non-U.S. offices indicates a deliberate strategy to reduce reliance on higher-cost and potentially less stable funding sources. Additionally, the shift in the loan portfolio towards commercial loans reflects a response to market conditions and economic improvements, aligning with better portfolio credit quality and lower charge-offs [2].\n\nIn conclusion, the financial entity's strategy appears to prioritize liquidity, stability, and cost efficiency in its funding sources while adapting its loan portfolio to capitalize on market opportunities and improved economic conditions."}

The continuing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic could have impacted operations and market conditions, leading to reduced revenues or increased operating expenses [1]. Additionally, capital contributions and expenditures related to projects like the Permian Basin may have affected cash flow and profitability [2].\n\nIn summary, the net income for both Amberjack and Mars decreased from 2018 to 2020, likely influenced by external market conditions and operational factors."}

According to the provided data, Adjusted EBITDA for Comcast Corporation was $34,708 million in 2021, $30,826 million in 2020, and $34,258 million in 2019 [4]. This indicates that despite a slight dip in 2020, Adjusted EBITDA recovered strongly in 2021.\n\nThe changes in Adjusted EBITDA can be attributed to several factors across different segments. For instance, revenue increased in 2021 primarily due to increases at Comcast Spectacor as a result of the impacts of COVID-19 in the prior year period and sales of Sky Glass televisions [8]. Additionally, expenses decreased in 2021 compared to 2020, mainly due to costs incurred in the prior year periods in response to COVID-19, including severance charges related to NBCUniversal [7].\n\nThe table showing financial data for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, provides a detailed breakdown of revenue, operating costs, and expenses [image1]. It highlights an increase in total revenue by 3.1% from 2020 to 2021, driven by growth in direct-to-consumer and advertising revenues [image1]. The operating costs and expenses also saw changes, with programming and production costs slightly decreasing while direct network costs significantly increased by 17.1% [image1].\n\nFurthermore, capital expenditures were flat in 2021, with reduced spending in the Theme Parks segment due to COVID-19 being offset by increases in the Cable Communications segment [9]. The capital expenditure data supports this trend, showing that spending on scalable infrastructure increased from $2,289 million in 2020 to $2,658 million in 2021, while customer premise equipment decreased from $2,333 million in 2020 to $2,203 million in 2021 [image3].\n\nIn summary, the Adjusted EBITDA for Comcast Corporation showed resilience and recovery from 2019 to 2021, influenced by market recovery, strategic cost management, and shifts in capital expenditures. ![The table shows financial data for the years 2021, 2020, and 2019, highlighting the Adjusted EBITDA and other financial metrics](image4)\n\nAdjusted EBITDA for Comcast Corporation improved from 2020 to 2021 due to increased revenue and managed expenses."}

Specifically, the total revenue for Global Markets surged by $1,562 million or 27% in 2020, with significant gains in Fixed Income, Currencies, and Commodities (FICC) revenue, increasing by $1,541 million or 33%. Notably, Foreign Exchange revenue rose by $702 million (26%), Rates by $283 million (20%), and Credit by $556 million (90%) [image9].\n\nConversely, the Global Banking segment reported a slight decline in revenue by $71 million or 2%, primarily due to lower real estate and structured finance fee income and losses on legacy corporate restructuring positions. However, capital markets revenue grew and net interest income from corporate lending increased [7].\n\nThe Corporate Centre also underwent changes, particularly in how it allocated certain costs. Starting from January 2020, certain funding costs previously retained in the Corporate Centre were allocated to the global businesses, impacting revenue distribution [9]. Additionally, the Corporate Centre saw improvements in Central Treasury revenue, which decreased by $23 million (-13%) from 2019 to 2020 [image7].\n\nIn terms of overall financial health, HSBC maintained a robust CET1 ratio of 15.9% in 2020, exceeding its risk appetite of ≥13.1%.

According to the provided data, interest and other investment income declined by $470 million (44.4%) in 2021 compared to 2020 [12]. This substantial decrease was mainly due to lower income from short-term investments and fixed maturity securities as short-term interest rates remained low throughout 2021 [12].\n\nAdditionally, the asset allocations reflect these changes. As seen in the table comparing asset categories between December 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020, there was an increase in cash, cash equivalents, and U.S. Treasury Bills from $67,082 thousand to $90,688 thousand ![Increase in cash and cash equivalents](image6). This shift towards holding more cash and short-term government securities indicates a strategy prioritizing liquidity and safety over yield [12]. \n\nMoreover, the carrying value of fixed maturity securities decreased from $20,317 thousand to $16,386 thousand ![Decrease in fixed maturity securities](image6), which aligns with the reduced income from this category. The company's focus on maintaining ample liquidity is evident in its continued holdings of substantial balances of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term U.S. Treasury Bills despite the resulting lower interest income [12].\n\nIn conclusion, the decline in net investment income from 2020 to 2021 was largely driven by lower returns on short-term and fixed maturity investments, reflecting a strategic emphasis on liquidity and safety in the allocation of assets."}

According to the financial statements, this increase can be attributed to several factors. First, there was a rise in investment, dividend, and other income by $34 million in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to equity earnings from additional interests acquired in Explorer and Colonial pipelines in June 2019, as well as the acquisition of an interest in Mattox in April 2020 [11].\n\nAdditionally, the comprehensive income attributable to the Partnership also saw an improvement over these years.

This substantial growth can be attributed to several factors, including the first-time earnings contribution from Varian. Specifically, Varian contributed an adjusted EBIT of €221 million in the period from April 15 through September 30, 2021, achieving an impressive margin of 17.0% [12]. Additionally, the Diagnostics segment saw a significant improvement in its adjusted EBIT margin from 1.9% in 2020 to 13.3% in 2021, largely due to high demand for rapid COVID-19 antigen tests [9].\n\nRegarding net assets, the acquisition had a notable impact on Siemens Healthineers' balance sheet. Net debt surged from €1,484 million in 2020 to €11,901 million in 2021, primarily due to finance transactions related to the Varian acquisition [1]. This increase in net debt is also reflected in the image data, which shows that net debt (including pensions) rose from -€2,513 million in 2020 to -€12,809 million in 2021 `![{Net debt including pensions increased significantly}](image1)`.\n\nMoreover, the working capital was affected as well.

This substantial rise was primarily due to the impact of the Covid-19 outbreak on the forward economic outlook, particularly affecting regions like Europe, MENA, and North and Latin America [10].\n\n2. **Operating Expenses Reduction**: Operating expenses saw a reduction from $(9,544) million in 2019 to $(9,264) million in 2020, a decrease of $280 million or 3%. This reduction reflects management’s cost-saving initiatives and lower performance-related pay, which helped mitigate some of the negative impacts on profitability [6].\n\n3. **Revenue Changes Across Sectors**: While overall revenue declined, there were sector-specific variations. For instance, Global Markets revenue increased by $1,562 million or 27%, driven by higher volatility levels and increased client activity, especially in Foreign Exchange and Credit [3]. Conversely, sectors like Global Liquidity and Cash Management saw a significant drop in revenue, decreasing by $701 million or 26% [7].\n\nIn summary, while net operating income increased slightly, the profit before tax decreased due to higher expected credit losses, offset partially by reductions in operating expenses and strong performance in specific market segments."}

The income tax expense in 2020 was actually a benefit of $5.6 billion, contrasting sharply with the $9.5 billion expense in 2018 [10]. This change in income tax from an expense to a benefit is primarily due to asset impairments recorded in 2020. Additionally, the effective tax rate dropped from 37% in 2018 to 17% in 2020 [10], reflecting a significant shift in the company's financial position and the mix of results across different jurisdictions.\n\nNext, considering the average realizations for crude oil and natural gas, the data shows a clear decline over the same period ![Crude oil and NGL prices fell significantly from 2018 to 2020](image6).

Retained earnings are influenced by dividends declared and paid, stock repurchases, and other comprehensive income or loss. For instance, dividends declared and paid were $3.72 per share in 2020 [8], compared to $3.21 per share in 2019 [4] and $2.63 per share in 2018 [9].

These charges can significantly impact net income and, consequently, retained earnings. Moreover, the increase in cash and short-term investments from $5.39 billion in 2019 to $6.57 billion in 2020 [7] suggests improved liquidity, but this also means less retained earnings as more funds were allocated to liquid assets rather than reinvested into the business.\n\nIn summary, the company's net income decreased from 2018 to 2020 due to lower revenues and higher dividend payouts, while retained earnings were affected by substantial stock repurchases and restructuring charges. The significant factors affecting these changes were strategic capital management decisions such as dividend increases and share repurchases, along with operational expenses like restructuring charges."}

According to the financial data, ExxonMobil's share of equity decreased from $191.7 billion in 2019 to $157.2 billion in 2020 [10]. This represents a substantial reduction of $34.5 billion.\n\nTo understand the key factors contributing to this change, we need to examine several aspects of the company's financial activities during this period. \n\nFirstly, there was a significant reduction in equity due to losses. The company reported a loss that reduced equity by $22.4 billion [10]. Additionally, distributions to shareholders in the form of dividends also contributed to the decline, amounting to $14.9 billion [10].\n\nForeign exchange translation effects provided a slight positive impact on equity, adding $1.8 billion due to the weaker U.S. dollar [10]. However, this was not enough to offset the larger reductions.\n\nFurthermore, the environmental expenditures incurred by ExxonMobil in 2020, totaling $4.5 billion, also had an impact on the overall financial performance and thus on equity [7]. These expenditures included investments in refining infrastructure and technology for clean fuels as well as measures to reduce emissions.\n\n![{ExxonMobil's equity components over the years including changes in common stock, earnings reinvested, and treasury shares}](image7)\n\nIn summary, the total equity of ExxonMobil decreased by $34.5 billion from 2019 to 2020, primarily due to substantial losses and dividend distributions, with only minor positive adjustments from foreign exchange effects."}

This growth was driven by several factors including an increase in retained earnings from RMB 7,007 million to RMB 11,111 million due to profit for the year and other comprehensive income. Additionally, there were increases in additional paid-in capital from RMB 34,425 million to RMB 35,044 million, and non-controlling interests from RMB 88 million to RMB 486 million.\n\nBy 2021, the trend showed a different pattern ![equity changes](image5). The total equity decreased slightly from RMB 52,731 million at the beginning of the year to RMB 51,055 million at the end.

In 2021, total NBCUniversal revenue saw a substantial increase of 26.1% to $34.3 billion compared to 2020 [10]. This growth can be attributed to various factors including the recovery from the impacts of COVID-19, which had led to temporary closures and capacity restrictions in the previous year.\n\nRevenue increases were observed across different segments. For instance, the Media segment's revenue surged by 20.3% to $22.8 billion in 2021 [6]. A significant portion of this increase was due to the broadcast of the Tokyo Olympics, contributing $1.8 billion in revenue. Excluding this event, the revenue still grew by 11.0%, driven by higher distribution and advertising revenues [6].\n\nMeanwhile, Sky's revenue increased by 9.1% to $20.3 billion in 2021, with a constant currency change of 3.1%. This growth was mainly due to increases in advertising and direct-to-consumer revenue, although content revenue decreased partly because of reduced broadcast rights for Serie A in Italy [7]. The table showing detailed revenue breakdowns further supports these observations ![{Revenue trends highlight an overall market recovery}](image3).\n\nCustomer relationships also played a crucial role. Despite a slight net loss of 198 thousand customers in 2021, the number of customer relationships remained relatively consistent over the three years [5]. Notably, there were decreases in Italy but increases in the United Kingdom and Germany [11]. The average monthly direct-to-consumer revenue per customer relationship increased by 8.7% in 2021 compared to 2020, reflecting rate adjustments and changes in service levels [8] ![{Average monthly direct-to-consumer revenue per customer relationship showed positive growth}](image8).\n\nOverall, the financial performance of NBCUniversal improved significantly from 2019 to 2021, driven by robust revenue growth and stable customer relationships despite some regional fluctuations.\n\nIn summary, the financial performance of NBCUniversal improved markedly from 2019 to 2021, driven by strong revenue growth and stable customer relationships."}

This approach ensures that induction and learning opportunities can be tailored to Directors’ Committee memberships and the Board’s specific areas of focus [1].\n\nTo illustrate the detailed steps involved in this process, we can refer to the eight-step method outlined by BHP for managing Board succession planning and the appointment of new Board members ![The table outlines an eight-step process for BHP's Board succession planning and appointment of new Board members](image1). \n\nFirstly, BHP employs a **rigorous approach** to manage Board succession planning, considering unforeseen departures and replacing current Board members while focusing on diversity, size, tenure, skills, experience, and attributes necessary for effective governance [image1]. Secondly, the process is **continuous**, particularly for Non-executive Directors, with a nine-year tenure as a guide, aiming to maintain a balance between experience and new perspectives [image1].\n\nFor new appointments, the Nomination and Governance Committee outlines a **role description**, incorporating criteria and attributes specified in the Board Governance Document. An external search firm is then selected to carry out a global search based on this role description [image1]. Shortlisted candidates undergo **Board interviews**, where they meet each Board member before a decision is made about their appointment [image1].\n\nThe Nomination and Governance Committee then makes a **recommendation** for the preferred candidate for Board appointment, following which thorough **background checks** are performed by the Board, supported by external consultants [image1]. Finally, a **letter of appointment** is produced, detailing terms for Non-executive Directors, including indemnification by the Group, definitions of their role, independence, participation, time commitment, and continuous improvement [image1].\n\nIn addition to these steps, the Nomination and Governance Committee oversees continuous improvement activities (training and development programs) for Non-executive Directors, covering business matters, environmental, social, and governance issues, and providing updates on BHP’s assets, commodities, geographies, and markets [8]. These programs are designed and periodically reviewed to maximize effectiveness, incorporating the results of Director performance evaluations.\n\nTherefore, BHP's Nomination and Governance Committee ensures effective board succession planning and director development through a well-defined, multi-step process that balances continuity and fresh perspectives, ensuring the Board remains equipped to adapt to changing external factors and BHP's specific circumstances."}

The total cost of revenues rose from $3,451 million in 2019 to $4,235 million in 2020, with a variance of $784 million [4].

This decrease was driven by reductions in commercial and industrial loans, commercial real estate loans, and lease financing and other loans. Specifically, commercial and industrial loans saw a decline of $22,867 million (-16%) [image3], which aligns with the text stating that paydowns exceeded originations due to lower loan demand and higher client liquidity [12].\n\nCommercial real estate loans also decreased by $5,202 million (-10%) [image3].

This increase was primarily driven by higher gross carrying amounts for brands, which rose from $3,908 million to $4,299 million, and patents and technology, which remained relatively stable but slightly decreased from $2,781 million to $2,769 million. The customer relationships also saw a slight increase from $1,789 million to $1,797 million. Other intangible assets stayed nearly the same, with a gross carrying amount of $147 million in 2022 compared to $150 million in 2021.\n\nSimultaneously, the accumulated amortization for these assets also increased from $(6,100) million in 2021 to $(6,273) million in 2022 [10]. This rise in accumulated amortization indicates that more of the value of these intangible assets has been expensed over time, reflecting their consumption or decline in value.\n\nThe changes in intangible assets with determinable lives are closely related to the company's overall amortization expenses. The table showing the intangible asset amortization amounts for the years ended June 30 confirms this trend, as the amortization expense decreased slightly from $318 million in 2021 to $312 million in 2022 ![The amortization expense decreased slightly from $318 million in 2021 to $312 million in 2022](image1). This decrease in annual amortization expense despite an increase in accumulated amortization can be attributed to the timing and nature of the intangible assets being amortized, as well as potential new acquisitions or adjustments in the estimated useful lives of existing assets.\n\nIn summary, Procter & Gamble's intangible assets with determinable lives increased in gross carrying amount from 2021 to 2022, while the accumulated amortization also grew, leading to a slight decrease in the annual amortization expense during this period."}

This notable downturn in net interest income was primarily due to lower interest rates, which affected various categories such as U.S. commercial loans [image2]. On the other hand, net interest expense decreased by $5,627 million from 2019 to 2020, following a smaller increase of $714 million from 2018 to 2019 [image2].\n\nThese changes reflect the organizational structure of Bank of America, particularly its focus on managing risks and optimizing capital allocation across its business segments. The significant decrease in net interest income can be attributed to strategic decisions made within the Consumer Banking segment, where net interest income saw a substantial drop [image5]. This segment's performance was influenced by lower interest rates, which impacted deposit and lending activities [image1]. Additionally, the decrease in net interest expense suggests that the bank managed to reduce funding costs effectively, aligning with its internal risk-based capital models that incorporate credit, market, interest rate, business, and operational risks [1].\n\nFurthermore, the organizational chart illustrates the interconnectedness of the bank's divisions, showing how each segment contributes to overall financial performance.

According to the financial data, interest and other investment income fell by 44.4%, dropping from $1,059 million in 2020 to $589 million in 2021 [7]. This significant reduction is largely attributed to lower income from short-term investments and fixed maturity securities due to persistently low interest rates that prevailed through 2021 [4].\n\nHowever, dividend income showed a modest increase of 3.5% from $4,890 million in 2020 to $5,060 million in 2021 [7].

The decrease in net investment income highlights the challenges posed by low interest rates on traditional investment strategies, prompting a reassessment of asset allocation to balance risk and return.\n\nIn summary, the net investment income decreased from 2020 to 2021 due to lower interest rates, while the asset composition shifted towards more cash and equity securities, indicating a strategy to manage liquidity and explore higher-yield opportunities amidst a challenging interest rate environment."}

This turnaround was primarily driven by higher margins on refined product sales, which contributed $1.6 billion to the increase, and higher earnings from CPChem, adding $1.0 billion. Additionally, there were increased sales volumes contributing $470 million, although these gains were partially offset by higher operating expenses of $150 million.\n\nIn contrast, international downstream earnings decreased from $618 million in 2020 to $525 million in 2021 [11]. The decline was mainly due to lower margins on refined product sales, which reduced earnings by $330 million, and higher operating expenses of $100 million. However, this was partially offset by a favorable swing in foreign currency effects that added $337 million between periods.\n\nTo understand the broader context, it's important to note the overall trends in sales and revenues. Total refined product sales increased by 14 percent in 2021 compared to 2020, reaching 1.14 million barrels per day, reflecting higher demand for gasoline, jet fuel, and diesel as travel restrictions eased [5].

According to the provided financial data [image8], the net income increased from $4,214,594 in 2018 to $5,185,313 in 2020. This represents a notable growth in profitability over the two-year period.\n\nRegarding comprehensive income, it also saw an upward trend. In 2018, the comprehensive income attributable to Accenture PLC was $3,578,520, which grew to $5,386,579 in 2020 [image8]. The increase in comprehensive income is influenced by both the rise in net income and other comprehensive income (OCI) components.\n\nKey factors influencing these changes include:\n\n1. **Operating Performance**: The operating income for Accenture increased from $5,898,779 in 2018 to $6,513,644 in 2020 [image4]. This improvement in operating performance contributed significantly to higher net income.\n   \n2. **Foreign Currency Translation**: A positive foreign currency translation adjustment of $197,696 in 2020 compared to a negative adjustment of $(305,225) in 2018 [image8] boosted OCI, thus enhancing comprehensive income.\n\n3. **Defined Benefit Plans**: There was a positive impact from defined benefit plans in 2020 with an income of $57,100, contrasting with a loss of $(253,039) in 2018 [image8].\n\n4. **Cash Flow Hedges**: Cash flow hedges resulted in a gain of $24,721 in 2020, whereas there was a gain of $123,003 in 2019 but a loss of $(198,645) in 2018 [image8].\n\n5. **Investments**: Investment-related adjustments had minimal impact but did contribute positively in 2020 with a gain of $(777) compared to losses in previous years [image8].\n\nAdditionally, the company's share repurchase program and dividends also played a role in equity adjustments. For instance, during fiscal 2020, Accenture purchased 2,461,094 Class A ordinary shares under its open-market share purchase program for an aggregate price of $555 million [5]. Furthermore, the declaration of quarterly cash dividends, such as the one declared on September 23, 2020, at $0.88 per share [4], impacted retained earnings and consequently shareholders' equity [image1].\n\nIn conclusion, the net income and comprehensive income attributable to Accenture PLC increased from 2018 to 2020 due to improved operating performance and favorable adjustments in OCI components like foreign currency translation and defined benefit plans."}

Supply chain disruptions can result from events affecting raw materials and manufacturing, such as strikes or natural disasters [6]. The potential impacts of these disruptions include supply issues and cost increases.\n\nTo mitigate these risks, Nestlé has implemented safety and security policies along with business continuity plans [6]. These measures aim to ensure that even in the face of unforeseen events, the supply chain remains resilient and operational. \n\nNestlé's factory distribution across different regions is an important factor in managing supply chain risks. For instance, the company operates in various regions like the Americas (AMS), Europe, Middle East, and North Africa (EMENA), and Asia, Oceania, and Sub-Saharan Africa. This geographic spread helps distribute risk, ensuring that if one region faces a disruption, others can still maintain operations and supply continuity.\n\nThe donut chart depicting the distribution of share capital by geography shows significant shares in Switzerland and the United States, indicating strong economic presence and possibly robust infrastructure in these areas ![Share capital is heavily concentrated in Switzerland and the United States](image2).

This improvement was primarily due to higher revenue growth and effective management of expenses. Additionally, other comprehensive income also saw a substantial shift, increasing from a loss of €-598 million in 2020 to a gain of €700 million in 2021. The total comprehensive income for 2021 was €2,446 million, compared to €825 million in 2020 [image1].\n\nThe increase in other comprehensive income can be attributed to several factors:\n- **Remeasurements of defined benefit plans** improved from a minor loss of €-5 million in 2020 to a gain of €154 million in 2021.\n- **Currency translation differences** turned from a loss of €-768 million in 2020 to a gain of €724 million in 2021, reflecting favorable exchange rate movements [image1].\n\n### Balance Sheet Components\n\nThe balance sheet also shows significant changes over the two fiscal years:\n\n#### Assets\nTotal assets increased from €25,094 million in 2020 to €42,162 million in 2021 [image6]. This growth is mainly due to a substantial rise in non-current assets from €14,827 million in 2020 to €31,338 million in 2021. Specifically:\n- **Goodwill and intangible assets** grew significantly due to acquisitions like Varian [3].\n- **Current assets** also increased slightly from €10,268 million in 2020 to €10,824 million in 2021, driven by higher cash and receivables [image6].\n\n#### Liabilities\nTotal liabilities rose from €12,586 million in 2020 to €26,847 million in 2021 [image6]. This increase is largely due to a significant jump in non-current liabilities from €5,294 million in 2020 to €15,758 million in 2021. Key factors include:\n- **Long-term financial debt** increased as the company raised loans to finance acquisitions [3].\n- **Provisions for pensions and similar obligations** also saw an uptick [image6].\n\n#### Equity\nEquity attributable to shareholders of Siemens Healthineers AG increased from €12,498 million in 2020 to €16,321 million in 2021 [image6]. This growth stems from:\n- A capital increase that added €2,284 million to capital reserves [7].\n- Net income contributing positively despite dividend payouts [7].\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn summary, the key differences in comprehensive income show a marked improvement in both net income and other comprehensive income, driven by better operational performance and favorable currency translations. On the balance sheet, there was a substantial increase in assets and liabilities, primarily due to acquisitions and financing activities, while equity grew due to retained earnings and capital increases ![Comprehensive income and balance sheet improvements highlight strong financial performance](image1)."}

The shipment volume for cigarettes decreased by 11.8%, dropping from 72,293 million units in 2019 to 63,749 million units in 2020 [image3]. This decline was partly due to lower market shares in key countries such as Argentina, Colombia, and Mexico, where adult smokers down-traded to ultra-low-price brands or faced retail out-of-stock issues [12].\n\nConversely, the shipment volume for Heated Tobacco Units (HTUs) saw a substantial increase of 50.8%, rising from 299 million units in 2019 to 451 million units in 2020 [image3].

In 2021, the net income was $21.5 billion, marking a substantial increase from $3.4 billion in 2020 [8]. This improvement can be attributed to several factors, including higher gains from equity securities, mortgage banking income, and investment advisory fees, partially offset by lower net interest income [8].\n\nExamining the balance sheet data, total loans decreased as paydowns exceeded originations. Specifically, Home Lending loan balances were impacted by actions taken in 2020 to temporarily curtail certain non-conforming residential mortgage originations and suspend home equity originations. Small Business period-end loan balances were also affected by a decline in PPP loans [5]. Additionally, total deposits increased due to higher levels of liquidity and savings for consumer customers, reflecting government stimulus programs and payment deferral programs [11].\n\n![{Total loans decreased significantly while total deposits increased over the years}](image2) The image illustrates that total loans saw a decrease from 2019 to 2021, with a notable drop in commercial and industrial loans, commercial real estate loans, and lease financing.

According to the provided data [image6], the total average Card Member loans increased from $13.3 billion in 2019 to $15.0 billion in 2021, marking a rise of approximately 13%. This growth can be attributed to higher customer acquisition and retention rates, as well as improved economic conditions post-pandemic [2]. The increase in loans suggests that more customers were utilizing their credit lines, which is a positive indicator for the company’s lending activities.\n\nSimultaneously, the net interest income also saw fluctuations during this period. Image7 shows that the net interest income decreased from $866 million in 2019 to $967 million in 2020, before slightly increasing to $1,011 million in 2021. Despite the slight uptick in 2021, it remains lower than the 2019 figure by about 4%. The decrease in net interest income was primarily due to lower revolving loan balances and a decrease in net interest yields driven by higher paydown rates on these loans [2].\n\nThese changes had mixed implications for the company's financial performance. On one hand, the increase in average Card Member loans supported overall revenue growth through higher transaction volumes and fees [6]. On the other hand, the decline in net interest income reflected a shift towards more conservative borrowing behavior among card members, possibly influenced by better liquidity and financial health [10]. Additionally, provisions for credit losses decreased and resulted in a net benefit, partly due to improved portfolio quality and macroeconomic outlook [4]. This reduction in provisions contributed positively to the bottom line.\n\nIn summary, while the average Card Member loans grew from 2019 to 2021, the net interest income experienced a modest decline, reflecting shifts in customer borrowing patterns and economic recovery.

According to the detailed breakdown of shareholders' equity changes [image2], share-based compensation expense increased Restricted Share Units by 1,118,284 and Additional Paid-in Capital by $79,522, totaling an increase of $1,197,806. This indicates that through share-based compensation, Accenture not only incentivized its employees but also bolstered its equity structure, thereby strengthening its financial foundation.\n\nSecondly, the cash flow from operating activities significantly impacts the company's cash position. The cash flow statement for 2020, 2019, and 2018 [image4] reveals that net income for 2020 was $5,185,313. Adjustments for non-cash items such as depreciation, amortization, and share-based compensation contributed positively to the operating cash flow. Additionally, changes in working capital (assets and liabilities) further influenced the cash generated from operations. Specifically, the net increase in cash and cash equivalents for 2020 was substantial, reflecting strong operational performance and efficient management of assets and liabilities.\n\nCombining both elements, share-based compensation directly boosts shareholders' equity by increasing retained earnings and additional paid-in capital, while robust cash flows from operating activities ensure a healthy cash position. Thus, for the year 2020, these two factors were crucial in maintaining and enhancing Accenture plc's financial health ![share-based compensation and operating cash flow contribute to equity and cash position](image2). \n\nIn summary, share-based compensation and cash flow from operating activities significantly contributed to Accenture plc's shareholders' equity and cash position for the year 2020 by increasing equity components and ensuring a solid cash balance."}

However, these gains were partially offset by increased working capital requirements, particularly in inventory and accounts receivable, which had a negative effect on cash flow but were mitigated somewhat by favorable changes in accounts payable and accrued expenses [1].\n\n![{Cash flow from operating activities significantly increased from 2020 to 2021}](image2)\n\nThe implications of these changes on business operations are multifaceted. The rise in operating cash flow suggests improved operational efficiency and profitability, allowing the company to reinvest more funds into its operations or pay down debt. Increased cash flow can also enhance liquidity, providing a stronger financial position to navigate market fluctuations and invest in growth opportunities. Moreover, the positive impact on cash flow from reduced short-term incentive compensation payments indicates tighter control over discretionary spending, which could reflect strategic financial management aimed at optimizing resource allocation [6].\n\nIn summary, the total assets and cash flow from operating activities showed positive changes from 2020 to 2021, indicating enhanced operational performance and financial strength for the consolidated segment."}

According to the financial statement provided ![{The table outlines the assets, liabilities, and shareholders' equity of the entity for the specified dates, offering a snapshot of its financial position.}](image1), total assets decreased from $191,367 million in 2020 to $188,548 million in 2021, marking a reduction of approximately $2,819 million.\n\nRegarding total liabilities, there was also a slight decrease from $168,383 million in 2020 to $166,371 million in 2021, a reduction of about $2,012 million. These reductions can be attributed to several factors:\n\n1. **Decrease in Cash and Cash Equivalents**: The cash and cash equivalents saw a significant drop from $32,965 million in 2020 to $22,028 million in 2021 [image1]. This decline aligns with the broader trend observed in total assets.\n   \n2. **Increase in Card Member Loans and Receivables**: Despite the overall decrease in total assets, card member loans increased from $68,029 million to $85,257 million, and card member receivables rose from $43,434 million to $53,581 million [image1]. This suggests that the company expanded its lending activities, which could have been funded by reducing cash reserves or other liquid assets.\n\n3. **Reduction in Investment Securities**: Investment securities decreased substantially from $21,631 million in 2020 to $2,591 million in 2021 [image1]. This sharp decline likely reflects strategic reallocation of funds or maturation of investments.\n\nThese changes in assets and liabilities relate closely to the entity's comprehensive income and cash flows. Comprehensive income for 2021 was $8,010 million, significantly higher than the $2,977 million reported in 2020 ![{This indicates a breakdown of net income and various component adjustments to arrive at comprehensive income for each year.}](image2). The increase in comprehensive income is consistent with the rise in net income from $3,135 million in 2020 to $8,060 million in 2021 [image2].\n\nThe cash flow statement provides further insight into these financial movements ![{This table is a financial document typically found in a company’s annual report, providing insights into the inflows and outflows of cash, informing stakeholders about the company’s financial operations during the reporting periods.}](image7). Net cash provided by operating activities increased from $5,591 million in 2020 to $14,645 million in 2021, indicating improved operational efficiency and profitability [image7]. However, this was offset by substantial cash outflows in investing activities ($10,529 million) and financing activities ($14,933 million) in 2021, leading to a net decrease in cash and cash equivalents of $10,937 million [image7].\n\nIn summary, the decreases in total assets and total liabilities from 2020 to 2021 are primarily driven by reductions in cash and cash equivalents and investment securities, while increases in card member loans and receivables reflect growth in lending activities. These changes correlate with an increase in comprehensive income and significant cash inflows from operations, partially offset by large cash outflows in investing and financing activities."}

The WPB business saw a decline in its revenue due to lower global interest rates, especially impacting regions like Hong Kong and the UK [3]. However, specific figures for WPB's net operating income are not directly provided in the text quotes. For CMB, despite challenges, there was growth in deposit balances supported by technology investments [2].\n\nThe image data provides more detailed insights into the net operating income. According to the management view of adjusted revenue presented in ![{the table shows a significant drop in net operating income from 2019 to 2020}](image5), the net operating income for the overall business decreased from $15,164 million in 2019 to $13,312 million in 2020, marking a decrease of $1,852 million or 12%. This reduction likely reflects the performance across various segments including WPB and CMB.\n\nFor profit before tax, the Adjusted results table in ![{the table indicates a substantial decrease in profit before tax from 2019 to 2020}](image8) shows that HSBC's profit before tax dropped significantly from $7,170 million in 2019 to $1,868 million in 2020, a decrease of $5,302 million or 74%.\n\nIn terms of segment-specific performance:\n- WPB achieved its target in seven out of eight scale markets but faced challenges in Malaysia, particularly regarding ease of banking [1].\n- CMB managed to support customer liquidity and working capital needs, although its performance was impacted by increased ECL charges and lower global interest rates [2].\n\nCombining these insights, it is evident that both WPB and CMB experienced declines in key financial metrics in 2020. However, while CMB managed to grow deposit balances through technological support, WPB struggled more significantly with achieving customer satisfaction and operational efficiency, leading to a relatively poorer performance in net operating income and profit before tax compared to CMB.\n\nTherefore, in 2020, HSBC's Commercial Banking performed better than Wealth and Personal Banking in terms of maintaining net operating income and profit before tax."}

The carrying amount at the beginning of the fiscal year on 1 July 2018 was $15,973,000 [image1]. By the end of the fiscal year on 28 June 2020, this amount had decreased to $14,265,000 due to factors such as annual depreciation charges, disposals, and exchange rate movements. Notably, the impairment incurred in the year ending 28 June 2020 also contributed significantly to this reduction [image1].\n\nTurning to right-of-use assets, the table in image6 specifically addresses these changes. The initial balance for right-of-use assets on 1 July 2019 was established at $138,403,000 upon the application of AASB 16. During the year, additions totaling $48,793,000 were made, along with adjustments from re-measurement of lease liabilities ($1,698,000) and exchange rate movements ($-1,755,000). Consequently, the balance at 28 June 2020 stood at $187,139,000 [image6].\n\nRegarding accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, the adjusted balance started at zero on 1 July 2019. Over the year, depreciation and impairment charges amounted to $37,454,000, with minor adjustments from exchange rate movements leading to a balance of $36,675,000 by the end of the fiscal year. This resulted in a carrying amount of $150,464,000 at 28 June 2020 [image6].\n\nAdditionally, text quote [3] highlights that site restoration costs are now capitalized as part of the lease right-of-use asset and depreciated over the life of the lease term since the adoption of AASB 16 from 1 July 2019. This change in accounting policy directly impacts the carrying amounts of right-of-use assets.\n\nIn summary, the carrying amounts of leasehold improvements, hardware and software, and right-of-use assets experienced changes primarily driven by depreciation, impairment losses, additions, re-measurement of lease liabilities, and exchange rate effects. Specifically, the carrying amount of right-of-use assets increased from $138,403,000 to $150,464,000 by the end of the fiscal year 2020 ![The carrying amount of right-of-use assets increased from $138,403,000 to $150,464,000](image6), while leasehold improvements and other assets saw a decrease due to various factors ![The carrying amount of leasehold improvements decreased from $15,973,000 to $14,265,000](image1).\n\nThus, the changes in carrying amounts reflect the combined impact of these financial adjustments and policy changes."}

This trend reflects Qualcomm's growing realization of tax benefits associated with its share-based compensation plans.\n\nAdditionally, the effective tax provision has fluctuated considerably over these years. In 2019, the effective tax provision was $3,095$ million, which dropped significantly to $521$ million in 2020 and then slightly increased to $1,231$ million in 2021 ![{Effective tax provision changed significantly over the three years}](image7). The effective tax rate also varied, starting at 41% in 2019, decreasing to 9% in 2020, and rising to 12% in 2021. These changes can be attributed to several factors, including the derecognition of deferred tax assets on distributed intellectual property in 2019, which amounted to $2,472$ million, and the benefit from establishing new U.S. net deferred tax assets, which resulted in a $(570)$ million deduction in the same year [8].\n\nIn terms of unrecognized tax benefits, there has been a steady increase from a beginning balance of $1,705$ million in 2019 to $2,136$ million in 2021 ![{Unrecognized tax benefits showed a steady increase over the three years}](image8). This growth is due to additions for current year tax positions and reductions for prior year tax positions, indicating ongoing adjustments and settlements with taxing authorities.\n\nFurthermore, the breakdown of current and deferred tax provisions shows that while the current provision (benefit) increased from $737$ million in 2020 to $1,468$ million in 2021, the deferred (benefit) provision decreased from $(216)$ million in 2020 to $(237)$ million in 2021 ![{Current provision increased while deferred provision decreased in 2021}](image9). This suggests that Qualcomm recognized more immediate tax expenses in 2021 compared to previous years, possibly due to changes in tax policies or higher taxable income.\n\nOverall, the trends indicate that Qualcomm experienced significant fluctuations in its tax provisions and benefits, influenced by various factors such as share-based compensation, intellectual property distributions, and ongoing tax adjustments and settlements. The most notable change was the significant drop in the effective tax provision from 2019 to 2020, followed by a moderate recovery in 2021. \n\nThe significant changes in Qualcomm's tax provisions and related benefits over the years 2019, 2020, and 2021 reflect a complex interplay of tax strategies, regulatory impacts, and operational performance."}

Similarly, in 2020, amortization adjustments were also substantial, impacting the transition from IFRS to core results ![image6 shows the detailed reconciliation from IFRS to core financial measures](image6).\n\n2. **Impairments**: Impairments of property, plant, and equipment, and intangible assets also play a crucial role. In 2021, impairments amounted to $684$ million [7], while in 2020, they were higher at $1,354$ million. These impairments are often reversed or adjusted in core results, leading to higher core figures compared to IFRS results.\n\n3. **Acquisition or Divestment of Businesses and Related Items**: Adjustments related to acquisitions and divestments can vary widely. In 2021, acquisition or divestment items contributed $414$ million to adjustments [8], whereas in 2020, they were relatively smaller but still impactful.\n\n4. **Other Items**: Miscellaneous items such as restructuring charges, legal provisions, and other non-recurring expenses are included in the adjustments. These items can have a notable impact on both operating income and net income when transitioning from IFRS to core results.\n\nIn conclusion, the most significant adjustments affecting net income and basic EPS between IFRS and core results for 2020 and 2021 were primarily due to amortization of intangible assets, impairments, and acquisition or divestment of businesses and related items."}

The changes in equity components for Chevron Corporation from 2018 to 2021 reveal that cash dividends played a significant role in reducing retained earnings [image5]. In 2021, Chevron paid out cash dividends, which decreased retained earnings. This reduction directly affects the total stockholders' equity, as it reduces the amount of earnings retained within the company rather than distributed to shareholders.\n\nRegarding treasury stock transactions, image5 also shows that Chevron engaged in the purchase and issuance of treasury shares. Treasury stock purchases typically decrease stockholders' equity because they represent an outflow of cash to repurchase shares from the market. Conversely, issuing treasury shares can increase stockholders' equity if the company reissues these shares at a higher price than the original purchase cost. In 2021, Chevron had movements in treasury shares, indicating that these transactions influenced the overall equity structure by adjusting the number of outstanding shares and the associated costs.\n\nNext, let's consider the impact on cash flow. Image6 provides consolidated cash flow data for Chevron over three years, including 2021. Under financing activities, it shows that cash dividends resulted in a significant outflow of cash, contributing to the net cash used for financing activities of ($23,113 million) in 2021. This substantial outflow reflects the distribution of profits to shareholders, impacting the company's liquidity.\n\nAdditionally, treasury stock transactions also affected cash flow under financing activities. The net sales (purchases) of treasury shares are detailed in image6, showing that Chevron spent cash to repurchase its own shares, further contributing to the negative net cash used for financing activities. These transactions indicate that Chevron was managing its capital structure by balancing the number of shares outstanding and the cash reserves available.\n\nIn summary, both cash dividends and treasury stock transactions significantly impacted Chevron's equity structure and cash flow in 2021 by reducing retained earnings and increasing the outflow of cash under financing activities [image5]![{Treasury stock and dividend payments reduced retained earnings and increased cash outflows}](image6)."}

As a result, the Group recognized right-of-use assets and corresponding lease liabilities for its leases. The initial recognition of lease liability on the application of AASB 16 was $143,621 thousand as shown in the table ![Balance at 1 July 2019 was adjusted to $143,621 due to the recognition of lease liability on initial application of AASB 16](image1). Over the year, additional lease liabilities were recognized during the period amounting to $50,245 thousand, with re-measurement adjustments adding $1,559 thousand. Lease payments made during the year reduced the liability by $(31,886) thousand, while interest added $4,707 thousand, resulting in a final balance of $167,154 thousand as of 28 June 2020.\n\nFor employee benefit liabilities, the transition also had notable effects. According to the consolidated employee benefit liabilities data ![Total employee benefit liabilities increased slightly from $4,054 thousand in 2019 to $4,092 thousand in 2020](image3), there was a slight increase from $4,054 thousand in 2019 to $4,092 thousand in 2020. This change reflects the ongoing obligations for employee benefits such as annual leave and long-service leave, which are calculated based on undiscounted amounts expected to be paid as at the reporting date [1].\n\nIn summary, the financial impacts of transitioning to AASB 16 on lease and employee benefit liabilities in 2020 included an increase in lease liabilities primarily due to the recognition of new right-of-use assets and corresponding liabilities, and a marginal rise in employee benefit liabilities reflecting ongoing employee service obligations."}

The fair value allocation here included a non-cash charge of approximately $166 million due to favorable terms in the reseller agreement [4], which resulted in a loss on the date the transaction closed. Additionally, the goodwill from this acquisition was primarily attributed to the assembled workforce and expanded market opportunities, similar to ClickSoftware [6]. However, the total net assets acquired were significantly lower, totaling $134 million ![Net assets acquired valued at $134 million](image1).\n\nBoth acquisitions allocated fair values to intangible assets like developed technology and customer relationships.

According to the provided data ![{the table compares financial metrics such as operating profit for 2020 and 2019}](image4), the operating profit for PBNA under the reported GAAP measure saw a decline. The operating profit decreased by 2% from $10,291 million in 2019 to $10,080 million in 2020 [4].\n\nNext, considering the core non-GAAP measures, which adjust for items affecting comparability, we can see from the segmental financial data ![{segmental financial data shows adjustments for various influencing factors like restructuring charges}](image5) that the core non-GAAP measure for PBNA also reflects adjustments for mark-to-market net impact, restructuring and impairment charges, inventory fair value adjustments, and merger and integration charges. Specifically, for PBNA, the core non-GAAP measure was adjusted upwards by $0.34 per share due to these factors [5].\n\nMoreover, the detailed segmental performance ![{shows percentage changes and impacts of foreign exchange translation and acquisitions/divestitures}](image6) indicates that PBNA experienced a reported percentage change of 4% in GAAP terms, but this includes a -2% impact from acquisitions and divestitures. Adjusting for these, the organic percentage change in non-GAAP terms was only 2%. Additionally, there was a positive impact from effective net pricing, which contributed to the overall performance.\n\nIn summary, while the reported GAAP measure for PBNA showed a slight decrease in operating profit, the core non-GAAP measure, after adjusting for items affecting comparability, provides a clearer picture of the underlying business performance. The influencing factors included adjustments for mark-to-market impacts, restructuring and impairment charges, inventory fair value adjustments, and the effects of acquisitions and divestitures.\n\nThe reported GAAP measure for PBNA decreased slightly from 2019 to 2020, while the core non-GAAP measure remained relatively stable after accounting for adjustments."}

According to the financial data [6], net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2020, decreased by $0.3 billion compared with 2019. However, excluding unfavorable currency movements of $0.5 billion, net cash provided by operating activities actually increased by $0.2 billion. This suggests that despite a reported decrease, operational improvements and higher net earnings (excluding specific charges) positively influenced cash flows [image1]. The table in image1 shows net cash provided by operating activities totaling $9,812 million for 2020 and $10,090 million for 2019, confirming this trend.\n\nNext, consider the net cash used in investing activities. In 2020, net cash used in investing activities was $1.2 billion, which is a decrease of $0.7 billion from the comparable 2019 period [2]. This decrease was primarily due to the reduction of cash resulting from the deconsolidation of RBH and lower capital expenditures. Lower capital spending, as detailed in [5], where capital expenditures were $0.6 billion in 2020 compared to $0.9 billion in 2019, contributed to this improvement in cash conservation.\n\nFinally, regarding financing activities, net cash used in financing activities increased by $0.4 billion from 2019 to 2020, reaching $8.5 billion [3]. This increase was mainly due to higher payments to noncontrolling interests and higher dividends paid, partially offset by debt activity. The table in image4 provides a comprehensive overview of these financing activities, showing that dividends paid rose from $7,161 million in 2019 to $7,364 million in 2020, and payments to noncontrolling interests also increased significantly from $357 million to $776 million.\n\nCombining these factors, the overall impact on the cash balance can be seen in the final figures. Image4 shows that the cash balance at the end of 2019 was $6,865 million, while it increased to $7,285 million by the end of 2020, an increase of $420 million. Despite higher cash outflows in financing activities, the positive adjustments in operating and investing activities, along with favorable currency effects, contributed to this increase in the cash balance.\n\nIn conclusion, the changes in net cash from operating, investing, and financing activities from 2019 to 2020 resulted in an overall increase in the cash balance at the end of 2020 compared to 2019 [image4]."}

This decline was primarily due to lower revenue, higher provision for credit losses, and higher expenses. Specifically, net interest income saw a decrease of $3.5 billion to $24.7 billion, mainly because of lower rates, although this was partially offset by higher deposit and loan balances [2]. Noninterest income also fell by $1.9 billion to $8.6 billion, driven by a decline in service charges and lower card income due to decreased client activity [2].\n\nIn contrast, GWIM, which includes Merrill Lynch Global Wealth Management (MLGWM) and Bank of America Private Bank [11], experienced changes that were less severe but still reflected challenging conditions.

Comparatively, in 2019, the company recorded a credit of $36 million due to the sale of its manufacturing facility in Greenock, Scotland [9].\n\nThe financial impact of these restructuring activities can be observed in the operating profit as well. In 2020, the restructuring charges contributed to a reduction in operating profit.

In 2018, the comprehensive income was $2,005 million, while in 2019 it was $2,731 million, and by 2020 it had risen sharply to $6,346 million [6]. The primary factors contributing to this substantial change can be attributed to several key areas:\n\nFirstly, the foreign currency translation adjustments played a crucial role. In 2018, Danaher recorded a loss of $632 million due to these adjustments. However, this turned around dramatically in 2020 with a gain of $2,918 million, compared to a minor loss of $75 million in 2019 ![Foreign currency translation adjustments showed significant improvement in 2020](image5).\n\nSecondly, the net earnings also contributed positively to the comprehensive income. Net earnings increased from $2,651 million in 2018 to $3,008 million in 2019, and further to $3,646 million in 2020 [6]. This growth in net earnings is partly due to the acquisition of Cytiva and the subsequent increase in sales and operational efficiency [12].\n\nAdditionally, the pension and postretirement plan benefit adjustments impacted the comprehensive income. Although there were losses in all three years, the magnitude of the loss decreased over time. Specifically, the loss was $13 million in 2018, $90 million in 2019, and $147 million in 2020. Despite being a negative factor, the relative stability in these figures indicates that they did not significantly alter the overall trend ![Pension and postretirement plan benefit adjustments showed relatively stable losses](image5).\n\nLastly, the cash flow hedge adjustments also influenced the comprehensive income. These adjustments resulted in a loss of $113 million in 2019 but improved to a smaller loss of $72 million in 2020, while no adjustment was reported for 2018 ![Cash flow hedge adjustments improved in 2020](image5).\n\nIn summary, the comprehensive income of Danaher Corporation increased substantially from 2018 to 2020 primarily due to significant gains in foreign currency translation adjustments and growing net earnings, along with more stable pension and postretirement plan benefit adjustments and improved cash flow hedge adjustments."}

These projects were mostly implemented through external agencies rather than directly by the company, indicating a reliance on specialized organizations to manage these initiatives.\n\nOn the other hand, for COVID Relief projects, the table in `![{The table provides information about various projects with details including the serial number, name of the project, item category from the list of activities in schedule VII of the Act, whether the project is in a local area, location details, amount spent on the project, mode of implementation (direct or through implementing agencies), and CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility) registration numbers.}](image7)` indicates that a significant amount, up to ₹24.73 crore, was spent on a PAN India COVID relief project. Smaller amounts were also allocated to state-specific projects. Interestingly, some of these projects were implemented directly, while others were managed through implementing agencies such as Setu Charitable Trust and National Health and Education Society.\n\nThe key differences in project implementation modes are evident:\n- **Rural Development Projects**: Mostly implemented indirectly through external agencies, emphasizing expertise in specific regions.\n- **COVID Relief Projects**: A mix of direct and indirect implementations, reflecting the urgency and diverse needs during the pandemic.\n\nIn conclusion, while both types of projects involve substantial financial commitments, rural development projects tend to rely more heavily on external agencies for implementation, whereas COVID relief projects show a balance between direct and indirect methods."}

Actuarial assumptions, such as discount rates, compensation increases, and pension progression, significantly influence the valuation of these obligations.\n\nFirstly, the discount rate, a critical assumption for calculating the present value of future benefits, saw an increase from 1.5% in 2020 to 1.7% in 2021 for the overall average [2]. This change would generally reduce the DBO because higher discount rates lower the present value of future liabilities. However, the actual effect can be complex due to other factors.\n\nCompensation increases also varied. For instance, in the United Kingdom, the compensation increase rose from 2.6% in 2020 to 3.0% in 2021 ![{compensation increases and pension progression rates for selected countries over two years}](image3). An increase in expected compensation can lead to a higher DBO as it implies greater future payments. Similarly, pension progression rates increased in the UK from 2.6% to 3.0%, further raising the DBO.\n\nThe sensitivity analysis reveals that a decrease in the discount rate by half a percentage point would increase the DBO by €271 million as of September 30, 2021, while an increase would decrease it by €242 million ![{effects of changing assumptions on the DBO}](image7). This underscores the significant impact of even small changes in discount rates.\n\nPlan assets were also affected by these changes. The fair value of plan assets increased from €271 million in 2020 to €289 million in 2021 ![{financial data related to defined benefit plans across different fiscal years}](image1). This improvement in asset value helps offset some of the increased liabilities resulting from more optimistic assumptions about future obligations.\n\nOverall, changes in actuarial assumptions led to both an increase in the defined benefit obligation and an improvement in plan assets from 2020 to 2021. The net effect on the funded status of the pension plans would depend on the relative magnitude of these changes. \n\nIn summary, changes in actuarial assumptions impacted the defined benefit obligation and plan assets by increasing the DBO and improving plan asset values from 2020 to 2021."}

Specifically, the RWA increased under both the Standardized and Advanced Approaches due to several factors.\n\nCredit risk RWA saw an increase of $44,382 million under the Standardized Approach and $56,003 million under the Advanced Approach [3]. This was primarily driven by increases in Derivatives exposures and Investment securities, along with higher market volatility and the E*TRADE acquisition [12].\n\nMarket risk RWA also rose significantly by $14,547 million under the Standardized Approach and $14,443 million under the Advanced Approach [3]. The rise was mainly due to an increase in Regulatory VaR, reflecting higher market volatility [8].\n\nOperational risk RWA decreased by $7,791 million under the Advanced Approach, attributed to a decline in the frequency and severity of litigation-related losses [1] and [3].\n\nDespite these changes, the External TLAC as a percentage of RWA decreased from 49.9% at December 31, 2019, to 47.7% at December 31, 2020 ![External TLAC percentages for RWA decreased slightly from 2019 to 2020](image7).

Franchised revenues also fell by 14%, from $5,062 million in 2019 to $4,348 million in 2020. These declines were primarily driven by temporary restaurant closures and limited operations in key markets such as the U.K., France, Germany, Italy, and Spain [12].\n\nFurthermore, the bar chart illustrating restaurant margins by type [image1] shows that both franchised and company-operated margins in the International Operated Markets declined sharply.

The sale of Wells Fargo Asset Management (WFAM) on November 1, 2021, led to a substantial decrease in the assets under management [7]. Specifically, the balance of WFAM assets started at $603.0 billion at the beginning of 2021, but due to outflows and the sale, it ended at only $587.1 billion lower by the end of the year ![Sale impact on WFAM AUM](image5).\n\nThis reduction in assets under management directly influenced several aspects of Wells Fargo's balance sheet. For instance, total deposits decreased as actions were taken to manage under the asset cap [2]. This aligns with the observed decline in available-for-sale debt securities, which is part of the portfolio rebalancing efforts to manage liquidity and interest rate risk [11]. Additionally, the sale of WFAM contributed to a decline in loans, particularly from the divestiture of certain portfolios [12].\n\nFurthermore, the transition services agreement for Institutional Retirement and Trust (IRT) client assets, amounting to $19 billion in AUM and $582 billion in AUA, continued until June 2022 [3]. This indicates that while the immediate impact of the WFAM sale was a sharp reduction in AUM, Wells Fargo still managed some of these assets temporarily, which helped mitigate the immediate financial impact.\n\nIn summary, the changes in 'Total WFAM assets under management' significantly reduced Wells Fargo's balance sheet figures for 2021 compared to previous years, primarily through decreases in deposits, available-for-sale debt securities, and loans."}

Net interest income for 2020 was $27.6bn, a decrease of $2.9bn or 9.5% compared with 2019 [9]. This decline was primarily due to lower average market interest rates across major currencies, which reduced the yield on average interest-earning assets (AIEA). Despite this, there was some offset from interest income associated with an increase in AIEA by $170.1bn or 8.8% [9].\n\nInterest expense also saw a substantial reduction. In the fourth quarter of 2020, it was $2.7bn, down $2.9bn year-on-year [11]. The annual interest expense decreased from $14.2bn in 2019 to $14.2bn in 2020, reflecting the impact of lower market interest rates, partly offset by growth in interest-bearing customer accounts [11]. This reduction in interest expense helped mitigate the negative effect on NII.\n\n![Net Interest Income and Interest Expense data comparison between 2019 and 2020](image1)\n\nThese changes had a direct impact on the net operating income. The reported profit before tax for 2020 was $8.8bn, representing a 34% decrease from 2019 [1]. Adjusted profit before tax was $12.1bn, a 45% decrease [1]. The fall in reported profit was mainly attributed to increased expected credit losses and other credit impairment charges (ECL), along with a reduction in reported revenue [1]. Lower NII contributed to these reductions, affecting overall profitability.\n\nAdditionally, the return on average tangible equity (RoTE) for 2020 was 3.1%, falling short of the previously targeted range of 10% to 12% for 2022 [1]. The significant changes in the operating environment during 2020 made it challenging to achieve these financial goals, further highlighting the impact of the changes in NII and interest expense on profitability.\n\nIn summary, the decrease in net interest income and the reduction in interest expense from 2019 to 2020 negatively impacted the net operating income and overall profitability of the organization."}

Let's delve into the details.\n\nFirstly, net investment income decreased by 5.0% from $5,039 million in 2020 to $4,807 million in 2021 [6]. This decline was primarily due to a significant drop in interest and other investment income, which fell by 44.4% from $1,059 million in 2020 to $589 million in 2021 [6]. The decrease in interest income is attributed to lower income from short-term investments and fixed maturity securities as short-term interest rates remained low throughout 2021 ![low interest rates led to significantly lower interest income](image6).\n\nOn the other hand, railroad operating earnings increased by 15.7% from $6.8 billion in 2020 to $7.9 billion in 2021 [5]. This growth can be attributed to several factors. Railroad operating revenues rose by 11.6%, driven by higher volumes of 6.9% and a 3.5% increase in average revenue per car/unit [5]. The volume increase was due to continued improvements following the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, although there were ongoing disruptions in the global supply chain [5]. Additionally, the improvement in earnings reflected overall higher freight volumes, higher average revenue per car/unit, and improved productivity, partly offset by higher average fuel prices and volume-related costs [6].\n\nIn summary, while net investment income declined due to low interest rates affecting short-term investments, railroad operating earnings saw an increase thanks to higher freight volumes and better productivity, despite challenges like higher fuel prices."}

In 2020, the operating lease ROU assets increased from $764 million in 2019 to $942 million in 2020. This increase reflects the company's expansion in leasing activities or acquisitions [image4].

Work in process and raw materials also showed increases, moving from $285 million to $369 million and from $510 million to $691 million, respectively. These increases suggest higher production levels or anticipation of increased sales demand [image6].\n\nThese changes in lease assets and inventories are reflected in the financial statements as follows: Higher lease assets and liabilities imply greater financing and operational commitments, impacting cash flow management and financial leverage. Increased inventories can affect cost of sales and working capital requirements. For instance, the cost of sales in 2020 was significantly impacted by acquisition-related charges associated with fair value adjustments to inventory, which increased costs by $457 million [2]. Moreover, the rise in inventories contributed to the use of operating cash flows, totaling $160 million in 2020 compared to $161 million in 2019 [3].\n\nIn summary, the differences in lease assets and inventories between 2019 and 2020 reflect strategic business growth and operational adjustments, which in turn influence various aspects of the company's financial performance and cash flow management."}

The table in `![{This table outlines changes in reserves and related costs across the specified periods}](image4)` provides a comprehensive view of the restructuring reserves and costs over the three years.\n\n### Breakdown of Restructuring Costs\n\n#### June 30, 2020:\n- **Reserve:** $472$\n- **Cost Incurred and Charged to Expense:** $330$\n- **Cost Paid/Settled:** $(524)$\n- **Ending Reserve:** $278$\n\n#### June 30, 2021:\n- **Reserve:** $278$\n- **Cost Incurred and Charged to Expense:** $253$\n- **Cost Paid/Settled:** $(384)$\n- **Ending Reserve:** $147$\n\n#### June 30, 2022:\n- **Reserve:** $147$\n- **Cost Incurred and Charged to Expense:** $253$\n- **Cost Paid/Settled:** $(384)$\n- **Ending Reserve:** $147$\n\nThe reserve balances indicate the amount set aside for future restructuring activities, while the cost incurred and charged to expense shows the actual costs recognized each year. The cost paid/settled reflects the cash outflows related to these restructuring activities.\n\n### Main Components of Restructuring Costs\nThe main components of restructuring costs as described in the text include:\n- **Employee Separation Costs:** Severance packages based on salary levels and past service periods [5].\n- **Asset-Related Costs:** Write-downs and accelerated depreciation for assets held-for-sale or disposal [5].\n- **Other Costs:** Including asset removal and termination of contracts related to supply chain and overhead optimization [5].\n\nFrom the table in `![{This table outlines changes in reserves and related costs across the specified periods}](image4)`, we can see that the cost incurred and charged to expense decreased from $\\S330$ million in 2020 to $\\S253$ million in 2022. This reduction indicates a decrease in restructuring activities or possibly more efficient management of these costs.\n\nIn conclusion, the total restructuring costs decreased from $\\S330$ million in 2020 to $\\S253$ million in 2022, with the main components being employee separation costs, asset-related costs, and other restructuring-type charges."}

According to the table detailing shareholdings over the period [image3], S Fallscheer held 4,140,000 shares on 1 July 2019 and increased this to 5,827,764 shares by 28 June 2020. This indicates a significant increase of 1,687,764 shares during the year, with no shares sold.\n\nNext, regarding the Long Term Incentive Plans (LTIP), as shown in ![details of LTIP for directors and executives](image1), S Fallscheer had 2,564,103 shares held under the FY19 LTIP, which remained unchanged. Additionally, 956,328 shares were granted under the FY20 LTIP, increasing the total holdings further.\n\nNow, turning to remuneration details, the table in ![remuneration details for board members](image5) breaks down the compensation components. For S Fallscheer, the key points are:\n- **Short Term Employment Benefits**: Increased significantly from $997,500 in 2019 to $1,337,500 in 2020.\n- **Performance-based Payment**: Decreased from $3,500,000 in 2019 to $1,000,000 in 2020.\n- **Post-Employment Benefits**: Remained consistent at $40,000.\n- **Long Term Benefits**: Remained consistent at $0.\n- **Share Based Payments**: Increased from $(133,333) in 2019 to $150,000 in 2020.\n- **Other Benefits**: Remained consistent at $0.\n\nThe overall total remuneration decreased from $4,404,167 in 2019 to $2,447,500 in 2020.\n\nCombining these insights, it is clear that while S Fallscheer's shareholdings increased substantially, reflecting a strong alignment with shareholder interests, the remuneration package saw a reduction primarily due to lower performance-based payments. The increase in shareholdings implies a stronger financial stake in the company, potentially aligning S Fallscheer's interests more closely with those of other shareholders. However, the decrease in total remuneration suggests a challenging financial year for the executive, possibly influenced by the company's overall performance as seen in the financial data [image4].\n\nIn conclusion, S Fallscheer's shareholding increased significantly from FY19 to FY20, enhancing their financial stake in the company, while their total remuneration decreased, indicating a challenging year for the executive."}

In 2019, service costs were RMB 14,967 million (89.3% of total cost of revenues), rising to RMB 17,478 million (88.0%) in 2020, and further to RMB 18,992 million (87.0%) in 2021 [image6]. This indicates that the company continued to invest heavily in content and delivery infrastructure, crucial for supporting both online music services and social entertainment services.\n\nOther cost of revenues also saw an increase, from RMB 1,794 million (10.7%) in 2019 to RMB 2,848 million (13.0%) in 2021 [image6]. These costs primarily include employee benefits, advertising agency fees, and online payment gateway fees [7], suggesting higher operational activities and possibly more aggressive marketing strategies.\n\nOperating expenses, particularly general and administrative expenses, showed a notable rise. In 2019, these expenses were RMB 2,703 million (57.0% of total operating expenses), increasing to RMB 4,009 million (60.0%) in 2021 ![General and administrative expenses grew significantly](image2). This growth can be attributed to higher salaries and benefits for personnel, professional service expenses, and amortization of intangible assets [10].\n\nSelling and marketing expenses also increased but at a slower rate compared to general and administrative expenses. They went from RMB 2,041 million (43.0%) in 2019 to RMB 2,678 million (40.0%) in 2021 ![Marketing expenses increased but proportionally less than administrative expenses](image2). The company focused on managing external promotion channels’ efficiency while utilizing internal traffic to attract users [12].\n\nOverall, the rise in both cost of revenues and operating expenses suggests a strategic investment in expanding the business and improving operational capabilities. However, the proportional increase in general and administrative expenses relative to selling and marketing expenses might indicate a shift towards enhancing internal efficiencies and innovation rather than solely relying on external promotions.\n\nIn conclusion, the company's financial management has prioritized scaling up operations and investing in areas critical for long-term growth, such as content and technology, while also focusing on operational efficiencies."}

Additionally, an image shows a comprehensive table presenting this information specifically for 2019 and 2020 [![{Key observations can be made about the variations in production prices and costs across different regions and the overall trend from 2019 to 2020}](image3)].\n\nFrom the data, it is evident that the average production prices for crude oil and NGL varied significantly between 2018 and 2020. For instance, in the United States, the average production price for crude oil decreased from $69.57 per barrel in 2018 to $60.61 per barrel in 2020 [8]. Similarly, for NGL, the price dropped from $47.10 per barrel in 2018 to $35.85 per barrel in 2020 [8].\n\nIn Europe, the average production price for crude oil also saw a decline, moving from $68.92 per barrel in 2018 to $64.53 per barrel in 2020 [8]. For NGL, the price fell from $39.69 per barrel in 2018 to $38.53 per barrel in 2020 [8].\n\nFor Canada/Other Americas, the average production price for crude oil decreased from $66.89 per barrel in 2018 to $66.93 per barrel in 2020 [8], showing a marginal increase. However, for NGL, there was a significant drop from $36.34 per barrel in 2018 to $30.72 per barrel in 2020 [8].\n\nThese trends indicate that while some regions like Canada/Other Americas saw slight increases or stability in crude oil prices, most regions experienced a general decline in both crude oil and NGL prices from 2018 to 2020.\n\nThe average production prices for crude oil and NGL generally decreased from 2018 to 2020 across different regions."}

The increase in noncurrent assets of $3,039 million [7] suggests that IBM invested more in long-term resources, potentially enhancing its future operational capabilities. Meanwhile, the slight increase in long-term debt from $54,102 million in 2019 to $54,355 million in 2020 [image8] indicates a modest rise in IBM's leverage.\n\nExamining the cash flow data, we see that operating activities provided substantial cash inflows of $18,197 million in 2020, up from $14,770 million in 2019 [image5]. This strong performance in generating cash from operations helped offset the net use of cash in financing activities, which amounted to $9,721 million in 2020 compared to a net source of $9,042 million in 2019 [image5]. The decrease in cash from financing activities can be attributed to lower funding requirements as a result of the decline in financing assets [5].\n\nIn terms of equity, total equity decreased by $258 million from December 31, 2019, primarily due to dividends paid and a decline in accumulated other comprehensive income, partially offset by increases from net income and common stock [6]. Despite this reduction in equity, the stable return on equity for Global Financing remained at 25.8% for both 2020 and 2019 [image3], indicating consistent profitability relative to equity investment.\n\nOverall, while there was an increase in noncurrent assets and a marginal rise in long-term debt, IBM maintained a robust cash flow from operations and a steady return on equity, suggesting that these financial changes did not negatively impact IBM's overall financial standing but rather positioned it for sustained long-term growth ![The table shows a slight increase in long-term debt and a notable increase in noncurrent assets over the year](image8)."}

This decline was primarily due to paydowns outpacing new originations and draws on existing lines. The reduction suggests that consumers were either paying off their debts more aggressively or were less inclined to take on new home equity debt, possibly as a response to economic uncertainties or changes in financial priorities.\n\nFor credit cards, outstandings in the credit card portfolio also saw a substantial decrease of $18.9 billion in 2020 to $78.7 billion [11]. This drop can be attributed to lower retail spending and higher payments made by consumers, likely driven by government stimulus benefits and payment deferrals associated with COVID-19. Additionally, net charge-offs decreased by $599 million to $2.3 billion during 2020 compared to $2.9 billion in 2019 [11], indicating improved credit performance, possibly due to these stimulus measures and reduced borrowing.\n\n![{Outstanding home equity balances declined significantly from 2019 to 2020}](image2)\n\nThese changes in credit card and home equity metrics indicate a shift towards more conservative financial behavior among consumers in 2020.

The sensitivity of BHP's profit after taxation and underlying EBITDA to fluctuations in commodity prices is clearly outlined [4]. For instance, a US$1 per tonne decline in the average iron ore price would have an estimated impact on FY2021 profit after taxation of US$163 million and underlying EBITDA by US$233 million. Similarly, changes in the prices of other commodities like coal and nickel also have substantial effects.\n\nFor coal, the financial performance was notably affected by lower volumes and increased costs. Underlying EBITDA for Coal decreased by US$1.3 billion to US$288 million, with lower prices impacting it by US$0.7 billion [2]. Additionally, controllable cash costs increased by US$102 million due to higher maintenance and stripping volumes at Queensland Coal. This increase in costs, coupled with reduced sales volumes, led to a significant decrease in profitability [2].\n\nThe image data further supports this analysis. ![A US$1 per ton increase in the energy coal price impacts profit after taxation by $9 million and underlying EBITDA by $13 million](image5) provides specific figures on how changes in energy coal prices directly affect BHP's financial metrics. Moreover, the table comparing Queensland Coal and NSWEC shows a clear decline in revenue and EBITDA for both entities, with increases in cost per tonne [8].\n\nRegarding nickel, the average realised sales price for FY2021 increased from US$13,860 per tonne in FY2020 to US$16,250 per tonne [6]. Positive investor sentiment and strong demand, especially driven by multi-region supply disruptions and falling London Metal Exchange stocks, contributed to this rise. Underlying EBITDA for Nickel West increased by US$296 million to US$259 million in FY2021, reflecting higher prices and volumes, and lower maintenance costs [9].\n\nIn summary, changes in commodity prices, particularly for coal and nickel, significantly influence BHP's financial results through their direct impact on revenue, EBITDA, and overall profitability.

This decline was primarily due to lower interest rates, reduced loan balances reflecting soft demand, elevated prepayments and refinancing activity, the sale of the student loan portfolio in the first half of 2021, unfavorable hedge ineffectiveness accounting results, and higher securities premium amortization [7].\n\nOn the other hand, noninterest income saw a substantial increase, rising from $4,916 million in 2020 to $10,036 million in 2021, an increase of $5,120 million or 104% [image2]. This growth in noninterest income can be attributed to higher net gains from equity securities, mortgage banking income, and investment advisory and other asset-based fee income [12]. Additionally, there were significant gains on the sales of certain businesses like the Corporate Trust Services business, student loan portfolio, and WFAM [9]. However, this was partially offset by lower lease income due to a $268 million impairment of certain rail cars used for coal transportation [1] and higher valuation losses related to retained litigation risk [9].\n\nThese changes resulted in a total revenue increase from $5,357 million in 2020 to $8,495 million in 2021, an increase of $3,138 million or 59% [image2].

This ratio indicates the percentage of earnings paid out as dividends to shareholders. According to the financial data presented in image6, which provides a detailed overview of various performance ratios and capital metrics for Wells Fargo:\n\n- In 2019, the Dividend Payout Ratio was 35.8%.\n- In 2020, it significantly decreased to 14.7%.\n- By 2021, it increased slightly to 18.2%.\n\n![{Dividend Payout Ratio trends from 2019 to 2021}](image6)\n\nThis trend suggests that despite an initial sharp decline in 2020, likely due to economic challenges or strategic decisions during the pandemic, the Dividend Payout Ratio saw a moderate recovery in 2021.\n\nNext, regarding the Book Value per common share, which reflects the value attributable to each common share after all liabilities are deducted from total assets, the same image6 shows:\n\n- In 2019, the Book Value per common share was $38.35.\n- In 2020, it dropped to $35.63.\n- By 2021, it rebounded to $41.99.\n\n![{Book Value per common share trends from 2019 to 2021}](image6)\n\nThe Book Value per common share initially decreased in 2020 but showed a strong recovery in 2021, surpassing its 2019 level.\n\nIn conclusion, both the Dividend Payout Ratio and Book Value per common share experienced declines in 2020 but recovered in 2021, with the Book Value even exceeding its 2019 level."}

The decrease in comprehensive income primarily stems from losses on cash flow hedges and available-for-sale securities, as well as foreign currency translation adjustments [3].\n\nFurthermore, the increase in net income from 2018 to 2020, despite an unpredictable year due to the COVID-19 pandemic, indicates resilience in the company's core operations and revenue generation capabilities. However, the drop in comprehensive income highlights challenges in managing risks related to financial instruments and currency fluctuations.\n\nIn conclusion, while Amgen showed stable net income growth, the decline in comprehensive income suggests that the company faced increased volatility in non-operational financial activities during this period."}

The AOCL is influenced by several factors including foreign currency translation, defined benefit plans, cash flow hedges, and investments. According to the provided data [7], the AOCL for fiscal years 2019 and 2020 showed notable shifts. Specifically, the table detailing AOCL ![details on AOCL changes](image7) indicates that the foreign currency translation component had a substantial impact. In 2019, the ending balance for foreign currency translation was significantly different from 2020, likely due to fluctuations in exchange rates affecting the translation of assets and liabilities into U.S. dollars [2]. Additionally, the defined benefit plans section saw actuarial gains and losses that contributed to the overall AOCL. Cash flow hedges also played a role, with reclassification adjustments impacting the AOCL as these gains or losses were eventually recognized in earnings [11].\n\nTurning to property and equipment values, the detailed breakdown ![property and equipment changes](image4) shows an increase in gross property and equipment from $3,347,195 in 2019 to $3,859,299 in 2020. This growth can be attributed to increases in computers, related equipment, and software, which rose from $1,723,623 in 2019 to $1,978,380 in 2020. Leasehold improvements also saw a rise from $1,228,845 in 2019 to $1,424,722 in 2020. However, this was offset somewhat by higher accumulated depreciation, increasing from $(1,956,029) in 2019 to $(2,313,731) in 2020. Consequently, the net property and equipment value grew from $1,391,166 in 2019 to $1,545,568 in 2020.\n\nIn conclusion, both the accumulated other comprehensive loss and property and equipment values increased from fiscal year 2019 to 2020, driven by factors such as foreign currency translations, actuarial gains and losses, and capital investments in technology and leasehold improvements."}

Brokerage sweep deposits grew from $121,077 million in 2019 to $232,071 million in 2020, contributing significantly to the overall increase in total deposits [3]. Additionally, there was an increase in savings and other deposits from $28,388 million in 2019 to $47,150 million in 2020.

In 2019 and 2020, Danaher issued Series A and Series B Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock (MCPS). The proceeds from these issuances were approximately $3.0 billion in 2019 and approximately $1.67 billion in 2020 [4]. This capital injection directly increased the company's equity, specifically under preferred stock. As shown in the balance sheet, preferred stock increased from $1,600 million in 2019 to $3,268 million in 2020 ![Preferred stock increase due to MCPS issuance](image2).\n\nNext, we look at the changes in cash flows from financing activities. According to the statement of cash flows, Danaher had significant cash inflows from financing activities in 2020, totaling $1,006 million [8]. This positive cash flow was primarily driven by proceeds from stock issuance and public offerings, which included the aforementioned mandatory convertible preferred stock offerings. Additionally, there were substantial borrowings that contributed to this positive cash flow [8].\n\nThese financing activities not only bolstered the company’s liquidity but also affected its equity structure. The additional paid-in capital increased significantly from $7,565 million in 2019 to $9,698 million in 2020, reflecting the impact of the stock issuances [2]. Retained earnings also grew from $24,166 million in 2019 to $27,159 million in 2020, partly due to net earnings reinvested back into the business [2].\n\nFurthermore, the comprehensive income, which includes net earnings and other comprehensive income, surged from $2,731 million in 2019 to $6,346 million in 2020 [4]. This growth in comprehensive income positively influenced the total stockholders' equity, as it accumulated in retained earnings and other comprehensive income components [7].\n\nIn summary, the issuance of mandatory convertible preferred stock and the positive cash flow from financing activities led to a notable increase in Danaher Corporation's total stockholders' equity from 2018 to 2020, with preferred stock, additional paid-in capital, and retained earnings all showing significant growth during this period."}

This increase can be attributed to several factors:\n\nFirstly, the company saw an improvement in its operational performance across various segments. For instance, the Media segment revenue increased by 20.3% to $22.8 billion, despite the Adjusted EBITDA decreasing by 18.0% to $4.6 billion due to the Tokyo Olympics broadcast costs in 2021 [2]. Excluding the Olympic-related revenue, the segment still showed a solid growth of 11.0%.\n\nAdditionally, the Theme Parks segment experienced a substantial recovery with revenue increasing by 141.2% to $5.1 billion and Adjusted EBITDA improving from $(0.5) billion to $1.3 billion [2]. This recovery was driven by the reopening of theme parks that were previously closed or restricted due to COVID-19.\n\nFurthermore, there was a decrease in income tax payments in 2021 by $1.3 billion compared to the previous year, primarily due to tax deductions from the senior notes exchange [4]. This reduction in tax payments significantly contributed to the higher net cash provided by operating activities.\n\nAnother contributing factor is the changes in operating assets and liabilities. The decrease in 2021 compared to 2020 was mainly related to the timing of amortization and payments for film and television costs, as well as an increased number of sporting events in 2021 [9].\n\nLastly, the company's capital expenditures increased by 4.9% to $6.9 billion, reflecting investments in scalable infrastructure and line extensions, which are crucial for long-term growth [11]. However, this increase in capital spending did not negatively impact the overall cash flow as it was offset by improvements in other areas.\n\nIn summary, the net cash provided by operating activities increased by $4,409 million from 2020 to 2021 due to improved segment performances, decreased tax payments, and strategic management of operating assets and liabilities [6]."}

Additionally, higher earnings from CPChem, a 50 percent-owned affiliate, added $1.0 billion [2]. Increased sales volumes also positively impacted earnings by $470 million [2]. However, these gains were partially offset by higher operating expenses, which increased by $150 million [2].\n\nTo provide context on the magnitude of this turnaround, we can see from the financial data that the U.S. downstream segment's performance improved dramatically.

Additionally, image2 provides a list of subsidiaries with varying shareholdings, including some with 66% ownership, which aligns with TCS Japan Ltd's updated holding.\n\nTherefore, before the increase, **TCS Japan Ltd** had the lowest percentage of shares held at 51%.\n\n![{TCS Japan Ltd had an initial holding of 51% which was later increased to 66%.}](image2) \n\nThus, the subsidiary with the lowest percentage of shares held was TCS Japan Ltd at 51% before the increase."}
{"q_id": 805, "model": "qwen-plus", "in_tok": 3550, "out_tok": 401, "total_tok": 3951, "response": "The exercisable percentage of incentives is directly tied to the EBIT growth achieved over the performance period. According to the provided information, the Board sets specific EBIT growth hurdles that must be met for any portion of the Performance Options or Rights to vest and become exercisable [3]. For example, the threshold EPS target is set at 10% compound growth over a three-year period, and the stretch target is 20% compound growth [3].\n\nTo illustrate this further, let's consider the performance-based incentive structure detailed in the images. The table shown in `![{the relationship between EBIT growth and the percentage of an award that is exercisable}](image4)` outlines how different levels of EBIT growth translate into varying percentages of exercisable awards. Specifically:\n\n- If the EBIT growth is less than the threshold, no incentives are awarded (Nil).\n- At 17.5% compound growth in EBIT, 40% of the incentives are awarded.\n- At 20% compound growth, 60% of the incentives are awarded.\n- At 22.5% compound growth, 80% of the incentives are awarded.\n- At 25% compound growth, 100% of the incentives are awarded.\n\nThis means that if the company achieves higher EBIT growth, a larger percentage of the granted options or rights will vest and become exercisable by the recipients. Conversely, if the company fails to meet the minimum threshold, none of the options will vest, as seen in the case where the actual compound annual growth rate in EPS was only 3%, leading to all options lapsing unvested [4].\n\nTherefore, EBIT growth significantly affects the exercisable percentage of incentives over the performance period by determining whether and to what extent the performance conditions are met, thereby impacting the vesting of Performance Options or Rights. In summary, achieving higher EBIT growth results in a greater percentage of incentives becoming exercisable."}

In 2020, the company reported a net loss of $5,561 million, which turned into a net income of $15,689 million in 2021 [4]. This turnaround was driven by several factors.\n\nFirstly, the upstream sector played a crucial role in this transformation. U.S. upstream earnings surged from a loss of $1.6 billion in 2020 to a profit of $7.3 billion in 2021, mainly due to higher realizations of $6.9 billion, the absence of impairments and write-offs that amounted to $1.2 billion in 2020, increased sales volumes of $760 million, and gains from asset sales of $640 million [1]. Similarly, international upstream operations also saw a dramatic shift from a loss of $825 million in 2020 to earnings of $8.5 billion in 2021, attributed primarily to higher realizations of $7.6 billion and the absence of impairments and write-offs that totaled $3.6 billion in 2020 [10].\n\nDownstream operations also contributed positively. U.S. downstream swung from a loss of $571 million in 2020 to earnings of $2.4 billion in 2021, largely because of higher margins on refined product sales of $1.6 billion and improved earnings from CPChem [8]. However, international downstream faced a slight decrease in earnings from $618 million in 2020 to $525 million in 2021, mainly due to lower margins on refined product sales and higher operating expenses [3].\n\nThe consolidated cash flow data further supports these improvements. Net cash provided by operating activities increased from $10,577 million in 2020 to $29,187 million in 2021 ![Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities significantly increased](image1). Despite higher cash outflows for investing activities, the overall financial health of the company strengthened as indicated by the net change in cash, which moved from a decrease of $174 million in 2020 to an increase of $58 million in 2021.\n\nComprehensive income also reflected this robust recovery. It shifted from a comprehensive loss of $1,756 million in 2020 to a comprehensive income of $17,412 million in 2021 [8]. The primary contributors to this increase included not only the net income but also positive adjustments in currency translation, unrealized holding gains on securities, and other comprehensive gains, net of tax.\n\nIn summary, Chevron Corporation's net income and comprehensive income changed dramatically from 2020 to 2021 due to improved operational efficiencies, higher realizations, and the absence of significant impairments and write-offs."}

In 2022, net cash used in financing activities totaled $4,283$ million [3], compared to $6,488$ million in 2021. The decrease in cash used in financing activities can be attributed to several factors. Notably, there were payments of dividends and repurchases of common stock, as well as repayments of Senior Notes and withholding taxes on stock awards.\n\nTo understand this change more comprehensively, we should also consider the overall financial context.

This trend can be observed in the financial data provided in the table ![operating profit margins fluctuated between 2018 and 2020](image7).\n\nThe initial increase in operating profit margin from 2018 to 2019 can be attributed to several factors such as higher core sales volumes, lower overall spending levels on business travel due to the pandemic, cost savings from productivity improvement initiatives, and favorable foreign currency exchange rates [7]. However, this margin declined slightly in 2020 compared to 2019, despite continued strong performance in core sales growth, including contributions from acquisitions like Cytiva [6].\n\nThe slight decrease in operating profit margin in 2020 might be due to incremental amortization charges related to acquisitions, particularly Cytiva, and impairment charges that adversely impacted the margin by approximately 160 basis points [1]. Additionally, ongoing investments in sales and marketing growth initiatives also contributed to this decline [1].\n\nOverall, the operating profit as a percentage of sales indicated an improvement from 2018 to 2019 but faced minor challenges in 2020, leading to a marginal decrease. Despite this, the company maintained a robust operating profit margin, reflecting its strong operational efficiency and strategic initiatives.\n\nIn conclusion, the operating profit as a percentage of sales improved from 19.0% in 2018 to 20.2% in 2019 but slightly decreased to 19.4% in 2020, indicating both progress and challenges in maintaining margins during significant business transformations and market conditions."}

This significant rise can be attributed to several key factors detailed in the financial statements.\n\nFirstly, the operating profit for 2021 was $6.878 billion, which is a substantial increase from $4.553 billion in 2020 [2]. This growth in operating profit was primarily driven by higher sales volume and favorable price realization. Additionally, there were gains from Financial Products, lower restructuring expenses, and positive impacts from foreign currency exchange [5].\n\nSecondly, other income/expense significantly improved from an expense of $44 million in 2020 to an income of $1.814 billion in 2021 [3]. This change was mainly due to mark-to-market gains for remeasurement of pension and other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans in 2021, contrasting with mark-to-market losses in 2020.\n\nFurthermore, the effective tax rate decreased from 27.8 percent in 2020 to 22.9 percent in 2021 [3]. The decrease was related to changes in the geographic mix of profits from a tax perspective. Notably, there was also a tax charge of $833 million related to pension and OPEB mark-to-market gains in 2021, compared to a tax benefit of $82 million related to mark-to-market losses in 2020 [3].\n\nLastly, the cash flow from operating activities increased substantially from $4.05 billion in 2020 to $7.181 billion in 2021 [11], reflecting higher profit adjusted for non-cash items and lower payments for short-term incentive compensation.\n\n![Comprehensive income details are provided for 2021, showing significant components like foreign currency translation adjustments and pension benefits](image6)\n\nIn conclusion, the comprehensive income attributable to shareholders increased from 2020 to 2021 due to higher operating profits, significant improvements in other income, a lower effective tax rate, and better cash flow from operations."}

Only 1,025 females availed parental leave compared to 2,023 males. This discrepancy could be influenced by various factors such as societal norms or personal choices. Importantly, the return rate after availing parental leave is higher among females (94%) than males (96%), indicating a strong commitment from women to rejoin the workforce post-leave.\n\nFurthermore, when examining the retention rates one year after returning from parental leave, only 6% of females were still employed, compared to 4% of males. This suggests that while women return to work at a slightly lower rate, those who do return tend to stay longer in their roles. These statistics highlight the challenges faced by women in balancing career and family responsibilities.\n\nTo address these issues, HDFC Bank has implemented several initiatives aimed at supporting women in the workplace [5]. For instance, the Careers 2.0 program provides a platform for skilled women professionals to transition back to work after taking breaks due to personal reasons.

Let's delve into each category:\n\n### Operating Activities\nIn 2020, IBM generated $18,197 million from operating activities, an increase of $3,426 million compared to 2019 [10]. This substantial rise was primarily driven by a reduction in financing receivables due to sales of receivables, including sales of financing receivables of $3,076 million [1]. Additionally, payroll tax and value-added tax payment deferrals and exemptions contributed approximately $600 million due to tax relief under the U.S. CARES Act and other non-U.S. government assistance programs related to COVID-19 [1].\n\n### Investing Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities decreased significantly from $(26,936) million in 2019 to $(3,028) million in 2020, marking a decrease of $23,908 million [6]. This decrease can be attributed to a few key factors: a decrease in net cash used for acquisitions of $32,294 million due to the Red Hat acquisition in the prior year; a decrease of $6,245 million in cash provided by net non-operating finance receivables primarily driven by the wind down of the OEM IT commercial financing operations; and an increase in cash used for net purchases of marketable securities and other investments of $896 million [9].\n\n### Financing Activities\nFinancing activities were a net use of cash of $9,721 million in 2020, compared to a net source of cash of $9,042 million in 2019, resulting in a year-to-year change of $18,763 million [2]. The shift was largely influenced by early retirements and debt maturities totaling $11,267 million, partially offset by issuances of $8,982 million [11]. Additionally, dividends paid amounted to $5,797 million [3], reflecting IBM's commitment to returning capital to shareholders despite suspending its share repurchase program.\n\n### Overall Impact on Cash Flow\nCombining these changes, the net effect on cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash was an increase from $(3,290) million in 2019 to $5,361 million in 2020 ![{net change in cash improved significantly from a negative position in 2019 to a positive one in 2020}](image1).

The Media segment benefited from the reorganized operating structure that combined NBCUniversal’s television networks with Peacock, leading to enhanced content creation and distribution [2].\n\nAdditionally, the Cable Communications segment saw an increase in revenue, primarily due to higher broadband, wireless, business services, advertising, video, and other revenue, although this was partially offset by a decrease in voice revenue [11]. This is further supported by the financial data showing a modest 0.7% increase in revenue for the Cable Communications segment from 2020 to 2021 ![The table shows overall revenue growth for Comcast from 2019 to 2021](image1).\n\nMoreover, the Sky segment contributed significantly to the revenue increase, growing by 11.4% from 2020 to 2021, which can be attributed to increases in direct network costs and other expenses [11].

By 2020, this figure increased to $4,973 million, or 24.0% of the income before taxes [7].

This decline was influenced by several major factors.\n\nFirstly, the decrease in interest income was a significant contributor. Interest income fell from $8,199 million in 2020 to $7,391 million in 2021 [image6], primarily due to lower revolving Card Member loan balances as customers paid down their debts more quickly [5]. Higher paydown rates on revolving loan balances directly impacted the interest yield, reducing the overall interest income generated from these loans.\n\nAdditionally, provisions for credit losses decreased significantly, resulting in a net benefit due to a $2.5 billion reserve release in 2021 compared to a reserve build in the prior year [2]. This improvement in portfolio quality and macroeconomic outlook allowed for fewer provisions, which indirectly supported the stability of the net interest yield despite the overall decline in interest income.\n\nInterest expense also played a role; it decreased from $1,054 million in 2020 to $717 million in 2021 [image6], partially offsetting the reduction in interest income. However, this decrease was not sufficient to fully counterbalance the impact of lower interest yields driven by higher paydown rates on revolving loans [7].\n\n![{Net interest yield decreased slightly from 2019 to 2021 due to lower interest income and higher paydown rates}](image2)\n\nIn summary, the net interest yield on average Card Member loans declined from 11.1% in 2019 to 10.7% in 2021, primarily due to lower interest income caused by higher paydown rates on revolving loan balances."}

However, there was a dramatic increase in 2020, with approximately $21.2 billion used in investing activities [11].\n\nThis substantial change in 2020 can primarily be attributed to the cash paid for acquisitions, most notably the Cytiva Acquisition. The financial statements highlight that the primary reason for the increased net cash used in investing activities during 2020 compared to 2019 was due to the acquisition costs, which amounted to $20.971 billion in 2020 [8]. This is further supported by the detailed breakdown of cash flows from investing activities, which indicates that the cash paid for acquisitions was significantly higher in 2020 compared to previous years ![Cash paid for acquisitions was significantly higher in 2020](image8).\n\nTherefore, the major contributing factor for the change in 2020 was the large expenditure on acquisitions, particularly the Cytiva Acquisition."}

This change can be attributed to higher volatility in foreign currency markets during 2020, likely influenced by the global economic uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic [3]. Additionally, the average impact rose from $20 million in 2019 to $78 million in 2020, with the high impact increasing from $24 million to $136 million, and the low impact moving from $18 million to $54 million. These figures indicate a more volatile environment for foreign currency rates in 2020 ![{The table shows significant increases in both average and peak impacts of foreign currency rate changes in 2020 compared to 2019}](image3).\n\nRegarding interest rates, the fair value impact at year-end decreased from $301 million in 2019 to $180 million in 2020. However, this reduction does not fully reflect the overall volatility experienced during the year. The average impact was much higher in 2020 at $445 million compared to $247 million in 2019.

As of December 31, 2019, the ACL stood at $533 million [8]. By the end of 2020, this figure had risen sharply to $1,130 million [7]. This substantial rise was primarily driven by several key factors.\n\nFirstly, the adoption of the Current Expected Credit Loss (CECL) methodology in 2020 contributed to an initial increase in the allowance for credit losses. The CECL adoption resulted in an immediate increase of $131 million in the allowance for credit losses on January 1, 2020 [5], which set the stage for further adjustments throughout the year.\n\nSecondly, the economic impact of COVID-19 played a critical role. The provision for credit losses within the Institutional Securities business segment increased due to actual and forecasted changes in asset quality trends, as well as risks related to uncertainty in the outlook for sectors like commercial real estate and corporate loans [2]. These sectors faced heightened risks during the pandemic, leading to higher provisions for potential losses.\n\nAdditionally, gross charge-offs also influenced the ACL. In 2020, gross charge-offs amounted to $103 million, partially offset by recoveries of $8 million [image5]. Despite these recoveries, the net effect still added to the overall increase in ACL.\n\nFurthermore, the provision for credit losses surged by $733 million in 2020, significantly contributing to the higher ACL balance [image5]. This provision was necessary to account for the deteriorating economic conditions and the anticipated impact on loan performance.\n\nTo visualize the change in ACL over the period, consider the breakdown shown in the table [image5]. It clearly illustrates the starting balance of $590 million on December 31, 2019, and the ending balance of $1,231 million on December 31, 2020, with detailed adjustments including the CECL adoption, charge-offs, and provisions.\n\nIn summary, the ACL increased from $533 million in 2019 to $1,130 million in 2020, primarily due to the adoption of CECL, the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and increased provisions for credit losses [image5]."}

This commitment is reinforced by Bank of America's participation in various global alliances focused on sustainable development, such as the U.N. Global Investors for Sustainable Development and the World Economic Forum Net-Zero Transition Finance Committee [1].\n\nTo manage these commitments effectively, Bank of America has established robust governance frameworks. The Climate Risk Steering Council oversees climate risk management practices, ensuring that the bank aligns with its Risk Framework and meets monthly to address climate-related risks [3]. Additionally, the bank has launched a TCFD report and set targets aligned with the Paris Agreement, demonstrating its dedication to transparency and accountability ![The table outlines Bank of America's commitment to the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) and its efforts to reach net-zero GHG emissions by 2050](image1).\n\nIn terms of specific actions, Bank of America has made significant strides in reducing its environmental footprint. Since 2010, the bank has reduced its GHG emissions across Scopes 1, 2, and 3, including location-based and market-based emissions, purchased goods, capital goods, and employee commuting [1]. Moreover, the societal impact of these emissions was estimated at $238 million in 2019 based on the EPA's social cost of carbon [1].\n\nRegarding air pollution, Bank of America reported its 2019 emissions, which included sulfur oxides (SOx), nitrogen oxides (NOx), carbon monoxide (CO), volatile organic compounds (VOC), and particulate matter. These emissions were valued at an estimated impact of $146,000 based on social cost factors from the World Resources Institute’s assessment tool ![The image details Bank of America's 2019 emissions and their estimated societal impact](image3).\n\nThese initiatives not only mitigate the bank's operational impacts but also contribute positively to society by promoting cleaner air and reducing the overall carbon footprint.

It considers instantaneous parallel and non-parallel shocks to the market-based forward curve, indicating that the bank periodically reviews these scenarios to ensure they remain relevant in the current rate environment.\n\nAdditionally, the total risk-adjusted margin increased by 88 basis points in 2020 compared to 2019, partly due to lower promotional rates and lower net credit losses [3]. However, this increase in margin did not fully offset the broader decrease in NII caused by the lower interest rate environment.\n\nIn summary, the trend in Net Interest Income across the quarters of 2020 showed a consistent decline when compared to 2019, primarily due to lower interest rates impacting loan and security earnings."}

This growth can be attributed to several key factors.\n\nFirstly, the net earnings of the company increased significantly over these years. In 2018, the net earnings were $12,382 million, rising to $15,769 million by 2020. This rise in net earnings was driven by an overall increase in total revenues and a corresponding rise in earnings from operations. Specifically, total revenues grew from $226,247 million in 2018 to $257,141 million in 2020, while earnings from operations increased from $17,344 million in 2018 to $22,405 million in 2020 [image5].\n\nAdditionally, the changes in other comprehensive income played a role in shaping the comprehensive income figures. For instance, the total foreign currency translation losses had a notable impact, shifting from a loss of $1,242 million in 2018 to a smaller loss of $983 million in 2020. The unrealized gains on investment securities also contributed positively, moving from a loss of $227 million in 2018 to a gain of $805 million in 2020 [image7].\n\nMoreover, cash flows from operations were robust, increasing from $18.5 billion in 2018 to $22.2 billion in 2020, indicating strong operational performance that supported higher earnings [1]. Furthermore, the company managed its liabilities effectively, as seen in the financial statements showing the structure of assets, liabilities, and equity ![Total liabilities, redeemable noncontrolling interests and equity are detailed in this financial statement](image2).\n\nIn summary, UnitedHealth Group's comprehensive income increased steadily from 2018 to 2020 due to higher net earnings, improved operational cash flows, and favorable adjustments in other comprehensive income components like foreign currency translation and unrealized gains on investments."}

According to the data provided, the starting balance for Allowance for Credit Losses (ACL) as of December 31, 2019, was $590 million. By December 31, 2020, this balance had increased to $1,231 million, which includes an ACL for Loans of $835 million and ACL for Lending commitments of $396 million [1]. This substantial increase in ACL reflects heightened provisions for potential credit losses due to economic uncertainties primarily stemming from the impact of COVID-19 [2].\n\nTo understand the contributing sectors to this change, we can look at the sectors that were under heightened focus due to their sensitivity to the economic environment. These sectors include retail, air travel, upstream energy, lodging and leisure, and healthcare services and systems [1]. The aggregate exposure to these sectors represented less than 10% of the total Institutional Securities business segment lending exposure by December 31, 2020 [1]. Notably, approximately 90% of these exposures were investment grade and/or secured by collateral, indicating a relatively strong quality of loans despite the challenging conditions [7].\n\nAdditionally, the detailed breakdown of financial exposure across various sectors shows changes over the year. For instance, the Financials sector saw an increase from $40,992 million in 2019 to $44,358 million in 2020, while Real estate exposure decreased slightly from $28,348 million in 2019 to $25,484 million in 2020 ![Financial exposure across sectors changed with increases in some areas like Financials and decreases in others like Real estate](image7). \n\nFurthermore, the table presenting loans and lending commitments categorized by credit rating and maturity periods also highlights shifts in exposure.

This significant rise can be attributed to several key factors.\n\nFirstly, income from associated companies saw a dramatic increase of USD 14.7 billion, primarily due to the gain recognized on the divestment of the investment in Roche, amounting to USD 14.6 billion [2]. Additionally, excluding this divestment gain, income from associated companies still increased by USD 110 million, mainly driven by higher income from Roche [12].\n\nSecondly, the Group's equity experienced a notable boost, increasing by USD 11.2 billion to USD 67.8 billion at the end of 2021. This was largely due to a net income of USD 24.0 billion and other contributing factors such as actuarial gains and favorable fair value adjustments on financial instruments [3], [4].\n\nMoreover, operating income improved significantly by 15%, reaching USD 11.689 billion in 2021 compared to USD 10.152 billion in 2020, with a margin increase of 5.8 percentage points [7]. The improvement in operating income was influenced by lower legal settlements, impairments, and amortization, partially offset by unfavorable gross margins and lower sales [7].\n\nLastly, the repurchase of shares also impacted earnings per share. In 2021, Novartis repurchased a total of 30.7 million shares for USD 2.8 billion, which decreased the number of outstanding shares and thus positively affected the earnings per share calculation [10].\n\nTo summarize, the 202% increase in total basic earnings per share from 2020 to 2021 was driven by a combination of substantial gains from divestments, strong net income, improvements in operating income, and strategic share repurchases. \n\n![{Core basic earnings per share increased by 9% from 2020 to 2021}](image1)"}

Non-current assets, particularly intangible assets, saw a substantial increase from DKK 5,835 million in 2019 to DKK 20,657 million in 2020 [image1]. This surge is primarily attributed to the acquisitions of Corvidia Therapeutics Inc. and Emisphere Technologies Inc., which involved the purchase of intangible assets amounting to DKK 16.3 billion [5].\n\nAdditionally, property, plant, and equipment remained relatively stable at DKK 50,269 million in 2020 compared to DKK 50,551 million in 2019 [image1]. However, deferred income tax assets also increased from DKK 4,121 million in 2019 to DKK 5,865 million in 2020 [image1], reflecting adjustments in tax provisions.\n\nRegarding total equity, it grew from DKK 57,593 million in 2019 to DKK 63,325 million in 2020 [image7]. This increase can be attributed to higher retained earnings, which rose from DKK 57,817 million in 2019 to DKK 63,774 million in 2020 [image7]. The rise in retained earnings likely stems from the net profit for the year, which was DKK 42,138 million in 2020, up from DKK 38,951 million in 2019 [image4].\n\nFurthermore, the cash flow statement indicates that despite a decrease in free cash flow from DKK 34.5 billion in 2019 to DKK 28.6 billion in 2020 [5], the company managed to maintain its financial stability through efficient management of operating activities, generating DKK 51,951 million in net cash from these activities in 2020 [image6].\n\nIn summary, the significant increase in non-current assets, especially intangible assets, along with the growth in total equity, strengthened the company's financial position from 2019 to 2020, demonstrating robust capital investment and profitability."}

In 2021, there was a higher repayment of interest-bearing liabilities, mainly due to bond repayments on maturity and early repurchase of hybrid bonds, totaling $(6.0) billion. Additionally, dividends paid increased by $(1.0) billion reflecting the record half-year dividend and higher dividends paid to non-controlling interests driven by higher profits at Escondida [4].\n\nTherefore, the observed trend is an increase in net financing cash outflows from continuing operations in 2021 compared to the previous years, primarily driven by higher debt repayments and increased dividend payouts. \n\n![{Net financing cash outflows increased significantly in 2021}](image3)"}

According to the data presented in the table ![{Net Sales and Non-current Assets for different regions over two years}](image4), there were notable variations across regions.\n\nIn Spain, net sales increased from €3,229 million in 2020 to €4,267 million in 2021, marking a significant rise. Meanwhile, non-current assets slightly increased from €4,449 million to €4,657 million. This indicates robust growth in sales within the domestic market, supported by stable asset investment [12].\n\nFor the Rest of Europe, net sales grew substantially from €10,430 million in 2020 to €14,051 million in 2021, reflecting a strong recovery or expansion in this key market. However, non-current assets saw a slight decrease from €6,068 million to €5,901 million, suggesting that the sales growth was achieved without a proportional increase in fixed assets [12].\n\nIn the Americas, net sales nearly doubled from €2,763 million in 2020 to €4,877 million in 2021, indicating significant market penetration and demand. The non-current assets remained relatively stable at around €2,040 million, implying efficient utilization of existing assets [12].\n\nAsia and the rest of the world experienced an increase in net sales from €3,980 million in 2020 to €4,521 million in 2021. Non-current assets decreased marginally from €1,255 million to €1,215 million, suggesting that the sales growth might be attributed to factors other than new investments in non-current assets [12].\n\nOverall, the increases in net sales across all regions indicate a strong financial performance and market recovery for Inditex Group in 2021 compared to 2020. The stability or slight decline in non-current assets suggests that these sales gains were achieved through operational efficiency rather than substantial new capital investments. \n\nTo conclude, the Inditex Group demonstrated improved financial performance in 2021 with higher net sales across all regions, primarily driven by operational efficiency rather than significant new investments in non-current assets."}

First, there was a notable reduction in costs associated with the Destiny franchise [3]. This is significant because Activision sold the publishing rights for Destiny to Bungie in December 2018, leading to lower ongoing development costs for this particular game series in 2019.\n\nAdditionally, the financial data on product development expenses shows a clear decrease of $103 million from 2018 to 2019, maintaining the same percentage of consolidated net revenues at 15% ![product development expenses decreased](image8). This decrease aligns with the reduced involvement in the Destiny franchise and reflects strategic shifts in resource allocation.\n\nMoreover, there was an increase in the capitalization of development costs, primarily driven by the timing of Blizzard’s game development cycles [3]. Capitalizing more development costs means that some expenses were deferred rather than expensed immediately, further contributing to the observed decrease in reported product development expenses.\n\nIn summary, the main factors contributing to the decrease in product development expenses from 2018 to 2019 were the reduced costs associated with the Destiny franchise and increased capitalization of development costs due to the timing of Blizzard’s game development cycles."}

The issuance of additional shares to the Employee Share Trust in 2020 not only increased the number of shares outstanding but also contributed to an increase in the total value of share capital.\n\nThe impact on the number and value of shares can be further analyzed by looking at the changes in treasury shares. In 2020, after issuing shares to the trust, the company then allocated these shares upon option exercise, resulting in a net effect on treasury shares. Specifically, the net value impact on treasury shares was a reduction of 20,288 thousand AUD in 2020 compared to a reduction of 4,780 thousand AUD in 2019 [8].\n\nThis indicates that while more shares were issued to the Employee Share Trust in 2020, leading to higher share capital, the overall financial impact on treasury shares was more significant due to the larger number and value of shares involved ![Share capital and treasury shares data for 2020 and 2019](image8).\n\nTherefore, the share issue to the Employee Share Trust in 2020 increased both the number of shares issued and their total value compared to 2019."}

This decrease is primarily due to a significant drop in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), which went from $(2,895) million in 2020 to $(2,945) million in 2021 ![{Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) slightly worsened from 2020 to 2021}](image3).\n\nRetained earnings, however, increased from $11,881 million in 2020 to $11,495 million in 2021. Despite this increase, it was not enough to offset the negative impact on total shareholders' equity due to the decline in other comprehensive income ![{Retained Earnings increased but were offset by a decrease in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)}](image3).\n\nOther comprehensive income includes items like net unrealized gains or losses on debt securities and foreign currency translation adjustments.

The increase in retained earnings did not sufficiently counterbalance these losses. \n\nThe changes in shareholders' equity between 2020 and 2021 negatively impacted the company's financial position, especially through the decline in other comprehensive income."}

This region had a net revenue increase of 9.0% from $9,817 million in 2019 to $10,702 million in 2020 [image4].\n\nHowever, the most relevant information comes from image5, which specifically addresses the European Union. It shows the total market size and PMI's shipment volumes within this region. Notably, PMI's shipment volume for cigarettes decreased by 6.3%, while heated tobacco units increased by 57.9%. The overall shipment volume in the European Union changed by -1.9% from 186,888 million units in 2019 to 183,262 million units in 2020 [image5].\n\nGiven these details, the net revenue for the European Union can be inferred from the financial performance and shipment volumes. Image6 further supports this with a breakdown of net revenues showing a significant increase from $3,282 million in 2019 to $3,378 million in 2020, excluding currency impacts [image6].\n\nCombining this information, it appears that the European Union segment experienced a modest increase in net revenue despite some decreases in cigarette shipments, likely driven by higher sales of heated tobacco units and favorable pricing.\n\nTherefore, PMI's net revenue for the European Union in 2020 was approximately $3,378 million ![Net revenue for the European Union increased slightly in 2020](image6)."}

For instance, half of women in STEM jobs say they have experienced at least one form of gender-related discrimination in the workplace [2]. This contrasts sharply with only 19% of men in STEM positions who report similar experiences [10].\n\nThe types of discrimination most commonly reported by women include earning less than a man doing the same job (29%), being treated as if they are not competent because of their gender (29%), experiencing repeated small slights in their workplace (20%), and receiving less support from senior leaders than a man doing the same job (18%) [8]. \n\nThis disparity is even more pronounced for specific groups of women in STEM. Women working in computer jobs, for example, are more likely to experience discrimination, with 74% reporting such experiences compared to 50% of women in STEM overall [6]. Moreover, women in majority-male workplaces face particularly high levels of discrimination, with 78% reporting at least one form of gender-related discrimination, compared to just 43% in majority-female or evenly mixed workplaces ![Women in male-dominated workplaces face more discrimination](image3).\n\nIn contrast, men in STEM jobs report much lower rates of gender-related issues.

After peaking in 1890, the population began a slow decline, dropping to 13,330 by 1900 and continuing to decrease through subsequent decades. By 2000, the population was recorded at 9,403. This decline is linked to broader socio-economic shifts. As farming methods became more mechanized, the scale of farming increased, leading to fewer but larger farms [6]. Consequently, smaller rural communities struggled to maintain their populations as farm consolidation reduced the number of individual farm operations.\n\nAdditionally, the development and reliance on railroads influenced town sustainability. Towns without direct rail connections often faced decline or disappearance [10]. The map highlighting Hamilton County's communities illustrates how transportation routes shaped settlement patterns ![Settlement patterns influenced by transportation](image3).\n\nReligious and ethnic enclaves also played a role in shaping the county's demographics. Ethnic groups such as Germans, Swedes, Danes, and Russian Mennonites settled in specific areas, forming tight-knit communities centered around religious institutions [2]. For instance, St. John’s Lutheran Church in Kronborg remained a focal point for Danish immigrants, preserving cultural heritage [12], as depicted in the image of the church ![St. John’s Lutheran Church in Kronborg](image5).\n\nIn summary, Hamilton County's population trends from 1870 to 2000 were significantly influenced by federal policies like the Homestead Act, advancements in farming technology, changes in transportation infrastructure, and the establishment of ethnic and religious communities."}

This baseline scenario can be visualized as part of the current infrastructure seen in the map highlighting various transportation routes [image1], where the red lines represent Caltrain services.\n\nWhen considering improvements, one scenario involves using Metrolink's used cars. In this case, the peak service increases to 6 trains per hour with 5 cars each, leading to a requirement of 30 train cars [4]. This increase in capacity would likely involve integrating more trains similar to the Metrolink passenger train shown, which consists of white and blue double-decker cars [image2].\n\nElectrification of the trains is another proposed improvement. With this change, the peak service would be 6 trains per hour with 6 cars each, requiring 36 train cars [8]. Electrified trains could significantly enhance efficiency and reduce emissions, potentially transforming scenes like the one depicted in the roadway scene illustration [image3], where traditional road vehicles share space with trains.\n\nExtending platforms to accommodate more cars is yet another scenario. Here, the peak service would be 6 trains per hour with 8 cars each, necessitating 48 train cars [2]. Longer platforms would allow for more passengers per train, improving overall capacity and possibly reducing congestion at stations.\n\nFinally, increasing frequency, potentially with High-Speed Rail (HSR), would result in a peak service of 8 trains per hour with 8 cars each, requiring 64 train cars [8]. This significant increase in capacity would have a substantial impact on the transportation network, as illustrated by the table that outlines various scenarios and their corresponding peak hour train cars [image4].\n\nIn conclusion, the peak hour train car requirement increases progressively from 25 cars under the current service to 64 cars with increased frequency and HSR integration."}

Over the subsequent years, these percentages fluctuated, reflecting changing economic conditions and political climates. By 2019, only 26% of Americans expressed satisfaction with the state of the nation, a substantial decline from earlier decades [2].

From 1997 to 2004, both realized and unrealized portions are depicted, indicating that during these years, a portion of the funds were already generating returns while a substantial part remained as potential future value. Notably, the realized portion generally decreases over time, suggesting that fewer funds reached full realization during this period [1].\n\nStarting from 2005 onwards, all bars are labeled as 100% unrealized, marked as \"Post-bubble vintages.\" This indicates that after the burst of the dot-com bubble, there was a new wave of venture capital investments that had not yet been realized into actual returns. These post-bubble vintages represent a phase where investors were more cautious, leading to a buildup of capital waiting for the right opportunities to materialize [8].\n\nIn summary, the trend depicted in the assembly of NAV for European venture funds by vintage year shows a transition from a mix of realized and unrealized investments before 2005 to a period dominated by unrealized investments afterward, reflecting the impact of the dot-com bubble and subsequent cautious investment strategies."}

According to the bar graph in image3, Rock has an 82% stream share while Pop has a 58% stream share. This substantial difference suggests that Rock music relies more heavily on its existing catalog for streaming activity, whereas Pop music's streaming success may be more driven by current releases [3].\n\nThis trend aligns with the statement that \"ROCK IS DRIVEN BY CATALOG AT ALL FORMATS WHILE POP IS MAINLY DRIVEN BY CURRENT\" [1]. The higher catalog stream share in Rock indicates a strong loyalty and continuous interest in classic and established albums, reflecting the genre's enduring appeal over time. On the other hand, Pop's lower catalog stream share suggests that it thrives on new and trending songs, which are likely to capture immediate attention and drive current popularity.\n\n![{Rock has a higher catalog stream share indicating reliance on classics, while Pop focuses more on current hits}](image3)\n\nIn conclusion, the higher catalog stream share in Rock versus Pop indicates that Rock benefits from its extensive back catalog, while Pop relies more on fresh content to maintain its market presence."}

This indicates a significant disparity between proprietary and open-source models across all categories.\n\nFor specific insights into the 'Human & Social Science' category, let's look at the performance metrics presented in the table shown in the image `![{the table compares models that use text and image (referred to as LMMs), and those that use text only (referred to as LLMs) across various disciplines}](image1)`. In this table, the 'Human & Social Sci.' category is listed, and it shows that models generally exhibit higher performance in this discipline compared to more complex fields like Science and Health & Medicine [9].\n\nThe image `![{chart displaying the distribution of 11.5K multimodal questions across six broad disciplines, including Humanities & Social Sciences}](image3)` provides further context by showing that Humanities & Social Sciences make up 9% of the total questions, which might suggest a moderate representation in the dataset. The relatively lower complexity of visual data in this discipline likely contributes to better model performance [11].\n\nAdditionally, the specialized performance scores for various models on validation and test sets across different disciplines, as detailed in the image `![{table presents performance scores for various models on validation and test sets across different disciplines such as Art, Art Theory, Design, and Music}](image5)`, reveal that models tend to score higher in simpler domains. For instance, mPLUG-OWL2* shows strong performance in individual categories like Art, Art Theory, Design, and Music but does not specifically detail Human & Social Sciences. However, it is reasonable to infer similar trends given the related nature of these subjects.\n\nIn conclusion, large multimodal models (LMMs) generally perform better in the 'Human & Social Science' category compared to their overall performance, especially when contrasted with more complex disciplines requiring intricate reasoning and domain-specific knowledge [11]."}

This is further supported by the qualitative analysis which shows that pre-trained models not only capture rarer vocabulary but also generate more grammatically well-formed sentences [1].\n\nThe effectiveness of pre-training is also evident in multilingual systems where word embeddings are aligned between source languages. For example, when comparing bilingual and multilingual setups, aligning word embeddings leads to notable improvements in BLEU scores for all tasks [10].

Unlike self-correction where the same model acts as both generator and critic, this approach leverages external models or tools such as knowledge bases, trained models, code interpreters, and search engines to assist in refining the outputs [3]. This external feedback can provide more diverse and accurate information, ensuring that the refined outputs are not only corrected but also enriched with factual accuracy and context.\n\n![{The image illustrates how external models/tools assist in refining the outputs through cycles of generation, review, feedback, and refinement}](image3)\n\nFurthermore, the use of external feedback allows for a broader range of corrections beyond what a single model might achieve on its own.

Similarly, if the output involves complex reasoning or technical content, an external tool or a domain-specific model can offer precise evaluations and corrections [2].\n\nThis method is particularly beneficial because it does not require retraining the original language model; instead, it focuses on improving specific outputs after they have been generated. This flexibility makes it easier to integrate new types of feedback and adapt to different tasks without altering the underlying model parameters [6].

According to the provided information, the filter-then-rerank paradigm uses templates to convert candidate labels into multiple-choice question (MCQ) options [2]. This approach simplifies the task for LLMs by focusing on reranking pre-selected candidates rather than identifying all entities or events from scratch.\n\nFor specific datasets like TACREV, templates have been carefully designed and listed in Table 19 for FewNERD, Table 20 for TACREV, and Table 21 for ACE05 datasets [6]. Given that 'Contact.Meet' is likely an event type, we can infer that its template would follow a similar structure as shown in the examples provided.\n\n![{Examples of prompts for different NLP tasks including Named Entity Recognition, Relation Extraction, Event Detection, and Event Argument Extraction}](image2)\n\nIn the context of event detection, the instruction typically includes identifying events in the sentence and locating them to words [7]. For instance, the demo sentence \"Injured Russian diplomats were among victims... crossfire.\" has events identified as 'Life.Injure' and 'Conflict.Attack'. Similarly, the template for 'Contact.Meet' would instruct the model to identify if there is a meeting event and locate it within the sentence.\n\nBased on this pattern, the prompt template for 'Contact.Meet' would be structured as follows:\n\n**Instruction:** Identify if there is a 'Contact.Meet' event in the sentence and locate it to words.\n**Demo Sentence:** [Example sentence with 'Contact.Meet' event]\n**Entities/Events:** [Identified entities and their roles]\n**Test Sentence:** [Sentence to be evaluated]\n**Output:** [Event detected or not]\n\nThe exact template for 'Contact.Meet' would closely resemble the format used in the TACREV dataset examples, ensuring clarity and consistency in how the LLM processes and evaluates the input.\n\nTherefore, the prompt template used for the label 'Contact.Meet' in the filter-then-rerank method involves identifying and locating a 'Contact.Meet' event in the sentence, similar to the structured examples provided in the dataset templates."}

The retrieval then starts from the root of the tree, where at each level, it selects the top nodes based on their cosine similarity to the query vector [8]. This method progressively narrows down the search by focusing on more specific details as it moves deeper into the tree layers [9]. Ultimately, the text from all selected nodes is concatenated to form the retrieved context. This approach allows for a controlled retrieval that can balance between broad thematic information and granular details depending on the depth and number of nodes selected at each layer [3].\n\nOn the other hand, Collapsed Tree Retrieval offers a simpler and more flexible way to search for relevant information. It flattens the multi-layered tree into a single layer, bringing all the nodes onto the same level for comparison [10]. The retrieval process here involves evaluating all nodes simultaneously and selecting the most relevant ones based on cosine similarity until reaching a threshold number of tokens [11]. This method does not adhere to a strict layer-by-layer traversal but instead retrieves information that matches the required level of granularity for a given question [3]. As shown in the graph, the collapsed tree method tends to perform better, especially around 2000 tokens, achieving higher F1 scores compared to tree traversal [![The collapsed tree method performs better at 2000 tokens](image4)].\n\nIn summary, Tree Traversal Retrieval focuses on a structured, layer-by-layer search, while Collapsed Tree Retrieval evaluates all nodes at once, providing greater flexibility and often better performance for certain tasks."}

The dataset includes multiple categories such as Text, Code, Visual Chat, Image Generation, Interleaved Text/Image Generation, and Safety [2]. Each category plays a crucial role in shaping the model's inference strategy.\n\nFor instance, the **Text** and **Code** categories provide essential textual data that helps the model understand and generate coherent text sequences [6]. This is critical for maintaining logical flow and accuracy in text-based responses during inference. The **Visual Chat** and **Image Generation** categories ensure that the model can effectively handle visual elements, generating relevant images based on prompts [4]. This alignment with visual understanding and generation is vital for tasks like creating mixed-modal documents or responding to queries with appropriate images.\n\nThe **Interleaved Text/Image Generation** category specifically targets scenarios where both text and images are generated in sequence. By training on this data, Chameleon learns to seamlessly integrate text and images, producing well-structured multimodal outputs [5]. This is particularly important for applications requiring both textual and visual coherence, such as educational materials or interactive chat interfaces.\n\nLastly, the **Safety** category addresses potential risks by including prompts that could provoke unsafe content, ensuring the model adheres to safety standards [7]. During inference, this helps prevent the generation of harmful or inappropriate content.\n\nTo illustrate the balance and integration of these modalities, consider the diagram from ![{Chameleon handles and generates mixed-modal documents using input tokens from both text and images}](image1).

Unlike traditional object detection models that rely on hand-designed components like spatial anchors, DETR uses these object queries to globally reason about the relations of objects and the context of the entire image.\n\nIn the DETR architecture, the CNN backbone first extracts a compact feature representation from the input image [3]. These features are then passed to the transformer encoder-decoder. The decoder receives a fixed number of object queries, which are transformed into output embeddings through multi-headed self-attention and encoder-decoder attention mechanisms [5]. Each object query is independently decoded into box coordinates and class labels by a feed-forward network (FFN), resulting in a set of final predictions [5].\n\nTo illustrate this process visually, `![{DETR's architecture includes a decoder that uses object queries to predict bounding boxes and class labels for detected objects}](image5)` provides an insightful depiction.

Although \"DyGIE-RelProp\" does not outperform \"DyGIE\" across all categories, it demonstrates that relation propagation can help maintain performance levels in sentences with more entities [7]. Relation propagation significantly benefits both entity and relation extraction tasks, especially in datasets like ACE05 and SciERC, which contain multiple relation instances across different entities [10].\n\nFurthermore, the dynamic span graph approach in D Y GIE enhances interaction across tasks, allowing the model to learn useful information from broader context [2].

When repetition control is introduced, it tends to reduce the frequency of question-asking compared to models without such controls.

In contrast, the \"Question-controlled CT\" (blue line with circles), which does not include repetition control, increases steeply and approaches nearly 100% as the control level increases.\n\nThis reduction in question-asking frequency when repetition control is applied is also supported by text evidence. According to the findings, the introduction of the `extrep bigram` feature in weighted decoding, which discourages bigrams that have appeared in previous utterances, prevents the model from producing common question-related bigrams like \"do you\" and \"what is\" [10]. As a result, even when the model is set to produce 100% questions, it only achieves around 79.67% with repetition control in place. To mitigate this issue, an additional setting was introduced to allow necessary question-asking bigrams while still controlling for repetition, achieving a 99.54% question-asking rate but with slightly increased external bigram repetition [10].\n\nIn summary, the presence of repetition control reduces the frequency of question-asking in generated text, though adjustments can be made to balance both aspects effectively."}

Initially, the model trained on original distractors achieves an F1 score of 67.08 when evaluated on the same original distractors [3]. However, when this model is evaluated on adversarial distractors, the F1 score drops significantly to 46.84, indicating that the original model struggles with the new distribution of distractors introduced by adversarial selection [4].\n\nWhen the model is re-trained using adversarial distractors, its performance improves substantially. The F1 score increases from 46.84 to 60.10 when evaluated on adversarial distractors, showing that the model can somewhat recover its original accuracy after being exposed to and trained on these challenging distractors [3]. This suggests that adversarial training helps the model adapt to more difficult and diverse distractors, thereby improving its robustness.\n\nAdditionally, when filtering by entity type is applied to the adversarially selected distractors, the model's F1 score further improves from 40.73 to 58.42, demonstrating that combining adversarial training with additional filtering techniques can enhance the model's performance even more ![Performance metrics for different combinations of evaluation and training data](image2).\n\nIn conclusion, adversarial training significantly impacts model performance by initially reducing its accuracy on new types of distractors but ultimately leading to improved robustness and adaptability when the model is re-trained on these adversarial examples."}

For instance, when using 500 retrieved paragraphs without the gold paragraphs, single-paragraph BERT achieves an F1 score of 39.12 [4]. However, when two gold paragraphs are added to these 500 paragraphs, the F1 score improves to 53.12, indicating a substantial increase in performance due to the presence of relevant information [4]. This suggests that the failure to retrieve gold paragraphs is a significant factor affecting model performance.\n\nFurthermore, the type of distractors used also plays a crucial role. When adversarial distractors are introduced, the accuracy of single-paragraph BERT drops from 67.08 F1 to 46.84 F1 [2]. However, re-training the model on these adversarial distractors can recover some of the lost accuracy, reaching 60.10 F1 [2]. This demonstrates that while adversarial distractors challenge the model, they can also help improve its robustness if the model is adapted accordingly.\n\nAdditionally, the nature of the distractors can influence whether questions require multi-hop reasoning. Weak distractors allow 35% of questions to be answered with single-hop reasoning, often by entity type matching ![{Weak distractors enable single-hop answers for 35% of questions}](image1). In contrast, stronger distractors could potentially transform these questions into true multi-hop problems, as suggested by the analysis [12].\n\nIn conclusion, the inclusion of gold paragraphs enhances model performance, while the type of distractors can either challenge or refine the model's capabilities. The effectiveness of multi-hop question answering models heavily depends on both retrieving relevant gold paragraphs and carefully selecting distractors that genuinely necessitate multi-hop reasoning."}

This ability is particularly important for sentiment analysis because the order of words can significantly alter the meaning and sentiment conveyed by a phrase, as exemplified by the phrases “not really good” and “really not good” [7].\n\nHowever, when the word-order information is removed by shuffling the words in the training set, the performance of LSTM models on sentiment analysis tasks drops noticeably.

This is evident from multiple pieces of evidence provided.\n\nFirstly, Figure 13 shows that on the BloodMNIST dataset, the Hard-to-contrast initial query strategy (red lines) outperforms other initial query strategies in every cycle of active learning [1]. This trend is consistent across various datasets as indicated in Figures 5 and 14 for OrganAMNIST and PathMNIST respectively, where hard-to-contrast data also consistently outperform other strategies [4], [12].\n\nAdditionally, the strong correlation between the performance of the initial cycle (20 labeled images) and the last cycle (50 labeled images) suggests that the choice of initial queries has a significant impact on the overall performance of the model [1], [2]. For instance, the Pearson correlation coefficient between $\\mathrm{AUC_{20}}$ and $\\mathrm{AUC_{50}}$ remains high for hard-to-contrast data across different selection methods [2]. This implies that selecting hard-to-contrast data as an initial query can set a robust foundation for subsequent cycles of active learning.\n\n![{Hard-to-contrast strategy outperforms others across different datasets}](image3)\nThe bar chart in image3 further supports this by comparing map-based querying strategies across four datasets: PathMNIST, OrganAMNIST, BloodMNIST, and CIFAR-10-LT.

In both training from scratch and fine-tuning from self-supervised pre-training scenarios, the red line representing the hard-to-contrast strategy generally outperforms other methods [5]. This indicates that the hard-to-contrast approach not only excels in the initial stages but also sustains its advantage as more labeled data becomes available.\n\nIn conclusion, the 'Hard-to-Contrast' querying strategy significantly outperforms other strategies in terms of AUC across different numbers of labeled images, highlighting its effectiveness for initial query selection in active learning."}

In terms of breadth, MMMU covers a wide range of disciplines and subfields, including Art & Design, Business, Science, Health & Medicine, Humanities & Social Sciences, and Tech & Engineering [2]. It encompasses 30 subjects and 183 subfields, ensuring a comprehensive evaluation of models across diverse domains. This is in contrast to other benchmarks that often focus on daily knowledge and common sense, with limited image formats [6].\n\nRegarding depth, MMMU requires expert-level reasoning and domain-specific knowledge to solve problems. For instance, it includes questions that necessitate applying advanced concepts like \"Fourier Transform\" or \"Equilibrium Theory\" [2]. This contrasts sharply with existing benchmarks that typically require only basic perception abilities or simple reasoning [1]. The inclusion of such complex, college-level questions ensures that LMMs are rigorously tested for their ability to integrate deep subject knowledge with visual understanding.\n\nMoreover, MMMU features interleaved text-image inputs, challenging models to jointly understand both modalities and perform complex reasoning based on this understanding [2]. This is further supported by the variety of image types included, from photographs and paintings to diagrams and medical images [image8]. This diversity in image formats enhances the benchmark's capability to evaluate models' perceptual capabilities comprehensively.\n\nThe implications for using MMMU in evaluating LMMs are significant. Models like GPT-4V, despite being advanced, achieve only 55.7% accuracy on MMMU, indicating substantial room for improvement [8]. Open-source models fare even lower, highlighting the benchmark's rigorous standards [8]. Therefore, MMMU not only underscores the progress made in multimodal understanding but also reveals the challenges that remain, especially in handling complex visual inputs and reasoning with subject-specific knowledge [12].\n\nIn summary, the MMMU benchmark offers a more thorough and demanding evaluation framework for LMMs compared to other benchmarks, emphasizing both broad coverage and deep expertise [image4]. ![{MMMU excels in depth and breadth compared to other benchmarks}](image4)"}

According to the data in image4, which provides detailed information about different models and their associated hardware and power consumption, the power consumption for T2T_big (Transformer big) is listed as well.

For instance, Google derives 56% of its energy from renewables, while the rest comes from gas (14%), coal (15%), and nuclear (10%) [image2].

Specifically, the results indicate that incorporating personality information into the NCF model improves recommendation performance [9].\n\nLooking at the detailed comparison in the table shown `![{comparison of different models on three datasets}](image7)`, it is evident that for the Amazon-beauty dataset, the NCF+Hard-Coded model performs well but not always the best. For instance, at k=3, NCF+Hard-Coded achieves a Hit rate (H@3) of 0.426 and a Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (N@3) of 0.285. However, NCF+Soft-labeled outperforms it with a higher H@3 of 0.431 and N@3 of 0.288.\n\nFurthermore, when examining the overall trend across different values of k, the NCF+Soft-labeled model generally exhibits superior performance over NCF+Hard-Coded.

In the context of Knowledge-aware Language Model Attribution (KaLMA), knowledge graphs (KGs) play a crucial role by organizing world knowledge in a structured manner [6]. These graphs consist of nodes and edges, where nodes represent entities and edges represent relationships between these entities.\n\nIn the diagram explaining the task of KaLMA, typically, each entity node would be connected via relation arrows to other nodes that provide specific details or attributes about the entity. However, some relation arrows might not point to specific leaf nodes if the information is incomplete or if the model identifies a need for supporting knowledge beyond what is provided in the graph. This concept ties into the \"Conscious Incompetence\" setting, where the model recognizes its limitations and gaps in knowledge [6].\n\n![{The image shows a diagram illustrating the influence of Orazio Gentileschi on Artemisia Gentileschi's life and career in developing her as a Baroque painter using a knowledge graph}](image6)\n\nIn this specific scenario, if we refer to the diagram from Image 6, it illustrates the influence of Orazio Gentileschi on Artemisia Gentileschi’s development as a painter through a knowledge graph. Here, relation arrows connect Orazio Gentileschi and Artemisia Gentileschi with attributes like occupation, style, place of birth, and citizenship. However, if there were any arrows pointing to concepts that are not fully detailed or expanded within the graph, those would be the arrows not pointing to specific leaf nodes.\n\nFor instance, if there is an arrow indicating \"influences\" but it does not lead to a specific node detailing the exact nature of these influences, such an arrow would not point to a specific leaf node. This reflects the model's awareness of missing knowledge, aligning with the \"Conscious Incompetence\" principle.\n\nTherefore, in Figure 1, the relation arrows that do not point to specific leaf nodes likely indicate areas where the knowledge graph lacks complete information or where the model has identified a knowledge gap."}

This approach laid the groundwork for more sophisticated models that could capture nuanced changes.\n\nBy 2011, researchers began exploring the Google Ngrams corpus, which became instrumental in detecting differences in word usage and meaning across decades ![{Introduction of Google Ngrams for diachronic analysis}](image1) [12].\n\nIn 2012, the concept of \"Word epoch disambiguation\" was introduced, allowing systems to identify the specific time periods associated with different contexts of words undergoing semantic shifts [3].\n\nAdvancements in prediction-based models were noted in 2013, significantly improving the accuracy of capturing semantic changes [10]. These models leveraged machine learning techniques to better understand how word meanings evolve.\n\n2014 saw the application of word embeddings, notably with the introduction of \"word2vec\", which revolutionized the way semantic shifts were analyzed [5]. This method provided a robust way to represent words in a continuous vector space, facilitating comparisons across time.\n\nThe year 2015 brought about the development of \"Models alignment\", enabling researchers to find equivalents for certain words across different time periods [3]. This was crucial for cross-time evaluations and understanding long-term linguistic trends.\n\nIn 2016, the New York Times (NYT) corpus and the Corpus of Historical American English (COHA) were extensively used to analyze diachronic semantic shifts [8]. These corpora provided rich data sources for tracing subtle changes in word meanings over time.\n\nFinally, 2017 was marked by insights into the \"Laws of semantic change\" and the realization that local measures might be better suited for detecting cultural shifts [2]. Additionally, joint learning across time spans emerged as a promising approach, further enhancing the ability to track semantic changes accurately ![{Key developments in laws of semantic change and joint learning}](image1).\n\nTo summarize, these milestones highlight the rapid progress in methodologies and datasets used to trace diachronic semantic shifts from 2010 to 2017."}

This is evident when comparing the base SPECTER model scores with those where the abstract is excluded, as shown in the table ![{removing the abstract decreases performance significantly}](image1).\n\nAdding authors as an input feature, along with the title and abstract, surprisingly hurts performance [8]. One possible explanation for this behavior is that author names are sparse in the corpus, making it difficult for the model to infer document-level relatedness from them. Additionally, tokenization using WordPieces might be suboptimal for author names, leading to noisy correlation [8].\n\nOn the other hand, adding venues slightly decreases performance overall, except on the document classification task, where it improves performance [8]. This can be observed in the table, which shows the highest score for CLS when venue information is added ![{adding venues improves classification but not other tasks}](image1).\n\nMoreover, the use of hard negative distractors in the citation-based fine-tuning objective is crucial for SPECTER's performance [2].

When looking at the full setup where BERT processes both claims and reasons with warrants, it achieves a peak performance of $77\\%$ accuracy [1]. However, this high performance is largely attributed to the exploitation of spurious statistical cues within the dataset rather than genuine argument comprehension [5].\n\nTo break down the performance further, we can examine how BERT performs with different input configurations. For instance, when only warrants are considered (W), BERT reaches a maximum accuracy of $71\\%$ [10]. Adding reasons (R, W) provides an additional four percentage points, while including claims (C, W) adds another two percentage points, accounting for the total six-point increase from warrants alone to the peak performance [5]. This incremental gain underscores that BERT leverages specific patterns in the data rather than understanding the arguments.\n\nMoreover, the detailed performance metrics reveal that BERT's mean performance is $71.6\\pm0.04$, and the median is $71.2\\%$, excluding the degenerate runs [11]. These figures indicate a more stable but still inflated performance due to the same spurious cues.\n\nWhen evaluated on an adversarial dataset designed to eliminate these cues, BERT's performance drops dramatically. As illustrated in the table comparing different models and configurations ![{BERT's performance drops significantly on the adversarial dataset}](image5), the mean, median, and max scores all hover around $50\\%$, indicating random accuracy. This sharp decline supports the conclusion that BERT's initial high performance was not indicative of true argument comprehension but rather exploitation of dataset artifacts [9].\n\nIn summary, BERT's test performance is highly dependent on the presence of spurious statistical cues in the original dataset, and its performance drops to near-random levels when these cues are removed."}

This extensive collection ensures a robust evaluation of models across various dimensions. In contrast, other benchmarks like VQA, GQA, VisWiz, TextVQA, OKVQA, SEED, MMBench, MM-Vet, and ScienceQA have smaller datasets, as illustrated in the comparison table [image6]. The large size of MMMU allows for a more thorough assessment of model performance.\n\nSecondly, MMMU features a wide variety of image types, totaling 30 different categories [4]. These range from common formats like photographs and paintings to specialized types such as chemical structures, medical images, and geometric shapes [image4]. This diversity is further emphasized by the distribution shown in a bar chart, where diagrams and tables are the most frequent, followed by photographs and paintings [image1]. Other benchmarks typically focus on fewer image types, limiting their scope and applicability [image6].\n\nLastly, the reasoning depth required by MMMU is significantly more advanced. Unlike benchmarks that primarily test commonsense knowledge or simple reasoning, MMMU demands expert-level visual perception and deliberate reasoning with college-level subject knowledge [9]. This challenge is vividly illustrated through tasks that require applying complex theories like \"Fourier Transform\" or \"Equilibrium Theory\" [12]. The comparison table also highlights that MMMU excels in both breadth (knowledge coverage) and depth (reasoning complexity) compared to other benchmarks [image6].\n\nIn conclusion, the MMMU benchmark stands out due to its larger dataset size, broader range of image types, and deeper requirement for expert-level reasoning, making it a more rigorous and comprehensive evaluation tool for multimodal understanding and reasoning models."}

This table includes various voltage parameters such as input low and high voltages (VIL, VIH) and output low and high voltages (VOL, VOH), along with their respective minimum and maximum values.\n\nFor the 8751H microcontroller, the input low voltage (VIL) is specified to have a maximum value of 0.8V, while the input high voltage (VIH) has a minimum value of 2.0V. The output low voltage (VOL) has a maximum value of 0.5V when sinking a current of 1.6mA, and the output high voltage (VOH) has a minimum value of 4.75V when sourcing a current of 0.4mA [image1].\n\nComparatively, for the 8751BH and 8752BH models, the input low voltage (VIL) also has a maximum of 0.8V, similar to the 8751H. However, the input high voltage (VIH) has a slightly higher minimum value of 2.4V. The output low voltage (VOL) for these models remains at a maximum of 0.5V when sinking 1.6mA, but the output high voltage (VOH) has a minimum value of 4.9V when sourcing 0.4mA [image1].\n\nFurthermore, the text quote [2] provides information on the voltage range that can be applied to any pin relative to VSS, which is from -0.5V to +7V for all pins except for specific ones like the power supply pins. This range ensures compatibility and operational safety across different conditions.\n\nIn summary, the 8751H microcontroller has slightly different input and output voltage specifications compared to the 8751BH and 8752BH models, particularly in terms of the input high voltage and output high voltage thresholds. ![The table provides electrical characteristics for various voltage parameters associated with certain microcontroller models](image1)."}

According to the graphic illustration, the CD8+ T cell engages with the liver cell that contains the Pf schizont, a stage of the malaria parasite [image5]. The liver cell presents Pf peptides on its surface via MHC Class I molecules, which are recognized by the CD8+ T cell. This recognition triggers an immune response where the CD8+ T cell releases perforin and granzymes, leading to apoptosis and the death of the parasite within the liver cell. Additionally, IFN-γ and Fas/FasR interactions play a role in signaling and inducing apoptosis.\n\nIn summary, the immune system targets malaria parasites by using CD8+ T cells to recognize and eliminate infected liver cells, thereby preventing the development and spread of the parasite [image5]."}

Business intelligence (BI) typically involves the use of standard reports, ad-hoc reports, query drilldowns, and alerts to provide historical data and answer basic questions about business operations [8]. However, as we move into business analytics, the degree of intelligence increases, leading to more sophisticated methods like statistical analysis, forecasting, predictive modeling, and optimization.\n\nIn business intelligence, data handling primarily focuses on transforming raw data into information through reporting mechanisms. For example, standard reports can tell us \"What happened?\" by providing summaries of past events. Ad-hoc reports delve deeper with queries like \"How many, how often, where?\" This phase is crucial for raising questions but not necessarily answering them [7].\n\nBusiness analytics, on the other hand, builds upon this foundation by employing advanced techniques that generate insights rather than just information. Statistical analysis helps in exploring \"Why is this happening?\" by examining patterns and correlations within the data. Forecasting extends this understanding to consider \"What if these trends continue?\" Predictive modeling takes it a step further by predicting \"What will happen next?\" Finally, optimization evaluates \"What's the best that can happen?\" ensuring that actions taken are not only informed but also optimized for the best outcomes [8].\n\nThis progression is visually represented in the diagram ![{Progression from BI to BA}](image8). The flowchart also illustrates a similar concept, showing how data moves through various stages from mere storage to actionable insights, ultimately leading to value creation ![{Data to Value Flowchart}](image3).\n\nIn summary, the transition from business intelligence to business analytics enhances data handling and insights generation by moving from descriptive reporting to prescriptive analytics, thereby enabling more informed and strategic decision-making processes."}

During fertilization, the combination of these gametes results in four possible genotypes in the F2 generation: PP, Pp, Pp, and pp.\n\nThe genotypic ratio in the F2 generation is 1 PP : 2 Pp : 1 pp. Since the purple flower color is dominant over white, all individuals with at least one P allele (PP or Pp) will have purple flowers, while only those with the homozygous recessive genotype (pp) will have white flowers. This leads to a phenotypic ratio of 3 purple-flowered plants to 1 white-flowered plant in the F2 generation [11].\n\nThus, Mendelian inheritance explains the observed phenotypic and genotypic ratios in the F2 generation of pea plants through the principles of segregation and independent assortment of alleles."}

This map emphasizes regions with high volcanic activity, providing a clear visual representation of geological features.\n\nIn contrast, the distribution of public libraries in the Netherlands is depicted through multiple maps, each emphasizing different aspects. One such map shows the concentration of public libraries within the country, indicated by red dots scattered across various regions [![Public libraries in The Netherlands](image6)]. Another map provides a broader view, including parts of Belgium and Germany, but with a focus on the Netherlands, showing a dense clustering of red dots representing library locations [![Red dots indicating library locations](image7)].\n\nThe data presentation for public libraries also includes structured tables that list detailed information about each library, including identifiers, names, descriptions, and geographical coordinates [![List of public libraries](image8)]. This tabular format complements the map visualization by offering precise data points for each library.\n\nIn summary, while both use red dots on maps to represent locations, the volcano map highlights natural phenomena concentrated in specific regions, whereas the public libraries map showcases a more evenly distributed set of cultural institutions within a defined national boundary. \n\nThe comparison in terms of data presentation reveals that the volcano map focuses on highlighting natural features with less accompanying detail, while the public libraries map integrates both visual and tabular data to provide comprehensive information about each location. \n\nThus, the maps serve different purposes: one to inform about natural hazards and another to guide users to cultural resources."}

One significant issue is the siloed approach that many organizations take, which hinders effective coordination and leads to misaligned goals ![There is no single ownership of the experience resulting in siloed approaches and misaligned goals.](image6).\n\nMoreover, there is often a lack of leadership commitment and guidance necessary to drive sustainable growth across various business segments such as Sales, Finance, HR, and Marketing [8]. Additionally, companies frequently drown in data, focusing too much on quantitative metrics like reach while neglecting qualitative aspects like customer engagement and satisfaction [2].\n\nAnother critical barrier is the over-reliance on traditional marketing metrics that fail to capture the complexity of customer interactions in the digital age [1]. For instance, attributing campaign performance solely to the first or last click overlooks the true influence of touchpoints throughout the customer journey [10]. This misattribution can lead to ineffective strategies and missed opportunities for enhancing customer relationships.\n\nFurthermore, there is often insufficient focus on turning data into actionable insights [11]. Without a clear understanding of how to measure what matters most—such as customer engagement, conversion, and satisfaction—organizations struggle to implement meaningful changes [11].\n\nIn conclusion, the primary barriers preventing the adoption of an integrated customer management approach are a siloed organizational structure, lack of leadership commitment, overemphasis on traditional metrics, and inadequate processes for converting data into actionable intelligence."}

This separation helps us distinguish individual elements within a complex scene.\n\nNext, the principle of **Closure** is demonstrated through the combination of the \"G\" and \"E.\" Even though parts of these letters are missing or not fully drawn, our perception completes the shapes, allowing us to recognize them as whole forms ![{We perceive incomplete shapes as complete}](image2).\n\nThe principle of **Proximity** is evident in the depiction of the letter \"E\" as a series of small rectangles grouped closely together. Despite being composed of separate elements, the close arrangement makes us see them as a single unit ![{Close grouping suggests unity}](image2).\n\nAdditionally, the letter \"S\" exemplifies the principle of **Continuity**. The smooth, continuous contour line guides our eyes along the path, making it easy to follow and perceive the shape as a continuous flow ![{Continuous lines suggest smooth pathways}](image2).\n\nThe letters \"T\" and \"A\" share a similar striped pattern, illustrating the principle of **Similarity**. This similarity in appearance leads us to group these letters together, reinforcing the idea that visually similar elements are perceived as part of the same group ![{Visual similarity groups elements together}](image2).\n\nLastly, the overall simplicity and clarity of the letter \"A\" reflect the principle of **Prägnanz** (or Prägnanz), where our perception tends to favor the simplest and most stable form.

In the depicted diagram, the ECU is positioned at the center [image1], where it receives data from multiple sensors such as the engine temperature sensor, intake air temperature sensor, mass air flow sensor, throttle position sensor, HEGO sensor, crankshaft sensor, and camshaft sensor. These sensors provide critical information about the engine's operating conditions, which the ECU uses to make real-time adjustments.\n\nFor instance, based on the input from the mass air flow sensor, the ECU can determine the amount of air entering the engine and adjust the fuel injection quantity to maintain the optimal air-fuel ratio [4]. Similarly, the throttle position sensor informs the ECU about the driver’s desired power output, allowing it to control the opening of the injectors and manage idle speed [6]. The ECU also controls ignition timing to optimize combustion efficiency [5].\n\nFurthermore, the ECU manages the fuel supply system by regulating the operation of the fuel injectors [image2]. It ensures that the correct amount of fuel is delivered to the engine under varying operating conditions, such as cold starts or when the engine has not yet warmed up [7]. This coordination between the ECU and the fuel system components is crucial for efficient engine performance and emissions control.\n\nIn summary, the role of the ECU in the depicted engine management system is to monitor and control various engine parameters to ensure optimal performance, fuel efficiency, and emissions compliance ![The ECU coordinates inputs from sensors and controls outputs to injectors and other systems](image1)."}

The process can be broken down into three main steps:\n\nFirst, the single circular chromosome of the prokaryote duplicates [11]. This duplication is crucial as it ensures that each new cell will receive a complete copy of the genetic material. The image showing a simplified diagram of a bacterial cell with duplicated genetic material inside further illustrates this initial step `![{The image shows a bacterial cell with duplicated genetic material inside}](image4)`.\n\nSecond, the cell elongates and the duplicated chromosomes begin to separate from each other [11]. During this elongation phase, the cell increases in size to accommodate the separation of the duplicated chromosomes. This stage prepares the cell for the final division. An image depicting the bacterial cell during this elongation and separation phase highlights how the cell structure changes to facilitate the movement of the duplicated DNA `![{The image illustrates bacterial cell division with elongation and separation of genetic material}](image8)`.\n\nFinally, the plasma membrane grows inward at the midpoint of the cell, leading to the formation of a division septum that ultimately divides the cell into two daughter cells [11]. This step is critical for ensuring that each new cell has its own set of genetic material and cellular components. \n\nIn summary, the three steps of binary fission of a prokaryotic cell are the duplication of the chromosome, the elongation of the cell and separation of the chromosomes, and the division of the cell by the inward growth of the plasma membrane."}

For instance, when consuming hot dogs, the first hot dog might provide significant satisfaction [8]. However, as more hot dogs are consumed, the satisfaction diminishes, eventually turning negative, as seen in the table where the sixth hot dog results in a utility of -10 ![{Diminishing returns with hot dog consumption}](image8).\n\nIn competitive contexts, however, the dynamics can be quite different. The image illustrating hot dog consumption in a competitive setting shows a dramatic shift in utility at a specific point. At 64 hot dogs, there is a sudden spike in utility from -50 to +5000, indicating that this consumption level ties the individual with a competitor for a championship in 2007 ![{Utility jumps dramatically at 64 hot dogs, tying for a championship}](image1). This suggests that in competitive scenarios, certain thresholds can lead to significant positive outcomes, which do not follow the typical pattern of diminishing marginal utility observed in standard consumption.\n\nThus, while standard consumption economics predicts a steady decrease in utility with increased consumption, competitive contexts can introduce unique variables such as strategic milestones or performance achievements that significantly alter the utility curve. \n\nIn conclusion, diminishing marginal utility differs between standard consumption and competitive contexts by introducing potential spikes in utility at critical points in competition, whereas in standard consumption, utility steadily decreases with each additional unit consumed."}

For instance, **Matrix Metering Mode** evaluates light across the entire frame, making it ideal for shooting natural landscapes ![{Matrix Metering Mode measures light across the entire frame}](image5). On the other hand, **Center Metering Mode** focuses on light near the center of the screen, perfect for portraits where the subject is typically centered [10]. Lastly, **Spot Metering Mode** concentrates on a specific region, ensuring precise exposure for detailed areas like a subject's eyes [10].\n\nSimilarly, focus modes adjust how the camera locks onto subjects. **AF-S (single)** is suitable for stationary subjects as it locks focus once and remains steady until the photo is taken ![{AF-S mode is best for stationary subjects}](image4). Conversely, **AF-C (continuous)** continuously adjusts focus, making it excellent for moving subjects such as sports or wildlife photography [7]. Additionally, **MF (manual)** allows you to touch the subject of interest for focusing, which can be particularly useful for close-up shots or when the camera has trouble focusing automatically [7].\n\nThese settings provide photographers with greater control over their images, allowing them to adapt to different lighting conditions and subject movements, ultimately enhancing the quality of their photography.\n\nTo enhance photography under various scenarios, using the appropriate metering and focus modes in Pro Mode ensures optimal exposure and sharp focus tailored to each situation."}
