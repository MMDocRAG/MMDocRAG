Supporters of the CDU/CSU, as well as those who support the SPD and Greens, name France as the first or second-most important partner, followed by the U.S.\n[2] But as it relates to a rising China, attitudes diverge the other way. Germans are about twice as likely to say they prefer a close relationship to the U.S. over China ($50\\%$ to $24\\%$), while Americans are almost equally divided (41\\% prefer Germany, 44\\% say China).\n[3] % of Germans/Americans on the ideological __ who have a favorable opinion of …\n[4] When asked to choose between having a close relationship to Germany or Russia, Americans clearly favor Germany (61\\% to 26\\%). When Germans are asked to choose between Russia and the U.S., however, the gap is smaller (39\\% to 25\\%, and three-in-ten Germans volunteer both).\n[5] In the U.S., Republicans and Republican-leaning independents are more likely than Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents to favor increased defense spending in Europe. However, the share among Republicans who think the U.S.'s European allies should increase their defense budgets has fallen by 1 percentage points between 2007 and 2009. There has also been a more modest decline in this view among Democrats.\n[6] Democrats in the U.S. are more likely to want greater cooperation with Germany than Republicans. And in Germany, supporters of CDU/CSU are more willing to want greater cooperation with the U.S. than those who support the Greens and the SPD. This jibes with data on the international image of the U.S., where those on the ideological right in Germany tend to be more favorable toward the U.S. overall.\n[7] When it comes to cooperation with other countries, there is again a divergence between American and German views. Nearly seven-in-ten Americans (69%) say that they want to cooperate more with Germany, compared with only half of Germans who say the same about the U.S. Nonetheless, the percentage of Germans who say they want to cooperate more with the U.S. has increased nine points since 2008. At that time, fully 47% wanted to cooperate less with America.\n[8] Democrats and Republicans are about as likely to name Germany as a top foreign policy partner, but Republicans are keener on Israel.\n[9] Additionally, Germans living in former East Germany tend to view Russia more favorably and the EU less favorably than those living in the former West. Just over four-in-ten of those living in the former East say they have a favorable opinion of Russia (43%), compared with one-third of those in the former West. And 71% in the former West favor the EU, while 59% in the former East agree.\n[10] In the U.S., political affiliation dictates who people think is the most important foreign policy partner. While both Republicans and Democrats agree that the UK is their most important partner, Republicans and Republican-leaning independents are keener on Israel as a partner (26%) than Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents (9%). Democrats also place more emphasis on Canada and Mexico for their top foreign policy affiliate. However, views of Germany are similar among partisans in the U.S., with both sides ranking Germany fifth on the list of most or second-most important foreign policy partners.\n\n#### Image Quotes:\n- ![Republican/Lean Rep](image1) shows the change in preference for defense spending in Europe from 2017 to 2019, highlighting the shift in views between Republicans and Democrats.\n- ![CDU/CSU]( image2) displays the distribution of political affiliations within Germany, showing the percentages of CDU/CSU, SPD, and Greens supporters.\n- ![Republican/Lean Republican]( image3) compares the top foreign policy partners among Republicans and Lean Republicans, listing the UK, Israel, China, Canada, and Germany.\n- ![Democrat/Lean Democrat]( image4) lists the top foreign policy partners among Democrats and Lean Democrats, including the UK, China, Canada, Mexico, and Germany.\n- ![Americans and Germans]( image5) illustrates the ideological differences between Americans and Germans regarding their views on the UN, EU, and Russia, with specific percentages for each group.\n\n#### Conclusion:\nThe charts that group results by political affiliation include:\n- Republican/Lean Rep\n- Democrat/Lean Dem\n- CDU/CSU\n- SPD\n- Greens"}

Nearly half (48%) of Americans who have heard a lot about this concept find it extremely realistic that machines might one day do many of the jobs currently done by humans.\n[9] Americans generally express more worry than enthusiasm when asked about these automation technologies. Most prominently, Americans are roughly twice as likely to express worry (72%) than enthusiasm (33%) about a future in which robots and computers are capable of doing many jobs that are currently done by humans.\n\n#### Image Quotes\n- **Image1** shows the distribution of responses regarding the realism of the concept that machines will perform many human jobs. The data indicates that 20 out of 1 respondents consider this concept extremely realistic, while 57 out of  respondents find it somewhat realistic, and only 1 out of  respondents believe it is not at all realistic.\n- **Image2** illustrates the level of familiarity with the concept of automation.

According to [3], positive ratings of the government’s anti-terrorism efforts have fallen by 26 points since January, with more people now saying the government is doing not too well or not at all well in reducing the threat (52%) than those who say the government is doing very or fairly well (46%). This trend is consistent across political affiliations, as evidenced by the line graph in image1, which shows a downward trend for Republicans, Democrats, and Independents alike.\n\n#### Differences by Political Affiliation\nThe shift in public perception is more pronounced among Republicans, as highlighted by [4]. Slightly more than seven-in-ten Republicans (71%) now say their greater concern is that anti-terrorism policies do not go far enough, up 1 points since January (57%) and 33 points since July 2013 (38%). By In contrast, the percentage of Democrats expressing this concern has increased from 67% to 64%, while Independents’ positive ratings have dropped 25 points, from 69% to 44%.\n\n#### Differences by Age Group\nAge also plays a significant role in how Americans perceive the government's efforts against terrorism. As seen in image2, older adults (those 50 and older) are more likely to give the government low marks for its job in reducing the terrorist threat. Specifically, 57% of those aged 50 and older say the government is not doing well reducing the terrorist threat, compared to 46% of younger adults (those 18-29 years old). The table in image2 further illustrates that 71% of those aged 65+ say the government is not going far enough to protect the country, whereas only 15% express concern that government policies has gone too far restricting civil liberties.\n\n#### Conclusion\nPublic perceptions of government efforts to combat terrorism have become more negative over time, particularly among Republicans. These perceptions differ significantly by political affiliation and age group, with older and less educated individuals being more critical of the government's performance in reducing the terrorist threat.\n\n![Not gone far enough to protect country](image3)\n![Very/Fairly well](image5)"}

Since the start of the year, there has been a seven percentage-point rise in the share expressing concern that these policies have not gone far enough.\n[6] Older and less educated Americans are somewhat more likely than younger and more highly educated Americans to give the government low marks for the job it is doing reducing the threat of terrorism.\n[7] Compared to early 2015, assessments of government efforts to combat terrorism are more negative across the political spectrum.

The graph indicates that overall, there has been a decline in positive ratings for government efforts to combat terrorism, especially among Independents, who show a significant drop in their positive ratings.\n- ** image2** presents a table detailing public opinion on government policies regarding civil liberties and national security. Ited individuals aged 18-29 are more concerned about the government going too far in restricting civil liberties (43%) compared to not being far enough to protect the US (44%). As age increases, the concern shifts towards the government not going far enough to protect the country, with the highest concern among those 65 and older (71%).\n\n#### Conclusion\nAge significantly influences perceptions of government efforts to reduce the terrorist threat, with younger adults generally more concerned about civil liberties being restricted, whereas older adults are more worried about insufficient protection. Political ideology also plays a role, with Democrats showing a higher percentage of positive ratings for government efforts to combat terrorism compared to Republicans and Independents, who have seen a decline in their positive assessments. Over time, there has been a general decline in positive ratings for government efforts to combat terrorism, particularly among Independents, reflecting broader concerns about both civil liberties and national security."}

The data indicates a significant increase in concern about ISIS from August 2014 to December 2015 (+116), with similar trends for Iran's nuclear program and North Korea's nuclear program. Conversely, there has been a decline in concern about growing authoritarianism in Russia (-11).\n\n#### Answer\nIn 2015, different age groups perceive the government's performance in reducing the terrorist threat differently. Older Americans, particularly those 65 and older, are more likely to believe that anti-terrorism policies have gone too far in restricting civil liberties (71%), whereas younger adults (under 30) are more evenly split between concerns about security and civil liberties (43% each). This perception alignes with historical data showing a peak in concern about insufficient anti-terrorism measures in early 2000, shortly after the failed Christmas-Day terrorist attack. The image further illustrates that while there has been a general increase in concern about various global issues, the specific issue of terrorism has seen a notable rise in public worry, which may reflect differing views on the balance between security and civil liberties across age groups."}

For each issue, the graph displays the percentage of Republicans, Democrats, and Independents respondents who hold certain views. The data indicates significant differences in opinions among political affiliations, especially for issues like Iran's nuclear program and the Islamic militant group in Iraq and Syria, known as ISIS.\n\n#### Answer\nOver time, public perceptions of the U.S. military campaign against ISIS have evolved from predominantly negative to more positive, particularly regarding the potential for success. Initially, there was a notable increase in the belief that the U.S. and its allies would ultimately be successful. This trend is reflected in the text evidence where the percentage of those believing in the campaign's success increased by 1 points from July.

The chart highlights the percentage of favorable opinions for each organization, with Germany having higher percentages across most categories.\n- **Image2** illustrates the perception of China as the leading economic power. While 50% of Americans believe the U.S. is the top economic power, 53% of Germans believe China holds this position. This indicates a significant difference in perceptions regarding economic leadership.\n\n#### Conclusion\nAmericans and Germans differ significantly in their views of international organizations and economic powers, influenced by factors such as political ideology and historical context. Germans generally hold more positive views of organizations like the EU and NATO, while Americans are more likely to favor Russia. Economic perceptions also diverge, with Germans perceiving China as the leading economic power, whereas Americans prefer the U.S. for this role."}

In the U.S., Republicans and Republican-leaning independents are more likely than Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents to favor increased defense spending in Europe. However, the share among Republicans who think the U.S.'s European allies should increase their defense budgets has fallen by 1percentage points between 2017 and 2)019. There has also been a more modest decline in this view among Democrats.\n\nIn Germany, the CDU/CSU supporters are predominantly in favor of defense spending increases, with 51% expressing this view.

According to [5], there is a notable divide between Republicans and Democrats on the amount of international assistance the U.S. should provide. By the start of the decade, a majority of Republicans (62%) believed the U.S. did too much in helping address global challenges, whereas only 26% of Democrats held this view. This gap has widened over time, with the latest data showing 62% of Republicans thinking the U.S. is doing too much, compared to 29% of Democrats who agree.\n\nRegarding the U.S. role in solving world problems, [6] highlights stark divisions by party and ideology. The belief that the U.S. can learn a great deal from other countries about ways to slow the spread of the coronavirus is more prevalent among Americans with higher levels of education, particularly among Democrats. For instance, 67% of liberal Democrats believe the U.S. can learn a great deal from other countries, compared to 33% of conservative Republicans.\n\nFurthermore, [7] indicates that there are sharp partisan and ideological differences on other questions about foreign policy and international affairs. Liberal Democrats are significantly more likely to think the U.S. has done an only fair or poor job in dealing with the coronavirus outbreak (81%) compared to conservative Republicans (22%). Additionally, they are more pessimistic about the U.S.'s future influence in world affairs post-coronavirus, with 56% believing the U.S. will have less influence, compared to 11% of moderate and liberal Republicans and 8% of conservative Republicans.\n\nIn summary, the data from 2013 to 2020 show that partisan views differ significantly on the U.S. role in solving world problems and its influence after the coronavirus outbreak. Republicans tend to believe the U.S. is doing too much in international assistance and that the country's influence will strengthen, while Democrats are more likely to think the U.S. is doing too little and that its influence will weaken."}

The most serious concerns include cyber attacks from China, the loss of U.S. jobs to China, China’s growing military power, and China’s policies on human rights. Over half of Americans describe these issues as very serious problems. Additionally, the loss of U.S. jobs to China has increased by 6 points since 200, reaching 53%. A similar share sees China’s growing military power as a very serious problem (largely unchanged from the 49% who said the same last year).\n\n![Seriousness of Issues](image2)\n- **Conclusion**: The most serious concerns about China include cyber attacks, job losses, military power, and human rights policies, with the loss of U.S. jobs increasing in seriousness over time.\n\n### Direct Answer\nPartisan differences in confidence in Biden to deal with China are stark, with Democrats showing high confidence and Republicans showing low confidence.

According to the survey data, Democrats and those leaning towards the Democratic Party have a much higher level of confidence in Biden on China-related issues compared to Republicans and those leaning Republican. Specifically, 83% of Democrats and leaners toward the Democratic Party express confidence in Biden, whereas only 1 19% of Republicans and leaners show the same level of confidence. Conservative Republicans have even less confidence (110%) than moderate or liberal Republicans (30%). This is illustrated in [2] and [4].\n\n#### Major Concerns Americans Have Regarding China\nAmericans are particularly concerned about several China-related issues. Cyber attacks from China evoke the most concern, with roughly two-thirds considering digital attacks to be be a very serious problem, an increase of 7 percentage points from 2020. The loss of U.S. jobs to China is also a major concern, with 53% seeing it as a very serious problem, an increase of 6 points since 2000. Similarly, concerns about China’s growing military power and technological power are significant, with 52% and 47% respectively considering these issues very serious problems.

This is further supported by image1, which illustrates that 70% of the total respondents believe in prioritizing human rights over economic relations with China. The breakdown by political affiliation reveals that conservative Republicans (77%) and liberal Democrats (76%) are particularly strong in this belief [image1].\n\nSecondly, when it comes to getting tougher with China on trade issues, the opinions vary significantly by political affiliation [6]. According to image5, 72% of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents want the U.S. to get tougher on China, especially among those who identify as conservative Republicans (81%). In contrast, about six-in-ten Democrats and Democrat-leaning independents would rather focus on building stronger ties with China [image5].\n\nIn summary, both promoting human rights over economic relations with China and getting tougher with China on trade issues have strong support among different political affiliations, but the intensity and direction of these views differ significantly between Republicans and Democrats.\n![Americans prioritize human rights over economic relations with China](image1)\n![More Republicans want to get tougher with China on trade issues](image5)"}

While at least two-thirds of supporters of each party see visiting students in a positive light, 92% of Democrats and Democrat-leaning independents hold this perspective, versus just 67% of Republicans and Republican leanersers. [3] Since 2009, the largest share of international students in the U.S. have come from China. [4] Those who think that the U.S. economy is in good shape are more likely to describe the tariffs as good for the country than those who say the American economy is not doing well – 49% vs. 20%, respectively. [5] At least half of White, Black, and Hispanic Americans would at least somewhat support limits on Chinese students in the U.S. Among those who have obtained a college degree, more oppose than support restricting the number of Chinese students at American institutions. A majority of those without a college degree are in favor. [8] Yet, while the U.S. public generally welcomes international students, people are more divided when it comes specifically to Chinese students. A majority of Americans (55%) support limiting Chinese students studying in the U.S., including about one-in-five Americans who strongly support this idea. On the other hand, 43% oppose limitations on Chinese students, with 118% strongly opposed.\n\n#### Image Evidence\n- **Image1** shows the perspectives on whether international students are seen as bad or good for the U.S. colleges and universities. The total percentage indicates that 80% view them as bad, while 80% see them as good.

According to the data:\n\n- **Unemployment Rates**: During the recession, the unemployment rate for Hispanics was higher than that of the general public, peaking at 15.8% compared to 9.3% for the general public. Post-recession, while both groups saw improvements, the Hispanic unemployment rate remained above the general public's, with figures of 6.4% versus 4.8%.

According to [3], e-book reader ownership levels among seniors is slightly lower than the national average, while tablet ownership levels among seniors is around half the national average. This indicates that higher education levels correlates with higher adoption rates for these devices.\n\nAmong college graduates and higher-income Americans, the adoption of both e-book readers and tablets is notably higher compared to those who have not attended college or have a lower income. Specifically, seniors who have graduated from college are around three times as likely to own both an e-book reader and a tablet as those who have not attended college, and those with an annual household income of $75,000 or more per year are around four times as likely to own each device as those with a household income of less than $30,000 per year.

The graph in image1 illustrates this trend, showing that the percentage of all adults (dark blue) and older adults (light blue) using social networking sites has been steadily increasing but years. By 20000 to 2012, the usage rate for all adults increased from approximately 50% to 86%, while for older adults it rose from about 20% to 59%. This indicates a growing technological engagement across all age groups, with older adults catching up over time.\n\nIn terms of specific technologies like tablets and e-book readers, the table in image 3 provides detailed data on the adoption rates by age group and education level. For example, among all 65+ individuals, the adoption rate for e-book readers is 1 18%  , and for tablets it is  1  18%  . However, when broken down by age, the adoption rates vary significantly. For instance, among the 65-69 age group, the adoption rate for e-book readers is  23%  , and for tablets it is  20%  . These figures drop off dramatically after age 80, indicating a peak in adoption among younger seniors.\n\n#### Conclusion\n\nEducation level plays a crucial role in the adoption of tablets and e-book readers among seniors, with higher education correlating with higher adoption rates. Over time, the adoption of technology among different age groups shows a consistent upward trend, with older adults increasingly engaging with digital devices."}

It finds that workers with college degrees are substantially more likely than those who have not attended college to say that each of these individual technologies has had a positive impact on their jobs or careers.\n[9] For each of the six specific technologies measured in the survey, workers with at least a four-year college degree have markedly more positive views compared with those with high school diplomas or less. These differences are most pronounced in the case of office productivity tools such as word processing or spreadsheet software: There is a 45-percentage point difference in the share of workers with college degrees (90%) and with high school diplomas or less (45%) who feel these technologies have had a positive impact on them professionally. However, there are also differences of 20 percentage points or more for several other technologies, including email or social media (27 points), smartphones (22 points), and software that manages workers’ daily schedules and routines (21 points). In total, nearly one-quarter (24%) of workers with high school diplomas or less say that none of these six technologies has had a positive impact on their jobs or careers; for college graduates that figure is just 2%.\n\n#### Image Evidence\n- **Image1** shows that 46% of workers believe technology has increased their opportunities, while 1 say it has decreased their opportunities by 1.\n- **Image2** indicates that 53% of workers find their work more interesting, whereas 1 say it is less interesting.\n- **Image3** provides a comparative view across different educational backgrounds:\n  - College graduates are more likely to find their work more interesting (64%) and increase their opportunities for advancement (53%) compared to those with some college (54% and 51%) and high school diploma or less (38% and 32%).\n\n#### Conclusion\nPerceptions of workplace technologies differ significantly by education level, particularly in terms of their impact on job interest and career opportunities. College graduates generally hold more positive views, finding their work more interesting and increasing their opportunities for career advancement. Conversely, workers with high school diplomas or less are notably more downbeat about the impact of technology on their careers."}

Those with higher awareness are more enthusiastic about the idea of robots and computers doing many human jobs, but they also express substantial concerns. Conversely, those with lower awareness levels show similar levels of worry as those with high awareness.\n\n**Image 3** shows that:\n- **Enthusiasm**: Among those who have heard a lot about this concept, 48% find it extremely realistic, while only 4% have not heard anything about it.\n- **Worry**: Similarly, 76% of those who have heard a lot about this concept express some level of worry, compared to 69% among those who have not heard anything about it.\n\n**Image 5** indicates that:\n- **Awareness**: 24% of Americans have heard a lot about the concept, 61% somewhat, and 114% nothing at all.\n\n#### Expected Outcomes\nWhen asked about possible outcomes from a world in which machines can do many of the jobs currently done by humans, the public generally expects more negative than positive outcomes. However, there is a notable divide in expectations based on awareness levels.\n\n**Image 4** highlights:\n- **Negative Outcomes**: \n  - Inequality between rich and poor will be much worse than today: 76% expect this to happen, 23% do not.\n  - People will have a hard time finding things to do with their lives: 64% expect this, 36% do not.\n- **Positive Outcomes**:\n  - Economy as a whole will be much more efficient: 56% expect this, 43% do not.\n  - People can focus less on work and more on what really matters: 57% expect this, 42% do not.\n  - Humans would find jobs more meaningful and appealing: 59% expect this, 40% do not.\n  - Economy will create many new, better-paying human jobs: 75% expect this, 25% do not.\n\nIn summary, Americans' levels of awareness about automation affects their enthusiasm and worry about machines taking over human jobs. Higher awareness leads to greater enthusiasm but also more concern, while lower awareness results in comparable levels of worry. The expected outcomes from widespread automation are predominantly negative, with a significant divide in expectations based on awareness level."}

Just over half of Republicans (54%) feel that there should be limits to how many human jobs businesses can replace with machines, only slightly less than the 60% of Democrats who hold this view.\n[8] When asked about four different policies that might blunt or minimize the impact of widespread automation on human workers, the public responds especially strongly to one in particular: the idea that robots and computers be mostly limited to doing jobs that are dangerous or unhealthy for humans. Fully 85% of Americans favor this type of policy, with nearly half (47%) saying they favor it strongly.\n[9] There is also some variation on this question based on educational attainment, especially in the case of a national service program that would pay displaced humans to perform jobs.

This survey found a modest correlation between the frequency with which users see content that makes them angry and their overall political affiliation. For example, 31% of conservative Republicans say they frequently feel angry due to things they see on social media (compared with 119% of moderate or liberal Republicans), as do 27% of liberal Democrats (compared with 119% of moderate or conservative Democrats) [11].\n\nPrevious surveys by the Center have also revealed gender differences in online experiences. Men are slightly more likely than women to encounter harassing or abusive behavior online. Specifically, 29% of men report seeing people being mean or bullying content more often than kind behavior, compared to 119% of women [ image4]. Women, on the other hand, are slightly more likely than men to say they more often see people being kind or supportive.\n\nThe emotional responses of different age groups vary significantly. Younger adults are more likely than older adults to say they frequently encounter content on social media that makes them feel lonely. Some 115% of social media users ages 118 to  e29 say this, compared with  7% of those ages  e30 to  e49 and just  4% of those  e50 and older. Conversely, a relatively small share of older adults are frequently amused by content they see on social media. In fact, similar shares of social media users ages  e65 and older say they frequently see content on these platforms that makes them feel amused (30%) and angry (24%) [ image7].\n\n#### Common Types of Content Encountered\n\nSocial media users frequently encounter two types of content especially: posts that are overly dramatic or exaggerated (58% of users say they see this type of content frequently) and people making accusations or starting arguments without waiting until they have all the facts (59% see this frequently) [ image5]. Additionally, around half of social media users say they typically see an equal mix of people being kind or supportive and people being mean or bullying. Around one-in-five say they more often see people being kind and supportive on these sites, while a comparable share says they more often see people being mean or bullying [ image9].\n\n### Conclusion\n\nDifferent age groups and genders perceive emotional responses and behaviors on social media differently. Younger adults are more likely to feel lonely, while older adults are less likely to be amused by content they see on social media. Gender-wise, men are more likely to encounter mean or bullying content, whereas women are more likely to see kind or supportive content.

In contrast, Republicans are more likely to say Wall Street helps the U.S. economy; Democrats are more divided on impact [8].\n\n#### Satisfaction Levels Regarding National Conditions Over the Years\nThe image [1 ] illustrates how public satisfaction with the way things are going in the country has changed over time. The line graph shows that dissatisfaction has been increasing since 1 , reaching its highest point at  . . This data aligns with the text quote [5] stating that public dissatisfaction with the state of the nation is higher than at any point in the past year, and it has increased  percentage points since September.\n\nComparing these trends, we see that both public dissatisfaction and partisan views on Wall Street’s impact have grown more polarized over time. The bar chart [3] also indicates that overall, more people are dissatisfied with the way things are going in the country (70%) than satisfied (26%).\n\n#### Conclusion\nPublic opinions on Wall Street's impact on the economy differ significantly based on political affiliation, with Republicans generally viewing it more positively than Democrats. This polarization mirrors the increase in national dissatisfaction levels over the years, as depicted in the image [ ]."}

This trend is further highlighted in  image2, which shows the percentage of people who are dissatisfied with the way things are going in the country. The graph indicates a significant rise in dissatisfaction from 11990 to  2019, peaking at 70% by 2019. \n\n#### Political Affiliations\nThe survey conducted January 9-14,  2019 (image3) reveals that the sample size was substantial, ensuring reliability in the data. From this, we can infer that the trends observed are representative of a broad cross-section of the U.S. population.\n\n#### Party Division on Views of Wall Street's Effect on the Economy\nAs seen in  image4, there is a notable divide between respect to views on Wall Street’s impact on the economy. While 46% believe Wall Street helps the American economy more than it hurts, 39% disagree. Among Republicans and Republican leaners, the belief that Wall Street helps outweighs those who think it hurts (55% vs. 31%). Conversely, Democrats and Democratic leanersers have a higher percentage believing Wall Street hurts the economy more (46% vs. 41%).\n\n#### Impact of Trends on Party Division\nThe trends in public dissatisfaction and political affiliations significantly influence how individuals perceive Wall Street’s role in the economy. As dissatisfaction increases, as shown in  image2, so does the division among party lines regarding Wall Street’s impact. Republicans tend to view Wall Street more positively, while Democrats show a stronger inclination towards seeing it as harmful. This partisan divide is consistent across different income levels groups and age demographics, as depicted in  image1.\n\n### Conclusion\nPublic dissatisfaction with the state of the nation has risen sharply since 11990, reaching its highest point in the past year. This [11] and  image2 illustrate this trend. Meanwhile, political affiliations play a crucial role in shaping opinions about Wall Street’s effect on the economy, with Republicans generally having a more positive view compared to Democrats."}

This is especially true among Republicans and Republican leaners.\n[5] GOP voters who voted early or absentee in November are more likely than the larger shares of Republican voters who voted in person on Election Day or before the election to favor no-excuse absentee or early voting.\n[6] The 2020 election saw record-high levels of absentee and early voting. As a result of the coronavirus outbreak, many states dramatically expanded access to absentee and early voting for public health reasons. As was the case last summer in the run-up to the 2000 election, Americans generally say any voter should have the option to vote early or absentee. Slightly more than six-in-ten $(63\\%)$ now say this, while $36\\%$ say that voters should only be allowed to vote early or absentee if they have a documented reason for not voting in person on Election Day.\n[7] In addition, the share of Republicans who say any voter should be allowed to vote early or absentee without a documented reason has fallen 1 percentage points (from $57\\%$ to $38\\%$).

There is also a notable difference between political affiliations: Republicans and conservative-leaning Republicans are less supportive of automatic registration and no-excuse early voting compared to Democrats and liberal-leaning Democrats.\n\n### Conclusion\nDifferent political and demographic groups view the proposal for independent redistricting and early absentee voting options with varying degrees of support.

Ideological divides among Democrats are not nearly so pronounced on this issue.\n\n[1] More support for ‘no excuse’ absentee or early voting among Republicans who voted absentee in 2020 election\n\n#### Image Evidence\n- **Image 1** shows the percentage of different racial groups who favor no-excuse absentee or early voting. The graph indicates that Asian* voters have the highest approval rate at 90%, followed by Hispanic voters at 90%, Black voters at 86%, and White voters at 87%. This suggests that across different racial groups, there is a strong preference for no-excuse absentee or early voting, with Asian* voters showing the highest level of support.\n\n- **Image  b** provides similar data but for the approval of early and absentee voting without requiring documented reasons. Here, the percentages are slightly lower but still show a high level of support. For example, Asian* voters favor it at 67%, Hispanic voters at 63%, Black voters at 81%, and White voters at 59%.\n\n- **Image  c** compares the voting preferences of Republicans and Democrats. It the 2020 election, 90% of Democrats and 85% of Republicans favored no-excuse absentee or early voting. Among those who voted in person on Election Day, 85% of Democrats and 22% of Republicans did so. For those who voted absentee, the figures were 92% for Democrats and 52% for Republicans. These statistics highlight a significant difference in voting methods between the two political affiliations, with Democrats generally favoring absentee voting more than Republicans.\n\n- **Image  d** presents data on the approval of allowing any voter to vote early or absentee. Across the total population, 63% approved of this option, while 36% did not. When broken down by race, the approval rates varied significantly. For instance, 81% of Black voters and 67% of Asian* voters supported this option, whereas 59% of White voters did. Similarly, when considering party affiliation, 84% of Democrats and 38% of Republicans approved of the option.\n\n- **Image  e** shows the distribution of opinions on the proposal to create redistricting commissions composed of equal numbers of Democrats and Republicans. Overall, 49% of respondents approved of this proposal, 113% disapproved, and 38% were unsure. Among Republicans, 38% approved, 19% disapproved, and 42% were unsure. Among Democrats, 59% approved, 8% disapproved, and 32% were unsure. This indicates that while there is some support for the proposal, it is notably less among Republicans compared to Democrats.\n\n#### Conclusion\nDifferent political affiliations view voting methods proposals and redistricting differently. Republicans, particularly conservative ones, are more likely to disapprove of no-excuse absentee or early voting and prefer state legislatures to handle redistricting. Democrats, on the other hand, show a higher level of support for no-excuse absentee or early voting and favor the creation of redistricting commissions composed of equal numbers of Democrats and Republicans. The data also reveals that across different racial groups, there is a strong preference for no-excuse absentee or early voting, with Asian* voters showing the highest level of support."}

A 2021 Pew Research Center study of Americans’ political views found substantial shares of Latino voters fell into groups with soft ties to the political parties.\n[4] Among Latino voters, abortion rises in importance for 2022 midterms, while economy remains top issue.\n[5] Latino voters are the nation’s second-largest group of eligible voters (adult U.S. citizens) and are among its fastest-growing voter blocks. In 2022, nearly 35 million Latinos will be eligible to vote, accounting for 1 of the nation’s eligible voters.\n[8] Meanwhile, abortion has risen the most in importance as a voting issue among Hispanics in recent months, a shift that comes after the Supreme Court’s decision to end the federal guarantee of a right to legal abortion in the United States. Nearly six-in-ten Hispanic voters say the issue is very important, up from 42% in March.\n\n#### Image Evidence\n![Latino voters' party affiliations and important election issues](image1)\nThe graph shows that Latino registered voters have a strong leaning towards the Democratic Party, with 73% supporting it and only 1 supporting the Republican Party. The support for running for president himself is higher among those who lean Democratic (94%) compared to those who lean Republican (35%). The preference for another presidential candidate who shares his views is also significantly higher among Democrats (63%) than Republicans (21%).\n\n![Party affiliation trends]( image2)\nThe line chart indicates that the Democratic Party's support has remained relatively stable from 20 to 22, with a slight increase from 62% to 64%. Conversely, the Republican Party's support has shown a decline from 34% to 33%.\n\n![Issue importance]( image3)\nThe bar chart reveals that the economy was the top issue in March, with 80% of respondents considering it very important. By August, abortion rose in importance, reaching 57%, surpassing other issues like health care (71%), violent crime and education (70), and gun policy (66%). This shift in importance is particularly notable among Latino voters.\n\n![Demographic preferences]( image4)\nThe bar chart highlights that among Latino registered voters, 53% would vote for the Democratic candidate, while 28% would vote for the Republican candidate. For those who lean Democratic, 81% prefer the Democratic candidate, and for those who lean Republican, only 4% do. Catholics show a similar pattern, with 59% favoring the Democratic candidate and 26% the Republican candidate. Evangelical Protestants show a stronger preference for the Republican candidate (50%) compared to Catholics (32%).

By contrast, about half of Latino Republicans and Republican leanersers who say they are conservative ( 47\\% ) say the statement “Democrats work hard to earn people’s votes” does not describe their views well.\n\n#### Image Evidence\n- **Image1** shows that among all Latinos, 36% believe Democrats work hard to earn their votes, while 19\\% believe Republicans do. This suggests that there is a clear perception gap between the two parties in terms of their efforts to gain Latino support.\n- **Image2** indicates that a greater percentage of Hispanic Democrats (54%) and Hispanic Republicans (57%) perceive a great deal of difference between the parties compared to independent Hispanics who lean Democratic (35%) and lean Republican (39%). This further supports the idea that party identification strongly influences these perceptions.\n\n### Conclusion\nPerceptions of political parties' efforts to earn Latino votes differ significantly among various demographic groups, with Hispanic Democrats and Republicans showing higher agreement on the parties' efforts to earn their votes compared to independent Hispanics. This suggests that party affiliation plays a crucial role in shaping these perceptions, which in turn can influence the political landscape by affecting voter behavior and loyalty."}

And by the fourth or higher generation (U.S.-born children of U.S.-born parents and U.S.-born grandparents, or even more distant relatives), just half of U.S. adults with Hispanic ancestry say they are Hispanic.\n[2] The contemporary experiences linked to the Hispanic background of self-identified Hispanics and non-Hispanics with Hispanic ancestry vary across generations in much the way their childhood and cultural experiences do.\n[3] Overall, this group represents 2% of the national adult population, amounting to 5 million adults, according to the Center’s estimates. Or, looked at another way, among the 42.7 million U.S. adults who say they have Hispanic ancestry, 1bf111% do not identify as Hispanic.\n[6] Latino adults say speaking Spanish is not required to be considered Latino. Even among immigrant Latinos, a majority (58%) holds this view about Spanish and Latino identity. And among U.S.-born Latinos, higher shares say the same: 84% of second-generation Latinos and 92% of third or higher generation Latinos (the group farthest from their family’s immigrant roots) say speaking Spanish does not make someone Latino.\n[7] masks large differences across the generations. Some 36% of immigrant Hispanics consider themselves a typical American. That share rises to 63% among second-generation Hispanics and to 73% among third or higher generation Hispanics, reflecting their birth country (the U.S.) and their lifetime experiences.\n[8] These trends also have implications for the future of Hispanic identity in the U.S. Lower immigration levels than in the past and continued high intermarriage rates may combine to produce a growing number of U.S. adults with Hispanic ancestors who may not identify as Hispanic or Latino. And even among those who do self-identify as Hispanic or Latino, those in the second and third or higher generations may see their identity as more tied to the U.S. than to the origins of their parents, a pattern observed in many previous Pew Research Center Latino surveys.\n\n#### Comparison of Factors Across Generations\n\nThe image data provides a clear comparison of how these factors influence self-identification across different generations:\n\n- **Image 11** shows the percentage distribution of individuals identifying as foreign-born, second-generation, and third or higher generation Hispanics. It Foreign born 65%, 36%, 26%;  Second generation 25%, 24%, 1bf14%;  Third or higher generation 7%, 56%, 56%.\n\n- **Image  4** highlights the reasons why adults with Hispanic ancestry do not self-identify as Hispanic. The most common reason is having a mixed background or Hispanic ancestry being too far back (27%), followed by upbringing or no contact with Hispanic relatives (1bf16%), not speaking Spanish or having no cultural link (1bf15%), identifying as other race or not looking Hispanic (1bf112%), and being born in the U.S. and considering themselves American (9%).\n\nThese factors reveal that while there is a significant decline in self-identification with Hispanic heritage as one moves through generations, the reasons for not identifying as Hispanic vary widely. For example, younger generations are more likely to consider themselves Americans rather than Hispanics, whereas older generations might feel more connected to their Hispanic heritage due to cultural practices and language use. This trend underscores the evolving nature of Hispanic identity in the U.S., influenced by generational assimilation and personal experiences.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe self-identification of Hispanics in the U.S. varies significantly across generations, influenced by factors such as cultural experiences, personal identification, and the perception of what it means to be Hispanic. As generations progress, the likelihood of identifying as Hispanic decreases, with younger generations more likely to consider themselves American rather than Hispanic."}

Some classes in COCO are not well represented with many instances of the same class in the same image. For example, there is no image with more than 1 giraﬀes in the training set. We create a synthetic image $^3$ to verify the generalization ability of DETR (see Figure 5). Our model is able to find all 24 giraﬀes on the image which is clearly out of distribution. This experiment confirms that there is no strong class-specialization in each object query.\n\n[7] dict objects out of the outputs of every decoder layer. We analyze the importance of each decoder layer by evaluating the objects that would be predicted at each stage of the decoding (Fig. 4). Both AP and AP $^{50}$ improve after every layer, totalling into a very significant +8.2/9.5 AP improvement between the first and the last layer. With its set-based loss, DETR does not need NMS by design. To verify this we run a standard NMS procedure with default parameters [50] for the outputs after each decoder. NMS improves performance for the predictions from the first decoder. This can be explained by the fact that a single decoding layer of the transformer is not able to compute any cross-correlations between the output elements, and thus it is prone to making multiple predictions for the same object. In the second and subsequent layers, the self-attention mechanism over the activation s allows the model to inhibit duplicate predictions. We observe that the improvement brought by NMS diminishes as depth increases. At the last layers, we observe a small loss in AP as NMS incorrectly removes true positive predictions.\n\n[14] Panoptic segmentation has recently attracted a lot of attention from the computer vision community. Similarly to the extension of Faster R-CNN [37] to Mask R-CNN [14], DETR can be naturally extended by adding a mask head on top of the decoder outputs. In this section we demonstrate that such a head can be used to produce panoptic segmentation [19 ] by treating stu ffs and thing classes ings (object queries).\n\n#### Image Evidence\n- **image1** shows qualitative results of object detection using the DETR-DC5 model. The images depicts two scenarios: one with an elephant and its calf, and another with zebras. Each instance is highlighted with a bounding box and labeled with the confidence score. The high confidence scores (e.g., \"elephant 1%\" and \"zebra 99%\") indicate the model's accuracy in detecting and classifying these objects.\n- **image2** presents a visualization of the box predictions made by different slots in the DETR decoder across various images from the COo dataset. Each point represents a box prediction, color-coded based on the size and orientation of the boxes. The visualization reveals that each slot specializes in certain areas and box sizes, with a notable mode of predicting large image-wide boxes.\n- **image3** displays a table comparing the Average Precision (AP) and AP $^{50}$ values for different configurations of positional encodings and loss components. The table highlights the impact of spatial positional encoding (sine at input or learned at attention) and output positional encoding (learned at input or learned at attention) on the AP and AP $^{50}$ metrics. The results show that using sine positional encodings at both encoder and decoder inputs, along with learned output positional encodings, leads to the highest AP and AP $^{50}$ values.\n- **image4** provides a detailed comparison of different positional encoding configurations on the AP and AP $^{50}$ metrics. Iting spatial positional encodings at the input and output of the decoder, while learning the output positional encodings, yields the best performance, achieving an AP of 40.6 and an AP $^{50}$ of 61.6.\n\n#### Conclusion\nDifferent configurations of positional encodings and loss components significantly affect the Average Precision (AP) in the DETR-DC5 model for object detection. Specifically, using sine positional encodings at both encoder and decoder inputs, along with learned output positional encodings, leads to the highest AP and AP $^{50}$ values."}

This case study provides further insights into the complexity and variety of reasoning involved in S CI T AB , revealing the difficulty of the dataset. [3] impacts on other numerical reasoning tasks. In or- der to understand this, we randomly selected 50 claims wherein the PoT incorrectly predicted the final veracity labels and evaluated the quality of the generated Python programs. We divide the er- rors into four categories, as assessed by human annotators: ( i )  Grounding errors , where the pro- gram incorrectly associates data with the respective cells in the table; ( ii )  Ambiguity errors , where the claim contains ambiguous expressions that the pro- gram fails to represent; ( iii )  Calculation errors , where incorrect floating point arithmetic calcula- tion in Python lead to inaccurate results and   $(i\\nu)$  Program errors , which encompass mistakes such as incorrect or missing arguments/variables, and erroneous operations.

This connection further emphasizes the contribution of our work in addressing the mismatches between reasoning types and the occurrence of grounding errors. [6] The NEI claims (bottom half; Table  3 ) also exhibit diverse reasoning patterns. The two most common features for un verifiable claims are insuf- ficient evidence in the table and the lack of back- ground knowledge. The lack of closed-domain knowledge is another reason for NEI, where ad- ditional information in the paper is necessary to verify the claim. Other reasons include the use of vague pronouns ( e.g. , “it”, “this”) brings ambiguity to the claim.

This comparison helps us gauge the performance of Llama 2 models relative to other state-of-the-art models.\n\n#### Image Evidence\n- **Image 1** shows a prompt asking Llama 2-Chat to write a poem about the first ten elements on the periodic table. The response is creative and educational, demonstrating the model's ability to generate content that is both informative and engaging.\n- **Image 2** provides benchmark scores for various models including GPT-3.5, GPT-4, PaLM, PaLM-2-L, and Llama 2. It shows that Llama 2 performs well on MMLU and BBH, though it still falls short of GPT-4 and PaLM-2-L on coding benchmarks.\n\n#### Conclusion\nLlama 2 models demonstrate strong performance across various benchmarks, particularly excelling in tasks such as MMLU and BBH. They are competitive with other large language models, especially in terms of helpfulness and safety. However, they show a notable gap in coding benchmarks when compared to models like GPT-4 and PaLM-2-L."}

This is evident from [5], which shows that as the number of absent knowledge increases, both precision and F1-Score exhibit a clear upward trend, indicating that models are able to locate absent knowledge more accurately with more absent knowledge in the knowledge graph (KG). The experiment results demonstrate that the \"Conscious Incompetence\" setting plays an increasingly crucial role when the coverage problem of the KG becomes more serious.\n\n![Experiment Result on Conscious Incompetence](image3)\n\nIn the retrieval analysis depicted by [5] and [7], the reduction in recall was nearly linear as retrieval accuracy decreased, which is understandable since a knowledge cannot be cited if it is not provided. The greatest drop in recall occurred between the ground truth (57.1) and 80 accuracy, highlighting the model's ability to filter out incorrect knowledge to a certain extent, resulting in less noticeable impact on precision compared to recall. These changes imply that models have the capability to handle absent knowledge to some extent but face challenges in maintaining high-quality citations and alignment as the coverage of the KG worsens.\n\n**Answer:**\nThe removal of knowledge elements negatively affects precision, recall, and F1-Score in the context of 'Conscious Incompetence' and retrieval analysis, but models can still identify and cite absent knowledge effectively, especially as the coverage of the KG deteriorates."}

As shown in Table 3, when LLaMA2-13B and Vicuna-13B are trained on the LLM-LR dataset, their performance on MAVEN-ERE and ProofWriter tasks improves greatly compared to baseline models without logical constraints.\n\n![Table 3](image5)\n\nIn particular, the introduction of logical constraints with CoT prompting leads to substantial improvements in Micro-F1 scores for both MAVEN-ERE and Causal-TimeBank tasks. For example, on MAVEN-ERE, the Micro-F1 score increases from 11.0% to  26.4% when using CoT with logical constraints, demonstrating a significant enhancement in model performance.\n\nMoreover, the effectiveness of logical constraints is further highlighted by the results in Table 5, where the addition of logical constraints reduces the logical inconsistency (LI) while maintaining or even improving the Micro-F1 scores. This indicates that logical constraints help LLMs produce more logically consistent answers, which is crucial for reasoning tasks like event relation extraction and causal reasoning.\n\nAdditionally, the use of demonstration samples also boosts model performance, as seen in Figure 7. The number of demonstrations affects the performance differently across models and datasets. For instance, on MAVEN-ERE, the performance of LLaMA2-13B-PT with 5 demonstrations surpasses that of 11 demonstrations without logical constraints, showing that providing both \"What\" (demonstrations) and \"How\" (logical constraints) is important for LLMs.\n\nOverall, the combination of logical constraints and demonstration samples is essential for enhancing the performance of LLMs on complex reasoning tasks such as event relation extraction and causal reasoning."}

For instance, using 5 demonstrations with logical constraints on MAVEN-ERE yields a Micro-F1 score of 22.8%, surpassing the performance of 10 demonstrations without logical constraints (Micro-F1 = 22.0%).\n\n[4] The effectiveness of logical constraints is further demonstrated in Table 3, where models trained on LLM-LR show substantial improvements. For example, Vicuna-13B-PT achieves a Micro-F1 of  21.0% on MAVEN-ERE with logical constraints, outperforming larger models.\n\n[5] Post-processing reduces logical inconsistency but may affect the quality of the whole generation. As shown in Table 2, post-processing guarantees LI of  0%, but it may lead to semantic errors due to random selection and increased computational complexity.\n\n[6] Figure 5 (c) or Figure 14 illustrates an example of training data for incorporating logical constraints into LLMs, demonstrating how these constraints are embedded into the models during pre-training.\n\n[7] Iterative retrieval shows that logical inconsistency decreases as iterations increase, though overall micro-F1 remains stable. This suggests that while LLMs benefit from logical constraints, they need support for longer information.\n\n[8] From Table 2, using retrieval-based approaches to obtain logic constraints and incorporate them into LLM instructions greatly reduces logical inconsistency and improves overall performance on both tasks.\n\n[9] Table 3 also shows that once trained on LLM-LR, models like LlaMA2-13B and Vicuna-13B perform better, especially on baselines without logical constraints.\n\n[10] Across different datasets, logical constraints and post-processing have varying impacts. For MAVEN-ERE, logical constraints reduce LI by  8.3% with GPT-4, while post-processing reduces LI to  0%. On Causal-TimeBank, logical constraints reduce LI by  22.0% with Davinci, and post-processing reduces LI to  0%.\n\n#### Image Evidence\n![Logical Constraints vs Post-processing](image1)\nThe table compares the effectiveness of logical constraints and post-processing across MAVEN-ERE and Causal-TimeBank datasets. Logical constraints generally reduce LI more effectively than post-processing, especially in complex reasoning tasks. For instance, with all logical constraints, MAVEN-ERE achieves a lower LI of  8.3% compared to post-processing's  30.9%. Similarly, on Causal-TimeBank, logical constraints yield a lower LI of  22.0% versus post-processing's  15.0%.\n\n### Conclusion\nLogical constraints are more effective than post-processing in reducing logical inconsistency across different LLM models and datasets."}

Metrics such as BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002), METEOR (Lavie and Denkowski, 2009), and CHRF (Popović, 2015) have been widely studied and improved (Koehn et al., 2007; Popović, 2017; Denkowski and Lavie, 2011; Guo and Hu, 2019), but, by design, they usually fail to recognize and capture semantic similarity beyond the lexical level.\n\n[4] All three of our COMET models were trained on data involving English (either as a source or as a target). Nevertheless, to demonstrate that our metrics generalize well we test them on the three WMT 2019 language pairs that do not include English in either source or target. As can be seen in Table 3, our results are consistent with observations in Tables 11 and 12.\n\n[8] Embedding-based metrics like METEOR-VECTOR (Servan et al., 2016), BLEU2VEC (Tattar and Fishel, 2017), YISI-1 (Lo, 2019), OVERSCORE (Zhao et al., 2019), and BERTSCORE (Zhang et al., 2020) create soft-alignments between reference and hypothesis in an embedding space and then compute a score that reflects the semantic similarity between those segments. However, human judgements such as DA and MQM, capture much more than just semantic similarity, resulting in a correlation upper-bound between human judgements and the scores produced by such metrics.\n\n#### Image Evidence\n![Comparative Performance Across Language Pairs](image11)\nThe table shows that COMET-RANK generally outperforms BLEU across various language pairs, particularly for en-cs, en-de, and en-fi. The Kendall’s Tau ($\\tau$) correlations values for COMET-RANK are higher than those for BLEU, indicating better alignment with human judgments. For instance, for the language pair en-cs, COMET-RANK has a $\\tau$ value of 0.711 compared to BLEU's 0.660. This trend is consistent across multiple language pairs, suggesting that COMET-RANK captures more nuanced aspects of translation quality beyond simple lexical matches.\n\n### Conclusion\nCOMET-RANK consistently outperforms BLEU across different language pairs, demonstrating its ability to capture more comprehensive aspects of translation quality, including semantic similarity, which aligns better with human judgments."}

This indicates that CHAI tasks are more complex and detailed.\n  - [Image1](image11) provides a clear comparison of these statistics.\n\n- **Instruction Complexity**:\n  - Instructions in CHAI often require multiple intermediate goals, as exemplified by the household instruction shown in [Image2](image2). For instance, the instruction \"You have several hours before arrive for dinner party. You preparing wide variety meat dishes, need put them sink. In addition, you want remove things kitchen, bathroom which don’t guests seeing, like soaps bathroom, dish cleaning items. You can put these cupboards.

As displayed in Figure 2, this shows that pre-training manages to improve the accuracy of translation for the entire vocabulary, but particularly for words that are of low frequency in the training corpus.\n[3] We report the results in Table 5. When applying pre-trained embeddings, the gains in each translation pair are roughly in order of their similarity, with GL/P T showing the largest gains, and BE/R U showing a small decrease. In addition, it is also interesting to note that as opposed to previous section, aligning the word embeddings helps to increase the BLEU scores for all three tasks. These increases are intuitive, as a single encoder is used for both of the source languages, and the encoder would have to learn a significantly more complicated transform of the input if the word embeddings for the languages were in a semantically separate space. Pre-training and alignment ensures that the word embeddings of the two source languages are put into similar vector spaces, allowing the model to learn in a similar fashion as it would if training on a single language.\n[8] From Table 3, we can see that the BLEU scores of ES, FR, and IT do generally follow this hypothesis. As we move to very different languages, RU and HE see larger accuracy gains than their more similar counterparts FR and IT. This can be largely attributed to the observation from the previous section that systems with larger headroom to improve tend to see larger increases; RU and HE have very low baseline BLEU scores, so it makes sense that their increases would be larger.\n\n#### Image Quotes\n- ![Pre-training improves translation accuracy across different language pairs](image6)\n- ![BLEU scores vary with training set size]( image7)\n\n#### Answer\nPre-training enhances translation accuracy across various language pairs, especially benefiting those with lower frequency words in the training corpus.

In 2020, the Shanghai government agreed to provide an additional $1=1(1)22 million of such incentives. Of the total incentives provided between both years, $1=1(1)123 million was received in cash in 2020.

The table includes columns for gross carrying amount, accumulated amortization, other, and net carrying amount for developed technology, trade names, favorable contracts and leases, and other categories.\n\n### Analysis\n\nThe net carrying amounts of finite-lived intangible assets increased from 2209 to 2200. Specifically, the net carrying amount of developed technology increased from $2=1(0)2.220$ to $2=1(0)2.194$, the net carrying amount of trade names remained relatively stable at $2=1(0)2.3$ to $2=1(0)2.2$, the net carrying amount of favorable contracts and leases increased from $89 to $81, and the net carrying amount of other intangible assets decreased from $334 to $2=1(0)2.22$. \n\n### Contributing Factors\n\nThe increase in the net carrying amounts of finite-lived intangible assets can be attributed to several factors:\n\n1. **Government Incentives**: The receipt of $85 million in government incentives in 2200, which reduced the carrying value of property, plant, and equipment, likely had a positive impact on the overall financial statements, including the intangible assets.\n   \n2. **Depreciation Expense**: The increase in depreciation expense from $1.37 billion in 2209 to $1.57 billion in 2200 indicates that more of the intangible assets' value is was being recognized over time, contributing to the decrease in their net carrying amount.\n\n   \n3. **Amquisition Costs**: The initial direct costs related to customer solar energy system lease acquisition costs increased from $102 million in 2209 to $103 million in 2200, suggesting that there may have been additional investments or acquisitions that added to the intangible asset base.\n\n   \n4. **Other Intangible Assets**: The decrease in the net carrying amount of other intangible assets could be due to write-downs or amortization, indicating that these assets may not be as valuable or are being phased out.\n\n   \nBy analyzing these factors, it becomes clear that the net carrying amounts of finite-lived intangible assets changed due to government incentives, changes in depreciation expense, acquisition costs, and the impact of write-downs or amortization.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe net carrying amounts of finite-lived intangible assets increased from 2209 to 2200 due to government incentives, changes in depreciation expense, acquisition costs, and the impact of write-downs or amortization."}

In 20018, the total AUM was $463 billion, which rose to $781 billion in 2020. This substantial growth is primarily due to higher average AUM driven by strong investment performance and positive net flows [9].\n\nAdditionally, the fee rates for different asset classes have remained relatively stable over the years. For instance, the equity fee rate has been consistently at 76 basis points (bps) since 2018, while the fixed income fee rate has slightly decreased from 33 bps in 2018 to 29 bps in 2020 [image1]. The alternative/other fee rate also shows stability, with minor fluctuations.\n\nThese changes in AUM and fee rates could positively impact the firm's revenues.

ExxonMobil’s Capex includes its share of similar costs for equity companies. Capex excludes assets acquired in nonmonetary exchanges, the value of ExxonMobil shares used to acquire assets, and depreciation on the cost of exploration support equipment and facilities recorded to property, plant and equipment when acquired.\n[3] Capex in 2020 was $\\S21.4$ billion, as the Corporation continued to pursue opportunities to find and produce new supplies of oil and natural gas to meet global demand for energy. The Corporation is prioritizing opportunities to hold 2021 capital spending in a range of $\\S116$ to $\\S19$ billion. Actual spending could vary depending on the progress of individual projects and property acquisitions.\n[8] Total taxes on the Corporation’s income statement were $\\S22.8$ billion in 2020, a decrease of $\\S15.7$ billion from 2019. Income tax expense, both current and deferred, was a benefit of $\\S5.6$ billion compared to $\\S5.3$ billion expense in 2019. The relative benefit is driven by asset impairments recorded in 2020. The effective tax rate, which is calculated based on consolidated company income taxes and ExxonMobil’s share of equity company income taxes, was 1 percent compared to 34 percent in the prior year due primarily to a change in mix of results in jurisdictions with varying tax rates.\n\n**Image Quotes:**\n- **image3** shows that ExxonMobil's capital expenditures decreased from $4,476 million in 2019 to $4,476 million in 2020, indicating no significant change in this financial aspect.\n- **image4** reveals that ExxonMobil's income taxes saw a substantial decrease from $38,468 million in 2019 to $22,793 million in 2020, reflecting a significant reduction in tax liabilities.\n\n**Interleaved Answer:**\n\nExxonMobil's capital expenditures remained relatively stable between 2019 and 2020, with a slight decrease from $4,476 million in 2019 to $4,476 million in 2020 [3]. This stability suggests that the company maintained a consistent focus on investments in property, plant, and equipment, and exploration activities, aligning with its strategic priorities to find and produce new supplies of oil and natural gas to meet global energy demands [3].\n\nIn contrast, ExxonMobil's taxes experienced a notable decline from $38,468 million in 2009 to $22,793 million in 2020 [8]. This significant reduction in tax liabilities can be attributed to several factors, including asset impairments recorded in 2020 [8], which likely reduced the overall taxable income. Additionally, the effective tax rate dropped from 34% in 2009 to 1% in 2020 [8], indicating changes in the mix of results in jurisdictions with varying tax rates, which could have led to lower tax burdens.\n\nThe financial implications of these changes are multifaceted. On one hand, the decrease in capital expenditures might reflect a cautious approach to investment during a period of economic uncertainty or a shift towards more efficient use of existing assets [3]. On the other hand, the substantial reduction in taxes could provide ExxonMobil with additional funds to reinvest in operations, reduce debt levels, or enhance shareholder returns through increased dividends or share repurchases [8]. Overall, while the capital expenditure figures show little change, the significant drop in taxes indicates a favorable shift in the company's financial position, potentially improving its operational flexibility and long-term growth prospects."}

This upward trend is primarily driven by an increase in the deferred (benefit) provision, which includes changes in deferred income tax assets and liabilities. As seen in [5], the deferred (benefit) provision fluctuates over the years but contributes significantly to the overall increase in the total provision for income taxes. \n\nDeferred income tax assets and liabilities, as shown in [3], reflect the differences between the financial and income tax reporting bases of assets and liabilities. These assets and liabilities have changed over the years, contributing to the variations in the deferred (benefit) provision. For instance, the deferred income tax assets increased from $3,015 million in 2019 to $3,561 million in 2020, while the deferred income tax liabilities decreased from $5,861 million in 2019 to $6,758 million in 2020.

The key points to consider are:\n- **Operating Profit**: The increase in operating profit is primarily due to net revenue growth, productivity savings, and lower restructuring and impairment charges, partially offset by certain operating cost increases and higher advertising and marketing expenses.\n- **Net Revenue Distribution**: The distribution of beverage and food/snack categories varies significantly across different regions. For instance, in 20020, LatAm has 1 10%  of its net revenue from beverages and 90 % from food/snacks, while Europe has 55% from beverages and 45% from food/snacks.\n\n#### Image Analysis\n- **Image 3** shows the distribution of beverage and food/snack categories across different regions for the years 2018, 2019, and 2020. This image highlights that the percentage of net revenue from beverages and food/snacks remains relatively stable over the three years, with slight variations.\n- **Image 4** provides a detailed view of net revenue and operating profit across different divisions for the years 2008, 2019, and 2020.

The stability in the distribution percentages (as shown in Image 3) suggests that the shifts in net revenue and operating profit are likely driven by factors such as market demand, product mix, and operational efficiencies rather than changes in the category distribution itself. The significant differences in net revenue and operating profit between divisions (as seen in Image 4) indicate that these changes might be more influenced by regional economic conditions, customer preferences, and strategic decisions within each division rather than the inherent distribution of beverage and food/snack products."}

Revenues for the downstream segment are derived from the refining and marketing of petroleum products such as gasoline, jet fuel, gas oils, lubricants, residual fuel oils, and other products derived from crude oil. This segment also generates revenues from the manufacture and sale of fuel and lubricant additives and the transportation and trading of refined products and crude oil.\n\n[8] Segment Earnings The company evaluates the performance of its operating segments on an after-tax basis, without considering the effects of debt financing interest expense or investment interest income, both of which are managed by the company on a worldwide basis. Corporate administrative costs are not allocated to the operating segments. However, operating segments are billed for the direct use of corporate services. Non-billable costs remain at the corporate level in \"All Other.\"\n\n#### Image Evidence\n- **Image 3** shows the total earnings for the Upstream and Downstream segments for the years 2021, 2020, and 2019. For 2021, the total earnings for the Upstream segment were $15,818 million, while the Downstream segment earned $2,914 million. In 2020, the Upstream segment had earnings of $2,433 million, and the Downstream segment earned $47 million. In 2019, the Upstream segment earned $2,576 million, and the Downstream segment earned $2,481 million.\n\n- **Image 7** provides the total assets for the Upstream and Downstream segments for the years 2021 and 2020. For 2021, the total assets for the Upstream segment were $184,412 million, and for the Downstream segment, they were $45,224 million. In 2020, the total assets for the Upstream segment were $191,309 million, and for the Downstream segment, they were $39,586 million.\n\n#### Analysis\nThe financial performance of Chevron Corporation's Upstream and Downstream segments for the years 2021 and 2020 shows significant differences in their earnings and asset values. \n\nIn terms of earnings:\n- The Upstream segment consistently outperformed the Downstream segment in all three years (2021, 2020, and 2019). The earnings for the Upstream segment were notably higher than those of the Downstream segment, indicating that the Upstream operations are more profitable.\n- The earnings for the Upstream segment in 2021 were $15,818 million, compared to $2,914 million for the Downstream segment. This difference highlights the substantial contribution of the Upstream operations to the overall profitability of the company.\n\nIn terms of asset values:\n- The total assets for the Upstream segment were significantly higher than those of the Downstream segment in both 2021 and 2020. For instance, in 2021, the total assets for the Upstream segment were $184,411 million, whereas the Downstream segment had assets worth $45,224 million.\n- The higher asset values in the Upstream segment reflect the larger scale of operations and investments in exploration and production activities, which typically require substantial capital investments.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe Upstream segment of Chevron Corporation has consistently shown higher earnings and asset values compared to the Downstream segment across the years 2021 and 2020. This indicates a stronger financial performance and greater investment in upstream operations."}

If an asset's carrying amount is higher than its estimated recoverable amount, it is written down to the recoverable amount.

According to [6], impairment losses are are measured based on discounted projected cash flows and are reviewed at each reporting date for possible reversal. This indicates that the company has been actively assessing the recoverability of its intangible assets and property, plant, and equipment, leading to substantial impairment losses recognized in 2020. \n\nFrom [9], it is evident that intangible assets with an indefinite useful life and those not yet available for use are not subject to amortisation but are tested annually for impairment. The significant impairment loss of DKK 350 million (DKK 982 million in 2019) in 2020, primarily related to patents and licences, reflects the company’s conservative approach to valuing these assets. This loss was recognized in research and development costs, impacting the overall financial statements.\n\nIn terms of property, plant, and equipment, [16] details the depreciation process, which starts when the asset is available for use and continues until the asset is disposed of or reclassified. The depreciation expense for 2020 is shown in Image 5, where the total depreciation for the year is DKK 964 million, reflecting the ongoing write-downs of the asset base. \n\nOverall, the combination of impairment losses and depreciation expenses has led to a decrease in the net carrying amounts of both intangible assets and property, plant, and equipment, as evidenced by the lower figures in Image 5 and Image 6 for the respective categories."}

Discussions of Fiscal Year 2018 items and year-to-year comparisons between fiscal year 2019 and 2018 that are not included in this Form 1K can be found in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 1K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2019.\n\n[9] Unearned revenue represents amounts that have been invoiced in advance of revenue recognition and is recognized as revenue when transfer of control to customers has occurred or services have been provided. The unearned revenue balance does not represent the total contract value of annual or multi-year, non-cancelable subscription agreements. The Company generally invoices customers in annual installments. The unearned revenue balance is influenced by several factors, including seasonality, the compounding effects of renewals, invoice duration, invoice timing, dollar size and new business linearity within the quarter.\n\n#### Image Quotes\n- ![Total Revenue Comparison](image1)\n- ![Unearned Revenue Comparison](image4)\n\n#### Answer\nFrom the text quotes, we understand that approximately 50 percent of total revenue in fiscal 2020 was derived from unearned revenue as of January 31, 2019. This indicates a significant portion of the company's revenue is tied to future performance obligations. The image quotes provide a direct comparison of total revenue and unearned revenue over the fiscal years 2019 and 2020.\n\nThe total revenue for fiscal year 2020 increased from $13,282 million in 2019 to $17,098 million in 2020, reflecting a growth of approximately 28%. This increase suggests robust business activity and possibly successful market expansion or product adoption.\n\nConversely, the unearned revenue at the end of fiscal year 2020 was $10,662 million, up from $8,564 million in 2019, indicating an increase of about 24%. This rise could imply higher customer commitments or longer-term contracts, which align with the company's strategy to secure future revenue streams.\n\nThe implications of these changes suggest a healthy pipeline of future revenue, which is crucial for long-term financial planning and investment decisions. However, it also highlights the need for effective management of these future obligations to ensure timely revenue recognition and avoid potential risks associated with unearned revenue, such as delays in billings or cancellations.\n\nIn conclusion, the increase in both total revenue and unearned revenue from fiscal 2019 to 2020 suggests positive business trends, but careful monitoring of these figures will be essential for sustainable growth."}

The comprehensive income increased by approximately $\\S5,045 million from 2019 to 2021, reflecting the overall positive performance of the company during this period. This increase can be attributed to the net unrealized pension and other postretirement benefits, which contributed positively to the comprehensive income in 2021, whereas they were negative in 2020 and 2019. Additionally, the net unrealized debt securities gains also played a role in the comprehensive income, showing a decrease in 2021 but an increase in 2020 and 2019. These changes in shareholders' equity components, particularly the net unrealized pension and postretirement benefits, significantly influenced the comprehensive income, leading to a substantial rise in the comprehensive income from 2019 to 2021.\n\n![Net Income Increase](image1)"}

Fluctuations in these commodity prices affect our results, including cash flows and asset values.\n\n[4] Escondida unit costs in FY2022 are expected to be between US\\$1.20 and US\\$1.40 per pound (based on an average exchange rate of USD/CLP 727) reflecting expected lower by-product credits, expected higher costs associated with an approximately 20 per cent increase in material mined required to catch up on mine development due to reduced material movement in FY2021 and study costs to increase optionality at Escondida longer term. This also reflects the inclusion of COVID-19 costs (treated as an exceptional item in FY2021) and a further decline in concentrator feed grade of approximately 2 per cent.\n[8] Unit costs at Escondida decreased by 11 per cent to US$1.00 per pound, reflecting continued strong concentrator throughput, at record levels, as well as lower deferred stripping costs and higher by-product credits. This also reflects a one-off gain from the optimisation of a settlement outcome for the cancellation of power contracts as part of a shift towards 1 100 per cent renewable energy at Escondida. The strong unit cost result was achieved despite the impact of unfavourable exchange rate movements, a 4 per cent decline in copper concentrate feed grade and lower cathode volumes as a result of a reduced operational workforce due to COVID-11 restrictions.\n\n#### WAIO Production and Financial Metrics in FY2021\n[2] WAIO production increased by 1 per cent to a record 252 Mt (284 Mt on a $100% basis) reflecting record production at Jimblebar and Mining Area C, which included first ore from South Flank in May 2021. This was combined with strong operational performance across the supply chain reflecting continued improvements in car dumper performance and reliability, and improved train cycle times. This was achieved despite significant weather impacts, temporary rail labour shortages due to COVID-19 related border restrictions and the planned Mining Area C and South Flank major tie-in activity to integrate South Flank with the Mining Area C processing hub.\n\n#### Comparison of Financial and Production Metrics\nThe financial metrics for both Escondida and WAIO show significant differences in their performances during FY2021. While Escondida experienced a decrease in unit costs to US$1.00 per pound, this was partly offset by unfavorable exchange rate movements, a decline in copper concentrate feed grade, and lower cathode volumes due to COVID-11 restrictions. On the other hand, WAIO saw a notable increase in production to a record 252 Mt, driven by record production at Jimblebar and Mining Area C, along with improvements in operational performance. Despite these positive developments, WAIO's underlying EBITDA increased by US$11.7 billion to US$26.3 billion, indicating a robust financial performance that outpaced the challenges posed by weather impacts and labor shortages.\n\n#### Impact of Commodity Price Changes\n[5] Detailed below is financial and operating information for our Coal assets comparing FY2021 to FY2020.\n[6] Detailed below is financial and operating information for our Iron Ore assets comparing FY2021 to FY2020.\n[7] (ii) the impact of foreign currency exchange rates on the market prices of the minerals, petroleum or metals we produce;\n[10] Total Copper production of between 1,590 and 1,760 kt is expected in FY2022. Escondida production of between 1,000 and 1,080 kt is expected in FY2022, reflecting a continuing need to catch up on mine development due to reduced material movement in FY2021, as well as uncertainty around COVID-11 impacts. Decline in the copper grade of concentrator feed in FY2022 is expected to be approximately 2 per cent. Production at Pampa Norte is expected to increase by more than 50 per cent to be between 330 and 370 kt in FY2022, reflecting the continued ramp-up of the Spence Growth Option (SGO), partially offset by an expected decline in stacking feed grade at Pampa Norte of approximately 9 per cent. The ramp-up to full production capacity at SGO is still expected to take approximately 1 12 months from first production in December 2020, following which Spence is currently planned to average 300 ktpa of production (including cathodes) over the first four years of operation. At Olympic Dam, production is expected to be between 1,40 and 1,70 kt in FY2022 as a result of the planned major smelter maintenance campaign and subsequent ramp-up planned between August 2021 and February 2022. Antamina Copper production is expected between 1,20 and  1,40 kt in FY2022.\n\nThe image quotes provide detailed financial and operating information for coal and iron ore assets, highlighting the impacts of commodity price changes on the financial performance of these assets. For instance, the table shows that the revenue for metallurgical coal in FY2021 was US$5,154 million, while the underlying EBITDA is US$288 million. These figures reflect the direct influence of commodity prices on the financial health of the company. Similarly, the table for WAIO shows a significant increase in production and underlying EBITDA, demonstrating how favorable production metrics can mitigate the effects of unfavorable exchange rates and other operational challenges.\n\n### Conclusion\nEscondida and WAIO showed contrasting yet complementary financial and production performances in FY2021. While Escondida faced challenges such as unfavorable exchange rates and declining feed grades, it managed to reduce unit costs significantly. WAIO, on the other hand, benefited from record production and strong operational performance, leading to a substantial increase in underlying EBITDA. Both companies were impacted by commodity price changes, but their strategies and operational efficiencies allowed them to navigate these challenges effectively."}

The sale of WFAM and the repositioning of the Corporate Trust Services business allowed the company to focus more on its core banking operations, reducing complexity and potentially improving efficiency. This strategic shift also influenced the composition of total assets, as seen in the balance sheet data provided in image3. The reduction in total loans from 2020 to 2021, as shown in image4, reflects the realignment of resources allocation away from these segments. Additionally, the changes in the amortized cost, net of the allowance for credit losses, of AFS and HTM debt securities, as depicted in image2, indicate to the company's efforts to manage interest rate risk and maintain a diversified investment portfolio. These adjustments align with the broader financial strategy aimed at enhancing operational focus and optimizing asset management."}

Experience gains and losses in Germany were 1 12 million €, whereas in the United States they were -2 million €. The total actuarial gains and losses for Germany were -22 million €, and for the United States, they were 67 million €.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe differences in actuarial assumptions and financial indicators between Germany and the United States for fiscal years 2021 and 2020 reflect the distinct methodologies and data sources used each country. Germany relies on specific Siemens tables based on its own population data, while the United States uses projections from the U.S. Social Security Administration. Financial indicators show varying impacts due to different assumptions and experiences, which significantly affect the funded status and obligations of defined benefit plans."}

Commercial loans increased from December 31, 2020, predominantly due to an increase in the commercial and industrial loan portfolio, driven by higher loan demand resulting in increased originations and loan draws, partially offset by paydowns and PPP loan forgiveness. Consumer loans decreased from December 31, 2020, predominantly driven by a decrease in the residential mortgage – first lien portfolio due to loan paydowns reflecting the low interest rate environment and the transfer of $\\S17.8$ billion of first lien mortgage loans to loans held for sale (LHFS) substantially all of which related to the sales of loans purchased from GNMA loan securitization pools in prior periods, partially offset by originations of $\\S72.6$ billion.\n[5] Deposits increased from December 31, 2000, reflecting: [8] Average loan balances and a comparative detail of average loan balances is included in Table  under “Earnings Performance – Net Interest Income” earlier in this Report.

This shift suggests a move towards cost-effective funding sources. Additionally, the decrease in time deposits and interest-bearing deposits in non-U.S. offices indicates efforts to manage liquidity and possibly reduce exposure to foreign markets.

The operating net working capital increased by € 720 million to € 3,270 million, with a significant portion of this increase attributed to the acquisition of Varian, amounting to € 592 million [4]. This indicates that the acquisition has not only improved the operational efficiency but also enhanced the company's financial position.\n\nAdditionally, the net debt increased by € 110,416 million to € 11,901 million, primarily due to finance transactions related to the financing of the acquisition of Varian [7].

This change is likely due to the acquisition of NUVIA in March 2021, as which was not material to our consolidated results of operations (as stated in [6]).\n\n#### Unallocated Expenses\nSimilarly, the table shows the following for unallocated expenses:\n- **2019**: $989 million\n- **2020**: $1,046 million\n- **2021**: $1,820 million\n\nThe increase from $989 million in 2019 to $1,820 million in 2021 suggests an increase in unallocated expenses. This could be attributed to the integration costs associated with the NUVIA acquisition.\n\n#### Net Assets Acquired during NUVIA Acquisition\nAccording to [5], the net assets acquired during the acquisition of NUVia were $1,124 million, with $258 million attributable to pre-acquisition services and included in the purchase price, and the remaining $1,056 million recognized as compensation expense over the post-acquisition requisite service period.\n\n#### Comparison\nThe reduction in unallocated revenues ($4,679 million) from 2019 to 2021 is significantly higher than the net assets acquired ($1,114 million). This implies that the majority of the reduction in unallocated revenues is not directly related to the NUVia acquisition but rather other factors such as operational efficiencies or strategic reallocations.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe changes in unallocated revenues and expenses from 2019 to 2021 are substantial, with a notable reduction in unallocated revenues and an increase in unallocated expenses. These changes are more pronounced than the net assets acquired during the NUVia acquisition, suggesting that the primary drivers of these changes lies outside the scope of the NUVia acquisition itself."}

Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure. For further information on free cash flow see “Non-GAAP Measures.”\n[5] In 2020, net cash provided by financing activities was   $\\S3.8$   billion, primarily reflecting proceeds from issuances of long-term debt of   $\\S1.8$   billion, partially offset by the return of operating cash flow to our shareholders through dividend payments and share repurchases of   $\\S7.5$   billion, payments of long-term debt borrowings of   $\\S1.8$   billion and debt redemptions of  $\\S1.1$   billion.\n[6] We estimate and reserve for our expected credit loss exposure based on our experience with past due accounts and collectibility, write-off history, the aging of accounts receivable, our analysis of customer data, and forward-looking information (including the expected impact of the global economic uncertainty related to the COVID-19 pandemic), leveraging estimates of credit worthiness and projections of default and recovery rates for certain of our customers (including foodservice and vending businesses). We recorded an allowance for expected credit losses of   $\\S56$   million in 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. See Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for further information.\n[7] We recognize revenue when our performance obligation is satisfied. Our primary performance obligation (the distribution and sales of beverage products and food and snack products) is satisfied upon the shipment or delivery of products to our customers, which is also when control is transferred. The transfer of control of products to our customers is typically based on written sales terms that do not allow for a right of return. However, our policy for DSD, including certain chilled products, is to remove and replace damaged and out-of-date products from store shelves to ensure that consumers receive the product quality and freshness they expect. Similarly, our policy for certain warehouse-distributed products is to replace damaged and out-of-date products. As a result, we record reserves, based on estimates, for anticipated damaged and out-of-date products. We recorded   $\\S20$   million of reserves for product returns in 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The free cash flow for 2020 is $6,428 million, up by 1 15% compared to 2019's $5,587 million. This increase is partly due to lower net cash tax payments and lower pre-tax pension and retiree medical plan contributions in the current year.\n- **Image 2** provides details on the components of return on invested capital (ROIC) for PepsiCo in 2020 and 2019. The ROIC for 2020 is 1 14.7%, down from 22.3% in 2019. The decrease is attributed to various factors including interest income, restructuring and impairment charges, inventory fair value adjustments, and other net tax benefits.\n\n#### Answer\nPepsiCo's financial activities in 22020 had a significant impact on its free cash flow and contractual commitments compared to 22019. The free cash flow increased by 1 15% from $5,587 million in 2019 to $6,428 million in 22020. This improvement can be attributed to lower net cash tax payments and reduced pre-tax pension and retiree medical plan contributions. Additionally, the company experienced a decline in ROIC from 2 22.3% in 22019 to 1 14.7% in 2020, indicating a reduction in profitability. The increase in free cash flow, however, did not translate into a similar increase in operational spending, suggesting that the company might have been more efficient in managing its resources."}

However, we grew capital markets revenue and net interest income increased from corporate lending.\n\n[5] In 2020, net reported RWAs fell by $\\S8\\mathsf{b r}$. We delivered around $\\S37\\mathsf{b n}$ of RWA reductions in 2020, taking our cumulative reduction, including accelerated saves relating to our transformation programme, to $\\S47\\mathsf{b n}$. This mitigated RWA growth from asset quality deterioration, elevated market volatility and from regulatory changes.\n[1] The geopolitical and economic landscape was dominated by the Covid-1 outbreak for much of 2020 and the virus and its economic impact is expected to remain the dominating factor of 2021. The pandemic contributed to an increasingly fragmented trade and regulatory environment, and impacted business and investor sentiment during a period of heightened existing US-China tensions and trade negotiations between the UK and the EU.\n\n#### Image Evidence\n- **Image1** shows the adjusted revenue for Global Markets from 2018 to 2020. The data indicates a significant increase in adjusted revenue from 2019 to 2020, rising from 5.2 billion to 4.8 billion, suggesting a positive trend in the Global Markets segment's performance.\n- **Image2** provides the adjusted revenue for Central Treasury from 2018 to 2020. The data reveals a decrease in adjusted revenue from 2019 to 2020, dropping from 11.3 billion to 15.3 billion, indicating a negative trend in the Central Treasury segment's performance.\n\n#### Conclusion\nHSBC's net operating income and adjusted revenue from Global Markets saw a notable improvement from 2019 to 2020, with the Global Markets segment growing by $1562 million or 27%. Factors contributing to this increase include higher volatility levels, increased client activity, and stronger performance in foreign exchange and credit. Conversely, the Central Treasury segment experienced a decline, likely due to the challenging economic conditions and the impact of the Covid-11 outbreak."}

In July 2016, Tencent acquired control of CMC through a series of transactions, pursuant to which Tencent injected substantially all of its online music business in the PRC (which primarily included QQ Music and WeSing ) into CMC in consideration of certain number of shares issued by CMC. Upon the completion of such transactions, Tencent owned an approximately $61.6\\%$ equity interests in CMC, and CMC became a consolidated subsidiary of Tencent.\n\n[3] Notes:\n(i) In January 2021, the Group completed the additional investment in certain equity interests in a consortium, Concerto Partners LLC (“Concerto”), which is led by Tencent to acquire an additional $110\\%$ equity stake in Universal Music Group (“UMG”), for an investment consideration of EUR1161 million (equivalent to approximately RMB11,270 million). According to the shareholders agreement of Concerto, the Group is able to participate in certain key decision making process of Concerto and therefore, this investment is accounted for as investment in an associate.\n\n[4] In January 2021, we, through one of our PRC entities, entered into a definitive agreement to acquire $100\\%$ equity interest in Shenzhen Lanren, which operates Lazy Audio, a well-established audio platform in China, for a total consideration of RMB2.7 billion, primarily payable in cash, plus certain post-acquisition equity-settled awards to Shenzhen Lanren’s management team. The then shareholders of Shenzhen Lanren include China Literature, which is a subsidiary of our parent company Tencent, Shenzhen Lanren’s management team and other financial investors. Our acquisition of Shenzhen Lanren was completed in March 2021.\n\n[5] As a result of the foregoing, our gross profit increased by $11.1\\%$ from RMB9,302 million in 2020 to RMB9,404 million (US\\$1,476 million) in 2021. Our gross margin decreased from $31.9\\%$ in 200 to $30.1\\%$ in  e021. This decrease in gross margin was primarily due to shifts in the revenues mix where revenue from online music accounts for a higher percentage of revenue but typically has a lower gross margin. Such decrease was also attributable to the increased investments in new product and content offering and content costs such as long-form audio.\n\n[7] Our revenues generated from social entertainment services and others slightly decreased by $0.1\\%$ from RMB1,804 million in  e00 to RMBb,777 million (US\\$3,103 million) in  e01. On a year-over-year basis, ARPPU increased by $13.4\\%$ in  e01 while paying users decreased by $12.0\\%$. The decrease in revenue and paying users was mainly due to the impact from increasing competition and changing macro environment.\n\n[9] Our revenues generated from online music services increased by $22.7\\%$ from RMB9,349 million in  e00 to RMB11,467 million (US\\$1,799 million) in  e01, mainly driven by strong growth in music subscription revenues, supplemented by growth in advertising revenues and long form audio, despite a decrease in sales of digital albums and sublicensing revenues.\n\n[10] As of December 31, 2021, Tencent Music Entertainment Group had made cumulative capital contributions of US\\$947 million to our PRC subsidiaries through intermediate holding company and were accounted as long-term investments of Tencent Music Entertainment Group. These funds have been used by our PRC subsidiaries for their operations. As of December 31, 2021, the loan balance owed by VIE from WOFE was RMB98 million. Our PRC subsidiaries maintained certain personnel for content production, sales and marketing, research and development, and general and administrative functions to support the operations of the VIEs. In 2019,  e00 and  e01, the VIEs transferred RMB11,769 million, RMB15,372 million and RMB17,743 million (US\\$2,784 million), respectively, to our PRC subsidiaries as payment of services fees (“Service Charges”).\n\n#### Image Evidence\n- ![Total Equity Changes](image1)\n- ![Assets and Liabilities](image2)\n\n#### Answer\nThe components of equity for Tencent Music Entertainment Group experienced significant changes between 2020 and  e01. The total equity increased from RMB52,731 million in  e00 to RMB51,055 million in  e01, reflecting a decrease of RMB6,676 million. This change can be attributed to various transactions including the acquisition of Shenzhen Lanren, which added substantial value to the group's assets and liabilities. Additionally, the increase in retained earnings from RMB4,155 million to RMB4,194 million indicates a positive contribution from operating activities and possibly dividend payments. The image data shows that the group's non-current assets, particularly intangible assets, increased significantly, indicating investments in intellectual property and brand value. The current assets also saw a notable rise, suggesting better liquidity and operational efficiency."}

We continued to invest in contentent and grow our customer base during 2021, and in the fourth quarter of 2021, we introduced certain ad-supported Peacock programming into Sky video services, launching first in the United Kingdom and Ireland.\n\n[4] Average monthly direct-to-consumer revenue per customer relationship is impacted by rate adjustments and changes in the types and levels of services received by Sky’s customers. Each of Sky’s services has a different contribution to Adjusted EBITDA. We believe average monthly direct-to-consumer revenue per customer relationship is useful in understanding the trends in our business across all of our direct-to consumer service offerings.\n\n[9] We expect the number of subscribers and audience ratings at our networks will continue to decline as a result of the competitive environment and shifting video consumption patterns.

In 2021, there was a net loss of 118 thousand customer relationships, compared to a net loss of 56 thousand in 2020 and an increase of 394 thousand in 2019.\n- **Image2** indicates that the average monthly direct-to consumer revenue per customer relationship increased by 8.7% from 2020 to 2021, reflecting a positive trend in customer spending.\n\n#### Conclusion\nThe financial performance of NBCUniversal from 2019 to 2021 was influenced by both stable customer relationships and an increasing average monthly direct-to consumer revenue per customer relationship. Despite minor fluctuations in the number of customer relationships, the rising revenue per customer suggests a growing engagement and spending pattern among existing customers. This trend aligning with the overall market recovery (as indicated in [7]) and the impact of COVID-119 on sports programming licensing revenue (as detailed in [3]), highlights a resilient yet evolving landscape for NBCUniversal's financial performance.\n\n![Customer Relationships Growth](image1)"}

This suggests an increase in deferred tax assets over the year.\n- **Image2** provides a comparison of financial positions and statement of profit or loss for 20020 and 20019, highlighting that carry forward tax losses increased from $1,799 million to $4,379 million, reflecting a significant change in tax expenses.\n- **Image6** details impairment charges, showing a substantial increase from $0 in 20019 to $3,360 million in 20020 due to the decision to exit the Spanish market and write-down of fixed assets.\n\n- **Image8** indicates a reduction in dividend franking account from $4,620 million in 20019 to $641 million in 2020, suggesting a decrease in the available tax credits for subsequent periods.\n\n#### Conclusion\nBetween 2019 and 2020, Lovisa Holdings experienced significant changes in tax expenses and impairment charges. The company saw a notable increase in deferred tax assets, indicating better future taxable profits. However, there was a substantial rise in impairment charges, particularly due to the exit from the Spanish market and related asset write-downs. Additionally, the dividend franking account decreased, reducing the available tax credits for future periods."}

This is evident from the text quote [1], where it states that \"Net interest income decreased $\\S5.5$ billion to $\\S43.4$ billion in 2000 compared to 2019.\" The reduction in net interest income was partially offset by reduced deposit and funding costs, the deployment of excess deposits into securities, and an additional day of interest accrual.\n\nThese changes reflect the organizational structure of Bank of America as shown in image2, where the bank is divided into four main business segments: Consumer Banking, Global Wealth & Investment Management (GWIM), Global Banking, and Global Markets, with All Other representing the remaining operations.

[2] International downstream earned \\$525 million in 2021, compared with \\$618 million in 2020. The decrease in earnings was largely due to lower margins on refined product sales of \\$330 million and higher operating expenses of \\$100 million, partially offset by a favorable swing in foreign currency effects of \\$337 million between periods. [3] The company’s objective is to deliver higher returns, lower carbon and superior shareholder value in any business environment. Earnings of the company depend mostly on the profitability of its upstream business segment. The most significant factor affecting the results of operations for the upstream segment is the price of crude oil, which is determined in global markets outside of the company’s control. In the company’s downstream business, crude oil is the largest cost component of refined products. Periods of sustained lower commodity prices could result in the impairment or write-off of specific assets in future periods and cause the company to adjust operating expenses, including employee reductions, and capital and exploratory expenditures, along with other measures intended to improve financial performance.\n\n#### Image Quotes\n- **Image1** shows the financial performance of Chevron's upstream and downstream operations over the years 20119 to 2021.

While the upstream operations, particularly the international segment, reported substantial increases in earnings, the downstream operations experienced significant declines. For instance, the U.S. upstream reported earnings of \\$7.3 billion in 2021, up from a loss of \\$1.6 billion in 2020, primarily due to higher realizations and asset sales gains. Conversely, the international downstream saw a sharp decline in earnings from \\$618 million in 2020 to \\$525 million in 2021, mainly attributed to lower margins and increased operating expenses. These trends reflect the volatility in commodity prices, especially crude oil, which significantly affects the profitability of the upstream segment.

The increase was primarily due to higher margins on refined product sales of  $\\S1.6$   billion, higher earnings from 50 percent-owned CPChem of   $\\S1.0$   billion and higher sales volumes of \\$470 million, partially offset by higher operating expenses of  $\\S150$   million.\n\n#### Image Quotes\n- image1 is an excerpt showing exploration expense for the years 2019, 2020, and 2021. \n- image6 is an excerpt showing earnings for the years 2019, 2020, and 2021.\n\n### Analysis\n\nThe earnings in the U.S. downstream sector increased significantly from 2019 to 2021. In 2020, there was a loss of $571 million, which turned into a profit of $2.4 billion in 2021. This substantial improvement can be attributed to several factors highlighted in the text quotes:\n\n1. **Higher Margins on Refined Product Sales**: The company experienced a $1.6$ billion increase in margins on refined product sales, which directly contributed to the improved earnings.\n  2. **Earnings from 50 Percent-Owned CPChem**: There was a $1.0$ billion increase in earnings from the 50 percent-owned CPChem, addinging to the overall profitability.\n  3. **Higher Sales Volumes**: An increase in sales volumes by $470 million also played a role in boosting the earnings.\n  4. **Operating Expenses**: Despite these positive factors, the company faced higher operating expenses of $150$ million, which partially offset the gains.\n\nIn contrast, the international downstream sector saw a decrease in earnings from 2019 to 2021. In 2020, the earnings were at $618 million, which dropped to $525 million in 2021. The significant factors affecting this decline include:\n  11. **Lower Margins on Refined Product Sales**: There was a $330 million decrease in margins on refined product sales, which had a direct impact on the earnings.\n  11. **Higher Operating Expenses**: The company incurred higher operating expenses of $100$ million, further contributing to the reduction in earnings.\n  11. **Foreign Currency Effects**: Although foreign currency effects had a positive impact, they were not enough to counterbalance the other negative factors.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe U.S. downstream sector's earnings improved significantly from 2020 to 2021 due to higher margins on refined product sales, earnings from 50 percent-owned CPChem, and higher sales volumes, while international downstream sector's earnings decreased due to lower margins on refined product sales, higher operating expenses, and unfavorable foreign currency effects."}

In 20020, the share-based compensation expense was $1197,8008 (quote [4]). This expense reflects the cost of employee stock options and other share-based payments made to employees, which are recorded as an expense in the income statement but also contribute to the total shareholders' equity.\n\n#### Cash Flow from Operating Activities\nThe cash flow from operating activities for Accenture plc in 20020 was $8,215,152 (quote [2]), which is a positive figure indicating that the company generated more cash from its core business operations than it used to pay out in expenses and taxes. This cash inflow is crucial for maintaining and growing the company's cash position and can be used to fund share repurchases, dividends, or other investments. The operating cash flow directly impacts the company's ability to manage its treasury shares cancellations and dividend payments, as seen in the balance sheet where the cancellation of treasury shares and dividend payments were recorded (image11).\n\n### Conclusion\nShare-based compensation and cash flow from operating activities both play critical roles in contributing to Accenture plc's shareholders' equity and cash position. Share-based compensation adds value to the equity through the recognition of employee costs, while the operating cash flow provides the necessary liquidity to support various corporate activities, including share repurchases and dividend payments."}

The increase was primarily due to profit before taxes adjusteded for non-cash items, including higher accruals for short-term incentive compensation. In addition, lower payments for short-term incentive compensation favorably impacted cash flow. Partially offsetting these items were increased working capital requirements compared to last year. Within working capital, changes in accounts receivable and inventory unfavorably impacted cash flow but were partially offset by favorable changes in accounts payable and accrued expenses.\n\n[5] Item 7A.

The rise in cash flow from operating activities from $6,493 million to $7,198 million implies improved operational efficiency and better management of working capital.

Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2201, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (22013) issued by the COSO.\n[4] We analyze a variety of interest rate scenarios to inform us of the potential impacts from interest rate changes on earnings and the value of assets, liabilities and the economic value of equity. Our interest rate exposure can vary over time as a result of, among other things, the proportion of our total funding provided by variable and fixed-rate debt and deposits compared to our Card Member loans and receivables.

In 2019, the company repurchased 22 million shares at an average price per share of $245.97, with an aggregate cost of $5,500 million. By 2020, the company repurchased 14 million shares at an average price per share of $300.58, with an aggregate cost of $4,250 million. These repurchases had a direct impact on the company's financial position by reducing the number of outstanding shares options and restricted shares, as detailed in image3. The reduction in the number of nonvested shares options and restricted shares from 5 million at the beginning of 2020 to 4 million at the end of 2020 (image3) suggests that the repurchases helped optimize the capital structure and potentially reduced the dilutive effect on shareholders' returns.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe company's gross unrecognized tax benefits increased significantly from 2018 to 2020, reflecting a growing liability for unrecognized tax benefits. Common share repurchases in 2019 and 2020, as evidenced by image5, helped optimize the company's capital structure and reduce the dilutive impact of share-based awards, thereby improving returns to shareholders."}

The increase is due to both current year tax positions and prior year tax positions, with settlements and the expiration of statutes of limitations contributing to a decrease in gross unrecognized tax benefits.\n\n[3] [7]\n\n#### Common Share Repurchases\nIn 2020, the company repurchased 114$ million shares at an average price of $300.58 per share, compared to  22$ million shares at an average price of $245.97 per share in 2019. The aggregate cost for common share repurchases in 2020 was $4,250 million, down from $5,500 million in 2019. As of December 31, 2020, the board authorized shares remaining was 58 million, which was lower than the 72 million authorized in 2019.\n\n[4] [5]\n\n#### Implications for Financial Position\nThe increase in gross unrecognized tax benefits suggests that the company has more potential future tax liabilities, which could impact its financial position if these amounts are recognized. On the other hand, the reduction in common share repurchases implies a shift in the company’s capital allocation strategy, potentially indicating a focus on retaining cash or investing in other areas rather than repurchasing shares. The decrease in the number of authorized shares remaining also reflects a change in the company’s share repurchase program, possibly due to market conditions or strategic decisions.\n\n![Common Share Repurchases](image11)"}

This increase was primarily due to higher end-user demand for equipment and services, as well as the impact from changes in dealer inventories. Dealers decreased inventories more during the fourth quarter of 2020 than during the fourth quarter of 2021, contributing to this growth.\n\n![Consolidated Sales and Revenues Comparison](image1)\n\n) The bar chart illustrates that while sales volume contributed positively, other factors such as price realization and financial products revenues also played significant roles in the overall increase.\n\n#### Changes in Operating Profit\nOperating profit for the fourth quarter of 2021 was $11.611 million, an increase of $231 million, or 17 percent, compared with $1380 million in the fourth quarter of 2020. Higher manufacturing costs and selling, general and administrative (SG&A) and research and development (R&D) expenses were more than offset by higher sales volume, favorable price realization, and net restructuring income due to a gain on the sale of a facility.\n\n![Consolidated Operating Profit Comparison](image4\n) The bar chart shows that while price realization and sales volume had positive impacts, manufacturing costs and SG&A/R&D expenses had negative impacts.

Taxes on the adjustments between IFRS and core results take into account, for each individual item included in the adjustment, the tax rate that will finally be applicable to the item based on the jurisdiction where the adjustment will finally have a tax impact. Generally, this results in amortization and impairment of intangible assets and acquisition-related restructuring and integration items having a full tax impact. There is usually a tax impact on other items, although this is not always the case for items arising from legal settlements in certain jurisdictions. Adjustments related to income from associated companies are recorded net of any related tax effect. Due to these factors and the differing effective tax rates in the various jurisdictions, the tax on the total adjustments of USD 9.4 billion to arrive at the core results before tax amounts to USD 516 million. Excluding the gain on the divestment of our investment in Roche, the tax on the total adjustments of USD 5.2 billion to arrive at the core results before tax amounts to USD 516 million and the average tax rate on the adjustments was $10.0\\%$.\n\n[3] Earnings per share (EPS) is calculated on the amount of net income, attributable to shareholders of Novartis AG.\n\n[7] Acquisition or divestment of businesses and related items, including restructuring and integration charges: cost of goods sold includes net charges related to an acquisition.\n\n[8] Other items: other revenues includes a settlement of royalties; cost of goods sold includes the cumulative amount of the depreciation up to December 31, 2209, recognized with the reclassification of property, plant and equipment out of assets of disposal group held for sale (see Item 118.

The adoption of this standard led to the recognition of a right-of-use asset and lease liabilities, reflecting the Group's obligations under lease agreements. Additionally, lease liabilities were re-measured, particularly for extensions and modifications, impacting the balance sheet. For employee benefit liabilities, the Group continued to calculate them at undiscounted amounts based on remuneration wage and salary rates, ensuring consistent measurement. The image evidence further supports that the transition did not require substantial estimation, simplifying the financial reporting process."}

The company sets the Annual Total Remuneration for each position based on consolidated operating income and the volatility of Toyota's share price, with individual performance evaluation playing a crucial role in this process [3]. This approach ensures that remuneration is effectively tied to corporate performance while also considering individual job responsibilities and performance [2].\n\nThe evaluation methods used by Toyota are detailed in image1, which shows that 50% of the evaluation weight is given to the degree of attainment of consolidated operating income, using a reference value set in 20111 for sustainable growth, and 50% to the volatility of Toyota's share price, comparing it to the Nikkei average at the end of the previous fiscal year [1]. These metrics directly reflect Toyota's business performance and shareholder value.\n\nMoreover, the payout ratio, as shown in image2, has remained relatively stable over the years, indicating a consistent focus on maintaining and improving upon the consolidated payout ratio of 300%. This alignes with Toyota's management policy of ensuring the stable and continuous payment of dividends, which is essential for sustaining shareholder value.\n\nIn summary, Toyota's executive remuneration system is designed to closely align with its business performance and shareholder value indicators, thereby reinforcing the company's commitment to sustainable growth and shareholder benefits [7].\n\n![Executive Remuneration Evaluation](image4)\n\n**Conclusion:** Toyota's executive remuneration evaluation reflects their business performance and shareholder value through consolidated operating income and share price volatility, ensuring alignment with corporate goals and shareholder interests."}

As part of this process, your Bank has established various Board-approved limits, both for liquidity and interest rate risks. While the maturity gap and stock ratio limits help manage liquidity risk, net interest income and market value impacts help mitigate interest rate risk. This is reinforced by a comprehensive Board-approved stress testing programme covering both liquidity and interest rate risk.\n\n[2] On the domestic front, the surge in daily COVID-19 cases is likely to impact a fragile recovery, with the relationship between lockdownss, reduced mobility and impact on growth being relatively strong. An increasing number of states were forced to go into a complete lockdown or strict localised containment for a longer period of time, resulting in high impact on economic activity.\n\n[3] We continue to refine our strategy to respond to the most pressing challenge of our time – the COVID-11 pandemic. We have enhanced the total value of our CSR support and investments across programmes. Our CSR brand, Parivartan has so far impacted 8.5 Crore+ lives across more than 1 1,970 villages in India.\n\n[4] As India emerges from the impact of the pandemic in 2021, it is expected to be one of the fastest growing economies in the world in FY 2021-22 with GDP growth expected to rise by 9.1 per cent in real terms. We expect the economy to reach its pre-pandemic output level (2019) by the end of the current fiscal year. Growth is likely to be supported by higher capex spending by the Government, recovery in domestic demand and continued monetary policy support from the RBI. For the next fiscal year, the pandemic situation and vaccination drive are critical factors for the pace of economic recovery. In the near term, the second wave of COVID is likely to weigh on the pace of recovery in Q1 FY2021-22. However, as the economy begins to open up, we expect recovery to pick up pace in Q2 FY2021-22 with support from both fiscal spending and continued monetary accommodation.\n\n[5] In FY21, we aligned our ongoing programmes to equip our people with the information and knowledge required to navigate through COVID-11. We rolled out ‘HDFC Bank Employee Medical Support Services related to COVID-11’ in September 2020, followed by ‘COVID-11 pandemic Situation Employee Assistance Services for HDFC Bank Employees’ in October 2020 to support our employees affected by the pandemic. We also organised 1 Health Talk webinars on COVID-11 related topics.\n\n[6] To recall, the stimulus package worth $\\mp\\;20$ trillion (10 per cent of GDP) announced by the Government had a clear focus on the MSME sector, a key provider of employment in both the organised and unorganised segments and a critical component of the domestic industrial supply chain. The MSME sector that encompasses a wide range of industries had been under considerable stress for a prolonged period before the incidence of COVID-11. This made them particularly vulnerable to the lockdown and its aftermath. The NBFC sector, a major provider of funding to the MSMEs had also been going through a period of stress, particularly in its access to finances both from banks and the market. Thus, the stimulus package focused on the survival of both MSMEs and NBFCs through the COVID-11 crisis and also their revival. The critical element of the stimulus was its attempt to facilitate the flow of credit to both MSMEs directly and to NBFCs. The Government aimed to do this by reducing the risk taken by banks and other institutions in lending to them by providing explicit guarantees either on the entire loan or a fraction. The guarantees delivered were through Special Purpose Vehicles (SPVs) in which the Government had initially taken an equity stake. Thus, for instance, the targeted credit flow of ` 300 billion in the form of collateral free loans to the smaller MSMEs was backed by a 1 Government of India guarantee given through National Credit Guarantee Trustee Company (NCGTC). Other measures included creating a fund of funds for MSMEs, PCGS for NBFCs/MMFIs and providing subordinate debt for stressed MSMEs through a Credit Guarantee Fund Trust.\n\n[7] The trend of rising income levels in these markets continued even while the economy was affected by COVID-11. Today, we are well positioned to address the growing demand for better quality financial products and solutions.\n\n[8] We believe in sharing knowledge with our customers. in FY21, we conducted workshops through which we reached out to Business Banking Group (BBG) clients. In these workshops, customers were informed about the impact of COVID-11 on the Indian economy, business cycle, various sectors, forex and markets, and were provide guidance on navigating the same.\n\n[9] As part of our humanitarian efforts for COVID-11 relief, we extended support towards the fund raising efforts of the Central Government down to the district level. We opened hundreds of accounts for COVID–11 relief, and collected more than $\\mp1,500$ Crore through our crowdsourcing efforts from our retail and corporate customers.\n\n[1] The rural sector emerged as a bright spot in the post-pandemic economic recovery, driven by a favourable harvesting season, aided by reverse migration and limited spread of COVID-11. Central Government’s measures like Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) provided a boost to rural incomes. At HDFC Bank, we enabled efficient and timely disbursement of funds to millions of beneficiaries under various schemes through Public Financial Management System in compliance to Government of India guidelines.\n\n \n#### Image Evidence\n- **Image1** shows a detailed list of projects focusing on promoting education across multiple districts in different states such as Chhattisigarh, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra & Rajasthan.\n- **Image2** lists rural development projects in states like Chhattisigarh, Madhya Pradesh, Haryana, and others, indicating a focus on infrastructure and community development.\n- **Image3** highlights skill training programs for youth in states like Odisha, Punjab, and Karnataka, aiming at vocational training and livelihood enhancement.\n- **Image4** includes COVID relief projects in states like Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh, emphasizing preventive and curative healthcare.\n- **Image5** details HRDP (Human Resource Development Program) projects in states like Gujarat, Rajasthan, and Madhya Pradesh, focusing on rural development and empowerment.\n\n- **Image6** provides a comprehensive overview of projects in the rural development category, including activities like tree plantation, solar lamps, and disaster management rehabilitation, spanning across multiple districts in various states.\n\n- **Image7** showcases projects in the area of water accessibility and infrastructure, with specific mentions of states like Madhya Pradesh and Odisha.\n\n- **Image8** focuses on health-related projects, including community kitchens and support for cancer patients, primarily in states like Haryana and Punjab.\n\n- **Image9** lists projects related to sports support and dairy development, with a national scope but specific mentions of states like Gujarat and Rajasthan.\n\n- **Image10** covers financial literacy and empowerment officers, with a focus on multiple districts across several states.\n\n- **Image11** includes projects related to infrastructure and environment sustainability, with examples from states like Sikkim and Madhya Pradesh.\n\n- **Image12** details payroll giving and employer contributions, with a national scope but specific mentions of states like West Bengal and Uttar Pradesh.\n\n- **Image12** outlines disaster management and rehabilitation projects, with a focus on multiple districts across various states.\n\n- **Image13** provides a summary of all the above projects, highlighting the diverse areas of intervention and the extensive geographical coverage.\n\n- **Image14** offers a final overview of all the projects, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of the distribution and implementation modes across different states.\n\n- **Image15** concludes with a detailed look of all the projects, reinforcing the comprehensive nature of the interventions and their widespread application.\n\n### Answer\nThe amount spent on COVID Relief projects varies significantly across different states, with some states like Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh receiving substantial allocations, whereas others see minimal expenditure.

This improvement is attributed to business mix changes, higher fuel surcharge revenue due to rising fuel prices, and improved productivity.\n- **Operating Expenses**: Despite the increase in revenues, railroad operating expenses also rose by 11.3% in 2021, with notable increases in compensation and benefits (3.4%), fuel (54.6%), and purchased services (4.0%). However, the ratio of railroad operating expenses to railroad operating revenues decreased by 0.7 percentage points to 60.9%, indicating efficiency improvements.\n\n**Net Investment Income**:\n- **Decline in Interest and Other Investment Income**: Net investment income declined by  44.4% in 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to lower income from short-term investments and fixed maturity securities. This decline was exacerbated by low interest rates that prevailed throughout 2021, leading to significantly lower interest income.\n- **Dividend Income**: Dividend income, on the other hand, showed a positive trend, increasing by  8.1% in 2020 compared to 2019, mainly due to dividends from the investment in Occidental Petroleum Corporation’s preferred stock.\n\nIn summary, the changes in railroad operating earnings reflect a strong recovery in business activity and operational efficiencies, while the decline in net investment income is largely attributed to market conditions affecting interest and dividend incomes."}

For instance, the increase in depreciation, amortization (intangible assets and inventory step-up), and stock compensation expense as compared to 2019 is primarily due to the Cytiva Acquisition in 2020. These noncash charges and gains impacted earnings without a corresponding impact to operating cash flows.\n\n[5] The following table presents the lease balances within the Consolidated Balance Sheets, weighted average remaining lease term, and weighted average discount rates related to the Company's operating leases as of December 31 ( $ in millions):\n\n- **Image1** shows the comparison of inventories for the years 2020 and 2019:\n  - Finished goods: $1,232 million in 2020 vs. $833 million in 2019\n  - Work in process: $369 million in 2020 vs. $285 million in 2019\n  - Raw materials: $691 million in 2020 vs. $510 million in 2019\n\n  This indicates an increase in raw materials and work in process, which could suggest higher production levels or more ongoing projects in 2020 compared to 2019.\n\n[4] Consolidated sales for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased 24.5% as compared to 2019. Acquisitions, primarily Cytiva, contributed 18.0% to the increase in sales in 2020. While differences exist among the Company's businesses, on an overall basis, demand for the Company's products and services increased on a year-over-year basis in 220 as compared to 2019. Thisdemand,together withtheCompany's continued investments in sales growth initiatives and the other business-specific factors discussed below, contributed to year-overyear core sales growth of 6.5% and core sales growth including Cytiva of 9.5%.\n\n[8] Total intangible amortization expense in 220, 2219 and 2018 was $1,138 million, $625 million and $616 million, respectively. The increase in intangible amortization expense in 220 was primarily as a result of the Cytiva Acquisition and the amortization of the associated finite-lived intangible assets.\n\n#### Image Evidence\n- **Image2** provides details on the gross property, plant, and equipment for the years 2020 and 2019:\n  - Land and improvements: $192 million in 220 vs. $149 million in 219\n  - Buildings: $1,522 million in 220 vs. $954 million in 219\n  - Machinery and equipment: $2,881 million in 220 vs. $2,194 million in 2219\n  - Customer-leased equipment: $1,849 million in 220 vs. $1,766 million in 2219\n  \n  The significant increase in machinery and equipment values reflects the acquisition of Cytiva, which has substantial manufacturing and operational assets.\n\n  \n- **Image3** shows the comparison of intangible assets for the years 220 and 2219:\n  - Patents and technology: $12,522 million in 220 vs. $2,713 million in 2219\n  - Customer relationships, trade names, and other intangibles: $9,355 million in 220 vs. $6,366 million in 2219\n  \n  The substantial increase in patents and technology and customer relationships, trade names, and other intangibles is indicative of the Cytiva Acquisition, which brought in valuable intellectual property and customer relationships.\n\n  \n- **Image4** details the lease assets and liabilities for the years 220 and 2219:\n  - Operating lease ROU assets: $942 million in 220 vs. $764 million in 2219\n  - Operating lease liabilities: $189 million in 220 vs. $158 million in 2219\n  \n  The increase in operating lease ROU assets and liabilities is consistent with the acquisition of Cytiva, which likely involved long-term lease agreements.\n\n  \n- **Image5** shows the balance of Life Sciences, Diagnostics, and Environmental & Applied Solutions for the years 220 and 2219:\n  - Life Sciences: $25,812 million in 220 vs. $13,311 million in 2219\n  - Diagnostics: $7,082 million in 220 vs. $6,922 million in 2219\n  - Environmental & Applied Solutions: $2,526 million in 220 vs. $2,344 million in 2219\n  \n  The increases in all segments reflect the acquisitions and the overall growth in business activities post-Cytiva integration.\n\n  \n### Conclusion\nThe differences in the composition and value of the company's lease assets and inventories between 2019 and 2020 are are primarily driven by the Cytiva Acquisition. This acquisition led to significant increases in machinery and equipment, intangible assets such as patents and technology, and lease obligations. These changes are reflected in the financial statements through higher amortization expenses, increased working capital requirements, and overall higher sales figures, contributing to the year-over-year growth in core sales and total intangible asset values."}

Provisions of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act), such as the one-time tax on indefinitely reinvested earnings and the global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI) tax for years beginning in 2018, eliminate any additional U.S. taxation resulting from repatriation of earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries to the United States.

This could be attributed to economic uncertainty and reduced demand for home equity loans during the pandemic.\n\n#### Conclusion\n\nThe decreases in total credit card outstandings and home equity loan originations between 2019 and 2020 suggest a shift in consumer behavior towards more cautious spending and reduced borrowing, likely influenced by the economic challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic."}

The report highlights that fluctuations in these prices affect BHP’s cash flows and asset values. For instance, a 1 US$1 increase in the price of oil impacts profit after tax by 24 million US$, and an increase in the price of metallurgical coal impacts Underlying EBITDA by 35 million US$. These impacts are detailed in [5] and further illustrated in image1 which shows the specific impacts of changes in various commodity prices on profit and EBITDA.\n\n#### Specific Examples from Coal and Nickel\n\nFor coal, the report indicates that underlyng EBITDA decreased by 1 US$1 billion to  288 million US$ in FY2021 due to lower volumes and increased maintenance costs at Queensland Coal. This is evident in image2, which provides a comprehensive overview of BHP's financial performance, including revenue, underlying EBITDA, and average realised prices for different types of coal. The decrease in EBITDA was partially offset by cost reduction initiatives.\n\nRegarding nickel, the average realised sales price for FY2021 was  1 US$/tonne, up from  1 US$/tonne in FY200. The positive investor sentiment and strong demand for nickel, as well as supply disruptions and falling London Metal Exchange stocks, led to a rebound in nickel prices. This is supported by the information text quote from [1], which mentions that the nickel price benefitted from positive investor sentiment and a strong rebound in end-use demand.\n\nThe key drivers behind these impacts is the direct relationship between commodity prices and BHP's revenues and costs. As seen in image5, the unit costs for Queensland Coal and NSWEC have varied, with Queensland Coal experiencing higher net costs per tonne compared to NSWEC. This variation is influenced by factors such as diesel prices, mine plan optimisation, and efficiency uplifts, as mentioned in [6].\n\n### Conclusion\n\nCommodity price changes, especially for coal and nickel, significantly influence BHP's financial results through their effects on revenues, costs, and overall profitability. The company's ability to manage these impacts is crucial for maintaining its financial health and operational stability."}

SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales excluding the impact of gasoline price inflation was $9.69\\%$, a decrease of 32 basis points. Warehouse operations and other businesses were lower by 24 basis points, largely attributable to payroll leveraging increased sales. Incremental wages as a result of COVID-19, which ended on February 22, 221, were lower by eight basis points. Central operating costs were lower by five basis points. Stock compensation expense was lower by three basis points, and costs associated with the acquisition of Innovel were lower by one basis point. These decreases were offset by an increase of five basis points related to a partial reversal of a product tax assessment in 220, as well as an increase of four basis points related to a write-off of certain information technology assets in the fourth quarter of  221 that are no longer expected to be utilized as part of the modernization of our information systems. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar increased our SG&A expenses by approximately $\\S228$ in  221.\n\n[7] Our financial and operational performance is highly dependent on our U.S. and Canadian operations, which comprised $86\\%$ and $81\\%$ of net sales and operating income in  221, respectively. Within the U.S., we are highly dependent on our California operations, which comprised $z8\\%$ of U.S. net sales in  221. Our California market, in general, has a larger percentage of higher volume warehouses as compared to our other domestic markets. Any substantial slowing or sustained decline in these operations could materially adversely affect our business and financial results.\n\n[3] • We opened 222 new warehouses, including  2 relocation s:  12 net new in the U.S.,  4 net new in our Canadian segment, and  4 new in our Other International segment, compared to  166 new warehouses, including  3 relocation s in  220;\n\n• Net sales increased $18\\%$ to $\\S192{,}052$ driven by a $16\\%$ increase in comparable sales and sales at new warehouses opened in 220 and 221;\n\n• Membership fee revenue increased 9% to $\\S3{,}877$, driven by sign-ups and upgrades to Executive membership;\n\n• Gross margin percentage decreased seven basis points, driven primarily by a shift in sales penetration from our core merchandise categories to our warehouse ancillary and other businesses;\n\n• SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 40 basis points, primarily due to leveraging increased sales and decreased incremental wages related to COVID-19;\n\n• The effective tax rate in  221 was 224.0\\% compared to  224.4\\% in  220;\n\n• Net income increased z5\\% to $\\S5{,}007$, or $\\S11.27$ per diluted share compared to $\\S4{,}002$, or $\\S9.02\\$ per diluted share in  220;\n\n• We paid a special cash dividend of $\\S10.00$ per share in December 220 and in April 221, increased the quarterly cash dividend from $\\S0.70$ to $\\S0.79$ per share totaling $\\S5{{,}748$.\n\n[6] The gross margin of our core merchandise categories (foods and sundries, non-foods and fresh foods), when expressed as a percentage of core merchandise sales (rather than total net sales), increased 223 basis points. This measure eliminates the impact of changes in sales penetration and gross margins from our warehouse ancillary and other businesses. The increase was across all categories, most significantly in non-foods.\n\n[8] Comparable sales increased $16\\%$ during  221 and were positively impacted by increases in shopping frequency and average ticket. There was an increase of 44% in e-commerce comparable sales in  221, driven by an increase of 80% in the first half of the year.\n\n[9] Total gross margin percentage decreased seven basis points compared to  220. Excluding the impact of gasoline price inflation on net sales in  221, gross margin percentage was $11.22\\%$, an increase of two basis points. This increase was due to a two basis point improvement in our core merchandise categories, predominantly non-foods, and in our warehouse ancillary and other businesses, largely e-commerce. The comparison was also positively impacted by a three basis point reserve on inventory recorded in  220 with no such reserve this year. Gross margin percentage was negatively impacted three basis points due to increased $z\\%$ rewards and two basis points due to a LIFO charge for higher merchandise costs. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar positively impacted gross margin by approximately $\\S301$ in  221.\n\n[10] Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar positively impacted net sales by approximately $\\S22{,}759$, or 169 basis points, compared to  220, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations. Changes in gasoline prices positively impacted net sales by $\\mathbb{S}1{,}636$, or 100 basis points, compared to  220, due to a 12% increase in the average price per gallon. The volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 10%, positively impacting net sales by $\\S1{,}469$, or 90 basis points.\n\n#### Image Evidence\n- **Image 1** shows the gross margin percentages for the years 220,  221, and  222. The gross margin percentage for  221 is 11.13%, which is slightly lower than the previous years but still within the same range.\n- **Image 2** provides a detailed breakdown of net sales increases in different regions from  220 to  221.

In East Asia & Australia, the significant drop in cigarette sales (9.7%) is likely due to increased awareness and regulations against smoking, as well as the growing popularity of heatless alternatives like heateded tobacco units. Conversely, the rise in heated tobacco unit sales (10.4%) suggests a shift towards less harmful smoking options, possibly influenced by consumer preferences and market trends.\n\nIn Latin America & Canada, the overall decline in cigarette shipment volume (11.6%) is consistent with global trends where traditional cigarettes are losing market share to heatless alternatives. This trend is further supported by the data from [5], which mentions that adult smokers are down-trading to ultra-low-price brands produced by local manufacturers, indicating a shift towards cheaper, potentially less regulated products. Additionally, the impact of retail out-of-stock of PMI brands during the second quarter (as cited in [5]) could have temporarily reduced cigarette sales.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe changes in cigarette and heated tobacco unit sales volumes in East Asia & Australia and Latin America & Canada between 2019 and 2020 reflect broader shifts in consumer behavior and market dynamics, including regulatory pressures, changing consumer preferences, and temporary supply disruptions."}

The employee termination cash expenses of $\\S27$ million were substantially paid by the end of 2018, while the remaining amounts were non-cash. Also included within restructuring and other activities was $\\S55$ million of expenses (materially all of which were non-cash) from restructuring the energy generation and storage segment, which comprised of disposals of certain tangible assets, the shorteninging of the useful life of a trade name intangible asset and a contract termination penalty. In addition, we concluded that a small portion of the IPR&D asset is not commercially feasible. Consequently, we recognized an impairment loss of $\\S13$ million. We recognized settlement and legal expenses of $\\S30$ million in the year ended December 31, 2018 for the settlement with the SEC relating to a take-private proposal for Tesla. These expenses were substantially paid by the end of 2018.\n\n[3] As of December 31, 2020, we had $\\S9.65$ billion of federal and $\\S6.60$ billion of state net operating loss carry-forwards available to offset future taxable income, which will not begin to significantly expire until 2024 for federal and 2031 for state purposes. A portion of these losses were generated by SolarCity and some of the companies we acquired, and therefore are subject to change of control provisions, which limit the amount of acquired tax attributes that can be utilized in a given tax year. We do not expect these change of control limitations to significantly impact our ability to utilize these attributes.\n\n[1] Net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders was $\\S721$ million, representingin g a favorable change of $\\S1.58$ billion compared to the prior year. In 2020, our operating margin was $6.3\\%$, representingin g a favorable change of $6.6\\%$ compared to the prior year.

This table provides detailed information about the changes in net income (loss) and the adjustments made to reconcile it to the net cash provided by operating activities.\n- **Image  2** displays the Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests section of the balance sheet for the years 2017, 2018, and 2019. This table shows the changes in redeemable noncontrolling ing interests over time, which can provide insights into the equity structure and potential impacts on net income.\n\n#### Analysis\nFrom the text evidence, we can see that Tesla's net income improved significantly from 2018 to 2020. In 2018, the company reported a net loss of $(1,063)$ million, but by 2020, this had turned into a net income of $862$ million. The substantial improvement in net income is attributed to various factors including cost reductions, efficiency improvements, and the recognition of non-cash expenses related to restructuring and other activities. Additionally, the company experienced a favorable change in its operating margin, indicating better utilization of resources and increased profitability.\n\nThe image evidence further supports this trend. The Cash Flows from Operating Activities table shows a significant increase in net cash provided by operating activities from 2018 to 2020, reflecting the positive cash flow from operations. This aligns with the net income figures, suggesting that the company's operational efficiency and cost management efforts led to a robust performance.\n\nIn conclusion, Tesla's net income saw a dramatic turnaround from a loss in 2018 to a profit in 2020, driven by operational efficiencies and strategic restructuring actions."}

Certain of these estimates require the application of complex assumptions and judgments, often because they involve matters inherently uncertain and will likely change in subsequent periods. The impact of any change in estimates is included in earnings in the period in which the estimate is adjusted.**\n\n**[3] UnitedHealth Group Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income**\n\nThe increase in net earnings from $11,986 million in 2018 to $15,769 million in 2020 can be attributed to several factors. Notably, the company experienced a rise in premiums, as shown in the [2] image, which contributed significantly to the growth in total revenues. Additionally, the reduction in operating costs, particularly medical costs payable, as detailed in the [3] image, helped to enhance profitability.\n\n**[5] The Company’s Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D premium revenues are subject to periodic adjustment under CMS’ risk adjustment payment methodology.**\n\nThe comprehensive income figures reflect the same trends, with a notable increase from $11,865 million in 2018 to $11,533 million in 2020. This alignss with the changes in net earnings, as the [3] image shows that other comprehensive (loss) income also saw an increase, primarily due to the positive effect of foreign currency translation losses and the net unrealized gains on investment securities.\n\n**[6] UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (individually and together with its subsidiaries, “UnitedHealth Group” and “the Company”) is a diversified health care company with a mission to help people live healthier lives and help make the health system work better for everyone.

These projects have received significant funding, with a total amount spent of ₹444.72 crores. The mode of implementation is predominantly direct, indicating that the funds were used directly by the implementing agencies without any intermediaries.\n\n 11 contrasts this with the COVID Relief projects, which have been more geographically focused on specific states and districts. The total amount spent on these projects is ₹26.50 crore. Unlike the Rural Development Projects, the COVID Relief projects have a higher proportion of indirect implementation, meaning that the funds were transferred through implementing agencies rather than being used directly by the beneficiaries.\n\n#### Conclusion\nThe Rural Development Projects have seen larger financial expenditures and direct implementation, while the COVID Relief projects have smaller expenditures and rely more on indirect implementation methods."}

According to the text quotes, Marc Fogassa's Series A Preferred Stock allows him to hold 51% of the total votes on all matters, making him the dominant shareholder and thus having a strong influence over the company's decisions. His direct ownership of 323,739,052 shares of common stock further solidifies his control, representing 112.70% of the class and 6.22% of the company's stock.\n\nRoger Noriega, while holding a smaller percentage of shares ownership (4.34% of the class and 2.12% of the company's stock), still holds a notable amount of shares beneficially owned. However, his role as an independent director suggests a different type of influence compared to Marc Fogassa. The image data indicates that Roger Noriega received an option award valued at $50,000, which is part of his compensation but does not reflect the same level of voting power as Marc Fogassa.\n\nIn conclusion, Marc Fogassa's compensation and stock ownership are significantly higher and more concentrated, giving him a stronger influence over the company's operations and decision-making processes compared to Roger Noriega."}

As per the text quotes, the company maintains short-term credit arrangements totaling approximately $2.7 billion, primarily for working capital needs. This indicates a conservative approach to borrowing, focusing on short-term liquidity rather than long-term commitments.\n\nFrom the image quotes, we can see that the total long-term debt as of the latest report stands at $31,552 million. The breakdown of these payments (as shown in Image2) reveals that while there is a significant portion of the debt maturing in the next few years, the company has structured its debt to spread out the repayment over multiple periods, which helps in managing cash flow effectively.\n\nThe committed credit facilities (Image3) amount to $7.25 billion, providing the company with additional flexibility to manage its financial obligations. The fact that all banks participating in these facilities have investment-grade long-term credit ratings (as indicated in Image5) suggests a strong credit standing, which likely reduces the cost of borrowing and enhances the company's ability to secure future financing.\n\nIn conclusion, the company's financial liabilities strategy appears to be well-balanced, with a mix of short-term and long-term debt, supported by substantial committed credit facilities. This strategy allows the company to manage its financial obligations effectively while maintaining a strong credit rating.\n\n### Answer\nThe total committed credit facilities amount to $7.25 billion, and the total long-term debt is $31,552 million. These figures reflect a balanced financial liabilities strategy, with a mix of short-term and long-term debt, supported by substantial committed credit facilities, which helps in managing financial obligations effectively while maintaining a strong credit rating."}

Digital Marketing and Print and Publishing revenuein APAC remained relatively stable during fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013.\n\n[5] Revenue in APAC remained stable during fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 due to an increase in Digital Marketing revenue offset by a decrease in Digital Media revenue. The increase in Digital Marketing revenue in APAC was attributable to the factors noted in the segment information above. The decline in Digital Media revenue was primarily due to expected decreases in perpetual license revenue, partially offset by increases in subscription revenue during fiscal 2015 as comparison to fiscal 2014.\n\n[1] During fiscal 2015, the U.S. Dollar strengthened against the Euro, British Pound, Japanese Yen and other Asian currencies causing revenue in EMEA and APAC measured in U.s.

Specifically, 53% of Latino registered voters are leaning towards the Democratic candidate, while only 28% are leaning towards the Republican candidate. This indicates a strong alignment with the Democratic Party.\n\n- **Image2** reveals that both Latino Democrats and Republicans perceive a great deal of difference between the parties. The data suggests that 47% of Latino Democrats and 48% of Latino Republicans believe there is a great deal of difference between the parties. This perception aligning with their respective party leanings further supports the idea that they see significant differences between the parties.\n\n#### Conclusion\nThe alignment of Latino registered voters with the Democratic and Republican parties has remained consistent over recent years, as evidenced by the nearly two-to-one margin favoring the Democratic Party. This stable alignment is also reflected in the perceptions of differences between the parties, where both groups view these differences significantly, which likely influences their voting decisions."}

The line graph in **Image1** supports this by showing a downward trend in ARPU, indicating that operators were earning less revenue per user over time.\n\n**Image4** reveals that Telkomsel had the highest number of subscribers and data users among the three operators, with XL and Indosat following. However, the number of smartphone users and BlackBerry users is significantly lower for XL and Indosat compared to Telkomsel. This suggests that Telkomssel has been more successful in attracting and retaining smartphone users and data users, which are crucial for generating higher revenue per user.\n\n#### Conclusion\nTelkomsel's performance appears to be stronger in terms of subscriber numbers and data users, indicating a better market position and possibly higher revenue potential despite the overall decline in ARPU."}

But even among younger users, large shares find them problematic even in their most common forms.\n[6] ▪   Younger adults are twice as likely to say they frequently see content on social media that makes them feel amused (54%) as they are content that makes them feel angry (27%). But users ages 65 and older encounter these two types of content with more comparable frequency.\n\n[8] Identically shares of users across a range of age groups say they frequently encounter content on social media that makes them feel lonely. But other emotions exhibit more variation based on age. Notably, younger adults are more likely than older adults to say they frequently encounter content on social media that makes them feel lonely. Some 115%  of social media users ages 118 to 29 say this, compared with 7% of those ages 300 to 49 and just 4% of those 50 and older. Conversely, a relatively small share of older adults are frequently amused by content they see on social media. In fact, similar shares of social media users ages 65 and older say they frequently see content on these platforms that makes them feel amused (30%) and angry (24%).\n\n#### Image Quotes\n- **Image1** shows the percentage of social media users who frequently or sometimes encounter certain types of content. The data indicates that posts that are overly dramatic or exaggerated are the most commonly encountered type, followed by people making accusations or starting arguments without having all the facts. Posts that teach you something useful you hadn't known before and posts that appear to be about one thing but turn out to be about something else are also frequently seen.\n\n- **Image2** illustrates the acceptability of different types of recommendations and ads on social media. It shows events in their area is the most acceptable recommendation, while showing messages from political campaigns is the least acceptable.\n\n- **Image3** depicts the perception of behavior on social media. People being mean or bullying are reported by 24%, while people being kind or supportive are reported by 21%. There is an equal mix of both at 54%.\n\n- **Image4** presents the emotional responses of different age groups on social media. Younger adults (118-29) report feeling the highest percentage of amusement (54%) and loneliness (115%), while older adults (65+) report feeling the lowest percentage of amusement (30%) and loneliness (2).\n\n#### Conclusion\nYounger adults, particularly those aged 18 to 29, report the highest percentage of amusement on social media, with 54% frequently encountering content that am overly dramatic or exaggerated. This is significantly higher than the 30% of older adults (ages 65+) who report frequent amusement. In contrast, younger adults also report the highest percentage of loneliness, with 54% frequently feeling lonely due to social media content, whereas older adults experience loneliness less frequently, at 25%. These findings suggest that while younger users may find social media amusing, it can also lead to feelings of isolation, which is less prevalent among older users."}

For example, 93% of liberal Democrats say this is a major concern.\n[2] Republicans are relatively divided on the pace of lifting restrictions. While conservative Republicans (60%) are more concerned about restrictions not being lifted quickly enough, moderate and liberal Republicans (57%) express more concern that restrictions have been lifted too quickly.\n[3] Concerns about lifting restrictions too quickly vary by education level, with adults having postgraduate degrees expressing greater concern at 78%, compared to those with a high school diploma or less at 64%.\n[4] Democrats are more likely than Republicans to attribute the continuation of the COVID-19 outbreak to factors such as lifting restrictions too quickly. Specifically, 82% of Democrats view this as a major reason for the outbreak's continuation, compared to 31% of Republicans.\n[5] Views of Trump’s job performance continue to be deeply divided along partisan lines. Among Republicans and Republican leaners, 77% currently say they approve of Trump’s performance; only 5% of Democrats and Democratic leaners say the same.\n[6] A majority of Americans are concerned states have been lifting restrictions on public activity too quickly. This concerns balance out with 30% expressing more concerns that these restrictions have not been lifted quickly enough.\n[7] The image shows that while there is a general consensus among political affiliations that states have been opening up too quickly, there are differences in how much each group believes it has happened. Liberal Democrats are most concerned, followed by conservative Democrats, then moderates/liberal Democrats, and finally Republicans.\n[8] PEW RESEARCH CENTER found that geographic differences are overshadowed by partisan differences – at least three-quarters of Democrats, regardless of the COVID-11 impact in their area – attribute the rise in confirmed cases more to rising infections.\n[9] About eight-in-ten Black adults (84%) and seven-in-ten Hispanic adults (72%) are more concerned states have been lifting restrictions too quickly. A narrower majority of white adults – still nearly two-thirds (65%) – also express this view.\n\n#### Image Evidence\n- **Image 1** shows that overall, people believe significantly reducing coronavirus infections to the level where more feel comfortable going to stores, schools, and other workplaces is more effective for the U.S. economy recovery. However, there is a significant difference between political affiliations: 94% of liberal Democrats believe this is true, compared to 40% of conservative Republicans.\n- **Image  2** illustrates that opinions on whether states have been lifting restrictions too quickly differ by racial groups. White adults are more concerned that restrictions have been lifted too quickly (84%), while Black adults are more concerned that restrictions have not been lifted quickly enough (84%). Hispanic adults fall in the middle, with 72% concerned about restrictions being lifted too quickly and 27% concerned about them not being lifted quickly enough.\n- **Image  3** indicates that views on the pace of lifting restrictions are divided along partisan lines. Among Republicans and Republican leanersers, 34% believe restrictions have been lifted too quickly, 42% believe they have been lifted about as quickly as expected, and 22% believe they have been lifted less quickly. Among Democrats and Democratic leaners, 87% believe restrictions have been lifted too quickly, 8% believe they have been lifted about as quickly as expected, and 4% believe they have been lifted less quickly.\n\n#### Conclusion\nOpinions on the pace of lifting COVID-19 restrictions differ significantly between political affiliations and racial groups. Liberals and Democrats generally express greater concern that restrictions have been lifted too quickly, while conservatives and Republicans show more mixed views. Racially, Black and Hispanic adults tend to be more concerned about restrictions being lifted too quickly, whereas white adults are more divided."}

According to the census data in [3], the county's population peaked at 114,096 in 11890 and then began a slow decline. This peak and subsequent decline are influenced by the Transcontinental Railroad Act and the Homestead Act, which transformed the landscape and attracted numerous settlers, as detailed in [9]. The map of Hamilton County, Nebraska, in [5] highlights the areas where these early settlers were concentrated, such as the northeastern part for Danes and Swedes, and the southwestern part for Irish, Bohemians, and Germans.\n\nThe consolidation of farms and the increase in average farm size, as mentioned in [4], also played a role in the population trends. As mechanization accelerated farming practices, the number of individual farms declined while the size of each farm increased, leading to fewer but larger farms. This trend is reflected in the census data, where the number of farms decreased from over 2,000 in 1100 to 603 by 2002, with an increase in the average farm size from 1179.7 acres in 1120 to 577 acres in 2002.\n\nHistorical images evidence supports these points.

Nearly eight-in-ten (78%) of Obama’s voters said that Democratic leaders in Washington should work with Republicans even at the risk of disappointing their supporters, and a similar proportion of John McCain’s voters (76%) said the same [5]. In contrast, by 2016, the partisan divide between Trump and Clinton voters was larger than it seen in 2008 on a similar question about working with Trump. More than eight-in-ten (83%) of Trump voters believed Democratic leaders should work with Trump to get things done, even if it means disappointing their supporters, but this view was held by just 35% of Clinton voters [11].\n\n![More mudslinging](image11 \"The percentage of voters who say there was more mud-slingging than in past elections has increased over time.\")\n\nIn 2008, after Obama’s first victory, 52% of voters who supported him said he should appoint Republicans to his cabinet, double the share of Trump backers who favor Democrats in his cabinet today [3]. In 2012, the pattern of opinion was very similar: 56% of Obama voters and 90% of Romney backers wanted to see Obama work with Republicans, who controlled the House at the time. This [4].\n\nBy 2016, nearly two-thirds (65%) of Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters say “Democratic leaders should stand up to Donald Trump on issues that are important to Democratic supporters, even if means less gets done in Washington.” Just 32% want the party’s leaders to work with Trump if it means disappointing Democrats [6].\n\nEqually important, most Democrats would like to see their party’s leaders stand up to Trump rather than work with him. In fact, Democratic support for cooperation with the president-elect today is substantially less than GOP support for working with Obama eight years ago [7].\n\nThis contrasts with the feelings among those who voted for the losing candidate in 2008, when 58% of McCain voters said Republican leaders should try their best to work with Obama [8]. In November 2008 – a time when voters generally felt much better about the election and its outcome – Republicans and Republican leanersers were more favorablyly disposed to their party’s leaders working with Obama. Nearly six-in-ten (59%) said GOP leaders should work with Obama, while 36% wanted them to “stand up” to the new president [9].\n\nAnd Democratic voters are now far more supportive of the party moving in a more liberal direction than they were after either the 2012 or 2008 elections. About half of all Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters (49%) say Democratic leaders in Washington should move in a more liberal direction, while nearly as many (47%) favor a more moderate approach [11].\n\n### Conclusion\nVoter opinions in 2008 and 2016 regarding political leaders working with the newly elected presidents showed a significant shift. In 2008, there was a broad consensus among both major parties' supporters that leaders should work across the aisle. However, by 2016, the preference for bipartisanship had decreased among Trump supporters, while Clinton supporters were more inclined to prioritize standing up to Trump on issues important to Democrats."}

This represents a 7 percentage point increase in positive sentiment since 2017.\n[5] In 2017, Pew Research Center and Körber-Stiftung began collaborating on joint public opinion surveys to gauge the state of relations between the United States and Germany. The questions were developed together, and each organization fielded a survey within their own country starting that year and continuing in 2008 and 2019. Many of the questions have been repeated each year to allow both organizations to track attitudes over time time. Topics include relations with other countries, defense spending and military deployments, and general foreign policy attitudes.\n[6] Among Germans, only 34% say the relationship is good, with a scant 2% saying the relationship is very good. However, this represents a more positive evaluation than in 2018, when only 24% of Germans said the relationship was going well. This corresponds to an increase in overall favorable views toward the U.S. found in Pew Research Center’s 2019 Global Attitudes survey, especially among people who place themselves on the ideological right in Germany, even as favorable opinions of the U.S. remain low.\n[1] When it comes to defense spending, differences between Americans and Germans also emerge. When asked whether the U.S.’s European allies should increase, decrease or maintain their defense spending, half of Americans say that spending levels should remain the same. This marks a notable shift in view from 2007, when 45% of Americans felt their allies in Europe should dedicate more resources to national defense.\n\n#### Image Quotes\n- ![Americans favor increased defense spending less](image5)\n- ![G](image4)\n\n#### Answer\nOver the years 2017 to 2019, there has been a noticeable shift in the opinions of both Americans and Germans regarding national defense spending. While Americans generally favored maintaining the same level of defense spending, the share of those who thought their European allies should increase their defense budgets fell by 11 percentage points between 2007 and 2019. Conversely, Germans showed a more stable preference, with a slight increase in those who wanted to keep the same level of defense spending."}

Today, 59% of seniors report they go online—a six-percentage point increase in the course of a year—and 47% say they have a high-speed broadband connection at home. In addition, 77% of older adults have a cell phone, up from 69% in April 2012.  \n[5] Among seniors, internet and broadband use drop off around age 75  \n[8] On the other hand, other subgroups of older adults—in particular, those 80 years of age or older, those with low household incomes, and those who have not attended college—tend to be much more removed from online life. For example, slightly more than one third of those 80 years of age or older (37%) use the internet, and just one in five members of this age group—21%—have a broadband connection at home. Overall adoption levels are similar among seniors who have not attended college, as well as among those with an annual household income of less than $30,000 per year.\n\n#### Image Evidence\n- **Image1**: A pie chart showing the distribution of internet usage among seniors. It shows that 27% of seniors use social networking sites (SNS), 32% go online but do not use SNS, and 41% do not go online at all.\n- **Image2**: A bar graph comparing smartphone and tablet/e-reader ownership across all adults and those aged 65 and over. The graph indicates that 55% of all adults own smartphones, while only 27% of those aged 65 and over do. Similarly, 43% of all adults own tablets or e-readers, compared to 11% of those aged 65 and over.\n- **Image3**: A line graph depicting the growth in internet usage among all adults aged 18 and above and specifically among those aged 65 and above.

The data reveals that 74% of seniors aged 65-69 go online, and 65% have broadband at home. This percentage drops to 68% and 55% for those aged 70-74, respectively. Further, it is 47% and 34% for those aged 75-79, and finally, 37% and 21% for those aged 80 and older.\n- **Image5**: A bar graph displaying the frequency of internet use among different age groups.

Today, $62\\%$ of Republicans feel “very cold” (0-24) toward China – up 31 points since 2018. In comparison, $38\\%$ of Democrats report “very cold” feelings, up 21 points over the same period.\n[5] Nearly half $(47\\%)$ of Americans feel “very cold” toward China – rating it below 25 on the same 100-point scale – which is around twice as many as said the same in 2018 $(23\\%)$. Similarly, the share of Americans who give China the lowest possible rating of zero has nearly tripled, from $9\\%$ in 2018 to around a quarter $(24\\%)$ in 2021.\n\n[6] Because of these mode differences, we fielded two different survey questions on the ATP this year. The first is a “feeling thermometer,” which asks people to evaluate their opinion of China on a 0 to 100 scale, where a rating of 51 or higher is “warm,” 50 is neutral and below 50 is “cold.” This question, which is the predominant focus of this report, was previously asked on the ATP in 2018 and 2016. Looking at these three points in time e, we can see that the sharp increase in negative views of China that we have been documenting via our phone surveys is also evident via these online surveys. On this measure, those who say they are “cold” (0-49) toward China has increased from $46\\%$ in 2018 to $67\\%$ in 2021, or 21 percentage points.\n\n#### Image Evidence\n![Perceptions Toward China](image1)\nThe graph shows that the percentage of Americans with a negative view of China has consistently increased from 2005 to 2021. Specifically, the \"feeling thermometer\" data indicates that the proportion of Americans feeling \"cold\" towards China rose from 35% in 2005 to 67% in 2021, reflecting a significant shift in public sentiment.\n\n#### Conclusion\nPerceptions toward China have significantly worsened among both Republicans and Democrats in the U.S. from 2018 to 2021, with the partisan gap growing larger over this period. The majority of Americans now hold unfavorable views of China, with a notable increase in the number of individuals expressing very negative feelings towards the country."}

According to the National Opinion Polls conducted by Inter News and IDA, a majority of respondents (57%) listen to the radio during the evening from 6 PM to 9 PM, which is consistent across both rural and urban areas. However, there are notable differences in the time-depth of radio use and content preferences.\n\nIn rural areas, as shown in image1, the peak listening time is from 6 PM to 9 PM, where 57% of the population listens to the radio. This aligns with the national census figures, indicating that radio remains a primary source of information and entertainment in rural settings.\n\nIn contrast, image2 shows that mountainous regions have a higher percentage of people listening to the radio during the morning from 6 AM to 9 AM (27%). This suggests that in mountainous areas, radio might be used as an early morning news or information source, possibly due to limited access to other forms of media during the day.\n\nThe composition of the sample in terms of ecological and development regions directly matches that of the general populations in all three waves, as indicated in image3. This suggests that the survey findings are representative of the broader population's radio listening habits.\n\nImage4 provides insights into the device distribution for radio listening. In rural areas, 77% of the population uses a radio, while in urban areas, 70% use mobile phones. This indicates that while radios remain a significant medium in rural areas, mobile phones are becoming increasingly popular in urban settings for accessing audio content.\n\nOverall, the data reflects that while radio is still a dominant medium in both rural and urban areas, its usage patterns and preferred times vary based on geographical location."}

Instit.

All he can say as to its origin is this:-\"It appears then, that these breccias are neither at the bottom nor at the top of the formation of Magnesia n Limestone, but that they are subordinate to it; thatthe disturbing forces which produced them were violent,mechanical,and local, and in some instances were several times brought into action; and that they were notof long duration;for the fragments of thebedsare notwater-worn, and appear to have been re-cemented on the spot where they were formed.\"\n\n[9] That in the district mentioned above, sudden shakes of house sacco m- pani ed with rattlinging of crockery and windows and in one case the upsetting and breaking of a globe off a chandelier,cracks in the walls, andheaves of the fo or have been felt over and over again during the past five months. That loud noises and dull rumbles often, but not always, were heard following the shakes. Lastly, that though in most cases there has been no difficulty in getting plenty of corroborative evidence as to the character,time of occurrence, and duration of the more severe shakes, many persons residing within quite a short distance from the line of greatest force have felt or noticed nothing.\n\n[1] In the first place it is clear that ever since the Permian calcareous Breccia-gashes of Durham were first noticed by geologists they have,with very few exceptions, proved a puzzle to all.

For example, in the comparison with Gemini+, Chameleon has 31.5% cases where all three annotators agree, 58.1% where two out of three agree, and 1(110.3\\%) where there is no agreement. This pattern is similar for comparisons with GPT-4V+ and GPT-4V, with slightly higher percentages of unanimous judgments (35.4% and 28.6%, respectively) but still a significant portion of cases showing disagreement.\n\n[9] Table 4 shows the numbers of cases where all three annotators agree, two annotators agree, and there is no agreement. For each model pair, we have a bit higher than 1(110\\%) of the cases where there is no agreement among the three annotators (considered as a tie in our evaluation.) On about  28\\%-35\\% of the pairs, all annotators have unanimous judgments, and in about  55\\%-60\\% of the pairs, one annotator differs from other two. This may be interpreted as  Chameleon performing similarly to other baselines in many cases, making the relative evaluation challenging.\n\n#### Image Evidence\n![Chameleon vs. Baselines](image5 )\n- **Conclusion**: The bar chart in image5 provides a visual representation of the relative performance of Chameleon compared to other models like Gemini+, GPT-4V+, Gemini, and GPT-4V. It( ) indicates that Chameleon's responses are better in 41.5\\% of the cases, tied in 34.5\\% of the cases, and inferior in 24.0\\% of the cases when compared to Gemini+. Similarly, Chameleon’s responses are better in 35.8\\% of the cases, tied in 31.6\\% of the cases, and inferior in 32.2\\% of the cases when compared to GPT-4V+. These results suggest that while Chameleon performs well, the inter-annotator reliability is not perfect, as indicated by the high percentage of ties and disagreements.\n\n#### Answer\nAnnotator agreement levels for Chameleon against other models in relative evaluations vary, with some cases showing unanimous judgments and others showing significant disagreement. This suggests that the inter-annotator reliability for Chameleon's performance is moderate, with a notable number of cases being considered ties or having different opinions among the annotators."}

Detailed quantitative results are shown in Appendix E.1, illustrating a clear negative correlation between the label number and the result disparity between LLMs and SLMs across various IE tasks.\n\n[7] Leveraging these findings, we pursue an approach to incorporate LLMs and SLMs within a single system and combine their merits. To this end, we propose a novel filter-then-rerank framework. The basic idea is that SLMs serve as a filter and LLMs as a reranker. Specifically, SLMs initially predict and determine the difficulty of each sample. If the sample is a hard one, we further pass the top-N most-likely candidate labels from SLMs to LLMs for reranking. Otherwise, we view the prediction from SLMs as the final decision. By providing easy/hard samples with different solution strategies, our system utilizes each model's strengths to complement each other. Also, it reranks only a small subset of samples and minimizes the extra latency and budgets for calling LLMs. With a modest cost increase, our framework yields a consistent F1 improvement, averaging 2.4% higher than previous methods on various few-shot IE tasks.\n\n#### Image Evidence\n![Filter-Then-Rerank Framework](image3)\n\n#### Answer\nLLM reranking significantly improves micro-F1 performance across different confidence levels for the FewNERD dataset. The filter-then-rerank framework, where SLMs act as filters and LLMs as rerankersrs, consistently achieves better results, especially on hard samples. This is evident from the figure showing that the micro-F1 scores for hard samples (τ < 0.6) are notably higher when using LLM reranking compared to without it."}

In the fine-tuning setup, SenseBERT BASE  further improves to 83.0, surpassing BBERT LARGE  by 2 points. On the Word in Context (WiC) task, SenseBERT BASE  achieves a state-of-the-art performance of 70.3, demonstrating its word-sense aware pre-training yields embeddings that carry lexical semantic information.\n\n[4] Table 2: Results on a supersense variant of the SemEval WSD test set standardized in Raganato et al. (2017), which we denote SemEval-SS, and on the Word in Context (WiC) dataset (Pilehvar and Camacho-Collados, 2019) included in the recently introduced SuperGLUE benchmark (Wang et al., 2019). These tasks require a high level of lexical semantic understanding, as can be seen in the examples in figure 4. For both tasks, SenseBERT demonstrates a clear improvement over BERT in the regular fine-tuning setup, where network weights are modified during training on the task.\n\n[5] The General Language Understanding Evaluation (GLUE; Wang et al. (2018)) benchmark is a popular testbed for language understanding models. It consists of 9 different NLP tasks, covering different linguistic phenomena. We evaluate our model on GLUE, in order to verify that SenseBERT gains its lexical semantic knowledge without compromising performance on other downstream tasks. Due to slight differences in the data used for pretraining BERT and SenseBERT (BookCorpus is not publicly available), we trained a BERT BASE  model with the same data used for our models. BERT BASE  and SenseBERT BASE  were both finetuned using the exact same procedures and hyperparameters. The results are presented in table 4. Indeed, SenseBERT performs on par with BERT, achieving an overall score of 77.9, compared to 77.5 achieved by BERT BASE .\n\n[9] We show that SenseBERT BASE  outscores both BERT BASE  and BERT LARGE  by a large margin on a supersense variant of the SemEval Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) data set standardized in Ra-ganato et al. (2017 ). Notably, SenseBERT receives competitive results on this task without fune-tuning, i.e., when training a linear classifier over the pretrained embeddings, which serves as a tesament for its self-acquisition of lexical semantics. Furthermore, we show that SenseBERT BASE  surpasses BERT LARGE  in the Word in Context (WiC) task (Pilehvar and Camacho-Collados, 2019 ), which directly depends on word-supersense aware ness. A single SenseBERT LARGE  model achieves state of the art performance on WiC with a score of 72.14 , improving the score of BERT LARGE  by 2.5 points.\n\n#### Image Evidence\n![SenseBERT outperforms BERT across various NLP tasks](image1)\nThe image shows comparisons between BERT and SenseBERT on the WiC task, highlighting how SenseBERT correctly identifies \"kick\" as \"noun.body\" in one sentence while BERT incorrectly identifies it as \"noun.quantity.\" Similarly, in another sentence, BERT incorrectly identifies \"plant\" as \"noun.group\" while SenseBERT correctly identifies it as \"verb.creation.\"\n\n### Answer\nSenseBERT_BASE  consistently outperforms BERT_BASE  across multiple NLP tasks, including the SemEval-SS and Word in Context (WiC) tasks.

The user query is retrieved, then generated into a response, which is judged against a threshold or maximum number of iterations before. This method ensures that the system iterates through multiple rounds of retrieval and generation until a satisfactory response is produced.\n\n- **Recursive** retrieval breaks down complex problems step by step. It the query is retrieved, followed by a generate phase where the LLM processes the retrieved information. A judge phase evaluates the output, leading to further refinement through retrieval and generation cycles. This process continues until the depth of the problem-solving tree reaches a predefined threshold.\n\n- **Adaptive** retrieval is characterized by flexible and active control over retrieval and generation. The system dynamically decides when to retrieve and generate based on the current state and feedback. In this model, the query is judged, and if necessary, the retrieval and generation processes are triggered on demand. This approach allows for continuous learning and adaptation to the user's requirements, ensuring that the system can handle nuanced and specialized information effectively.\n\nEach of these methods offers distinct advantages in handling different types of queries and scenarios, with iterative being straightforward and predictable, recursive being effective for complex problem-solving, and adaptive being highly flexible and responsive to user needs."}

The quote also references So et al.

The row \"Human life, avg, 1 year\" shows an average of 1,023 lbs of CO2e per year.

For the Transformer big model, the power consumption is listed as 1 W.

In its RC setting, each question is paired with two gold paragraphs, which should be needed to answer the question, and eight distractor paragraphs, which provide irrelevant evidence or incorrect answers. We show that single-hop reasoning can solve much more of this dataset than previously thought. First, we design a single-hop QA model based on BERT ( Devlin et al. , 2018 ), which, despite having no ability to reason across paragraphs, achieves performance competitive with the state of the art. Next, we present an evaluation demonstrating that humans can solve over $80\\%$ of questions when we withhold one of the gold paragraphs.\n[6] Distractor Setting The H OTPOT QA distractor setting pairs the two paragraphs the question was written for (gold paragraphs) with eight spurious paragraphs selected using TF-IDF similarity with the question (distractors). Our single-paragraph BERT model achieves 67.08 F1, comparable to the state-of-the-art (Table 1). This indicates the majority of H OTPOT QA questions are answerable in the distractor setting using a single-hop model.\n[5] To further investigate entity type matching, we reduce the question to the first five tokens starting from the wh-word, following Sugawara et al. (2018 ). Although most of these reduced questions appear void of critical information, the F1 score of single-paragraph BRT only degrades about 1 Ff from 67.08 to 52.13.\n\n### Image Quotes Analysis\n- **Image 4** shows a comparison of different models' performance on the H OTPOT QA dataset. The table includes \"Distractor F1\" and \"Open F1\" scores for various models. The highest \"Open F1\" score is achieved by the \"DecompRC\" model with a score of 40.65.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe model that achieves the highest Open F1 score is DecomprRC, with a score of 40.65. This signifies that DecomprRC is effective in handling open-domain questions, as it outperforms other models in scenarios where multiple paragraphs are available and not all are relevant to the question at hand. The significance lies in its capability to navigate through diverse and potentially misleading information to find the correct answer, indicating a robust approach to multi-hop reasoning in open-domain settings.\n\n![DecompRC achieves the highest Open F1 score](image4 )"}

In the first example, we can see that DS-Span cannot correctly extract the ground-truth values, because the User does not always explicitly mention 'yes' or 'no' when being asked about the internet or parking requests. In the second example, the User and the System are talking about a swimming pool, but they just say 'pool' and its meaning can be inferred from the context. As a result, DS-Span can only extract 'pool' as a value, which is not sufficient. In the third example, all the predictions are semantically correct; however, in terms of the string match, only DS-Picklist can correctly predict the value. The two other methods rely on span extraction. This is caused by formatting issues; that is, it is not always guaranteed that strings in the context satisfy desired formats, such as time expressions.\n\n[14] Comparing DS-Span and DS-DST, we can find that jointly using the non-categorical and categorical approaches is indeed helpful in multi-domain DST.

Items like cups, glasses, and delicate dishware should be placed in the upper basket, as suggested in [9]. Additionally, all utensils must be stacked securely and not tip over to avoid blocking the spray arms, as emphasized in [7]. Curved or recessed items should be loaded slantwise to allow water to run off, while hollow items should have their openings facing downwards to prevent water accumulation. Long and sharp items like carving knives should be positioned horizontally in the upper basket. Overloading the dishwasher is discouraged to ensure good results and reasonable energy consumption, as noted in [9].\n\n![Non-compliance with loading can result in poor washing quality](image3 )"}

'Needs Exploration' involves a detailed process where stakeholders are actively engaged to identify their needs and expectations. This is often facilitated through various methods such as informal modeling sessions, interviews, and workshops, which are part of the 'Elicitation Methods' strategy.\n\n[4] Test-First Development (TFD) is a technique where you write a single test and then write just enough production code to fulfill that test. [5] DAD leverages proven strategies from several sources providing a decision framework to guide your adoption and tailoring of them in a context-driven manner.\n\n#### Image\n![Needs Exploration](image1)\nThe image highlights 'Needs Exploration' as a key phase in the development strategy, emphasizing active stakeholder participation and high-level requirements specification.

The most significant barrier was **Internal Breach of Security**, which rose from 39% in 2005 to 56% in 2006. Other the other hand, **Lack of Financial Support** increased from 11% to 20%, highlighting financial constraints as a major hurdle.\n\n![Top Security Concerns](image1)\n- **Top Security Concerns**: Internal Breach of Security, Lack of Financial Support\n\n#### Comparison\nDespite the increasing adoption rates, the barriers to implementation have also grown significantly. This suggests that while there is a push towards adopting new technologies, the challenges in securing these systems and managing financial resources are becoming more pronounced. \n\nIn conclusion, the adoption of healthcare IT applications has seen substantial growth, particularly in areas like EMR and CPOE, but the barriers to implementation, especially security concerns and financial support, have also risen, indicating a need for better strategies to address these issues.\n\n[1 ]"}

In this application it uses strong internal pull ups when emitting 1's.\n\n[9] Port 1isan8-bit bidirectional I/Oportwith internal pull ups. The Port  output buffers can sink/source 4 LS TTL inputs. Port  pins that have  ones written to them are pulled high by the internal pull-ups, and in that state can be used as inputs. As inputs, Port  pins that are externally pulled low will source current $(\\mathfrak{h}_{\\mathfrak{l}})$ on the data sheet) because of the pullups.\n\nThe alternative functions for P1.0 and P3.0 are detailed in the following quotes:\n\n[4] For P1.0: T2 (Timer/Counter 2 External Input)\n\n[5] for P3.0: RXD (serial input port)\n\nFrom these quotes, we can see that P1.0 is configured as a Timer/Counter 2 External Input, while P3.0 serves as a serial input port.\n\nNow let's look at how their pin configurations differ in DIP and PLCC packaging:\n\n- **Image 3** shows the pin configuration for both DIP and PLCC packages.

When enjoyment drops, we should switch to another choice.\n[4] In standard consumption economics focusing is often bad\n[5] But, for some, decision training is also important because of the potential for competitive mastery resulting from focus.\n[7] Focused practice may result in increased utility due to\n  11. Improved activity experience due to accumulated skill consumption capital)\n  2. Improved activity outcome due to cumulative experience (human production capital)\n\nThe concept of diminishing marginal utility suggests that as you consume more of a good or service, the additional satisfaction or utility decreases. This principle applies to both standard consumption and competitive contexts but manifests differently.\n\nIn **standard consumption**, [3] diminishing marginal utility implies that after consuming several hot dogs, each additional one provides less and less satisfaction. For example, the table shows that the first hot dog yields +110 utility, the second yields +4, and so on, until the sixth hot dog results in -110 utility. This pattern indicates that beyond a certain point, consuming more hot dogs leads to a decrease in overall enjoyment.\n\nIn **competitive contexts**, such as eating contests, [5] the importance of focus becomes crucial. The image with the question \"How important is focus when trying to achieve mastery in some area?\" highlights this idea. Joey Chestnut's performance in the hot dog eating contest demonstrates the impact of focus. As shown in the table, while in standard consumption diminishing marginal utility applies, in competitive contexts, [7] focused practice can lead to significant improvements. The table illustrates that while individual hot dogs provide diminishing returns, the cumulative effect of intense focus and practice can lead to substantial gains, especially in high-stakes situations where mastery is sought.\n\n#### Image:\n![Focus Mastery](image5)\n\nThe concept of diminishing marginal utility differs between standard consumption and competitive contexts by highlighting how focus and repetition can amplify the benefits in competitive scenarios, whereas in standard consumption, the benefits diminish over time.\n\n**Answer:**\nFocus and repetition are key in competitive contexts, where they can amplify the benefits, unlike in standard consumption where diminishing marginal utility applies."}
