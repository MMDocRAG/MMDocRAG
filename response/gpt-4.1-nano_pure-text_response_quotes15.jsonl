Specifically, a majority now believe that the U.S. and its allies will succeed in their campaign against Islamic militants by the end of 2015.\n\nThe data from the survey indicate that two-thirds of Americans, 66%, now think that they will either definitely or probably succeed in defeating ISIS [2]. This represents an 11-point increase from July 2015, when only 55% held this optimistic view [2]. Visual evidence from the bar chart in image1 corroborates this trend, showing a substantial rise in the percentage of people expressing confidence in success from July to December 2015, with those believing in success increasing from 55% to 66%, and those believing in failure decreasing from 36% to 27% [image1].\n\nFurthermore, the support for a positive outcome has been relatively steady throughout 2015, and Americans' attitudes reflect a growing belief that, despite current setbacks, victory is achievable. While the public still holds negative assessments of the immediate progress, the overall outlook for eventual success has improved notably toward the end of 2015. \n\nIn summary, although many Americans believe the current military effort is not going well, there is a stronger confidence by the end of 2015 that the U.S. and its allies will ultimately succeed in defeating ISIS."}

Although the provided quotes do not specify any change in Lufthansa's logo colors during this period, it is common in crisis management for a parent company's branding to be adapted to show solidarity or mourning. The quotes highlight that Germanwings' logo was changed to black and white within the first 120 minutes, and Lufthansa followed a similar pattern [6], suggesting that while Lufthansa's own logo likely remained its standard colors initially, it might have been toned down or appeared in black and white as part of the broader visual response.\n\nThe images support this interpretation: Image 2 shows Lufthansa's Facebook page with its original logo, featuring the stylized bird in its typical color scheme, typically blue. Since no mention was made of an immediate color change within the first 90 minutes, it's reasonable to conclude that Lufthansa's logo kept its original colors during this initial period. It was only later, within 120 minutes, that Lufthansa, like Germanwings, adopted the black-and-white color scheme—indicating a shift in visual tone to reflect mourning or seriousness.\n\n![Lufthansa logo in its standard colors](image2)\n\nIn summary, Lufthansa's logo likely remained in its standard colors—blue and white—during the first 90 minutes.

Assuming your question pertains to this 2018 survey, we can analyze the relevant information.\n\nFrom quote [9], we learn that about a third of independents and roughly two-in-ten Republicans and Democrats believe neither party has high ethical standards.

While this percentage applies to the total population, it does not specify the breakdown within Democrats.\n\nImportantly, quote [7] states that nearly a third of college graduates say neither party has ‘high ethical standards’, but it doesn't break down this figure further by party.\n\nThe challenge here is that the question asks specifically *how many Democratic people in the survey* say neither party has high standards, but the exact percentage for Democrats is approximately 18-19% based on [9].\n\nIf we consider the total number of Democratic respondents as 710 (from image2), and assume that approximately 19% of them believe neither party has high ethical standards, the calculation would be:\n\n18.5% of 710 ≈ 0.185 × 710 ≈ 131.35\n\n**Therefore, approximately 131 Democratic respondents out of 710 surveyed said that neither party has high ethical standards.**\n\n---\n\n![A bar chart showing that about 19% of Democrats believe neither party has high ethical standards, based on survey data](image2)\n\n*Overall, roughly 19% of Democratic respondents in the survey believed that neither the Republican nor Democratic Party possesses high ethical standards.*"}

By 2016, the proportion of moderates among voters increased slightly to 36%, while the majority, around 60%, consistently identified as \"More conservative,\" with a small variation.\n\nMeanwhile, the evidence from the text supports a trend toward greater liberalism among Democratic voters. According to quote [9], about half (49%) of Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters now favor a more liberal direction, a significant increase from about 38% two years after Obama’s 2012 victory and notably higher than previous years. Similarly, quote [10] notes that Democratic voters are more supportive now of moving in a more liberal direction than they were after the 2008 or 2012 elections, reflecting a liberal shift within the party.\n\nFor Republicans, the trend is different. From quote [7], 60% of Republican and Republican-leaning voters want the GOP to move in a more conservative direction, indicating a strong retention of conservative ideology over the years. The image showing that in 2016 about 60% of voters still see the GOP as \"More conservative\" supports this consistency.\n\nIn sum, while Republican voters have largely maintained their conservative orientation, Democratic voters have been shifting toward more liberal positions, reducing the ideological gap between the two parties. The combined evidence suggests increased polarization, with Republicans steadfastly conservative and Democrats increasingly liberal by 2016.\n\n![The image showing the ideological distribution from 2008 to 2016, with a slight increase in moderates in 2016](image5)"}

This polarized perception likely influenced attitudes on bipartisan appointments. Furthermore, voter behavior in 2008 favored more openness to cross-party appointments; nearly half of Obama supporters supported appointing Republicans, contrasting with the lower support from Trump voters in 2016 for appointing Democrats. Interestingly, the data suggest that, compared to Obama in 2008, Trump's supporters are less inclined toward bipartisan appointments, with a much larger percentage (52%) believing it doesn't matter.\n\n![The survey data illustrating voter support and attitudes towards bipartisan appointments in 2016 and 2008](image4)  \n*The bar chart indicates that in 2008, a majority of Obama voters supported appointing Republicans, whereas in 2016, only about a quarter of Trump voters supported appointing Democrats.*  \n\nIn summary, voter opinion on appointing opposition party members was substantially more favorable towards bipartisan cooperation during Obama’s 2008 victory than Trump's in 2016, highlighting increased partisan divides over time.  \n**Therefore, voters were generally more supportive of cross-party appointments in 2008 than in 2016, particularly among the winning candidates' supporters.**"}

This indicates that, despite some similarities in views on policy ideas and ethics, the perception of extremism remains a significant dividing line shaped heavily by political and educational identities.\n\nTo synthesize, perceptions of ethical standards are generally modest across groups, with Democrats slightly favored, but independents and less-educated respondents tend to be more skeptical. Regarding extremism, Republicans are more likely to see their own party as moderate and less \"too extreme\" compared to Democrats, but overall, views of extremism are deeply divided along partisan lines. \n\n![perceptions of party ethics and extremism](image2)  \n*The bar chart illustrates similar perceptions across Democrats and Republicans regarding policy ideas, ethics, and extremism, with a notable gap in views on extremism.*"}

According to recent data, approximately 41% of Americans believe both parties have high ethical standards, with similar views for each party—about 42% for Democrats and 41% for Republicans [2][9]. However, only a minority, around 18-19%, think either party lacks high ethical standards, and a sizable quarter believe neither party holds high ethical standards [1][6].\n\n![A bar chart showing that about 41% of Americans see both parties as having high ethical standards, with similar views for Democrats and Republicans](image3)\n\nMeanwhile, perceptions of extremism differ markedly: 48% view the Republican Party as “too extreme,” compared to 42% for the Democratic Party [3]. Notably, the view of the GOP as “too extreme” has declined from 54% last June, indicating some easing in perception, but still stands higher than the Democratic Party’s comparable view.\n\n![A bar chart illustrating 48% of Americans see Republicans as “too extreme,” versus 42% for Democrats](image3)\n\nWhen examining how education influences these perceptions, data shows that individuals with less than a college degree (high school or less) are less likely to see either party as lacking high ethical standards—only 20% think neither party has high ethics—compared to 26% among those with some college education. Conversely, college-educated respondents tend to be more nuanced, with 43% perceiving one party as ethical but not the other [5][8].\n\nPolitical affiliation further shapes these views.

Yet, they also generally perceive the opposing party as “too extreme”: over 75% in each group believe the other party falls into this category [7].\n\nThese perceptions are markedly divided along partisan lines, emphasizing the deep polarization on both ethical standards and extremism. Education and political leanings significantly influence these perceptions: less educated individuals are somewhat less critical of their own parties’ ethics, and partisans tend to see their own party positively while criticizing the opposition.\n\nIn summary, Republicans are more likely than Democrats to be perceived as “too extreme,” while perceptions of ethical standards are relatively similar across parties but heavily influenced by individual education levels and political biases."}

Among those with at least a college degree, this perception remains similar, with approximately a quarter to a third viewing both parties as lacking high ethical standards [7], [9]. Interestingly, independents are more inclined than partisans to think neither party maintains high ethics, with around 34% expressing this view [10].\n\nThis skepticism about party ethics is also reflected in visual data, such as the bar chart showing perceptions of both parties. The chart indicates that while many believe both parties describe high ethical standards (around 17-47%), a substantial share attributes this to only one party or neither, especially among less educated groups and independents.\n\n![The image is a bar chart with three categories: describes both parties, describes one party, and describes neither party, showing variation across education and political groups.](image3)\n\nWhen it comes to party preferences, education plays a role.

Support for the Republican Party is higher among less educated groups, with about 47% of those with a high school diploma or less favoring Republicans, whereas college-educated voters lean Democratic.\n\nIn terms of political affiliation, partisanship strongly influences perceived ethical standards. Majorities of Republicans and Democrats describe their own parties as having high ethical standards—66% and 64%, respectively [5],—yet independents are more skeptical, with about 34% perceiving neither party as ethically high [10].

According to [3], only 25% of voters believe race relations will improve post-Trump’s election, while a significant 46% think they will worsen, and 26% see no change. Similarly, expectations for partisan relations are modest, with about 27% anticipating improvements, 27% expecting worsening, and 45% foreseeing little change [8]. This indicates a widespread perception that political and racial divides are unlikely to narrow soon.\n\nIntertwined with these perceptions are attitudes toward the influence of supporters’ enthusiasm. The data from [3] and [6] reveal that Trump supporters are notably more optimistic about positive change; 50% expect race relations to improve, and 47% believe partisan relations will get better, with only 9% and 9% respectively expecting things to worsen. Conversely, Clinton voters tend to be more pessimistic, with 84% expecting race relations to worsen and most also skeptical about partisan improvements. \n\nFurthermore, the survey in [5] shows that Trump supporters are more inclined to believe that highly enthusiastic supporters can positively influence governance, with 55% disagreeing that such supporters hinder progress, compared to 90% of Clinton supporters who see little negative impact. This suggests Trump supporters are more optimistic about rallying supportive voters to bring about tangible progress, whereas many Clinton supporters are more cautious or skeptical.\n\nAdding to this, the visual data highlight that a substantial portion of voters across party lines feel that strong supporter enthusiasm may demand more effective action. The combined evidence suggests that while voters recognize the polarized climate and expect limited progress in race and partisan relations, supporters' enthusiasm—particularly among Trump fans—may serve as a catalyst for change, fostering optimism for improved relations.\n\n![The image is a bar chart showing voter opinions on working with Trump versus standing up to him on issues important to Democrats.](image1)"}

According to the data, Republican voters have consistently favored a more conservative direction for their party, with around 60% favoring conservatism from 2008 through 2016, as shown in the bar chart from **image2**. This indicates a persistent inclination among Republicans to maintain a conservative approach, with little significant change over nearly a decade. Conversely, Democratic voters’ attitudes have evolved more noticeably. In **image3**, the proportion of Democratic-leaning individuals supporting a more moderate stance has remained relatively high, but by 2016, there was an increase in those supporting a more liberal direction—about 49% in 2016 compared to only 38% in 2014—highlighting a shift toward liberal aspirations within the party.\n\nWhen considering their reactions to the 2016 election results, the data reveals stark differences between the two groups. As seen in **image5**, Trump voters overwhelmingly felt happy—94%—about the election outcome, reflecting satisfaction with the Republican victory. Meanwhile, Clinton supporters largely expressed unhappiness, with 87% feeling unhappy, indicating a reaction aligned with party loyalty and decisively negative sentiments among Democrats. **image4** further illustrates their willingness to work with or oppose Trump; 83% of Trump supporters favor working with Trump, contrasted with only 35% of Clinton supporters, who mainly support standing up to him.\n\nOverall, Republican voters have maintained their conservative stance over time, and they generally respond positively to Republican victories, as reflected by their support for working with Trump and their happiness with the election outcome. Democratic voters, while more divided regarding their party's orientation, have shown increasing support for liberal policies over the years and tend to react negatively to Republican wins, especially in 2016. The divergence in reactions underscores a growing partisan divide, with Democrats feeling less satisfied when their candidate loses and Republicans feeling more aligned and content following their victories.\n\n![The bar chart shows voter reactions in 2016, with Trump voters mostly happy and Clinton supporters mostly unhappy](image5)."}

Specifically, **78% of Obama supporters** felt that Democratic leaders should cooperate with Republicans, and similarly, **86% of McCain supporters** wanted Republican leaders to work with Obama [9]. The picture for Republicans was similar, with **74%** favoring cooperation with Obama [10].\n\nBy contrast, in 2016, attitudes had become more polarized and less cooperative, especially among Democrats and Democratic-leaning voters. Only **32%** of Democrats supported working with Trump, while **65%** preferred standing firm against him [8]. Among Republicans, a starkly different view persisted, with **84%** supporting working with Trump, and only **14%** preferring to stand up to him (image1), indicating a partisan divide in expectations.\n\nIllustrating this shift, the survey in 2016 showed that **55% of all voters** believed leaders should cooperate to get things done, but among Democrats, **84%** prioritized standing up to Trump rather than working with him, contrasting sharply with the 2008 mentality of bipartisan cooperation [2,8]. The visual data in images captures this evolution, with the bar charts highlighting reduced support among Democrats for collaboration and increased willingness among Republicans to work with Trump compared to 2008.\n\nFurthermore, public perception of political negativity increased significantly. The line graph indicates that by 2016, **92% of voters** perceived more \"mudslinging\" than in past elections—more than any previous cycle—reflecting heightened frustrations and perhaps reduced trust in bipartisan efforts [3, image3].\n\nIn summary, voter expectations in 2008 favored party leaders working together across divisions, fostering cooperation, whereas by 2016, there was a tendency—especially among Democrats—to prefer standing firm against the opposing leader, signaling a more adversarial political climate and waning bipartisan cooperation.\n\n---\n\n![Survey comparison on bipartisan cooperation between 2008 and 2016](image1)  \n*Survey results from 2016 show that Democratic leaders largely preferred to stand up to Trump, whereas in 2008, both parties favored cooperation with the incoming president.*"}

The survey data reveal that voters viewed the 2016 election as extraordinarily negative, with a striking 92% of respondents indicating that there was more mudslinging or negative campaigning compared to previous elections—this is a significant increase from past years, especially since 2004 when 72% reported more negativity [7]. \n\nThe line graph illustrating this trend vividly shows a sharp rise in perceived negative campaigning over the years, culminating in 2016, where 92% perceived more mudslinging, the highest in the surveyed period [image1]. This escalation in negativity correlates with voters’ overall ambivalent and often negative emotions about the election outcome. For instance, nearly half of the voters (53%) said Trump’s election made them feel “uneasy,” while 51% felt hopeful; smaller proportions felt scared, sad, or angry [6]. The emotional landscape includes high levels of unease and sadness, which can be linked to the broad dissatisfaction as the election involved intense negative rhetoric.\n\nAdditionally, voter opinions of the candidates and parties were quite critical. Only about a quarter gave positive grades (A or B) to Trump (30%) and the Republican Party (22%), and similarly modest percentages for Clinton and the Democratic Party [4][5]. The low ratings for campaign actors—such as the press and pollsters, with many giving failing grades—augment the perception that the campaign was not only negative but also poorly conducted [3].\n\nThe perception of increased negativity is reinforced by the data on voters’ feelings about the political process; a record 73% believed there was less discussion of issues, indicating a focus on negativity rather than substantive debate [10]. Moreover, the heightened negativity during this election cycle can be inferred from the fear, worry, and disillusionment expressed by the voters, aligning with their critical perception of campaign conduct and political polarization.\n\nIn summary, the surge in negative campaigning in 2016—evident from the high percentage of voters perceiving more mudslinging—corresponds with widespread feelings of unease, sadness, and dissatisfaction with political entities [images, graph, and survey quotes]. The voters’ negative perceptions of candidates, parties, press, and pollsters reflect and amplify the overall atmosphere of political negativity during that campaign.\n\n![The increasing perception of negativity over election years](image1)  \n![Voter emotions indicating unease and sadness](image3)"}

This perception of hyper-partisanship and negativity correlates with the emotional turmoil observed, as Clinton supporters' feelings of disappointment and fear could partly stem from the intense negative climate.\n\nFurthermore, the public's overall ratings of campaign and political actors were generally low. Only about a quarter rated the parties with A or B grades, and about 30% assigned failing grades, indicating widespread dissatisfaction [3]. Combined with the high levels of mudslinging and negative campaigning, these perceptions reinforce the emotional divide between the groups.\n\nIn summary, Trump voters experienced predominantly positive emotions like hope and pride, likely fueled by perceptions of a successful and impactful victory amidst a highly negative political environment characterized by intense mudslinging. Clinton voters, however, reacted with negative emotions, reflecting their disappointment and concern in a context marked by unprecedented negativity and harsh judgments of political entities. This emotional divide underscores how perceptions of political performance and campaign negativity shape voters' emotional responses.\n\n**In brief:** Trump supporters felt hopeful and proud, aligning with their positive view of his victory amid widespread negative campaigning, while Clinton supporters experienced feelings of unease, sadness, and fear, linked to their disappointment in the election and the highly negative political climate."}

According to [2], Americans' ratings of the government's counterterrorism efforts have dropped to their lowest point since 2001, with more people now describing the government's performance as not too well or not at all well (52%) than as very or fairly well (46%). This decline is reinforced by [3], which shows that assessments across political groups have become more negative since early 2015, with Democrats still relatively more positive but also experiencing a substantial decrease—from 85% in January to 64%—while Independents and Republicans' positive ratings notably fell, with only 27% of Republicans rating the efforts favorably [3].\n\nPolitical affiliation plays a crucial role in perceptions. Democrats generally rate government efforts more positively than Republicans and Independents. For example, [5] confirms that 58% of those with postgraduate degrees, who tend to lean Democratic, view government efforts positively, whereas only 44% of those with less education or less higher education tend to be more skeptical. Additionally, [4] suggests that since Snowden’s disclosures in 2013, Republicans have become especially concerned that anti-terror policies don't go far enough, with 71% now emphasizing that concern, up 14 points since January [4].\n\nAge differences are also evident. Younger adults (18-29) tend to perceive the government more favorably; 53% believe it is doing well, whereas only 42% of those over 50 share that view [6]. Moreover, older and less educated respondents generally rate government efforts more negatively, aligning with the pattern described in [7] and [9].\n\nFurthermore, as shown in [1], there's a widespread concern that anti-terror policies have not gone far enough to protect the country, matching the rising worry expressed nationally that policies aren’t sufficient [10].

This gap aligns somewhat with the heightened suspicion of Islam among Republicans, who also perceive Islam as more supportive of violence. The overall perception of hostility towards Islam among Republicans correlates with their confidence in their party's ability to combat terrorism, as they tend to associate more threat with Islam.\n\nFinally, **image5** shows that the perception that Islam is more likely to encourage violence among believers has increased from 25% in 2002 to 45% in 2015, underscoring an overall growth in suspicion and fear over time across the broader public, which likely influences and reflects the partisan perceptions detailed above.\n\nIn summary, perceptions among Republicans have become significantly more negative regarding Islam's tendency to incite violence, paralleling their strong confidence in their party’s ability to handle terrorism. Meanwhile, Democrats remain comparatively less concerned about Islam's violence encouragement, and their confidence in tackling terrorism is also comparatively lower. This diverging perception underscores a deepening political divide on how Islam and terrorism are viewed in the U.S.\n\n---\n\n**![](image1)**: The line graph shows a steady increase in the percentage of Republicans who believe Islam encourages violence, from about 33% in 2002 to nearly 68% in 2015.  \n**![](image2)**: The political affiliation graph indicates that the proportion of Republicans identifying as such has risen from around 33% in 2002 to 68% in 2015, aligning with their increased suspicion of Islam.  \n**![](image3)**: The chart highlights that 46% of the public trusts Republicans more in handling terrorism, matching the perception that Islam is more likely to encourage violence among their supporters.  \n**![](image4)**: The demographic breakdown shows that conservative Republicans are most likely to view Islam as encouraging violence, with 77% holding this view in recent years.  \n**![](image5)**: The timeline graph illustrates the growing perception since 2002 that Islam is more likely than other religions to encourage violence, reflecting increasing partisan and public concern."}

Conservative Republicans are notably more inclined to support increased scrutiny, with 57% believing Muslims should be subject to more attention [3], contrasting sharply with liberal Democrats, where 87% oppose such scrutiny [6]. This skepticism among liberals aligns with their lower prioritization of terrorism as a major concern, as only 23% of Democrats cite terrorism as the most important national issue [4], whereas 41% of Republicans emphasize terrorism, defense, or national security [4].\n\nVisual evidence shows that Republican-leaning groups feel a greater threat from terrorism; for instance, Figure 4 indicates that Republicans prioritize terrorism and national security issues more than Democrats do, with a net difference of +25% in concern for terrorism/ISIS/National security [4]. Conversely, Democrats tend to focus more on domestic issues like the economy and social policies.\n\nDemographically, younger adults (18-29) and minorities are less likely to endorse increased scrutiny of Muslims, with 80% of young adults saying such scrutiny should not be part of counterterrorism efforts [8] and 74% of Blacks opposing religious-based scrutiny [10]. Older adults and White evangelicals are more divided, with about half supporting more scrutiny [1,7].\n\nOverall, groups that emphasize terrorism as a pressing issue are more supportive of scrutinizing Muslims, reflecting their heightened perception of security threats. Conversely, demographic groups less concerned with terrorism tend to oppose increased scrutiny, emphasizing civil liberties and social integration over security measures.\n\n![Bar chart showing political groups' opinions on religious scrutiny](image3)  \n\nThis illustrates that perceptions of the threat posed by terrorism heavily influence attitudes toward religious scrutiny, with conservative and security-focused groups advocating for more scrutiny aligned with their higher concern for terrorism."}

According to recent survey data, 29% of Americans now cite terrorism, including ISIS and national security concerns, as the most important problem facing the country, which is the highest since February 2003, compared to just 4% a year ago [7]. This increase is reflected in the media focus and the heightened concern about terrorism's threat, as shown in the survey data from December 2014 to December 2015, where the percentage mentioning terrorism in a concern context skyrocketed from 1% to 18% (+17) [image1].\n\nIn parallel, perceptions of how effectively the government is managing terrorism have worsened. Currently, 52% of Americans believe the government is doing not too well or not at all well in reducing the terrorist threat, which is a sharp decline from earlier positive ratings, such as 72% in January 2015 [3]. The decline has been broad across the political spectrum, with Democrats still largely positive (64%), but independents’ positive ratings falling from 69% to 44%, and Republicans’ perceptions worsening from 63% to just 27% [4]. Similarly, evaluations among those with higher education levels (postgraduates) remain somewhat more positive (58%) than among those with less education (44%) or only a bachelor’s degree (48%) [6].\n\nPublic concern about terrorism and the government’s efforts to combat it varies notably among demographic and political groups. Older Americans and those with less education tend to give more negative ratings of government performance, aligning with their greater concern about terrorism and higher perception of scrutiny or threat. For example, individuals aged 50+ perceive more government inadequacy and are more likely to see increased scrutiny based on religion, with 80% feeling there is additional religion-based scrutiny, compared to 61% overall [image5].\n\nPolitically, Republicans are much more likely than Democrats to prioritize terrorism as the key issue and to view government efforts positively—though these perceptions have declined markedly among all groups recently. For instance, only 27% of Republicans now view the government as doing very or fairly well on terrorism, down from 63% at the start of the year [4]. Democrats continue to rate government efforts more positively, but their approval has also fallen from 85% to 64% since early 2015 [4].\n\nOverall, Americans’ concerns about terrorism have surged, while confidence in government efforts has diminished across all demographics, especially among older, less educated, and Republican segments. The trend indicates increasing anxiety about terrorism and skepticism about effective government responses, with political and demographic differences shaping how these issues are perceived.\n\n![The table showing survey concerns over terrorism and international issues, highlighting the rise from 4% to 29% citing terrorism in just over a decade](image1)\n\n![Line graph of presidential approval ratings over time, showing fluctuations across party lines, reflecting shifting confidence in governmental leadership concerning security issues](image2)\n\n![Survey table displaying issue prioritization differences among political parties, with terrorism and national security being top concerns for Republicans and less emphasized among Democrats](image3)\n\n![Table illustrating how well different demographic groups perceive government efforts to reduce terrorism, with older and less educated Americans being more critical](image4)\n\n![Bar chart depicting perceptions of religious scrutiny, with older and certain demographic groups feeling more adversely affected](image5)\n\nIn summary, perceptions of terrorism have intensified while confidence in governmental counter-terrorism efforts has declined, with notable variations across age, education, and political affiliations."}

For instance, in the issue prioritization table, **41% of Republicans** cite terrorism and national security as top problems, compared to only **23% of Democrats** [5], highlighting a strong partisan focus on security threats. Additionally, Republicans are more likely to believe that the government is not doing enough to address terrorism. Specifically, **74% of Republicans** express concern that anti-terrorism policies have not gone far enough, versus **41% of Democrats** [10], showing that Republicans tend to favor more aggressive security measures, while Democrats are more cautious.\n\nConversely, economic issues are perceived differently across parties. The data from December 2014 and 2015 shows that concerns about the economy have decreased overall: the percentage mentioning the economy dropped from **14% to 9%** [4], with Democrats generally less focused on economic problems than Republicans. Furthermore, demographic breakdowns reveal that Democrats tend to rate economic performance more favorably, with a higher percentage indicating being very or fairly well regarding government efforts [category breakdown], whereas Republicans more often cite terrorism or national security as the primary concern. The \"issue importance\" table shows that economic issues are less emphasized by Republicans (2nd in priority for some, but less so than terrorism), indicating that security concerns overshadow economic ones among Republicans.\n\nIn summary, **Republicans are more concerned about terrorism and security threats, advocating for stricter policies**, while **Democrats are more focused on economic issues and less inclined to prioritize terrorist threats**. This is reflected both in their issue priorities and in their perceptions of government efforts.\n\n![The table displays survey results regarding issue priorities between Republicans and Democrats, showing Republicans' focus on security and terrorism, contrasted with Democrats' lesser emphasis on these concerns](image1)"}

This indicates that Republicans place a greater emphasis on terrorism compared to other groups.\n\nSupporting this, the poll on perceptions of government performance indicates that Republicans are substantially more likely to rate the government's effectiveness in reducing terrorism negatively, with only 27% believing it is doing well, down from 63% earlier in the year [4], [7]. In contrast, Democrats are more positive, with a majority (64%) still rating the government’s efforts as at least fairly effective, although this has declined from 85% earlier [4]. Independents’ opinions are notably less favorable now, with only 44% rating efforts positively, a decrease from 69% [4].\n\nFurthermore, concern about the adequacy of anti-terror policies remains higher among Republicans (more than two-thirds) than among Democrats or Independents, who are more concerned that policies have not gone far enough to protect the country [8]. This heightened concern correlates with their emphasis on terrorism as a critical issue and their lower confidence in government efforts.\n\nIn essence, Republicans prioritize terrorism as a pressing issue more than Democrats and Independents, and they are also more skeptical of government effectiveness in addressing the terrorist threat.

The chart (image1) indicates that Americans generally favor actions related to defense more than Germans, with 60% of Americans supporting certain measures versus only 34% of Germans opposing them, highlighting divergent national attitudes.\n\nFurthermore, Americans perceive U.S. military bases in Germany as highly important for their national security, with 85% affirming their significance ([6]). Germans, however, are less convinced, with only about half viewing U.S. military presence as important, and 45% disagree ([9]). This disparity underscores differing national security priorities and perceptions of alliance roles.\n\nIn summary, American support for increased defense spending and the importance of U.S. military bases in Germany have declined slightly among Republicans and Democrats with time, while in Germany, opinions are divided but trending toward greater support for increased defense budgets. Partisan preferences within each country influence these views substantially, reflecting changing security concerns and political attitudes over the years."}

According to the comparative bar chart (image1), American support for increasing European allies' defense spending declined from 45% in 2017 to 35% in 2019, while Germans' support rose slightly from 32% to 40% over the same period. Meanwhile, Germans generally remain more divided on whether to increase or maintain their defense expenditure, with about four-in-ten adopting each stance in 2019 [10].\n\nWithin the United States, partisan differences are prominent. The line graph (image3) illustrates that Republican or Republican-leaning individuals' support for increased defense spending decreased significantly from 62% in 2017 to 48% in 2019, reflecting a notable decline in enthusiasm among conservatives. Democratic or Democratic-leaning individuals started with lower support at 34% in 2017 and declined slightly to 28% by 2019, indicating a narrower gap but overall some decreasing trend in support across parties.\n\nIn Germany, partisan gaps also influence attitudes. Supporters of the CDU/CSU tend to favor increasing defense spending, with roughly 41% supporting this in 2019, whereas Greens supporters express more skepticism, with only 28% advocating for increased spending. The broader German public is divided, with support declining from about half in 2017 to a little over a third in 2019 for increased defense expenditure [9], reflecting a cautious approach and differing political attitudes. \n\nThe data overall shows that both Americans and Germans have become somewhat more conservative or cautious regarding increasing defense budgets, with partisan divisions shaping these trends in each country. Younger Germans, in particular, are less supportive of U.S. military bases, viewing them as less contributing to security, especially among those aged 18-29, who largely see U.S. bases as not contributing to German security [8]. \n\nIn summary, the support for increasing military spending has waned slightly in both countries over recent years, with significant partisan divides shaping perceptions, especially in the U.S., where political affiliation strongly influences attitudes toward defense expenditure."}

Conversely, Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents exhibit slightly less enthusiastic support, with around 80% valuing the bases' importance in 2017, decreasing slightly by 2019 [3][10][5].\n\nIn Germany, political party support shapes attitudes toward defense spending increases. CDU/CSU supporters are generally in favor, whereas Green supporters are much more skeptical, with only 28% supporting increased defense spending. SPD supporters fall in the middle at about 41% [5]. Furthermore, Germans' views on the importance of American military bases are diverse, with younger Germans (18-29) largely skeptical—around 60% believe bases do not contribute to security—while older Germans (65+) largely see them as important (61%) [6].\n\nOver time, opposition to increased defense spending has grown among Americans, especially among Republicans, as support declined from 45% in 2017 to 35% in 2019.

For example, 60% of postgraduates believe the U.S. should help other countries with their problems, compared to only about 29% of those with a high school education or less [1](text); this is visually supported by the high percentage of postgraduate respondents favoring international support in the chart [image3]. Meanwhile, less educated groups are predominantly inclined to have the U.S. handle its own issues exclusively.\n\nAdditionally, perceptions of how well the U.S. is managing its international responsibilities are generally more negative among Republicans, especially conservatives, who perceive the U.S. as doing adequately or well, as highlighted by the increasing trend of Americans believing the U.S. is doing \"Too much\" international engagement over time [image2]. Conversely, Democrats tend to be more critical of the U.S. response, aligning with their greater support for international cooperation [1](text).\n\nIn summary, Republicans, particularly conservatives, tend to favor a more inward focus, advocating that the U.S. should prioritize its own problems, while Democrats and those with higher education generally favor active international engagement.

This substantial difference is also reflected in the chart showing political leanings, where 71% of Republicans versus only 27% of Democrats/Lean Democrats lean toward the Republican side in their attitudes toward the U.S. response [image2].\n\nFurthermore, educational attainment influences how Americans view their country's response. More educated individuals, especially those with postgraduate degrees, are more critical; about two-thirds of postgraduates and around six-in-ten college graduates believe the U.S. has done a poor job [2].

Only 27% of Democrats/Lean Dems believe the U.S. did a good or excellent job managing the outbreak, whereas the majority of Republicans are more approving, with 71% expressing confidence in the U.S. response [8]. This ideological split reflects deeper partisan attitudes towards the countries' responses.\n\nInterleaving these insights, the visual image data further supports this divide. For example, the chart comparing political leanings in various countries shows that 71% of Republicans/Lean Reps believe the U.S. can learn from other countries, whereas only 27% of Democrats/Lean Dems share that view [2, image2]. This suggests Republicans are more inclined to see the U.S. as capable of improvement and possibly more critical of China’s response, aligning with their skepticism about China’s handling.\n\nFurthermore, the bar chart on perceptions across demographic groups indicates that political affiliation strongly influences how responses are judged.

This indicating a shift from concerns during the recession to a notable sense of upward mobility. Despite the socioeconomic challenges, including higher unemployment and poverty rates detailed in the text and supported by the graphs, the overall sentiment of financial improvement among Latinos has increased, signaling greater optimism about their economic future compared to the more stable but still challenging reality of unemployment trends.\n\nIn summary, while unemployment rates for Latinos remained higher than for non-Hispanic whites over this period, their perceptions of financial well-being and optimism about future economic mobility have notably improved between 2000 and 2015."}

The line graph depicting unemployment rates indicates that Hispanics experience higher and more persistent unemployment than non-Hispanics throughout the period from 2000 to 2015. Specifically, the unemployment rate for Hispanics started at 5.8% in 2000, peaked around 2010 during the recession, and ended at 6.4% in 2015, consistently staying above the non-Hispanic rate, which rose from 3.8% to 4.8% over the same period [image5].\n\nMeanwhile, economic perceptions among Hispanics have remained relatively optimistic and even improved over time. The line graph comparing attitudes shows that a higher percentage of Hispanics (rising from 70% in 2004 to 81% in 2015) perceive their financial situation positively, surpassing the general public's perceptions, which grew from 56% to 61% in the same period [image4]. Despite higher unemployment, Hispanics report better outlooks on their personal finances and future mobility, with 72% believing their children will be better off financially than themselves [5].\n\nThis divergence influences the broader economic disparities. Median household incomes for Hispanics stagnated around $42,500 since 2008, and their poverty rate remains elevated at 23.6%—higher than the national average—while their median wealth remains significantly lower than that of all U.S. households (as shown in the income and wealth graphs) [images2]. Despite growing confidence and resilience in perceptions, the continued higher unemployment and income stagnation highlight ongoing structural inequalities, with Hispanic households facing higher poverty and lower wealth accumulation compared to non-Hispanics.\n\nIn summary, while Hispanics experience higher unemployment rates, their generally positive outlooks on personal and family financial futures suggest a resilient attitude that persists despite economic hardships. However, these hardships continue to contribute to persistent income and wealth disparities between Hispanic and non-Hispanic groups. \n\n---\n\n![The image compares the unemployment rates of Hispanic and non-Hispanic groups from 2000 to 2015, showing higher and more fluctuating unemployment among Hispanics](image5)"}

For instance, in 2000, Hispanic unemployment was about 5.8%, while non-Hispanic was approximately 3.8%. During the recession periods, Hispanic unemployment spiked more noticeably, remaining above 6% in 2015, indicating ongoing disparities. [8]\n\nConcerning income, the left graph in [image2](image2) shows that in 2014, median household income for Hispanics was approximately $42,500, substantially lower than the $53,700 for all U.S. households. While incomes stagnated for Hispanics since the Great Recession, this gap persisted, reflecting ongoing economic disparities. [7]\n\nIn terms of poverty, the same graph reveals a higher poverty rate among Hispanic households: 23.6% in 2014, compared to 14.8% for the total U.S. population. Although the poverty rate for Hispanics decreased slightly from its peak during the recession, it remains above pre-recession levels, highlighting continued economic hardship.

For instance, about 48% of Latino individuals aged 18 to 29 rated their financial situation as good or excellent in 2015, which is a 27 percentage point rise from 2008, more than doubling the positive view from that year [6]. Moreover, most Latino subgroups saw gains since 2008; for example, support or positive perceptions increased among those with less than a high school education (+12 points), high school graduates (+16), and college attendees (+17), with notably large improvements among youth and education groups [7][8][10]. A line graph in the images confirms this trend: the line representing \"Hispanic\" respondents shows an increase from 2008 to 2015, rising to 81% in 2015, up from about 76% in 2004, indicating stronger positive perceptions of financial well-being [4].\n\nIn contrast, perceptions regarding family income relative to the cost of living among Latinos and other groups have shown little change over this period, remaining largely negative. In 2015, about half (53%) of Latinos felt their family income was not keeping up with the cost of living, consistent with 2014 figures, and similar views were held by Black and White populations [3][4]. The bar chart further confirms this stagnation: in 2015, 53% of Hispanic adults reported falling behind financially compared to 59% in 2014, showing only a slight decrease but essentially stable attitudes over the year [image1].\n\nFurthermore, a line graph illustrates that both the \"Hispanic\" and \"General public\" groups consistently viewed their financial situation less positively around 2008-2010, with some recovery by 2015, but the proportion feeling they were falling behind remained roughly halved between 2014 and 2015.

In contrast, tablet and e-book reader ownership among older adults is relatively higher, with about 27% owning such devices, and ownership equal to or exceeding that of smartphones [7]. This indicates that while older adults may hesitate to adopt smartphones, they are more receptive to using tablets and e-readers for digital engagement.\n\nIn terms of internet usage, about 59% of seniors are online, a steady increase from previous years [3]. Despite this growth, their usage rates lag behind the general population, where 86% of all U.S. adults go online [3].

Despite this growth, the disparities between younger and older age groups persist. The youngest cohort (18-29) reached about 90% by 2013, while the 65+ group lagged behind at 59% [2][image4].\n\n![A line graph shows that technology use among 65+ seniors increased from 14% in 2000 to 59% in 2013, but the rate remained lower than younger cohorts](image2)\n\nIn summary, **higher education significantly boosts the likelihood that seniors will adopt tablets and e-book readers**, and this trend parallels the broader pattern of gradual increase in technology use among older adults over time, although age remains a key factor limiting adoption rates. The data collectively highlight that both educational and age-related factors influence technology adoption, with education serving as a major catalyst for seniors embracing new devices and digital trends."}

For instance, a significant 54% of this age bracket often feels amused by social media content, with similar patterns for feeling connected (25%), inspired (19%), and even lonely (15%) [4, image4]. Conversely, older users (65+) report lower percentages for these emotions, indicating that younger individuals are more emotionally engaged. The dot plot shows that feelings like amusement and connection are more prominent among the 18-29 demographic, suggesting they are more emotionally reactive to social media content overall [4].\n\nGender differences are also evident. Women are more likely than men to perceive supportive behavior and kind interactions. For example, 24% of women frequently see people being kind or supportive, compared to 17% of men. Men, on the other hand, are more inclined to encounter mean or bullying behavior, with 29% seeing such content often, versus 19% of women [3]. Interestingly, both genders report encountering a similar amount of mixed supportive and bullying behavior, with 52-56% seeing an equal mix [3].\n\nIn terms of behaviors, users often see exaggerated or dramatic posts (58%) and posts involving accusations or arguments (59%) very frequently, which can evoke mixed emotional responses, including anger or frustration [9, image5]. The prevalence of such content might contribute to the emotional highs and lows experienced on social media platforms. It’s also noted that men are slightly more likely to see abusive behaviors than women, who tend to see more supportive interactions, although both groups encounter a balance of positive and negative content [8, 9, image3].\n\nThe type of posts most frequently encountered includes highly dramatic or exaggerated content and contentious arguments, which frequently provoke emotional reactions such as anger or connection [9, image5]. Younger users, feeling more intensely convicted and emotionally engaged, are especially likely to experience emotions like amusement or loneliness, which indicates a heightened emotional impact of social media content among youth [4, image4].\n\nIn summary, younger users and women generally experience more intense emotions and supportive interactions on social media, while older users report milder emotional reactions. The most common posts they encounter are exaggerated or argumentative, often evoking strong feelings such as amusement, anger, or connection, influencing their overall social media experience."}

According to the survey data, men are more likely than women to perceive and encounter aggressive or deceptive behaviors online. Specifically, **29% of men** see people being mean or bullying on social media, compared to only **19% of women** [1, image1]. Furthermore, men are also more likely to see people trying to be deceptive, with **24% of men** noticing deception versus **13% of women**, while both sexes equally recognize attempts to correct misinformation at **17%** [1, image1].\n\nWhen it comes to the frequency of encountering dramatic or exaggerated posts, a substantial majority of users across all groups report seeing such content frequently. For example, **58%** see overly dramatic or exaggerated posts often, and **59%** see people making accusations or starting arguments without having all the facts [1,4,8]. This high prevalence is common for both men and women, but given that men report higher perceptions of negative behaviors, it suggests men may encounter or be more aware of such dramatic content more often or perceive it as more prevalent.\n\nThe perceived higher encounter rates of negative behaviors among men correlate with their greater perception of deception and bullying online, which may contribute to their view that social media is a more hostile environment. Conversely, women tend to perceive social media as slightly less hostile, seeing fewer instances of bullying or deception, and are more likely to observe kind or supportive behaviors, aligning with the data that women see a slightly higher proportion of positive interactions [1, image1].\n\nIn summary, men perceive and potentially encounter more negative online behaviors—such as bullying and deception—more than women do, and these perceptions align with the frequent reports of dramatic and exaggerated posts on social media. Both men and women, however, recognize that a large share of content involves drama and arguments, contributing to the complex emotional landscape users navigate online. \n\n![People being mean or bullying](image1)"}

For instance, men are more likely to perceive online bullying as a common behavior, with 29% of men noticing this compared to only 19% of women, who tend to see more supportive interactions [4]. This aligns with data showing that men are also more likely to see deceptive content (24% vs. 13% for women) and thus may be more sensitive to negative online behaviors [4, 8]. Conversely, women generally perceive a more balanced online environment, but are more receptive to seeing supportive behaviors, which could influence how platforms recommend community-driven or supportive content tailored to gender experiences.\n\nThese perceptions directly impact how users respond to recommendations. For example, the survey shows that men and women differ in their perceptions of the acceptability of certain uses of their personal data. Men similarly tend to see less issue with recommendations related to their online behavior, such as suggestions for events or people to connect with, whereas women are slightly more cautious or less accepting of these uses [6]. Furthermore, women’s perceptions of online support and behavior might influence the effectiveness of targeted advertisements—women are more likely to value supportive and positive content, which could be exploited to tailor ads emphasizing community and kindness.\n\nThe emotional responses to social media content also vary by gender and age. Younger women, for instance, report higher engagement with emotionally charged content, with a tendency towards stronger feelings of connectedness and support, whereas men may perceive more negativity or deception [3, 4, 5]. This difference suggests that platforms can customize content curation—perhaps prioritizing positive, community-building content for women, particularly younger users, and being more vigilant about detecting deceptive or bullying content aimed at men.\n\nHere is an illustration of how different age groups are receptive to recommendations, which further emphasizes the need for tailored approaches [image1]:\n\n![Recommend events in their area](image1)\n\nSimilarly, the data shows that older users are less accepting of certain recommendations, especially regarding connecting with new people, highlighting that age and gender interactions influence perceptions [image1].\n\nIn summary, acknowledging that men are more exposed to and perhaps more tolerant of negative behaviors like bullying and deception, while women focus more on support and kindness, social media platforms should adapt their recommendation algorithms. For men, this could involve emphasizing safety features and filtering deceptive content. For women, promoting positive community interactions and supportive environments can enhance engagement. Additionally, understanding these gender differences can improve ad targeting—ensuring content is both relevant and sensitive to perceptions of acceptability and emotional needs across genders, ultimately fostering a safer and more inclusive social media environment.\n\n---\n\n> In conclusion, perceptions of social media content and behavior vary significantly between men and women, influencing how they respond to recommendations and advertisements.

For example, younger users—particularly those aged 18 to 29—are generally more accepting of data being used for activities like recommending local events or suggesting people they might want to connect with. This is evident in the chart where **78% of 18-29-year-olds** agree that recommending events in their area is acceptable (image1), and **66%** find it acceptable for platforms to recommend potential acquaintances [6]. Conversely, older users, especially those aged 65 and above, tend to be less accepting of these practices. For instance, only about **36% of seniors** find it acceptable to be recommended new connections, and even fewer accept targeted advertising or political messaging [6].\n\nThe images reinforce these differences. In image1, the percentages show that acceptance of recommendations for events and connections drops significantly in older age groups: **Ages 18-29** have the highest approval (80% for events, 67% for connecting with others), while **Ages 65+** show much lower approval (67% for events, 36% for connecting). This indicates that younger users are more comfortable with these uses of their data, aligning with their higher overall acceptance.\n\nFurthermore, when it comes to sensitive uses, such as political messaging, acceptance is notably low across all ages; just **around 30-40%** of each group view political campaign messages as acceptable (image1). The bar chart in image2 also highlights that only **about 7%** find sharing political messages very acceptable, with **31%** considering it not acceptable at all. This universal wariness suggests a broad discomfort with political uses of data regardless of age, but it is particularly pronounced among older users.\n\nOverall, users' comfort depends heavily on how their data is used. Data used for event recommendations and connecting with others is generally more acceptable—especially among younger users—while uses like advertising and political messaging evoke greater discomfort, especially among the elderly. These perceptions shape their willingness to share data and influence how social media platforms manage these practices.\n\n![This chart compares how different age groups feel about recommendations and advertisements](image1)\n\nIn conclusion, younger users tend to be more accepting of their data being used for social purposes like event and contact recommendations, reflecting higher overall comfort with these practices, whereas older users exhibit more reservations, especially concerning the use of data for advertising and political messages."}

For instance, a notable portion of Americans believe that algorithms used for personal finance scores and parole decisions are effective—54% and 49%, respectively—yet their perceptions of fairness are markedly lower, with only 32% and 50% viewing them as fair [5][1]. This indicates that effectiveness does not necessarily translate into fairness in public opinion, potentially undermining trust.\n\nImage1 visually illustrates this skepticism, especially among older age groups: only 34% of those aged 50+ believe programs can make decisions without human bias, while 63% expect bias to reflect designer influences. The trend suggests increasing distrust with age, which may affect acceptance of such systems [image1].\n\nIn contrast, systems like automated resume screening have a higher perceived fairness (43%) coupled with a similar effectiveness rating (47%), suggesting slightly better public acceptance [3]. However, overall, none of these systems are widely viewed as fair; for example, only about 32-33% believe personal finance scores and video interview analyses are fair, and a significant majority find their use unacceptable—68% and 67% respectively [7][9].\n\nImage2 underscores this skepticism regarding the personal finance score: 68% of Americans find its use unacceptable, citing privacy violations and unfairness as key concerns. The effectiveness (31%) and fairness perceptions are mismatched, emphasizing that many see these tools as problematic despite potential benefits [image2].\n\nFurthermore, perceptions of fairness are also influenced by demographic factors. Blacks and Hispanics tend to find consumer finance algorithms more fair (45% and 47%) compared to whites (25%), but they express more concern about parole scoring fairness—about 61% believe it's unfair—highlighting varied trust levels within communities [3][4].\n\nFinally, public trust is further complicated by the belief that these algorithms often reflect human biases; 58% of Americans think programs will always mirror designer biases, and only 40% believe they can be designed bias-free [6]. This broad skepticism, coupled with low fairness ratings across scenarios, suggests that despite recognizing some effectiveness, people remain wary of these systems' fairness, which diminishes overall trust.\n\n![The chart shows that older individuals tend to be more skeptical about the unbiased decision-making capacity of algorithms than younger groups](image1)\n\nIn summary, perceptions of effectiveness tend to be somewhat higher than perceptions of fairness for automated decision systems. However, widespread doubts about fairness—especially regarding privacy, discrimination, and bias—undermine public trust.

Despite this overall trend, **partisan differences persist**, with **Republicans more likely to believe that plenty of jobs are available**, as reflected in the partisan gap noted earlier.\n\nFurthermore, the **trend data among Republicans** indicates sustained or increasing optimism, whereas Democratic perceptions remain comparatively subdued, although both groups have shown improvements from previous lows during economic downturns. The **comparative line graph** tracking these groups' opinions demonstrates that **Republicans' perceptions tend to be more positive** and more responsive to economic developments over time.\n\nIn summary, **perceptions of job availability are strongly polarized along partisan lines**, with Republicans generally more optimistic than Democrats. Over roughly two decades, these perceptions have evolved with overall economic confidence improving, but the partisan gap has persisted, with Republicans consistently viewing local employment opportunities more favorably than Democrats [1], [2], [4].\n\n---\n\n![The survey chart showing that Republicans/Lean Republican are more likely than Democrats/Lean Democrat to see plenty of jobs available](image2)"}

According to [7], nearly half of Americans overall (46%) believe Wall Street does more to hurt than help the economy, while 39% see it as more helpful. However, when breaking down by political affiliation, the divide becomes more pronounced: a substantial majority of Republicans (55%) believe Wall Street helps the economy more than it hurts ([8]), whereas Democrats are almost evenly split, with 46% saying Wall Street hurts more (46%) and 41% saying it helps more ([7], [8])—indicating Democrats are more skeptical of Wall Street’s role.\n\nThis partisan divide in attitudes toward Wall Street parallels broader satisfaction with national conditions. Public dissatisfaction with the way things are going has increased over time; as shown in [3] and visualized in image1, around 70% of Americans are dissatisfied, and there has been a rise in dissatisfaction, reaching 61% in September and now around 70%. The graphs illustrate that satisfaction levels are generally low—only about 26% are satisfied today [2], and similar lows are seen across different time points.\n\nFurthermore, while overall satisfaction has declined, political affiliation influences this perception significantly, as indicated in [4] and [9]. Republicans’ satisfaction has dropped notably—from 59% in September to the current 47%, the lowest since late 2017 ([9]). Democrats, meanwhile, have remained largely dissatisfied; only about 14-16% have expressed satisfaction at any point during Trump’s presidency ([2], [10]) and their views are more divided on Wall Street's role. The images and data depict a persistent ideological split, with Republicans more inclined to view Wall Street positively and Democrats more divided and generally more negative. \n\nThe timeline of political support in image2 and the trends in party identification in image5 further underscore that these attitudes are deeply intertwined with partisan loyalties, which have shifted over recent decades. Overall, the data shows that political affiliation not only shapes opinions on Wall Street’s impact, with Republicans generally more favorable, but also correlates with broader dissatisfaction or satisfaction with national conditions. Today’s polarized views reflect longstanding partisan divides that have amplified over time, impacting how different groups perceive economic fairness and the role of financial institutions in the country."}

According to the line graph in **image2**, the percentage of Americans expressing dissatisfaction increased from around 54% in 1990 to approximately 70% in 2019, while those satisfied decreased from about 41% to 26%. This steady rise in dissatisfaction indicates growing public discontent over the years, crossing party lines, with minimal fluctuation in the overall downward trend.\n\nPartisan differences are strikingly evident. As shown in **text quotes [4]**, Democrats remain largely dissatisfied, with only 8% expressing satisfaction currently, and 90% dissatisfied. Their satisfaction has remained low throughout Trump’s presidency. Conversely, Republicans exhibit higher satisfaction levels but have declined from 59% in September (per **[5]**) to a low of 47% in 2019, with a notable decrease among Republican-leaners. This suggests increasing dissatisfaction among both parties but at different magnitudes and stability.\n\nRegarding political affiliation shifts over time, **image5** reveals that from 1990 to 2019, the percentage of people identifying or leaning Republican (red line) decreased overall, while Democratic affiliation (blue line) increased during Clinton and Obama years but stabilized more recently. These shifting party bases contribute to the partisan divide seen in public opinions.\n\nThe perceptions of Wall Street's impact further illustrate this division. In **image4**, 55% of Republicans believe Wall Street helps the economy more than it hurts, whereas 46% of Democrats think it hurts more than it helps. The divergence is also evident in **text quotes [3]** and [7], where Democrats are more skeptical of Wall Street’s positive contributions, with 54% believing Wall Street hurts the economy, compared to only 31% of Republicans. This polarization aligns with the party loyalty seen in the trends of party support (image5) and the dissatisfaction levels.\n\nOverall, these trends show that as dissatisfaction with the country has grown, especially among Democrats, and party identification has shifted over time, public opinions about Wall Street have become increasingly polarized, fueling party-based divisions on economic perspectives.\n\n![The chart shows Americans' perceptions of economic mobility, indicating a high percentage feel they are falling behind or staying even, especially among minorities and lower-income groups](image1)"}

Conversely, **only around 2-3% of Democrats or Democratic-leaning respondents** share this confidence, with the majority (69%) indicating they are not confident at all [3], and similar low levels are shown in the party comparison chart in image3, where Democrats show almost negligible confidence in this area.\n\nWhen comparing confidence in other tasks, such as negotiating trade agreements and managing the executive branch, the partisan gap remains stark. For example, in negotiating trade agreements, **51% of Republicans** are very or somewhat confident [3], compared to only 3% of Democrats, highlighting a huge disparity. Similarly, on managing the executive branch effectively, **41-52% of Republicans** express confidence, whereas only about 6% of Democrats do [3], with the figures for Democrats being overwhelmingly negative.\n\nThe images reinforce these contrasts: image3 illustrates the vast gap in confidence levels between parties across multiple issues, with Republicans showing high confidence in their political abilities, including trade negotiations and military decision-making, whereas Democrats are largely not confident. Image4 further emphasizes that conservatives within the Republican camp are even more confident regarding these tasks than moderates or liberals, heightening the partisan divide.\n\nIn summary, public confidence in Trump's ability to make good judicial appointments is markedly higher among Republicans than Democrats, and this partisan divide mirrors differing confidence levels in other key areas like trade negotiations and managing government functions, with Republicans generally exhibiting significantly higher confidence across these tasks [1], [3], and the supporting images."}

Moreover, Democrats overwhelmingly (87%) see the U.S. response as less effective than other countries, highlighting a profound partisan gap in evaluating national performance. \n\nSimilarly, trust in institutions varies markedly across party lines. According to the second image, Democrats exhibit high confidence in hospitals (87%) and public health officials (72%), whereas Republicans’ confidence in public health officials is notably lower at 53%, despite similar high confidence in hospitals (90%) [2][image2]. Overall, Democrats tend to trust health officials more consistently than Republicans do.\n\nThe third image further illustrates partisan differences regarding perceptions of COVID-19 policy. Democrats are more likely to agree that reducing infections is effective for recovery and that increased cases are due to more infections—not just testing [3][image3]. Conversely, Republicans show less agreement on these points, reflecting divergent understandings of what strategies are effective.\n\nLastly, trust in leadership has eroded over time within each party. The fourth image shows approval ratings for public health officials declining among both groups from March to August 2020, with Democrats’ approval decreasing from 84% to 72% and Republicans’ from 74% to 53% [4][image4][image5]. Among Trump, Republican support decreased from 83% to 73%, and Democrat support fell drastically from 18% to 6%, indicating growing partisan mistrust.\n\nIn conclusion, partisan alignment substantially influences perceptions of COVID-19 response effectiveness and confidence in institutions, with Democrats generally expressing higher trust and more positive assessments than Republicans. This partisan divide impacts public understanding and cooperation during health crises.\n\n![Survey results showing Republicans less likely than Democrats to see the U.S. response as effective](image1)\n![Confidences in institutions vary widely across political lines](image2)\n![Partisan differences in opinions on infection reduction and case increases](image3)\n![Approval ratings for health officials decline over time within parties](image4)\n![Line graphs of confidence in public health officials and Trump across parties](image5)"}

Overall, there is a clear pattern: Democrats attribute the increased cases to higher transmission, leading to caution about lifting restrictions, while Republicans tend to see increased testing as the main factor, making them more inclined to support lifting restrictions to restart economic activities.  \n![A bar chart showing the reasons for the spread of COVID-19, with 75% citing social distancing issues and 58% citing premature lifting of restrictions](image1)  \n![A horizontal bar chart illustrating that most Americans favor reducing infections before reopening, with Democrats heavily supporting reduction and Republicans more divided](image2)  \n![A chart comparing political groups' perceptions of causes of COVID-19 spread, with Democrats citing increased infections and Republicans citing increased testing](image3)  \n![A demographic breakdown showing most groups believe restrictions were lifted too quickly, especially among Black and Hispanic adults](image4)  \n![A comparison of opinions on testing versus infections as reasons for case increases across political groups, with liberals mainly seeing increased infections and conservatives supporting increased testing](image5)  \n\n**In summary, liberals associate rising COVID-19 cases directly with increased infections, leading to more cautious attitudes on lifting restrictions, while conservatives tend to attribute case increases to higher testing rates, supporting earlier reopening efforts.**"}

The overall support for photo ID among supporters stands at 76% as per [9], highlighting strong backing overall.\n\nLooking at the racial breakdowns, the visual data reinforce these findings: the charts in images 2, 3, 4, and 5 depict that Black and Asian individuals tend to show higher support for photo ID policies than White populations. For example, in image 3, the numbers 86 for Black and 79 for Asian suggest high support, whereas White groups have comparatively lower figures like 53 and 87, depending on the metric. Moreover, image 1 highlights that 81% of Black Americans support early or absentee voting, which correlates with broader support for accessible voting policies, including photo ID.\n\nRegarding political affiliations, Republicans overwhelmingly support requiring photo ID (93%) per [3], with 70% of conservative Republicans favoring documented reasons for early voting in image 1, and 62% of Republicans overall prefer requiring documentation for early voting in image 2. Conversely, Democrats are far less likely to support restrictive IDs, with only 54% of White Democrats [2] supporting it, and overall, 76% of adults favor supporting photo ID policies as indicated in [9]. Images 2 and 4 also hint that Democratic-leaning groups are generally more supportive of measures that facilitate voting, including early voting and absentee options, which often go hand-in-hand with easy access policies such as ID requirements.\n\nIn summary, Black and Asian communities show higher support for requiring government-issued photo IDs than White populations, and Democrats, in general, are less supportive of restrictive ID policies compared to Republicans.

Conversely, Black Americans strongly support more expansive voting policies, with 85% favoring allowing felon-convicted individuals to vote after serving their sentences [6]. \n\nIn contrast, White adults generally display more caution toward easing voting restrictions. While a slight majority of White Democrats support requiring photo ID (around 54%), White Republicans are less supportive of policies like automatic voter registration, with only about 35% in favor [2], [7]. Support for making Election Day a national holiday and automatic registration is also lower among White adults compared to Black, Hispanic, and Asian adults, indicating a tendency toward more restrictive policies within White populations [5].\n\nVisual data further illustrate these differences. For example, the bar chart showing opinions on early and absentee voting reveals that a majority of Black (81%) and Hispanic (63%) respondents favor open voting options, while a smaller proportion of White respondents (about 59%) support open voting, reflecting racial disparities in support for accessible voting policies [3]. Similarly, another visual demonstrates that support for early and absentee voting is higher among Black and Hispanic groups compared to White groups, indicating cultural and experiential factors influencing their preferences [4], [5].\n\nMoreover, the data suggests that partisanship is intertwined with racial and ethnic identities, as Democratic voters across all groups tend to be more supportive of easing voting restrictions than Republican voters, with White Republicans showing the least support (around 38%) for allowing all voters to vote early or absentee [8].\n\nIn summary, Black and Hispanic populations generally favor more inclusive voting policies, such as automatic registration and early voting, while White populations, especially among Republicans, tend to support more restrictive measures, reflecting considerable racial and ethnic influences on voting policy preferences.\n\n![The bar chart showing greater support for early voting among Black and Hispanic respondents compared to White respondents](image3)"}

Conversely, Republican support for no-excuse absentee voting has declined significantly—from 57% in October 2018 [7] to 38% in April 2021, reflecting a 19 percentage point reduction. This shift suggests growing Republican skepticism about the policy, as seen in the recent decline documented in the survey [5][7][2].\n\nSimilarly, attitudes toward automatic voter registration have shifted notably among Republicans.

In terms of party identification, surveys indicate that while a significant majority leaned toward the Democratic Party, with 64% identifying as or leaning toward Democrats in 2022 [2], this alignment has remained relatively stable over recent years. However, a substantial portion of Latino voters still maintain soft ties, suggesting potential variability in future party affiliation [3].\n\nIn the 2022 midterms, the importance of specific issues has shifted or remained prominent among Latino voters. Abortion has gained considerable importance, rising from 42% in March to 57% in August, especially following the Supreme Court's decision to end federal abortion rights [8]. Meanwhile, economic concerns remain the top issue, with 53% of voters citing it as very important in 2022, unchanged from previous findings [6, 10]. Other issues like healthcare and violent crime continue to be highly prioritized, reflecting ongoing concerns about social and economic stability.\n\nDemographically, the preferences within the Latino community vary based on cultural identity, religious beliefs, and political leanings. For instance, the data show that most Hispanics who consider Hispanic identity very important are likely to vote Democratic—about 60%—indicating a strong link between cultural pride and party support [7]. Conversely, support for Republican candidates is more prominent among certain subgroups, especially Republican or lean-Republican voters, where support for Trump or similar candidates remains high, particularly in districts Trump won (68%) [4, 9].\n\nMoreover, attitudes toward issues and candidates differ based on personal demographics. For example, among religious groups, Catholics tend to favor Democrats (59%), while Evangelical Protestants lean toward Republicans (50%) [4, 5]. Support for Democratic candidates also increases when individuals perceive Latino identity as very important, with 60% favoring Democrats versus 45% among those who see it as less significant [7].\n\nVisual data further illustrates these variances: the bar chart shows that Latino registered voters tend to favor Democrats (53%) over Republicans (28%) in support of their congressional candidates [4]. Supplementary charts highlight the sharp polarization in preferences based on political affiliation —Democrats overwhelmingly support Democratic candidates, and Republicans favor Republican candidates— with some demographic groups showing more mixed or uncertain support levels.\n\nIn summary, from 2019 to 2022, Latino voters have maintained a strong Democratic lean, although issue importance, especially on abortion, has risen markedly.

A higher percentage of Republican-leaning Hispanics (62%) believe that people are not seeing racial discrimination where it actually exists, suggesting underrecognition of racial issues among this group. In contrast, Democratic-leaning Hispanics (around 25%) are more likely to acknowledge the presence of real racial discrimination, aligning with their general awareness of racial issues.\n\nThis divergence is also captured in views about whether being Hispanic influences thinking about discrimination—66% of Hispanics who consider being Hispanic very important to their identity see racial discrimination as a significant problem, whereas only 54% of those who see it as less important share this view [4]. \n\nIn summary, Hispanic Democrats tend to oppose Trump continuing in political roles and are more attentive to actual racial discrimination issues.

For example, [8] indicates that about 36% of Latino Republicans and GOP leaners believe \"the Democratic Party really cares about Latinos\" describes their views at least somewhat well, whereas only 21% of Latino Democrats and Democratic leaners share that view about the Republican Party. Similarly, [9] shows that 77% of Latino registered voters are dissatisfied with national conditions, yet both Democrats and Republicans agree that it matters who controls Congress, indicating that perceptions of engagement do not necessarily translate into unified support.\n\nVisual evidence from the charts supports these perceptions. The bar graphs in [4] reveal that a substantial majority of Latino Democrats (around 71%) believe the Democratic Party \"works hard to earn Latinos’ votes,\" compared to only 45% for the Republican Party. Conversely, the survey data in [5] demonstrate that roughly half of Latinos perceive little difference between the parties, though about 45% see a great deal of difference, with Democrats and Republicans split evenly in their perceptions of this difference.\n\nIn terms of how these perceptions relate to party affiliation trends, [2] reports that Latino voters lean toward the Democratic Party by nearly two-to-one (64% vs. 33%) and that this affiliation has remained relatively stable in recent years. Despite this, [4] and [9] highlight that a significant minority of Latino voters hold soft ties or are dissatisfied with current political engagement strategies, which might suggest potential shifts in future affiliation. Furthermore, [10] indicates little recent change in Latino party affiliation, implying that these perceptions have historically reinforced existing tendencies but have not dramatically altered party alignment.\n\nOverall, while Democrats are perceived as more actively engaged and caring about Latinos, a sizable portion of Latinos recognize the efforts of Republicans as well, though to a lesser extent. These nuanced perceptions are reflected in the stability of party identification among Latinos over recent years. \n\n![The importance of issues among Latinos varies over time, affecting political priorities](image1)  \n![Latino voters' party affiliation has remained quite stable recently](image2)  \n![Perceived differences between Hispanics based on political affiliation are significant](image3)  \n![Survey results show Democrats are viewed more favorably for engagement efforts](image4)  \n![Perception of party caring about Latinos differs sharply between political groups](image5)"}

For example, about 45% to 48% of Hispanics see \"a great deal of difference\" between the parties, with similar proportions across Democrats and Republicans [6, 10]. \n\nSupport for the Democratic Party remains dominant, with 64% of Hispanic registered voters identifying or leaning toward it, a figure that has remained relatively stable over recent years [8]. This preference is reinforced by generally positive views of the Democratic Party's efforts and caring attitude toward Latinos, as reflected in survey results showing majorities believe the Democratic Party works hard to earn Latino votes, cares about Latinos, and represents their interests [9], and supported by data indicating that most Hispanics find the Democratic Party's actions toward Latinos favorable [1, 5].\n\nTime trends show slight fluctuations in perceptions of how well parties care about Latinos. For example, survey results from 2019 to 2022 show the Democratic Party's favorable perception slightly declining from 62% to 64%, whereas the Republican Party's perception remains lower and relatively stable around 33%–34% [image2]. Moreover, images depicting perceptions of effort to earn Latino votes illustrate that Hispanics generally see the Democratic Party as working harder and caring more about Latinos compared to the Republican Party, with the latter perceived as less engaged in efforts to earn Latino support [images 1 and 4].\n\nPolitical affiliation influences perceptions deeply. Hispanics identifying as Democrats tend to view the Democratic Party more favorably across key issues and perceptions, believing it cares more and works harder to earn Latino votes, while Republican identifiers favor the GOP to a lesser extent [images 1, 4]. Conversely, the size of the group viewing the parties as very different remains high regardless of affiliation, with roughly 47-48% of all Hispanics noting \"a great deal of difference\" between parties, indicating enduring perceived divisions within the community [6, 10].\n\nIn summary, while support for the Democratic Party among Hispanics remains robust and fairly stable over time, perceptions of the ideological and strategic differences between parties remain high across the community and are influenced substantially by political alignment. Hispanics generally view the Democratic Party as more engaged and caring about their interests, and the recognition of partisan differences continues to be a defining feature of their political perceptions.\n\n![The survey results show that Hispanics perceive significant differences between the Democratic and Republican parties, with a majority viewing the Democratic Party as more supportive and attentive toward Latinos, while perceptions of the GOP's engagement are much lower.](image1)"}

For instance, the data indicates that only about 16-17% see hardly any difference between parties, meaning most recognize substantial gaps, which could motivate engagement with their preferred party or cause shifts if perceptions change.\n\nAdditionally, perceptions of party efforts to earn Latino votes and how well the parties care about Latinos also play a role. Democratic supporters generally believe their party cares more and works harder to earn Latino votes, though significant numbers still hold negative views about Republican engagement [3], [4].\n\n![Bar graphs highlight that Latinos perceive Democrats as more committed to earning their votes and caring about their interests than Republicans do.](image4) As these perceptions evolve—if Latinos increasingly perceive little difference or feel that their issues are not being adequately addressed—they might reconsider their party affiliations.\n\nIn essence, while recent data shows stability in Latino voters’ party identification, their perceptions of increased similarities or dissatisfaction could serve as catalysts for future realignment. If perceptions of the parties converging or neglecting Latino concerns intensify, this could impact their traditional Democratic allegiance in upcoming elections.\n\n**In brief:** Latino voters see notable differences between parties, but perceptions of these differences are nuanced; evolving perceptions could influence shifts in their party affiliation over time."}

Similarly, regard for opportunities for promotion is more significant for men (57%) than women (46%), indicating men place slightly more importance on advancement prospects [9].\n\nWhen it comes to job flexibility, perceptions are similar: 71% of men and 76% of women value having the flexibility to balance work and family, a difference that isn't statistically significant [7, 10]. However, women tend to prioritize meaningful contribution and respect more than men; 60% of women value making a societal impact versus 51% of men, and 50% of women value being in a respected role compared to 43% of men [4, 9]. Regarding helping others, 59% of women find it essential, contrasted with only 31% of men, highlighting a notable gender difference in job characteristic priorities [9].\n\nImage1 visually supports these findings: it shows that while most men value promotion and high pay more than women, women are more inclined to seek jobs that help others and contribute meaningfully. The bar chart illustrates these divergent priorities clearly, emphasizing the gendered differences in job value preferences in STEM fields.\n\nAdditionally, the perception that STEM jobs offer more respect and societal contribution is somewhat divided, with only 28% viewing STEM as mainly helping others, which women prioritize more than men (31% vs. 59%) [4, 9]. Despite shared appreciation for pay and flexibility, women's emphasis on societal impact distinguishes their job characteristic preferences from men's.\n\nOverall, both men and women value higher pay and flexibility, but women tend to prioritize meaningfulness and societal contribution more than men, who place relatively greater importance on promotion and earning potential.\n\n---\n\n![The chart illustrates gender differences in job characteristic preferences among STEM workers, highlighting that women value helping others and societal respect more than men, while men prioritize pay and promotion](image1)"}

Additionally, both groups appreciate a welcoming workplace environment, with 48% of men and 53% of women emphasizing this need [4].\n\nHowever, notable disparities emerge when it comes to career advancement and societal recognition. Men in STEM place a higher emphasis on opportunities for promotion (57%) and high-paying jobs (59%), compared to women (46% and 48%, respectively), highlighting a greater focus among men on economic and career progression factors [4]. Conversely, women show a stronger preference for jobs that make a societal impact, with 60% valuing helping others and 50% valuing respect and societal contribution, which is significantly higher than men (31% and 43%, respectively) [9].\n\nThese value differences relate closely to the perceived difficulties faced by women, particularly regarding gender discrimination and societal barriers. Women in STEM are more likely than men (48% vs. 29%) to perceive gender discrimination in recruitment, hiring, and promotion as major obstacles [10]. Moreover, the fact that women prioritize societal impact and respectful work environments suggests that challenges like discrimination, lack of encouragement, and fewer role models hinder their sense of belonging and career advancement in STEM.\n\nFurthermore, the data on reasons for underrepresentation reinforce these perceptions: women report discrimination, lack of early encouragement, and difficulty balancing work/family commitments as critical barriers [3][5][9]. For instance, 39% cite discrimination or lack of encouragement as major hurdles for women’s participation in STEM [5][9].\n\nIn summary, while both men and women value flexibility and a welcoming workplace, women prioritize societal impact and respect more than men, reflecting their greater concern with discrimination and societal acceptance. These differing values are intertwined with the real barriers women face, such as discrimination and insufficient encouragement, which impede their entry and success in STEM careers. Addressing these issues by fostering inclusive environments and societal support could better align workplace characteristics with women’s priorities and reduce the gender gap in STEM."}

As indicated by the data, Mountain View experienced a 16% increase in ridership from 2012 to 2014, and Palo Alto saw an even more substantial 38% rise over the same period [7][3]. This surge in passenger numbers correlates with the crowded conditions depicted in the interior image of a packed train, where many seats are taken, and passengers are standing in aisles [image1]. The crowded train scenario exemplifies the current challenge of accommodating increasing demand without compromising comfort and efficiency.\n\nFurthermore, the growth in these regions—a reflection of their rapid development—means more commuters rely on Caltrain, which is already struggling with capacity during peak hours. The high load percentages shown in train capacity data reveal that trains often operate near or at their maximum seats, and with ongoing growth, this situation is likely to worsen if no infrastructure improvements are made. This is particularly significant since the map highlights these areas as key growth regions within the broader San Francisco Bay Area [image2].\n\nEfforts such as grade separations, increased funding, and expanded service frequency are essential to keeping pace with this growth. However, current infrastructure, like remaining at-grade crossings and limited funding in areas like Santa Clara County, pose hurdles to expansion [6][9].

According to [6], European venture-backed trade sales and IPOs in this period amount to approximately $15 billion, indicating robust exit activity despite the relatively smaller size of Europe's venture capital market compared to the US. \n\nVisual data from [image4] underscores this point, showcasing a substantial liquidity event figure in Europe, symbolized by the \"$15 Billion\" annotation, emphasizing the active exit environment in the region.\n\nWhen examining VC investments, the data from [image2] illustrates that Europe’s total invested venture capital sums are significantly lower than in the US. For example, Germany, the UK, France, and other regions collectively invested around $3.9 billion, contrasted with the US's dominant share (which accounts for 82% of global VC capital as per [1]). Despite this smaller investment volume, Europe has achieved a relatively high number of exits, with the backlog of liquidity events signaling a productive exit market.\n\nFurthermore, [image1] highlights that Europe produces a higher proportion of large exits relative to its smaller investment base (22% of exits >$100m for Europe vs. 78% for the US), and a higher ratio of \"home run\" exits (36% in Europe vs. 64% in the US), indicating efficient capital utilization in Europe. [7] supports this, noting that despite less available capital, European VC firms are more selective, resulting in higher capital efficiency (about 70% higher than in the US).\n\nIn summary, while the US leads in total venture capital investments and the number of large-scale exits, Europe's venture ecosystem has demonstrated a strong ability to generate substantial liquidity events, with roughly $15 billion in exits over the last two years, and has become increasingly efficient and productive despite fewer resources.\n\n![Venture-backed liquidity events in the last 24 months: $15 Billion](image4)"}

According to text [3], European VC has driven the best exit multiples globally, and the data in image2 supports this by showing that Europe has a higher median multiple of cash invested (7.2) compared to the USA (4.5). Despite the median exit valuation being higher in the US ($236 million versus $173 million in Europe), a larger proportion of European investments (57.26%) reach a multiple of 5 or more, indicating stronger relative returns for the invested capital.\n\nFurthermore, the post-IPO performance analysis illustrated in image1 reveals that European IPOs tend to outperform US IPOs in the period from 2004 to 2011, with the blue line (Europe) generally maintaining higher post-IPO index values than the red line (US). This aligns with text [6], which states that European VC-backed IPO performance matches or exceeds US performance both pre- and post-IPO.\n\nWhile the US dominates in total capital invested and the number of large exits (exits over $100 million) as shown in image3, Europe's higher capital efficiency and the higher multiple of cash invested suggest that European VC is achieving more significant relative returns. The scarcity of VC funding in Europe has driven up capital efficiency (roughly 70% higher than in the US as per [10]) and allowed investors to be more selective, resulting in higher multiples of invested capital.\n\nIn summary, European VC outperforms US VC in terms of investment multiples and relative exit success, even if absolute exit valuations are somewhat lower. The focus on efficiency and higher returns on invested capital underscores Europe's strong performance in generating superior investment multiples and post-exit returns.\n\n![European VC outperforming US in multiples](image2)  \n*European venture capital achieves higher median multiples of cash invested and a greater percentage of investments reaching high multiples, indicating superior relative returns.*"}

This increase reflects ongoing expansion in the company's user base, likely driven by the rising popularity of smartphones and data services, as indicated by the high number of smartphone users (35.4 million) and data users (63.5 million) in 2014 [4]. \n\nIn terms of ARPU, both Voice and SMS revenues continued their decline during this period, as depicted in the line graph illustrating ARPU trends from 2013 to 2017 [1]. Specifically, the Voice ARPU (blue line) and SMS ARPU (light blue line) show a steady downward trajectory, reflecting reduced income from traditional voice calls and text messaging, which are less used due to the proliferation of data-based apps like messaging and VoIP [1][7][9]. The Mobile Data ARPU initially declined around 2015 but began to rise again afterwards, indicating a shift in revenue sources toward data services.\n\nContributing factors to these changes include the widespread adoption of smartphones, which increased data consumption but decreased reliance on voice and SMS services [7][8]. As users transitioned to more data-centric communication channels, ARPUs from voice and SMS fell, while data revenue, though initially slow, started to pick up as users enrolled in larger data plans [7]. Additionally, aggressive pricing strategies and the entry of new players, such as Smartfren, contributed to the reduction in ARPU levels but also facilitated subscriber growth [2][6].\n\nOverall, Telkomsel's subscriber increase was supported by these expanding data services and smartphone adoption, but the decline in traditional ARPU streams like voice and SMS influenced overall revenue structure shifts during this period. The combined effect of these trends reflects a typical industry movement towards data-driven revenue models amidst evolving user preferences.\n\n![The line graph illustrates declining Voice and SMS ARPU and the initial drop followed by a rise in Mobile Data ARPU from 2013 to 2017, indicating a shift toward data services](image1)"}

XL had 15 million smartphone users out of 58.3 million subscribers. These figures suggest that both companies were expanding their smartphone penetration during this period.\n\nReferring to the ARPU trends depicted in the second image, there was an overall decline in voice and SMS ARPU from 2013 onwards, primarily driven by a shift towards data-driven communication methods such as IM and VoIP, which reduce the reliance on traditional voice and SMS revenue streams [4][5]. The third image illustrates that these shifts impacted ARPU, with voice and SMS earning decreasing, while mobile data ARPU showed a temporary drop around 2015 before rebounding [2]. The first image supports this pattern by showing a declining prepaid ARPU in Indonesia from 2008 to 2012 [1], and the second image projects continued declines until 2015, followed by recovery as data usage increased.\n\nInfluencing these changes were several factors: The proliferation of smartphones (as shown in the third and fourth images), the rise of data-based messaging apps and internet services, and intense price competition—initially triggered by price wars and later stabilizing due to tariff floors [3][9][10]. For Telkomsel and XL, expanding smartphone adoption meant more data consumption, gradually compensating for declines in voice and SMS ARPU, which aligns with the trend of increasing data ARPU after 2015.\n\nIn summary, between 2013 and 2014, both Telkomsel and XL saw growth in smartphone users, but ARPU from traditional voice and SMS services declined due to industry shifts toward data usage driven by technological changes and market competition. The increased adoption of smartphones and data services ultimately contributed to stabilizing and eventually increasing data ARPU in subsequent years.\n![The trend charts show declining ARPU for traditional services and rising data ARPU after 2015](image2)"}

The selected action is then used to generate a natural language response, often employing a template-based natural language generator (NLG), which fills in delexicalized tokens with the estimated slot values or KB entities [6].\n\nThis entire process can be visualized in the high-level architecture, where the dialogue state, query encoding, and slot logits feed into the policy network, which outputs a system action that guides the response generation [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [9]. As the system learns and refines through interactions and reinforcement learning, it becomes better at selecting appropriate actions leading to successful task completions, as evidenced by rising task success rates over training sessions [1].\n\n![The architecture of the end-to-end task-oriented dialogue system, detailing components such as user input encoding, dialogue state tracking, policy network, KB query, and NLG](image2)."}

In particular, the results highlight how the inclusion and placement of spatial positional encodings, as well as the choice of loss components like `class`, `ℓ₁`, and `GIoU`, influence detection performance.\n\nFrom the detailed results summarized in **Table 3** [3], combining `class`, `ℓ₁`, and `GIoU` components yields the highest AP of **40.6**, indicating that integrating multiple loss components enhances detection accuracy compared to using `class` with only `ℓ₁` (AP 35.8) or just `GIoU` (AP 39.9). This suggests that the combination of loss functions contributes positively to the model’s capacity to accurately localize and classify objects.\n\nConcurrently, the positional encodings’ configuration significantly affects AP as seen in **Table 4** [7]. Notably:\n- Removing spatial positional encodings entirely from the encoder still maintains a relatively high AP **(more than 32)**, with only a minor 7.8 drop compared to baseline, demonstrating some robustness to their absence.\n- Passing fixed sine or learned spatial positional encodings either once at decoder input or at every decoder attention layer results in slight decreases in AP (~1.4), indicating that the model benefits from spatial information but is somewhat tolerant to different encoding schemes.\n- Interestingly, passing these positional encodings only at the attention layers, especially shared across all layers, shows minor performance drops, emphasizing that while positional encodings improve precision, the architecture exhibits flexibility in their deployment.\n\nThe visualization in **Image 1** illustrates that the decoder’s attention mechanisms focus on specific object parts, such as extremities, which are crucial for accurate localization, and this process is influenced by the positional encodings' design.\n\n![The image consists of attention visualizations on animal objects, emphasizing focus areas like extremities](image1)\n\nFurthermore, **Figure 7** [3,8] shows that while decoder slots specialize and develop multiple operating modes, including focusing on large image-wide boxes, the overall improvement in AP across decoding layers (~8.2/9.5) underscores the importance of the attention mechanism’s capacity to refine object predictions progressively.\n\nIn summary, **including spatial positional encodings generally improves AP.** When these encodings are omitted or only partially used, the AP drops but not drastically, indicating some robustness. Conversely, **careful placement and sharing of positional encodings across layers can sustain high detection accuracy**. The combination of dense loss components (`class`, `ℓ₁`, `GIoU`) further enhances AP by better balancing classification and localization.\n\n**In conclusion:**  \nConfigurations that incorporate spatial positional encodings—whether learned or fixed—at every attention layer, combined with a comprehensive loss combining class, ℓ₁, and GIoU components, lead to optimal detection performance in DETR-DC5, with the highest AP around 40.6.

As shown in the line graphs [image3], ProgramFC consistently achieves higher F1 scores than FLAN-T5 at all sizes, from small models (80M) to large models (11B), across 2-hop, 3-hop, and 4-hop claims. For instance, on the 11B models, ProgramFC reaches F1 scores of approximately 77.62, 69.56, and 68.18 for 2-hop, 3-hop, and 4-hop tasks respectively, whereas FLAN-T5's scores are slightly lower [image3]. This indicates that ProgramFC's reasoning strategy effectively mitigates the performance decline seen in smaller models, enabling better complex reasoning with less parameter capacity.\n\nIn terms of retrieval recall, ProgramFC demonstrates significant improvements over the traditional one-step retrieval method. According to the bar chart data [image2], ProgramFC's recall@10 surpasses one-step retrieval in all tested tasks: for HOVER 2-hop, 3-hop, and 4-hop, the recall increases from 73.18%, 51.33%, and 36.43% to 77.13%, 59.17%, and 49.93%, respectively.

Its effectiveness becomes evident when comparing it with other models across multiple dimensions, including accuracy, retrieval, and error types.\n\nStarting with performance comparisons, as shown in the graph (image3), ProgramFC consistently outperforms FLAN-T5 for different model sizes and reasoning hops. For example, at the largest size (11B parameters), ProgramFC achieves F1 scores of 77.62 (2-hop), 69.56 (3-hop), and 68.18 (4-hop), surpassing FLAN-T5's scores in all categories. This trend suggests that ProgramFC benefits from the explicit reasoning programs, especially as the complexity or reasoning hops increase, demonstrating better scalability and reasoning depth. Moreover, the bar chart (image4) indicates that ProgramFC also significantly improves retrieval recall across all hop levels compared to one-step retrieval methods, with increases of about 4-13% depending on the task—highlighting the benefit of iterative, program-guided retrieval in capturing relevant information.\n\nIn tasks involving various models, such as InstructGPT variants and Codex (image5), ProgramFC consistently achieves competitive or superior scores, especially notable in complex HOVER 3-hop and 4-hop tasks, where its structured reasoning approach helps maintain higher accuracy over end-to-end models. The use of explicit reasoning programs enhances interpretability, making it easier for humans to understand and debug the reasoning process [2].\n\nHowever, the error analysis (images 1 and 2, and Table 2) reveals some critical challenges and trends. The error types evolve with increasing reasoning complexity: semantic errors become more prevalent in longer chains, especially structural errors, which often occur when the model fails to parse multi-step instructions correctly [8]. Note from image1: semantic errors increased from 29% in 2-hop to 77% in 4-hop scenarios, and structural errors surged from 19% to over 57%. Poor parsing often leads to incorrect program execution despite syntactic correctness, as no syntax errors were observed (image 1, [7]), but execution errors remained high in complex cases. For example, in 3-hop and 4-hop tasks, a large proportion (up to 62% in 3-hop and 71% in 2-hop) of incorrect predictions trace back to execution errors [1, 8].\n\nFurthermore, generating accurate reasoning programs remains challenging, especially for complex, implicit, or real-world claims requiring deep world and commonsense knowledge [6]. The models sometimes produce syntactically or semantically flawed programs, which are hard to detect and correct automatically. Developing more efficient and robust program generation methods could reduce these errors and improve the overall reliability of ProgramFC [3].\n\nIn summary, ProgramFC's strengths include superior performance on complex fact-checking tasks, especially with larger models and reasoning steps, and improved interpretability relative to end-to-end approaches. Its main limitations involve errors in program generation, especially as claim complexity increases, with structural and semantic errors becoming more common. Addressing these error trends is vital for enhancing its applicability to real-world, multi-modal, or more nuanced fact-checking scenarios.\n\n![The bar chart compares retrieval recall, showing ProgramFC's higher performance](image4)"}

In the 2-hop scenario, the F1 score for ProgramFC reaches approximately 77.62 at the largest model size, while FLAN-T5 attains around 77.07. For the 3-hop task, ProgramFC scores about 69.56, compared to FLAN-T5's 66.89, and in the 4-hop case, ProgramFC maintains an advantage with a score of 68.18 versus FLAN-T5's 63.39. This demonstrates that ProgramFC becomes increasingly effective as the reasoning depth grows, particularly notable in the 4-hop scenario where the difference widens. These results suggest that multi-hop reasoning tasks pose a challenge for models relying solely on parametric knowledge, but explicit program-based methods like ProgramFC manage these more complex tasks better.\n\nRegarding error types, the third image details how the proportion of certain errors shifts with increasing complexity. Syntactic errors are reportedly at 0% across all hops, indicating that parsing issues are less prevalent. However, semantic errors—which include incorrect or missing arguments, structure mistakes, and subtask failures—rise sharply from 29% in 2-hop scenarios to 77% in 4-hop scenarios. Conflict with the learning data or reasoning chain seems to cause these increases. Structural errors, related to the incorrect parsing or arrangement of reasoning steps, are substantial, especially at 57% in the 4-hop setting, indicating difficulties in managing lengthy reasoning chains. Additionally, the proportion of incorrect executions remains high, at 71% in 2-hop and 62% in 3-hop, but notably drops to 23% in 4-hop, possibly implying that errors are becoming more semantic and structural than purely execution failures at higher reasoning depths.\n\nIn summary, as reasoning complexity increases from 2-hop to 4-hop, models like ProgramFC demonstrate improved performance margins over baselines like FLAN-T5, but the nature of errors shifts heavily towards semantic and structural issues. The rise in semantic errors from 29% to 77% indicates that long-chain reasoning introduces significant challenges in maintaining accurate sub-task parsing and reasoning consistency, underscoring the need for enhanced interpretability and error correction mechanisms in complex multi-hop fact-checking tasks."}

Program errors (8%), such as incorrect syntax or missing variables in program-guided reasoning like Program-of-Thought, further impair accuracy.\n\nOverall, GPT-4's stronger performance arises from its more refined reasoning capabilities, better handling of numerical and grounding errors, and its ability to manage confidence levels appropriately. Conversely, InstructGPT's difficulty in accurately classifying claims, especially those with ambiguous or unsupported information, results in its lower accuracy.\n\n![The confusion matrices compare InstructGPT and GPT-4's performance, showing GPT-4's higher accuracy and less confusion among classes](image3)\n\nIn summary, the performance discrepancy is primarily driven by differences in the models' abilities to handle data grounding and ambiguous claims, with GPT-4 showing substantial improvements over InstructGPT in these areas."}

Its predictions are more concentrated on the true labels, such as 32.1% for supported and 25.2% for refuted in the predicted categories, whereas InstructGPT shows a dispersed pattern with many false positives, particularly misclassifying NEI claims as supported or refuted.\n\nConcerning error types, Table 5 (image3) indicates that grounding errors—incorrect associations of data with claim components—constitute the largest error category at 50%. Both models struggle with this, but the matrices reveal specific tendencies. InstructGPT exhibits a pattern of \"less confident\" predictions, frequently placing true claims into the NEI class (26.8% of NEI true labels), suggesting it often defaults to uncertainty when unsure. Conversely, GPT-4 displays overconfidence, frequently misclassifying NEI claims as supported or refuted (e.g., 10.3% of NEI true labels predicted as supported), which reflects its tendency to overcommit, potentially leading to false positives.\n\nFurthermore, the color-shaded confusion matrices illustrate that GPT-4 has a more decisive classification, but its overconfidence sometimes results in over-predictions, while InstructGPT’s hesitance causes under-confidence and a broader distribution of errors. The error analysis also notes that grounding errors, which encompass incorrect referencing of data, are the most prevalent in these models’ failures.\n\nThese differences suggest that GPT-4 enjoys higher overall accuracy with a strong capacity for complex reasoning, partly thanks to its overconfidence and better discrimination between classes. However, its tendency to overpredict NEI as supported or refuted indicates a potential for false positives, whereas InstructGPT’s uncertainty manifests as more frequent misclassifications into NEI, often with less confidence. Both models exhibits challenges in accurately identifying the NEI class, but GPT-4’s overconfidence could lead to overestimating claims’ verifiability, while InstructGPT’s hesitance results in more conservative, but sometimes less accurate, predictions.\n\n**In summary**, GPT-4’s superior performance comes with a tendency towards overconfidence, leading to some overclassification errors, whereas InstructGPT shows more uncertainty and less confident predictions, which can cause different misclassification patterns."}

InstructGPT tends to exhibit a pattern of “less confident” predictions, often classifying both supported and refuted claims as NEI, indicated by the higher proportions of NEI predictions when the actual label is supported or refuted—specifically, 26.8% and 23.6%, respectively [image5]. This over-cautiousness suggests difficulty in confidently recognizing when sufficient evidence exists, leading to conservative categorization where models default to NEI even when the claim might be verifiable.\n\nIn contrast, GPT-4 shows a tendency toward overconfidence, frequently misclassifying NEI claims as supported or refuted, with about 10.4% of true NEI claims being predicted as NEI, but also substantial misclassification into other classes—supported (10.3%) and refuted (8.5%) [image5]. This overconfidence implies that GPT-4 struggles with uncertainty in the absence of enough evidence, often incorrectly asserting veracity or refutation when evidence is lacking, thereby reducing accuracy in the NEI category.\n\nThe core challenge for InstructGPT involves uncertainty assessment—its conservative approach leads to many NEI labels when evidence is ambiguous or insufficient, but it sometimes underestimates verifiability. For GPT-4, the primary obstacle is overconfidence; it tends to overstate the verifiability of claims, making it difficult to accurately classify NEI claims due to its propensity to overinterpret sparse or ambiguous evidence. These differing issues highlight that indetermine confidence levels—either overly cautious or overconfident—are primary hurdles preventing precise NEI classification in zero-shot settings for both models."}

This efficiency relates to their inference acceleration and the effectiveness of compression techniques. For instance, GPT-J demonstrates a significant improvement in processing speed, which could correlate with its ability to better utilize deep layer representations, as shown in the performance metrics.\n\nThe figures analyzing layer-wise performance [10] further provide insights: in both models, metrics like $\\mathrm{AUCRO C}_{l}$, which measure the model's focus on label words, increase in deeper layers, reaching about **0.8 in GPT2-XL** and **0.9 in GPT-J** in the deepest layers. Additionally, the correlation measure $R_{l}$ increases as we go deeper, indicating that the models extract more relevant information in the middle to deep layers, leading to improved prediction accuracy.\n\nThe confusion matrices [4, image 2] visually demonstrate where these models tend to struggle. Diagonal values near **1** signify high accuracy for many categories, but off-diagonal elements illustrate confusions, especially among categories like \"Abbreviation,\" \"Entity,\" and \"Description.\" This indicates that both models, when performing classification, are generally accurate but can confuse categories with similar semantic anchors or key representations, which likely affects their overall accuracy in datasets containing such categories.\n\nIn summary, while GPT-J outperforms GPT2-XL in efficiency gains and likely in extracting deeper layer features that lead to better classification, both models exhibit some confusion between semantically similar categories, as seen in the confusion matrices.

Specifically, **precision increases** from around 14 to approximately 26 as more knowledge is removed, indicating the model becomes more conservative in citing knowledge when less relevant information is available. Conversely, **recall remains nearly constant**, hovering just below 15, which suggests that the model's ability to identify and cite relevant absent knowledge is limited but stable across different levels of missing information [5]. The **F1-Score experiences a moderate rise** from about 14 to 18, reflecting a balancing act where both precision and recall influence overall performance but with recall’s plateau indicating constrained detection of knowledge absence.\n\n![Experiment Result on Conscious Incompetence](image3)  \n*The line graph shows that as more knowledge elements are removed, the models tend to cite less, but their ability to recognize out-of-knowledge instances remains limited, with recall staying constant.*\n\nThis pattern implies that models tend to become more cautious in their citations as knowledge is partially missing, but their capacity to explicitly acknowledge absent or unknown knowledge remains modest, which is characteristic of the \"Conscious Incompetence\" stage. The elevated precision with increased knowledge removal indicates that the models avoid confidently citing knowledge they are less certain about, yet their stable recall suggests they do not substantially improve in recognizing missing knowledge.\n\nIn the broader retrieval analysis context shown in the \"Retrieval Analysis\" line graph, decreasing retrieval accuracy—from perfect (100) down to 20—corresponds to decreases in all metrics (precision, recall, and F1-Score). Notably, **recall drops sharply with lower retrieval accuracy**, especially between perfect and 80 accuracy levels, highlighting that poor retrieval harms the model's ability to recall relevant, even absent, knowledge effectively. Precision, however, is less affected and shows a gradual decrease, implying the model maintains some selectivity despite deteriorating retrieval quality [10].  \n\n![Retrieval Analysis](image5)  \n*As retrieval accuracy declines, the model’s recall suffers most significantly, indicating difficulty in identifying and citing necessary knowledge when retrieval quality is poor.*\n\nThese observations suggest that **while the models for \"Conscious Incompetence\" are somewhat cautious and tend to avoid over-citing as knowledge diminishes, their ability to correctly recognize and cite absent or unknown knowledge is limited, especially when retrieval accuracy drops**.

From the tables and figures, it is evident that adding logical constraints—whether directly during instruction (as in CoT with logical constraints) or through retrieval methods—tends to improve the accuracy and logical consistency of answers. For instance, **Figure 6** shows that the *micro-F1 scores* for MAVEN-ERE and Causal-TimeBank increase notably when logical constraints are introduced, especially as the number of demonstrations grows, with improvements surpassing those achieved purely through more demonstrations alone.\n\nFurthermore, the **left graph in Image4** demonstrates that as the number of demonstration samples increases from 1 to 20, the performance (Micro-F1) generally improves, and the benefit is more pronounced when logical constraints are applied. Specifically, models with logical constraints (\"w. lc\") consistently outperform those without (\"w/o. lc\") across different numbers of demonstrations, indicating that logical guidance aids learning and inference.\n\nThe **right graph in Image4** illustrates that iterative retrieval and logical constraints reduce logical inconsistency over multiple reasoning iterations, leading to more reliable answers. Additionally, **Table 5** and **Image5** show that models like Llama2-13B-PT and Vicuna-13B-PT attain higher Micro-F1 scores (up to ~26%) when trained with logical constraints, with post-processing further enhancing correctness.\n\nIn summary, increasing the number of demonstration samples improves model performance, but integrating logical constraints—either directly into instructions or through retrieval—provides a marked advantage, especially in complex reasoning tasks like event relation extraction. Logical constraints help models produce more accurate and logically consistent answers, particularly as the reasoning complexity (e.g., more hops) increases.\n\n---\n\n![The evaluation table shows that models with logical constraints and more demonstration samples achieve higher Micro-F1 scores on MAVEN-ERE and Causal-TimeBank, indicating improved performance.](image1)"}

Initially, models such as GPT-4, Vicuna, and Llama2 demonstrate that incorporating logical constraints significantly decreases LI compared to raw, unconstrained outputs. For instance, in the comparison table (image1), models that used all logical constraints consistently achieved near-zero LI percentages, often 0%, markedly lower than their versions without constraints. This demonstrates that explicitly providing logical rules markedly improves the models' logical consistency across datasets like MAVEN-ERE and Causal-TimeBank [2], [8].\n\nFurthermore, retrieval-based approaches to integrating logic constraints (images 1 and 3) also show reductions in LI. The results indicate that adding logical constraints—whether via all constraints or retrieved constraints—not only improves the correctness (higher Micro-F1) but also substantially reduces LI. For example, on MAVEN-ERE, Llama-2-13B-PT under logical constraints achieved an LI of 0%, rivaling the best post-processing results, which also reached 0% LI but sometimes at the cost of semantic coherence (image3, [8]). Post-processing, while guaranteeing 0% LI, can impact answer quality due to potential semantic inaccuracies introduced during answer refinement (images 1 and 3).\n\nComparing across datasets, the trend is consistent: logical constraints are very effective in minimizing LI across models and datasets. The iterative retrieval approach (images 1 and 5) further enhances this, as LI tends to decrease with more iterations, although with potential overthinking leading to diminishing returns. In some cases, post-processing might match the LI reduction of logical constraints but at a risk of semantic loss or answer distortion [8].\n\nIn summary, explicit logical constraints (either all constraints or retrieval-based) generally outperform post-processing in reducing logical inconsistency across MAVEN-ERE and Causal-TimeBank datasets. While post-processing guarantees perfect logical consistency (LI=0%), it may compromise answer quality, whereas logical constraints significantly lower LI in a more balanced manner. The overall evidence supports the conclusion that logical constraints are a more robust strategy to enhance logical consistency in LLMs across different datasets.\n\n![The table comparing model performance with logical constraints and post-processing](image1)"}

Additionally, the graphs in Image 2 highlight that the collapsed tree method peaks at a context length of around 2000 tokens with an optimal F1 score, while the tree traversal method shows a gradual improvement but remains less effective overall. This suggests that the collapsed tree approach with approximately 2000 tokens provides an effective balance, maximizing retrieval performance without exceeding model context limitations.\n\nThe qualitative analysis further illustrates that RAPTOR's hierarchical, tree-based retrieval allows it to select nodes from different layers, matching the question's detail level more accurately than DPR, which generally retrieves isolated chunks [10]. The various tables also reflect that augmenting models with RAPTOR consistently improves scores across metrics like ROUGE, BLEU, and F-1 Match, emphasizing its ability to synthesize and retrieve pertinent information efficiently [3][8][9][4].\n\nIn summary, RAPTOR outperforms traditional retrieval baselines across multiple metrics and models, with its performance critically dependent on the retrieval strategy and context management.

The \"Comparison with Rare Classes Results\" (quote [7]) highlights that RAR notably enhances the model's ability to discriminate rare categories, with improvements as high as 19.6% in AP_r (rare class AP) over models like CLIP alone, indicating a major leap in recognizing less frequent classes critical to zero-shot tasks.\n\nAdditionally, the visualizations emphasize that RAR facilitates better identification across objects of varying scales, improves localization, and refines predictions through effective reranking, as shown in the detection and classification visuals. The graph in image5 illustrates how RAR, by improving the accuracy across different crop scales and object sizes, contributes toward more consistent and robust zero-shot recognition performance.\n\nIn summary, compared to baseline models, RAR models deliver substantial improvements in zero-shot object recognition by leveraging retrieval-based reranking, leading to higher accuracy, especially in recognizing rare and fine-grained categories across large-scale datasets."}

Initially, as shown in [8], the system employs cropping and resizing techniques to generate focused object embeddings from detection images, directing the model’s attention to relevant parts and handling objects of varying sizes and positions. This pre-processing helps enhance feature quality, especially for small or cluttered objects. ![System for object recognition with cropping and blurring techniques](image4)\n\nOnce the images are pre-processed, the system encodes each object region into embeddings using a visual encoder, as highlighted in [10] and [3]. These embeddings are stored in an external memory, forming an index optimized for quick retrieval. Retrieval involves a k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) search, which finds the most similar stored embeddings or class labels based on the current object’s features, effectively narrowing down potential categories. This process is depicted in the \"Retrieving & Ranking\" stage of the pipeline in [3], where the top-k object categories are retrieved from memory. ![Pipeline for retrieving and ranking object categories](image3)\n\nAfter initial retrieval, as explained in [4] and [5], the system employs Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to rerank and validate the candidate labels. The MLLMs analyze the retrieved class names alongside contextual information, such as the appearance and location of objects, to accurately identify the correct category—like discerning a \"saltshaker\" from similar objects or confirming a \"vase\" in cluttered scenes. The reranking process refines initial results, ensuring higher precision, as illustrated in [2] and [4]. ![Reranking process for object labels](image2)\n\nThis combined approach of sophisticated pre-processing, efficient retrieval, and semantic reranking enables the system to handle complex detection scenarios effectively, consistently improving object recognition performance even under challenging conditions. In summary, the multimodal retriever retrieves relevant object categories via similarity search on encoded features and then uses MLLMs to rerank and confirm these categories, resulting in accurate recognition in detection datasets."}

In contrast, SciBERT's clustering appears less defined, potentially blending different disciplines.\n\nTogether, the table and visualizations suggest that SPECTER's training paradigm—particularly its use of citation-based triplet loss and focus on document-level representations—enhances its ability to produce embeddings that are more semantically meaningful for scientific literature analysis. This results in improved performance across tasks and a more interpretable, domain-aligned embedding space.\n\n![The clustering plot shows that SPECTER embeddings group scientific papers more coherently by discipline compared to SciBERT, indicating better topical separation](image2)"}

For instance, the augmentation method involving choosing negative training examples as templates resulted in a training set of 458,477 examples with a strong imbalance favoring negatives (79%). This imbalance impacts the overall effectiveness, as shown in Table 8, where adding positive examples (+positive) improved the accuracy over the original dataset, whereas adding negative examples (+negative) led to decreased performance despite balancing the data, mainly because of reduced data volume and the overwhelming presence of easy-negative samples [6].\n\nSpecifically, in sentiment classification tasks like SST-2 and SST-5, the experiments with different training objectives, including dice loss (DL) and Dice Similarity Coefficient loss (DSC), show that while CE (cross-entropy) achieves the highest accuracy, DSC and DL perform slightly worse or comparably, indicating that these augmentation strategies do not directly optimize accuracy but impact other metrics or lead to better generalization in imbalanced setups [1].\n\nIn named entity recognition datasets such as Chinese OntoNotes4.0 and English QuoRef, hyperparameters like \\(\\alpha\\) in Tversky index control the tradeoff between false negatives and positives, influencing performance. The results demonstrate that tuning these parameters (\\(\\alpha = 0.4\\) or 0.6) can yield the highest F1 scores, showing that adaptive weighting strategies in data augmentation or loss functions have a notable effect on outcomes [4][10].\n\nMoreover, the use of data augmentation with negative examples as templates, which increases the negative data size dramatically, underscores the importance of balancing data to avoid overwhelming the model with easy-negative examples, which can hinder learning on harder examples and reduce overall effectiveness [7]. Conversely, augmentation techniques like focal loss and dice loss, especially when combined with dynamic weighting strategies, help the model focus on harder negatives during training, boosting performance on imbalanced datasets [9].\n\nOn question answering tasks, the application of augmentation methods (like Focal Loss, DL, DSC) on models such as BERT and XLNet yielded incremental improvements in Exact Match (EM) and F1 scores across datasets like SQuAD and QuoRef, indicating that these techniques help models better handle difficult examples and improve robustness [4].\n\nIn summary, data augmentation impacts BERT's performance by altering data distribution, balancing class labels, and emphasizing hard examples.

For instance, in Table 1, COMET-RANK models trained within the proposed framework deliver higher correlation with human judgments across multiple language pairs involving English, often significantly surpassing BLEU scores. Similarly, Table 2's detailed scores show that incorporating reference translations enhances COMET-RANK's measurements—especially notable in language pairs with reverse directions—indicating that COMET-RANK benefits from reference data, whereas BLEU's scores rely solely on n-gram overlap without semantic understanding [1].\n\nFurthermore, the visualizations embodied in the line graphs (images 2 and 5) reveal that COMET-RANK maintains higher and more stable Kendall Tau scores across varying numbers of top MT systems, both in \"all systems\" and \"top systems\" scenarios. These graphs show that as the number of top models considered decreases, COMET-RANK's performance experiences a less pronounced decline compared to BLEU, which tends to perform poorly with fewer systems and demonstrates decreasing correlation. This suggests that COMET-RANK's learned, embedding-based approach captures semantic and contextual nuances better than BLEU's strict n-gram matching, leading to more robust and consistent assessments regardless of the set size.\n\nAdditionally, from the detailed metric comparisons across diverse language pairs, COMET-RANK, especially in its variants, tends to produce scores that align more closely with human judgments, outperforming BLEU in both cases [9][10]. It effectively leverages source and reference information, improving its semantic sensitivity, whereas BLEU remains limited to lexical overlaps, which can misrepresent true translation quality, especially in low-overlap or morphologically rich languages.\n\nIn conclusion, the trends indicate that COMET-RANK offers a more accurate and reliable evaluation of translation quality across different language pairs, particularly benefiting from reference and source information, and demonstrating superior correlation with human assessments. In contrast, BLEU remains a more superficial metric, primarily reliant on lexical matching, and thus less capable of capturing the nuanced aspects of translation quality, especially in diverse linguistic contexts."}

The text clarifies that in imbalanced datasets like this, **micro-average** is preferable to evaluate overall classifier performance because it accounts for class imbalance, which tends to favor the dominant class, Positive. Consequently, classifiers that perform well in Negative detection tend to register consistent improvements in micro-average scores, indicating robustness.\n\nIn particular, classifiers like **Decision Tree** and **Random Forest** maintain better scores across these averages, demonstrating their consistency.

LANI, inspired by the HCRC Map Task, features a larger corpus with 6,000 paragraphs, more instructions per paragraph (average of 4.7), and more actions per instruction (average of 24.6), indicating its focus on longer, possibly more detailed navigation sequences [1]. Its vocabulary size is also larger (2,292), reflecting a broader linguistic variability, and it involves relatively simpler manipulation tasks compared to CHAI.\n\nIn contrast, CHAI contains 1,596 instruction sequences with more instructions per paragraph (average of 7.7) but fewer actions per instruction (average of 54.5), suggesting more complex or multi-step tasks within a smaller dataset. The instructions in CHAI often include multiple goals, including navigation and object manipulation, such as opening cupboards, moving items, and closing doors, which inherently increases task complexity [9].\n\nPerformance metrics across the two datasets show that models generally perform better on CHAI in terms of stop distance (SD) and other goal prediction accuracy measures. For example, in the methodology comparison, \"Our Approach\" achieves a lower SD of 2.75 on CHAI compared to higher values on LANI, indicating more accurate navigation in CHAI’s environment [4]. However, despite better numerical scores, both datasets reveal significant challenges: human performance on LANI has a stop distance error of 5.2 with 63% success, while CHAI's human performance has a distance error of 1.34 and 100% task completion, highlighting that CHAI's tasks, involving more complex manipulation, are inherently harder for automation [2].\n\nFurther, the evaluation of various models shows that our method outperforms baselines and previous approaches on both datasets, with the greatest improvements observed in goal accuracy and reduced error metrics. Notably, the competitive performance in CHAI despite its complexity indicates that current automated methods are more effective at navigation than manipulation tasks, which remain more challenging across both datasets.\n\nIn summary, LANI emphasizes larger-scale navigation with simpler manipulation, leading to higher variability but easier task success, while CHAI involves more complex, multi-goal tasks that are tougher for models to fully master. Performance metrics mirror this difference, with models showing stronger results in LANI, but still leaving substantial room for improvement in CHAI's nuanced, combined navigation and manipulation tasks."}

When embeddings are not aligned, they are trained independently in source and target languages, which can result in less direct correspondence between semantic spaces [4]. This independence can pose challenges for the model in learning accurate mappings between words, especially for languages with distinct semantic structures [8].\n\nEmpirical evidence suggests that aligning embeddings to a common semantic space can facilitate better transfer learning and lead to higher BLEU scores. For instance, as shown in the results from Table 5, aligning word embeddings significantly improved translation quality for many language pairs, particularly those with similar linguistic roots, such as GL/Pt, and more divergent languages like RU or HE. The alignment ensures that semantically similar words across languages are positioned in comparable locations within the embedding space, which helps the encoder learn more effective representations [7].\n\nHowever, the impact of alignment is not uniformly positive. Interestingly, as Table 4 indicates, in some cases, alignment of the embeddings resulted in negligible gains or even slight decreases in BLEU scores across certain languages, implying that prior alignment may not always be beneficial or necessary [8][9]. This suggests that the effectiveness of alignment depends on factors such as the linguistic similarity of language pairs and the specific architecture of the translation system.\n\nVisual evidence from the provided graphs (image 4) further supports this complexity. The gain in BLEU scores from pre-trained and aligned embeddings tends to be more substantial when training data is scarce, highlighting that alignment can compensate for limited data [4]. Conversely, with larger datasets, the benefits diminish, and the impact of alignment becomes less pronounced.\n\nIn summary, while aligning word embeddings can improve BLEU scores by creating more consistent semantic spaces across languages—especially helpful for less similar pairs or low-resource scenarios—its benefits are not universal. The decision to align embeddings should consider the linguistic properties of the language pair and the available training data.\n  \n![The importance of embedding alignment varies, with benefits being more evident for divergent languages and low-resource settings](image4)"}

It shows larger pre-training improvements for more similar language pairs like ES→PT and FR→PT](image1)\n\nIn addition, qualitative analysis indicates that pre-trained embeddings help the model better translate less frequent vocabulary and generate more grammatically correct sentences, highlighting improved handling of rarer concepts, particularly in low-resource languages [7]. This is exemplified by its effectiveness in translating specific terms like \"Chris\" and multi-word phrases accurately.\n\nMoreover, the effectiveness of pre-training is also influenced by the size of the training dataset. The graphs demonstrate that the gain in BLEU scores from pre-training is most pronounced at smaller dataset sizes, diminishing as more training data becomes available (see the BLEU score improvement graphs). This suggests that pre-training is especially beneficial in low-resource scenarios where data is scarce [10].\n\n![Graphs showing BLEU score gains are larger when training data is limited, with improvements decreasing as the dataset size increases](image5)\n\nFurthermore, the role of language similarity is underscored by results indicating larger gains for more distant language pairs, such as Russian and Hebrew, which start with lower baseline BLEU scores, allowing for more substantial improvements through pre-training. Conversely, for very similar language pairs, the gains are smaller but still positive, as the embedding space becomes more semantically aligned, facilitating transfer learning [4], [8], [9].\n\n![Evaluation metrics for different language pairs show larger improvements for distant languages like Russian and Hebrew](image3)\n\nIn summary, pre-training enhances translation accuracy by creating a more consistent and semantically aligned embedding space, particularly benefiting low-resource and linguistically distant language pairs. Its impact is most substantial when training data is minimal and languages are less similar, gradually tapering off as more data is available or languages become more alike [4], [10].\n\n**In brief:** Pre-training improves translation accuracy most notably for low-resource and dissimilar language pairs, with the largest benefits seen when training data is limited and languages are less similar."}

As shown in the evidence, the alignment process helps bring the source language embeddings into a comparable space with the target, facilitating better learning and translation outcomes. For example, in the table comparing aligned and unaligned datasets (image4), we observe that alignment can either slightly improve or marginally decrease BLEU scores depending on the language pair, such as a +0.3 increase for RU→EN and a −1.3 decrease for GL→EN. This indicates that alignment generally aids in less semantically distant language pairs but might have variable effects depending on the specific languages involved.\n\nFurthermore, when examining the F-measure scores based on target word frequency (image2), it is clear that pre-training significantly benefits the translation of low-frequency words. Both \"std\" (standard) and \"pre\" (pre-trained) methods show increased F-measures as word frequency rises, but pre-training consistently outperforms standard approaches, especially for rare words (frequency 1 or 2). This suggests that pre-trained embeddings, particularly when aligned, help the model better handle less frequent vocabulary by providing richer initial representations, which are crucial for low-resource or low-frequency word translation.\n\nThe qualitative analysis from the translation examples (image1) further supports this, showing that models trained with pre-aligned embeddings produce more accurate and contextually appropriate translations. In conclusion, embedding alignment enhances the model's ability to translate across different languages effectively, especially beneficial for less frequent words, thereby improving overall translation quality."}

When GloVe embeddings are used without R-GCN (\"GloVe w/o R-GCN\"), the scores drop significantly both in unmasked (from 59.2 to 51.2) and masked conditions (from 11.1 to 11.6), indicating that R-GCN helps in updating mention representations based on their relations, which boosts accuracy. The \"No R-GCN\" setup, which likely involves removing the R-GCN from the better models, shows a performance of 62.4 in unmasked and 63.2 in masked conditions (quote [4]), suggesting a notable reduction compared to models that incorporate R-GCN.\n\nSimilarly, the removal of relation types (\"No relation types\") results in performance marginally declining (from 62.7 to 62.9 unmasked; masked from 63.9 to 65.8), but the effect is more palpable when the model relies heavily on relation information (quote [10]), where the absence of relation types diminishes the benefits of the graph structure.\n\nRegarding specific relation types like MATCH and COREF, quotes [1] and [9] indicate their roles. Removing MATCH connections (\"No MATCH\") yields scores of 64.3 unmasked and 67.4 masked, slightly worse than the full model, showing that MATCH relations contribute positively but are not solely critical. Removing COREF (\"No COREF\") results in 64.8 in unmasked, but the masked results aren't specified, implying some impact on performance. The data suggest that both relation types contribute to multi-hop reasoning, especially in the unmasked setting where more information is available.\n\nFinally, the overall trend from the tables and descriptions indicates that:\n- Removing R-GCN or disabling multi-hop message passing mechanisms reduces performance, especially in the masked condition where context is limited.\n- Eliminating relation types weakens the model’s ability to leverage structured information, leading to performance drops.\n- Specific relations like MATCH and COREF have a tangible impact, with their absence slightly degrading the model, more so when context or document-based cues are missing.\n\n**In summary:**\n\n| Component Removed                 | Impact on Unmasked Performance             | Impact on Masked Performance                  |\n|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|\n| R-GCN                          | Noticeable decrease (from ~68.5 to ~62.4) | Significant drop (model relies on multi-hop reasoning; performance suffers when R-GCN is absent)  |\n| Relation types                 | Slight decrease (~62.7 to ~62.9)         | Slight decrease (~63.9 to ~65.8)           |\n| MATCH relations                | Small drop in performance (~64.3)        | Slight degradation, more pronounced in masked settings |  \n| COREF relations                | Minor impact in unmasked (~64.8), masked effects less clear | Performance likely declines with no coreference links|\n\nOverall, component removal tends to impair the model's ability to utilize relational information effectively, with the most substantial effects observed when R-GCN and multi-hop message passing are omitted, especially in masked scenarios that demand reasoning over limited context."}

Specifically, the Entity-GCN without coreference achieves an unmasked test accuracy of **67.6%**, whereas with coreference, this slightly decreases to **66.4%** [4]. This suggests that, in unmasked conditions, incorporating coreference information does not necessarily enhance accuracy and may even slightly hinder it.  \n\nIn contrast, the performance in the masked setting (where mention surface forms are replaced with placeholders like MASK1) shows a different trend. The unmasked version without coreference has a development accuracy of **64.8%**, while the model with coreference edges attains an accuracy of **65.3%**, indicating a marginal improvement of about **0.5%** [4]. This implies that under masked conditions, coreference information may provide some benefit, possibly because exact entity linkage is less reliable, and coreference information helps bridge mentions across the text.\n\nThe results overall suggest that coreference information's contribution to Entity-GCN performance is context-dependent: it has a neutral or slightly negative effect in unmasked scenarios, where mentions can be recognized via surface forms, but offers at least a small advantage when surface forms are masked, and the model relies more on relational cues.  \n\n![A comparison graph illustrating Entity-GCN performance with and without coreference in unmasked and masked settings](image2)  \n\nIn summary, including coreference tends to slightly degrade or marginally improve performance depending on whether the setting is unmasked or masked.

It achieves 60.58% joint goal accuracy in an unseen domain (Taxi), even though the \"Zero-Shot\" column in the table shows a significant performance drop compared to trained single-domain models, which often score above 70-80%. This indicates that while zero-shot performance doesn't reach the levels of trained models, TRADE effectively transfers learned knowledge to new domains without additional training, showcasing its ability for zero-shot domain adaptation.\n\nIn summary, TRADE excels in multi-domain environments by combining shared representations with transfer learning techniques, leading to high accuracy across various domains, and it demonstrates considerable zero-shot capabilities, effectively generalizing to unseen domains with reasonable accuracy."}

Similarly, its slot accuracy scores are also the highest, recording **96.92%** (full) and **93.28%** (restaurant), indicating its robustness in understanding dialogue states across domains.\n\nIn terms of zero-shot DST performance, as illustrated in the bar charts (image2) and analyzed in quotes [1] through [3], TRADE outperforms many models in zero-shot scenarios, notably achieving high joint accuracy in unseen domains like taxi (around 60.58%), which is close to the supervised results, largely because its slot predictions benefit from shared slot values across domains. The visual error analysis shows the model effectively transfers knowledge for certain slots like people, area, price range, and day (in hotel), indicating its strong knowledge transfer abilities.\n\nRegarding domain adaptation, the results presented in tables (images 3 and 4, and quotes [6]–[9]) reveal that fine-tuning TRADE with strategies such as GEM (Gradient Episodic Memory) significantly helps maintain performance on previously learned domains while adapting to new ones. These strategies outperform naive fine-tuning and training from scratch, with results like **59.83%** joint accuracy on the new domain after only 1% training data, compared to **44.24%** when training from scratch (quote [7]). Moreover, GEM-based fine-tuning results show less performance degradation on previous domains. For instance, after fine-tuning with GEM, the hotel domain joint accuracy only drops modestly from 58.98% to 53.54%, whereas naive methods experience larger drops, as depicted in table 3 (image3).\n\nIn summary, TRADE not only achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on supervised MultiWOZ tasks—outperforming other models in joint and slot metrics—but also exhibits strong zero-shot transfer capabilities.

As shown in the provided data, GEM generally outperforms naive fine-tuning and EWC by maintaining higher performance on original domains after adaptation. For example, [5] indicates that fine-tuning with GEM results in only a modest performance drop on the four core domains (from 58.98% to 53.54% joint accuracy in the hotel domain), whereas naive fine-tuning causes a significant decrease (to 36.08%). Similarly, [6], [9], and [10] highlight that GEM consistently helps preservation of learned knowledge during domain expansion, outperforming EWC, which uses the Fisher information matrix as a regularizer, and naive methods that lack constraints altogether. Visual evidence from **image3** supports this, where fine-tuning results show that GEM's ability to prevent forgetting yields better performance across multiple domains compared to naive approaches.\n\nRegarding slot similarities, the heatmap in **image5** shows that certain slots, like \"destination\" and \"departure,\" or \"price range\" and \"stars,\" have high cosine similarity, indicating that their embeddings are closely related. This high similarity can facilitate transfer learning since related slots share semantic features, allowing the model to leverage common representations when adapting to new domains. Conversely, slots with less similarity may be harder to track accurately in zero-shot or few-shot settings, as evidenced by the difficulty in tracking slots unique to a specific domain like \"parking\" in the hotel domain or \"food\" in the restaurant domain (see **image2**).\n\nIn summary, GEM tends to better preserve prior knowledge during the adaptation process compared to EWC and naive fine-tuning, which is crucial when working with limited new domain data. Furthermore, understanding slot similarities can help improve performance, as higher cosine similarity between slots enables better transfer of knowledge across related slots, enhancing zero-shot and few-shot domain adaptation."}

Quantitative evaluations from multiple studies and datasets indicate that most popular MT systems, such as Google Translate, Microsoft Translator, Amazon Translate, and SYSTRAN, tend to perform variably across languages, often exhibiting significant gender bias, especially regarding stereotypical roles.\n\n![This table presents the accuracy and error metrics for different translation services—Google Translate, Microsoft Translator, Amazon Translate, and SYSTRAN—across various languages.](image2) Notably, as shown in the detailed metrics, while certain languages like German (DE) generally have higher accuracy scores (e.g., Microsoft Translator reaching 74.1%), others such as Ukrainian (UK) and Arabic (AR) tend to have lower accuracy and higher bias measures. Furthermore, the data suggest that, across these systems, accuracy in conveying the correct gender is often poor, with many models performing only marginally better than random guessing, particularly in languages with grammatical gender like Russian, Ukrainian, and Arabic, as discussed in [4] and [8].\n\nInterleaving this with findings on gender bias, studies have demonstrated that translation systems perform better on stereotypical gender roles—for instance, translating 'nurse' as female or 'programmer' as male [1][3][9]. Images depicting gender bias evaluation reveal that stereotypical translations achieve higher accuracy (e.g., Google Translate's stereotypical translations reach 67% in Spanish and up to 80% in French, in contrast to lower accuracy for non-stereotypical cases) [3][7]. The disparity is visually apparent in the bar chart, which shows that stereotypical translations are more accurately gendered across languages like Spanish, French, and German compared to non-stereotypical ones [3].\n\nAdditionally, extensive datasets such as WinoMT, Winogender, and WinoBias demonstrate a clear gender bias—models tend to default to stereotypical roles, favoring male associations for certain professions and female for others—a bias quantified by the differences in F1 scores (Δ_S) and others. These biases are consistent across languages with grammatical gender and across different MT systems, as detailed in the evaluations and tables [2][4][5][6][10].\n\nTherefore, although MT systems have improved in overall accuracy for some languages, the prevalent gender biases and disparities in translation quality persist, especially in languages with grammatical gender and when translating non-stereotypical roles. This highlights the ongoing need for bias mitigation and enhanced accuracy in multilingual machine translation.\n\n**In summary,** while translation accuracy varies across systems and languages—often low in languages with grammatical gender—gender bias remains a significant issue, with systems favoring stereotypical gender assignments, and their performance in conveying correct gender identity is generally inconsistent and biased."}

The bar chart in image1 clearly demonstrates that Google Translate's accuracy in gender translation is higher for stereotypical roles than for non-stereotypical ones across all tested languages. For example, in Spanish (ES), stereotypical translations have an accuracy of 67%, whereas non-stereotypical translations drop to 46%, indicating a substantial bias favoring stereotypical gender assumptions. Similar trends are observed in other languages such as French, Italian, Russian, and Arabic, where stereotypical roles are translated more accurately, reflecting underlying gender biases embedded in the models [2].\n\nFurthermore, the table in image2 provides quantitative evidence showing that applying gender-specific adjectives (+Adj) to entities improves gender prediction accuracy in several languages like Spanish (ES), Russian (RU), and Ukrainian (UK), with positive changes (Δ), suggesting that linguistic cues can influence bias mitigation. For example, adding stereotypical adjectives increases accuracy by approximately 10-11 percentage points, highlighting that explicit gender signals can somewhat correct biases [8].\n\nSpecific translation examples in image3 reinforce how biases manifest in actual translations. For instance, in translating the sentence \"The janitor does not like the baker because she always messes up the kitchen,\" the Spanish version defaults to \"el panadero\" (male baker), despite the female pronoun, illustrating stereotypical bias. However, when stereotypical cues like \"pretty\" are added, the translation's gender aligns better with the context, showing that explicit signals can counteract biases [3].\n\nThe data in images4 and 5 further demonstrate that these biases are pervasive across various models and languages, with certain translation systems exhibiting higher accuracy for stereotypical roles and notable differences in handling gender cues. For example, Google Translate and Microsoft Translator display these discrepancies, with accuracies favoring stereotypical associations, thus perpetuating gender stereotypes [4][5][6].\n\nIn summary, stereotype-based adjustments—such as incorporating stereotypical adjectives or leveraging explicit gender signals—can improve the accuracy of gendered translations and help counteract biases. Nonetheless, existing models demonstrate a persistent tendency to favor stereotypical roles, underscoring the need for more sophisticated debiasing approaches to ensure equitable translation outcomes across languages [2][8].\n\n![The bar chart shows that stereotypical translations consistently have higher accuracy across languages](image1)\n\n"}

For example, in a comprehensive analysis, different models' performances are evaluated under \"Distractor\" and \"Open\" settings; notably, Single-paragraph BERT achieves an F1 score of 67.08 in the distractor setting but drops to 38.40 in the open domain, highlighting how open-domain retrieval challenges reduce accuracy [1](image1). Similarly, when increasing the number of retrieved paragraphs from 10 to 500, the F1 score drops slightly from 38.40 to 39.12, but adding a gold paragraph boosts it substantially to 53.12, underscoring the importance of quality evidence in open-domain settings [2](image2).\n\nFurther, question complexity influences performance; multi-hop, context-dependent, and single-hop questions show varied scores, with multi-hop questions typically being more challenging. For instance, multi-hop questions like \"Who was born first, Arthur Conan Doyle or Penelope Lively?\" yield an F1 of 54.46, whereas single-hop questions such as \"Which writer was from England, Henry Roth or Robert Erskine Childers?\" score higher at 70.54 [3](image3). Training strategies also matter; models trained on adversarial distractors tend to recover their performance better when tested on similar data, suggesting adversarial training improves robustness. In one study, training on adversarial data increased F1 from 46.84 to 60.10 when evaluated on adversarial distractors, compared to training on original data [4](image4).\n\nAdditionally, question type and distractor selection influence model accuracy. Filtering distractors by entity type improves results, reducing F1 degradation caused by entity bias, and adversarial training with filtered distractors raises performance from about 40.73 to 58.42 F1 [5](image4). The percentage breakdown of question types indicates that multi-hop and weak distractor questions constitute significant portions of the dataset, which are inherently more challenging and require more sophisticated reasoning [6](image5). \n\nIn summary, employing targeted training strategies—such as adversarial training and entity type filtering—and ensuring high-quality, relevant evidence in evaluation significantly enhance F1 scores, especially for the more complex multi-hop questions, demonstrating that strategic datasets and training approaches are crucial for improving question answering models' robustness and accuracy."}

This reliance leads to inflated accuracy scores that do not truly reflect understanding. \n\nHowever, when an adversarial dataset is constructed—incorporating negated claims and inverted labels to mirror cue distributions across classes—the models' performances notably decrease to levels near random chance (around 50-53%), as shown in Table 4 and discussed in [3] and [6]. For example, BERT’s peak accuracy drops from about 77% to approximately 53% after training on the adversarial set, indicating that the model no longer relies on superficial cues but struggles to generalize under more challenging, less biased conditions [6].\n\n![The table shows BERT's performance metrics decreasing to near chance levels on the adversarial dataset, highlighting the reduced reliance on dataset artifacts](image4)\n\nThis setup exposes the models’ deficiencies in true argument understanding, revealing that prior high performance was largely due to exploiting dataset artifacts rather than genuine comprehension. The conclusions drawn from these results are that: \n\n1. **The original ARCT dataset contains statistical biases that can be exploited by models.**  \n2. **Constructing an adversarial dataset by negating claims and balancing cue distribution effectively removes these cues, leading to more realistic evaluations.**  \n3. **Model performance degradation on the adversarial set indicates that prior successes do not represent true argument reasoning ability.**  \n4. **Adopting the adversarial setup as a standard benchmark fosters more meaningful research efforts aimed at genuine NLP understanding.**  \n\nThis approach underscores the importance of robust evaluation datasets free from spurious cues to assess whether models genuinely comprehend argumentation or merely learn dataset-specific artifacts. \n\n![The diagram illustrates how BERT processes input tokens, showing deep layers that are capable of subtle cues, but also susceptible to dataset biases](image2)\n\nIn summary, the adversarial data setup reveals that BERT's high scores on the original dataset are mostly due to exploiting superficial statistical cues.

Closed vocabulary models, which use word-only representations, tend to have higher sensitivities as they rely heavily on a fixed vocabulary, resulting in more variability when encountering out-of-vocabulary words. For example, from the data in the second image, pass-through strategies in closed vocabulary models show higher sensitivity scores—around 11.4 to 12.7—leading to increased vulnerability to adversarial attacks, as indicated by their elevated sensitivity values and relatively higher WERs.\n\nIn contrast, open vocabulary models (such as char or word+char models) exhibit lower sensitivity when employing backoff mechanisms like the neutral variant. This is because the neutral backoff reduces the number of unique predictions by mapping rare or unseen words to a fixed neutral word, thus lowering the contrast in output predictions. As shown in the second image, open vocabulary models with the neutral backoff display sensitivities as low as approximately 11, with some models achieving even lower, and their WERs often remain lower or comparable to the closed models, especially when combined with robust backoff strategies. The reduced sensitivity correlates with improved robustness against attacks.\n\nFurthermore, the data in the first image emphasizes that strategies such as neutral backoff or background models significantly improve the robustness of models against spelling-based attacks, maintaining higher accuracy and lower sensitivity. For instance, the \"BERT + Neutral\" model retains high accuracy under attack conditions, akin to the trend observed in open vocabulary models employing neutral backoff strategies, which balance recognition performance with lower sensitivity.\n\nIn summary, closed vocabulary models tend to have higher sensitivity and WER when not using effective backoff strategies, making them more vulnerable to adversarial manipulations. Open vocabulary models, especially when utilizing neutral backoff, generally demonstrate lower sensitivity and better robustness, as evidenced by their more stable WER scores under adversarial conditions and their ability to handle out-of-vocabulary words more gracefully."}

For example, in the WMT19 results, *metrics based on word or sentence embeddings* outperform n-gram-based ones across many pairs, emphasizing the importance of semantic understanding [5].\n\nThe **significance test matrices** (images 3 and 4) further support this. They show that **YiSi-1** and **ESIM** frequently achieve statistically significant wins over other metrics—both for translating into English and from English—highlighting their robustness across language directions. These matrices use green cells to mark statistically significant improvements, and metrics like YiSi-1 and ESIM often dominate in both \"into\" and \"out of\" English scenarios, indicating their cross-lingual effectiveness [4].\n\nWhen comparing the metrics **translating into versus out of English**, the data suggests **a generally symmetric performance** for these semantic-based metrics. They maintain their significance in evaluating the quality regardless of translation direction. This is evidenced by the consistent significance markers in images 3 and 4, as well as the high correlation scores in tables 5 and 6, where metrics like YiSi-1 and ESIM perform well across different language pairs and directions.\n\nIn contrast, traditional n-gram metrics like BLEU or SENTBLEU, while useful, show less consistency in significance and often rank lower in the significance tests, especially for languages with more distant linguistic features. The **semantic embedding-based metrics** thus outperform in delivering statistically significant, reliable assessments across diverse language pairs and directions [1][2][3].\n\nTo summarize, **semantic embedding-based metrics such as YiSi-1 and ESIM** demonstrate the most consistent statistically significant performance across various language pairs, both for translating into and out of English, owing to their semantic understanding capabilities. This trend underscores a shift towards embedding and semantic-aware evaluation methods for more reliable machine translation assessment.\n\n![This heatmap shows that metrics like YiSi-1 and ESIM often significantly outperform others across language pairs in significance tests](image4)"}

Moreover, traditional metrics such as **BLEU** and **chrF** also demonstrate relatively strong correlation values, reflecting their continued relevance, but their performance is slightly more variable across different language pairs.\n\nFor **en-kk**, similar trends are evident. The **Yisi-2** metric again shows the highest correlations in many cases, indicating it reliably correlates with human judgments for Kazakh translations as well. Additionally, general metrics like **BEER** and **BERT** tend to perform well, with correlation scores comparable to or slightly below Yisi-2.\n\nThe significance testing matrices confirm that **Yisi-2** often has statistically significant wins over other metrics for these language pairs, emphasizing its robustness in these contexts [3]. Conversely, some traditional metrics like BLEU, while useful, occasionally lag behind more recent or specialized metrics such as Yisi variants.\n\nHere's an illustrative excerpt from the significance testing matrices:\n![significance testing results](image3)  \n*(the matrices show green cells where a metric significantly outperforms another)*\n\nAnd the correlation scores for these pairs:\n![correlation across metrics](image4)  \n*(highlighting high correlation metrics like Yisi-2)*\n\nIn summary, in the provided dataset, **Yisi-2** emerges as a particularly strong metric for **en-fi** and **en-kk**, showing robust and statistically significant high correlations with human judgment, outperforming many traditional measures like BLEU in these language pairs.\n\n**Therefore, metrics like Yisi-2 are most reliable for evaluation in these translations, but traditional metrics like BLEU and chrF also maintain reasonable correlation with human assessments.**"}

This reduction can be attributed primarily to amortization expenses, which are ongoing amortizations of existing asset values over their useful lives. For example, the accumulated amortization of developed technology increased from $72 million in 2019 to $111 million in 2020, indicating that $39 million of amortization was recognized during the year, reducing the net amount. Similarly, trade names and favorable contracts also experienced increases in accumulated amortization, further contributing to the overall decrease.

The company's foreign exchange risk is categorized as high, prompting extensive hedging activities to mitigate short-term earnings and cash flow volatility [1], [7], [8].\n\nExamining the data, the impact of a hypothetical immediate 5% increase or decrease in key currencies relative to EUR and DKK shows notable effects on both comprehensive income and income statements. Specifically, as depicted in the table of financial sensitivity, a 5% appreciation of foreign currencies would adversely affect other comprehensive income by approximately 1,811 million DKK in 2019 and 1,893 million DKK in 2020, representing a negative effect on equity reserves (see images 3). Conversely, a 5% depreciation would result in positive impacts of similar magnitude, indicating a high sensitivity to exchange rate movements.\n\n![The table provides impact estimates of exchange rate fluctuations on comprehensive income and income statement for 2020](image3)\n\nIn terms of cash flow hedges, the data from 2020 shows that Novo Nordisk actively manages its foreign currency exposure through forward exchange contracts and currency options—using financial instruments to hedge forecast transactions, assets, and liabilities up to 24 months ahead [9]. The table in the images details how these derivatives, classified by credit rating, contribute to the overall financial risk management. For example, high-rated counterparties in the AA range hold the majority of cash and derivatives, totaling over 8 billion DKK in 2020, which helps secure favorable hedge positions (see image 4).\n\n![Financial data illustrating the distribution of cash and derivatives by credit rating for 2020](image4)\n\nAdditionally, exchange rate movements are reflected in the historical currency data, showing that currencies like USD and GBP experienced fluctuations against DKK in 2020 and 2019. The average and year-end rates, along with their changes, demonstrate the currency volatility Novo Nordisk faces, reinforcing the importance of its forex hedging programs [5].\n\n![Currency exchange rate fluctuations for key currencies over 2018-2020](image5)\n\nOverall, the high foreign exchange risk led Novo Nordisk to implement extensive hedging strategies to counteract short-term impacts on earnings and cash flow, as evidenced by the significant sensitivity figures and active management of derivative instruments. These risk mitigation measures, combined with currency volatility, directly influenced the company's comprehensive income and cash flow hedges in 2020, maintaining financial stability amidst market fluctuations.\n\n**In summary,** the exchange rate changes and high foreign exchange risk prompted strategic hedging activities in 2020, affecting Novo Nordisk's comprehensive income and cash flow management through coordinated use of financial instruments and risk mitigation strategies."}

This shift reflects several key factors that influenced the company's deferred tax positions during the year.\n\nFirstly, the **income/charges to the income statement** were minimal, amounting to only a 2 million DKK net change, indicating that operational income or expense impacts had limited direct effect on deferred taxes that year. Conversely, adjustments to **other comprehensive income** led to a substantial decrease of 577 million DKK, primarily driven by currency translation effects and valuation changes related to financial instruments.\n\nAdditionally, **income/charges to equity** contributed a minor reduction of 72 million DKK, reflecting movements directly impacting shareholders’ equity, possibly from revaluations or transfer adjustments. Importantly, the **acquisition of subsidiaries** during 2020 added 276 million DKK to deferred tax assets, as new entities often have associated deductible temporary differences or unused tax losses. Conversely, the **effect of exchange rate adjustments** caused a decrease of 307 million DKK, primarily due to currency fluctuations affecting the value of assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies.\n\nThe comprehensive impact of these factors, especially the currency-related adjustments and movements in other comprehensive income, culminated in the overall reduction of the net deferred tax position. Maintaining and assessing deferred taxes also hinged on management's judgment regarding future taxable income, which influences whether deferred tax assets are recognized; thus, changes in anticipated profitability or tax policies could alter these balances further.\n\nHere's a visual overview of the year's changes:\n\n![The table presents a detailed reconciliation of the net deferred tax assets and liabilities over a period, highlighting changes and classifications.](image1)"}

This increase was primarily due to lower interest expenses, which dropped significantly from $619 million in 2020 to $449 million in 2021, and a decline in the average revolving Card Member loan balances, which moderated the net interest yield. Additionally, despite some fluctuations in interest rates, the company's interest income grew, contributing to higher net interest income, as indicated by the reported increase and the commentary on interest expense management [4], [7].\n\nIn contrast, card member receivables experienced fluctuations over these years. According to the data, total card member receivables slightly declined from $22.8 billion in 2019 to $22.4 billion in 2021, with a notable dip in 2020 before recovering somewhat in 2021. Specifically, U.S. receivables decreased from $14.2 billion in 2019 to $11.9 billion in 2020 but then increased to $14.7 billion in 2021 [4]. Outside the U.S., receivables decreased from $8.6 billion in 2019 to $6.8 billion in 2020, before rising again to $7.7 billion in 2021. These changes reflect a combination of factors such as macroeconomic conditions, credit loss provisions, and changes in customer borrowings.\n\nContributing factors for these changes include:\n\n- **For net interest income**:\n  - Lower interest expenses and funding costs, which improved the net interest margin (noted in [4], [7]).\n  - Adjustments in interest rates affecting interest income and expense, with a hypothetical 100 basis point rate increase having a detrimental impact on earnings [4].\n  - The decline in average revolving loan balances, partially offsetting the interest income gains [4], [7].\n\n- **For card member receivables**:\n  - Portfolio quality improvements and macroeconomic outlook, which led to reserve releases and lower credit loss provisions, enabling recovery in receivables in 2021 [6].\n  - Changes in customer borrowing behavior influenced by economic conditions and interest rate impacts.\n  - Fluctuations driven by pandemic-related economic disruptions and subsequent recoveries, as reflected in the 2020 dip and 2021 rebound.\n\nIn summary, from 2019 to 2021, net interest income increased mainly due to cost management and rate effects, while card member receivables experienced volatility driven by macroeconomic conditions, credit quality improvements, and customer borrowing patterns.\n\n![The trend of interest income and receivables over the years](image2)"}

In the balance sheet data (image3), 'Retained Earnings' increased significantly from RMB 7,007 million in 2019 to RMB 11,111 million in 2020, reflecting a growth of RMB 4,104 million. This increase is primarily driven by the profit for the year and other comprehensive income, which together augment retained earnings. According to the income statement (image2), the company's profit for 2020 was RMB 4,176 million, indicating a profitable year that contributed directly to the rise in retained earnings.\n\nFurthermore, the total comprehensive income for 2020, detailed in the statement of comprehensive income (image5), was RMB 8,100 million, which is substantially higher than the profit alone. This figure includes not only net profit but also other comprehensive income components such as fair value changes on financial assets, currency translation differences, and share of other comprehensive income of associates. The notable increase in other comprehensive income—from RMB 1,031 million in 2019 to RMB 5,219 million in 2020—played a significant role in the higher total comprehensive income. The positive fair value changes and currency translation differences contributed to this uplift, aggregating into a higher overall comprehensive income figure.\n\nIn summary, from 2019 to 2020, 'Retained Earnings' grew mainly due to net profits realized during the year, while the substantial increase in 'Total Comprehensive Income for the Year' was driven by strong net profit combined with favorable changes in fair value of assets and currency translation differences. These components collectively contributed to the significant upward movement in both metrics, reflecting overall positive financial performance and valuation adjustments during 2020.\n\n---\n\n![Financial statements showing the increase in equity and comprehensive income in 2020](image3)"}

Specifically, the total provision rose from approximately $3.56 billion in 2018, to about $3.74 billion in 2019, and further to around $4.97 billion in 2020, indicating a rising trend in tax expenses [5]. This upward trajectory is reflected in both current and deferred components, with current tax provisions jumping significantly in 2020, driven by increased federal, state, and foreign taxes paid or accrued [5].\n\nExamining the deferred income tax assets and liabilities provides additional insight into these trends. As of December 31, 2020, the net deferred income tax liabilities are approximately $3.37 billion, up from about $3 billion in 2019. The assets, mainly consisting of accrued expenses, loss carryforwards, and lease liabilities, have increased from roughly $2.87 billion in 2019 to about $3.39 billion in 2020, partly offsetting liabilities [7]. Conversely, the liabilities, primarily from intangible assets, goodwill, and other depreciation-related items, have also grown, contributing to the overall rise in net deferred tax liabilities.\n\nThis increase in deferred liabilities, especially in intangible assets and lease liabilities, suggests that the company's future taxable income might be expected to be higher, leading to larger deferred tax obligations. The growth in deferred assets, such as net operating loss carryforwards, indicates potential future tax benefits, though these are often mitigated by valuation allowances when realization is uncertain [9].\n\nIn summary, the rising provision for income taxes reflects both immediate tax expenses and changes in deferred tax positions. The increasing deferred income tax liabilities, in particular, signal larger future tax obligations due to growth in intangible assets and lease obligations, aligning with the overall upward trend in income tax expense over these years.\n\n![The table displays a rise in the company's total income tax provisions from 2018 to 2020, with increased current taxes and expanding deferred tax liabilities](image5)"}

In 2019, total current liabilities were approximately $3,205 million, while noncurrent liabilities stood at about $5,351 million, totaling roughly $8,556 million. By 2020, current liabilities had risen to approximately $5,342 million, and noncurrent liabilities increased to around $7,789 million, bringing the combined liabilities to about $13,131 million. This indicates an increase of roughly $4,575 million in total liabilities over the year, primarily driven by rises in deferred revenue, operating lease liabilities, and cross-currency swap derivatives [2][3].\n\nSimultaneously, the company's total debt experienced a slight decrease from approximately $21,729 million in 2019 to around $21,204 million in 2020, a reduction of about $525 million. Notably, the company had the capacity to incur an additional roughly $4.4 billion of debt under its Five-Year Facility as of the end of 2020, indicating ongoing liquidity flexibility despite the decrease in total debt [3][5].\n\nIn essence, while total debt marginally declined, the comprehensive liabilities—especially with increased operating lease obligations and derivatives—suggest a shift towards more off-balance-sheet commitments and contractual obligations. This reflects strategic financing activities, including new borrowings for acquisitions and operational needs, coupled with ongoing management of debt structure to ensure liquidity and adherence to covenants like maintaining a leverage ratio of 0.65 or less [4][5]. The rise in liabilities underscores an overall increase in obligations, even as the specific debt levels slightly decreased, highlighting a complex balance between debt management and broader liabilities.\n\n![Liabilities Breakdown](image2)"}

This rise reflects a higher proportion of taxes relative to earnings in 2020, which is partly attributable to the decrease in net discrete tax benefits, from a benefit of **$(475) million** in 2019 to a smaller benefit of **$(122) million** in 2020, according to the same table. These discrete tax benefits are mainly associated with the remeasurement of reserves and the conversion of employee share-based awards [5].\n\nThe reduction in net discrete tax benefits indicates that in 2020, the Firm recognized fewer tax benefits related to tax examination resolutions and share-based awards than in 2019. This decrease, combined with the higher effective tax rate, means that the tax expenses in 2020 were relatively higher compared to earnings, influencing the overall tax burden.\n\nRegarding compensation expenses, the total recognized in 2020 was **$2,119 million**, up from **$1,878 million** in 2019, reflecting increased discretionary incentives, higher payouts linked to investment performance, and additional compensation from the Acquisition, as detailed in [9]. The rise in compensation expenses did not coincide with an increase in tax benefits; instead, fewer discrete benefits were recognized, contributing to the overall increase in the effective tax rate.\n\nIn summary, from 2019 to 2020, the Firm experienced a higher effective tax rate mainly due to lower net discrete tax benefits and higher total compensation expenses, resulting in an increased tax burden relative to earnings during that period.\n\n---\n\n### Visual Summaries:\n![Compensation expenses in 2020](image1)  \n*Shows the overall increase in compensation expenses across different segments from 2019 to 2020.*\n\n![Tax and awards information](image4)  \n*Displays the change in effective tax rates and net discrete tax benefits, illustrating the decline in benefits and rise in tax rate.*\n\nThis connection indicates that as the Firm’s compensation expenses grew in 2020, the associated tax benefits diminished, leading to a higher effective tax rate overall."}

This growth resulted in a total loan increase of about $15.2 billion, adjusting the total worldwide card member loans from $73.4 billion to $88.6 billion. The improvements in **portfolio quality** and macroeconomic outlooks, especially reductions in unemployment projections, contributed to a decrease in the reserve for credit losses in 2021, and net write-offs remained lower compared to 2020, indicating healthier credit conditions.\n\nSimilarly, **card member receivables** increased overall, with a total rise from $43.7 billion in 2020 to $53.6 billion in 2021, driven by increased borrowing and spending activity. The gross receivables saw an uptick, and the reserve for credit losses for receivables also grew, albeit at a lower rate, aligning with the increased balances.\n\nOn the **network volume** front, the global data shows a substantial recovery and growth: worldwide billed business increased by **25%**, from 2020's decline, signaling a robust rebound in consumer and commercial spending. Specifically, worldwide network volumes grew by 24%, reflecting increased transaction activity. In the U.S., both network volumes and billed business expanded markedly, with increases of 24% and 25% respectively, demonstrating strong domestic consumption. Outside the U.S., similar positive growth occurred, with network volumes rising approximately 27%, indicating a global economic recovery.\n\nCorrespondingly, **card member spending** also improved. The average spending per proprietary basic card member increased by around 4%, and overall non-interest revenue lines experienced substantial growth — with discount revenue up 26% and net card fees rising 11%, driven by higher card acquisition and retention efforts. These growth trends in spending and revenue mirror the increased card member borrowing and transaction activity.\n\nIn summary, from 2020 to 2021, card member loans and receivables grew notably due to increased customer borrowing, supported by improved economic outlooks and credit quality, leading to lower credit loss reserves and net write-offs. Meanwhile, network volumes and card member spending rebounded strongly, indicating renewed consumer confidence and transaction activity post-pandemic lows. \n\n![The table displays global increases in card network volumes and spending, reflecting economic recovery](image4)"}

For instance, the total assets increased considerably during this period, indicating expanded scale and investment [image5].\n\nSpecifically, in the North American divisions—such as FLNA (Frito-Lay North America), QFNA (Quaker Foods North America), and PBNA (PepsiCo Beverages North America)—the net revenue and operating profit generally trended upward. For example, PBNA's assets grew from approximately $31.4 billion in 2019 to $37.1 billion in 2020, reflecting strong performance. This expansion correlates with the regional composition of their product categories, where beverage sales constitute a substantial portion—about 45% for PepsiCo overall in 2020 [image3].\n\nIn terms of categorical distribution, regions like Europe and AMESA have shown shifts in beverage versus food/snack proportions over the years. Europe’s beverage share increased from 50% in 2018 to 55% in 2020, potentially driving higher revenue since beverages often entail different pricing and margin structures compared to food and snacks [image3]. Conversely, regions like LatAm consistently had a dominant food/snack share (90%), which might influence its revenue stability but possibly with lower margins.\n\nMoreover, the distribution of revenues across categories influences operating profit margins in each division. The table summarizing net revenues and operating profits indicates that growth was partly driven by productivity savings and pricing strategies, as well as lower restructuring charges, which further benefited profit margins [6]. Additionally, the higher advertising and marketing expenses cited reflect efforts to promote beverage and snack categories, aligning with the regional category distributions.\n\nThe proportion of beverage sales, especially in Europe and AMESA, and their increasing share contribute positively to revenue growth, given their typically higher margins. Meanwhile, supply chain and cost management across categories likely impacted operating profit, as regional distribution of product categories affected the cost structure.\n\nIn summary, from 2018 to 2020, divisions experienced growth driven by strategic expansion in beverage and snack sales, with regional shifts in category composition influencing revenue streams and profit margins. The increased categorization of beverage sales in regions like Europe and APAC correlates with observed revenue and profit increases, supported by product mix and geographic expansion efforts."}

This transition marked a significant shift in business focus, emphasizing mineral rights ownership in Brazil, including metals such as gold, diamonds, lithium, and rare earth elements[7].\n\nRegarding its corporate structure, one key development is the amendment to its Articles of Incorporation filed on July 6, 2020, which increased the number of authorized common shares from an initial amount to 2,500,000,000 with a par value of $0.001 per share[4][3]. This expansion of authorized shares indicates preparation for future issuance, financing, or restructuring activities. Additionally, the company authorized a series of classes of preferred stock with specific voting rights, where Series A Preferred Stockholders are entitled to 51% of total votes, controlling significant voting power regardless of share count, while common stockholders hold 49% proportionally[10].\n\nIn terms of stock ownership, recent transactions include issuing 53,947,368 shares to Lancaster Brazil Fund in March 2020, which involved recording a loss of $76,926 due to the exchange of equity with a related party[1][5]. Furthermore, the company engaged in a complex exchange involving convertible notes and stock options for its CEO, with recorded losses totaling approximately $68,015[3]. These transactions suggest active management of equity structure and a focus on leveraging debt-to-equity conversions.\n\nThe subsidiary structure also reflects strategic expansion into mineral operations, with subsidiaries owning mineral rights in Brazil for various valuable resources, including BMIX Participações Ltda., Mineração Duas Barras Ltda., and others, majority-owned at 99.99% by Brazil Minerals or its subsidiaries[image1].\n\nIn summary, recent amendments increased authorized shares and established a preferred stock class with voting rights, while subsidiary formations and share issuance activities point towards strengthening control over mineral rights assets and preparing for future growth.\n\n![The company increased its authorized shares and set voting rights via preferred stock amendments](image3)\n\nThis comprehensive restructuring and ownership adjustment showcase Brazil Minerals, Inc.'s strategic focus on expanding its mineral exploration assets and optimizing corporate governance mechanisms."}

This dramatic improvement was primarily driven by higher crude oil prices, which directly influence the profitability of exploration, development, and production activities that define the upstream operations [7]. In contrast, the Downstream segment showed a more subdued change, with earnings rising from near break-even (+$47 million) in 2020 to about $2,914 million in 2021 [5]. While this reflects a positive trend, the downstream earnings are more sensitive to refining margins, which are affected by global supply-demand balances, crude oil prices, and operational disruptions [4].\n\nIn terms of asset values, the comparison reveals that the total assets for these segments remained relatively stable over the period. The Upstream segment held assets valued at $184,412 million in 2021, slightly lower than $191,309 million in 2020 [2][6], due to asset dispositions such as “Assets held for sale” recorded as $768 million in 2021, associated with upstream operations anticipated to be sold [2]. Conversely, the Downstream segment’s assets increased from $39,586 million in 2020 to $45,224 million in 2021 [2][6], possibly reflecting investments in refining capacity and marketing infrastructure. The overall asset base across all categories remained fairly steady, with total assets around $239.5 billion in 2021 and $239.8 billion in 2020 [2][6].\n\nThe major differences are thus primarily in profitability: the upstream segment's earnings surged due to higher oil prices, which significantly affect exploration and production revenues, whereas the downstream segment saw modest earnings growth, heavily influenced by refining margins and operational factors. Asset-wise, the upstream assets slightly decreased due to sales and impairment considerations, while downstream assets increased, signaling continuous investment and capacity expansion in refining and marketing sectors.\n\n**In summary**, in 2021, Chevron’s upstream operations became highly profitable driven by favorable oil prices, while downstream operations experienced modest improvements, with asset values remaining relatively stable or increasing slightly, reflecting ongoing investments and operational adjustments."}

This growth was primarily driven by higher earnings before income taxes ($18.0 billion in 2022 vs. $13.7 billion in 2020) and a lower effective income tax rate, which together boosted net earnings [6]. Although foreign exchange impacts negatively affected net earnings by approximately $274 million in fiscal 2022, the overall profit growth remained positive due to operational improvements and tax benefits.\n\nRegarding stock-based expenses, the total recognized expense declined slightly from $558 million in 2020 to $528 million in 2022, a decrease of $30 million or about 5%. Specifically, expenses related to stock options decreased from $249 million in 2020 to $271 million in 2022, showing some variability, while RSUs and PSUs expenses decreased from $309 million in 2020 to $257 million in 2022 [7, 8, 9].

Focusing on systems, the external systems total revenue decreased by approximately 8.2%, from $7,604 million in 2019 to $6,978 million in 2020 (see [image1](image1)). Specifically, within hardware, IBM Z revenue increased slightly by 1.9%, but Power Systems and Storage Systems faced declines of about 22.4% and 6.1%, respectively, driven by product cycle dynamics and the IBM Z cycle ([1], [4], [image1](image1)). The gross profit margins in systems hardware improved, indicating more efficient operations, yet overall pre-tax income dropped by 36%, a significant decrease driven partly by workforce rebalancing charges ([5], [9]).\n\nRegionally, the company's total revenue declined by approximately 4.6%, from $77,147 million in 2019 to $73,620 million in 2020 (see [image4](image4)). Breaking it down:\n- The Americas saw a 6% decrease in revenue, slightly better than the regional average, and reflected the impact of the pandemic on domestic business.\n- Europe, Middle East, and Africa experienced a 3.3% decline, showing relative resilience.\n- Asia Pacific's revenue declined by approximately 3.5%, indicating a consistent downward trend regionally ([4]).\n\nConsidering pre-tax income, the overall decline was sharper than revenue drops. Globally, pre-tax income fell by approximately 27.8%, from $1,055 million in 2019 to $761 million in 2020, indicating increased expenses or lower profitability margins amidst revenue declines. Similarly, regional pre-tax income sharply decreased by 92.9%, from $1,645 million to only $117 million ([3], [image3](image3)). This indicates that, beyond revenue declines, profitability was significantly affected across regions, likely due to operational challenges and restructuring costs.\n\nIn summary, the year-to-year percent changes show that IBM's external revenue decreased modestly across regions (around 3-6%), whereas pre-tax income declined more steeply (around 28% globally and over 90% regionally), illustrating that profitability was disproportionately impacted relative to revenue reductions, especially due to operational and restructuring expenses in 2020."}

These adjustments generally involve adding back amortization expenses and impairment charges because they are non-cash or non-recurring items, aiming to reflect the underlying operational performance more accurately.\n\nIn 2020, as shown in the financial tables, the impact of these adjustments can be observed across different segments. For instance, in the segment detailed in image2 (likely representing a major business unit), the adjustments for amortization of intangible assets amounted to approximately 366 million USD for core gross profit and similarly for operating income, with additional impairment charges of 127 million USD. These additions result in a substantial increase in core operating income compared to IFRS figures, highlighting that amortization and impairments reduced IFRS operating income by around 366 to 255 million USD, respectively.\n\nSimilarly, in the 2020 data from image4, the adjustments to operating income involved amortization of intangible assets and impairments, which collectively increased the core operating income from IFRS by accounting for these non-cash charges. The adjustments for amortization and impairments here amounted to about 236 million USD for gross profit and 255 million USD for operating income, illustrating their additive effect.\n\nIn 2021, the influence is also evident. The data in image3 indicates that adjustments for amortization of intangible assets were around 236 million USD for gross profit and 34 million USD for impairments, significantly affecting the core operating income. Likewise, in the extensive data of image6, the amortization adjustments for core gross profit and operating income are substantial: over 3.4 billion USD for amortization of intangible assets in both gross and operating income, with additional impairment charges of 619 million USD in operating income.\n\nAcross all these segments and years, the common trend is that amortization of intangible assets and impairments reduce IFRS operating income. When adjustments are made to arrive at the core results, these charges are added back, resulting in higher core operating income figures. This adjustment process reveals the company's operational earnings exclusive of non-cash amortization and impairment expenses, providing a clearer view of ongoing business performance.\n\n**In summary:**  \n- In 2020, adjustments for amortization and impairments increased the operating income from IFRS results by approximately 255–366 million USD in various segments.  \n- In 2021, these adjustments were even more prominent, with amortization adjustments exceeding 3 billion USD and impairments adding tens of millions USD, substantially raising the core operating income figures compared to IFRS results.  \n\nThese adjustments consistently demonstrate how amortization and impairments can significantly affect reported operating income, with their exclusion in core results offering a more normalized view of the company's operational profitability."}

This roughly doubles the previous year's figure, indicating a substantial rise in the company's derivative positions, specifically in forward contracts covering currencies such as USD, CNH, JPY, GBP, CAD, and EUR. These instruments include cash flow hedges and fair value hedges, with some gains and losses recognized directly in the income statement and others in comprehensive income [1][4][5].  \n![The table displays data on derivative financial instruments for 2020 and 2019, with increased fair values in 2020](image1)  \n\nSimultaneously, **image2** shows that total financial liabilities measured at fair value through the income statement, mainly comprising derivatives, increased from DKK 734 million in 2019 to DKK 1,365 million in 2020. The total financial liabilities also expanded from DKK 26,182 million in 2019 to DKK 33,845 million in 2020, driven partly by the rise in derivative liabilities and other borrowings. Notably, current borrowings surged from DKK 1,474 million to DKK 7,459 million, reflecting increased utilization of short-term debt [2][3].  \n![Financial liabilities at fair value and other categories increased significantly in 2020](image2)  \n\nLooking at **cash flow changes**, **image5** illustrates that working capital decreased more in 2020 (DKK 4,353 million outflow) compared to 2019 (DKK 3,388 million outflow). This includes adjustments for inventories, receivables, payables, and other liabilities. The heightened outflow in 2020 results from increased receivables, payables, and other working capital components, which are influenced by the overall economic environment and company operations during that year. Such changes impact cash flows from operating activities and signal how the company manages liquidity in response to external conditions.  \n\nFurthermore, the company’s **non-cash income statement adjustments**, as seen in **image3**, increased from DKK 7,032 million in 2019 to DKK 7,849 million in 2020. This component includes fair value gains/losses on derivatives and other non-cash items, which relate directly to the derivative positions and valuation effects reflected earlier. The rise in non-cash items indicates an increased influence of valuation changes of financial derivatives on the income statement, aligning with the increased fair value of derivatives in 2020.  \n\nIn summary, the substantial increase in derivative financial instruments' fair value and related liabilities in 2020 indicates heightened hedging activities and risk management strategies. These derivatives influence the company's financial statements through increased fair value measurements, impacting recognized gains or losses depending on hedge accounting criteria. The greater working capital outflows reflect operational adjustments to maintain liquidity, influenced by market conditions and financial derivatives’ valuation effects, ultimately affecting cash flows and the overall financial position.  \n\nIn simple terms, the company managed more derivatives in 2020, which affected its liabilities and income, while also experiencing larger cash outflows related to working capital to support its operational needs."}

According to the summarized data, the directors received their salaries and allowances as detailed in the reports, and non-executive directors earned a standard sitting fee of Rs. 5,000 per meeting [7].\n\nSpecifically, the paid professional services to related directors involved amounts of Rs. 8.65 lakhs for Mr. R.A. Shah and Rs. 3.57 lakhs for Mr. Lalit Bhasin, but these payments were for services rendered rather than as performance-based remuneration. The company’s directors did not receive bonuses or incentives tied to financial performance, nor was there any structured performance-linked remuneration detailed in the reports [3], [8].\n\nWhen analyzing how their compensation related to the company’s financial performance and market conditions, the available reports indicate that the company's financial health in the period can be partially gauged through market data and performance metrics. The graph provided shows that the company’s share price fluctuated between Rs. 84 and Rs. 106, while the BSE Sensex ranged from 84 to 98 during April 2002 to March 2003, reflecting varied market conditions. The company's share price performance was relatively modest compared to Sensex movements, indicating moderate market sentiment rather than explosive growth or downturns [image1].\n\nFurthermore, the company's quarterly and annual financial results were disseminated through official publications and online, but there’s no direct linkage in the documents between remuneration and financial metrics such as profits or dividends. Given the absence of performance-linked incentives or bonuses in the remuneration structure, it appears that director compensation was more fixed and less directly tied to the company's financial or market performance during that period.\n\nIn summary, the directors’ remuneration in 2002-03 was largely fixed, with non-executive directors earning regulatory sitting fees, and payments to some executive directors for professional services, but there was no explicit performance-based remuneration structure. This remuneration approach seems to have had limited direct correlation with the company's financial results or market performance during the period, which was characterized by moderate fluctuations in share prices and steady disclosures rather than aggressive growth or decline.\n\n---\n\n![The graph compares the company's stock performance against the BSE Sensex over a year, indicating market conditions during 2002-03](image1)"}

This rise is mainly due to increases in insurance-related liabilities, such as unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, which grew from **$79.9 billion** to **$86.7 billion** [4, 8]. These liabilities reflect ongoing insurance operations and accumulated claims, which may be influenced by claims development and other factors.\n\nOn the other hand, shareholders' equity saw a substantial increase from about **$664 billion in 2020** to **$743.3 billion in 2021**, a rise of roughly **$79.3 billion**. This growth is driven by a combination of factors: an impressive net earnings of **$90.8 billion** [3], and a positive comprehensive income totaling **$90 billion** attributable to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders, as detailed in the income statement summaries [3]. The strong net earnings and accumulated comprehensive income significantly bolster shareholders' equity.\n\nThese changes in liabilities and equity are closely tied to the company’s earnings performance. The net earnings of approximately **$90.8 billion** in 2021, combined with a robust comprehensive income, indicate high profitability levels that contribute directly to increasing shareholders' equity (retained earnings and other comprehensive income components). The increase in liabilities, particularly in insurance-related liabilities, corresponds to the normal growth or claims experience inherent in insurance operations, which are expected to fluctuate based on claims development and underwriting results.\n\nMoreover, the company's strong asset base, including property, plant, and equipment valued at **$158 billion** and robust float generated through insurance operations (which grew from **$19 million** to **$147 billion** [6]), provide a solid foundation for ongoing operations and future growth.\n\nIn summary, from 2020 to 2021, Berkshire Hathaway’s total liabilities rose modestly due to increased insurance liabilities, while shareholders' equity surged substantially, driven by high net earnings and positive comprehensive income. These financial results reflect the company's profitable operations, effective capital management, and resilience in adverse conditions.\n\n![Insurance and Other assets breakdown](image1)\n\n**In conclusion, Berkshire Hathaway's increase in liabilities aligns with rising insurance obligations, while the large growth in shareholders' equity underscores its strong earnings and comprehensive income, reinforcing its financial strength over the period.**"}

The data indicates a disciplined shareholder return policy: for example, the payout ratio fluctuated around 30%, and total shareholder returns ranged from approximately 810 to 1,200 billion yen over recent years [5]. This reflects a strategic balance between returning value to shareholders and reinvesting in future technologies critical for responding to climate challenges.\n\nSimultaneously, Toyota actively assesses risks and opportunities stemming from climate change scenarios, like the below 2°C or 1.5°C pathways, which forecast increased electrification and renewable energy use [5][6]. The company invests in battery technology, streamlines production through the Toyota Production System to fund advanced tech development [6], and evaluates scenarios that project increased electric vehicle adoption under stricter regulations [2][5].\n\nThe evaluation framework for Toyota’s operational performance and shareholder value measures, including financial metrics like operating income and share price volatility [image1], indicates a strategic effort to adapt to these evolving conditions.

This suggests higher depreciation costs possibly due to additional assets being amortised or depreciation schedules being revised, which reduces the book value of assets over time. The specific categories like \"Land and buildings\" and \"Other equipment\" experienced depreciation effects consistent with these overall figures, with land and buildings depreciation rising from 564 to 644 million DKK from 2019 to 2020.\n\nImpairment losses, especially related to intangible assets, are discussed in the context of patents and licences. As per [3], in 2020, an impairment loss of DKK 350 million was recognized, primarily related to patents and licences in the diabetes and obesity segment. This impairment directly reduces the carrying amount of intangible assets that are not yet in use or have decreased future cash flow expectations, as outlined in [2], [4], and [6]. The impairment losses from 2019, which amounted to DKK 982 million mainly due to patents and licences, decreased significantly in 2020, reflecting management’s updated projections and potentially better market or technological outlooks.\n\nThe impact on net carrying amounts is observed in [image4], where the total costs of intangible assets, such as patents and licences, and property, plant, and equipment, are shown. For example, the carrying amount of intangible assets with indefinite useful lives and those not yet in use are tested annually for impairment. The reduced impairment losses in 2020 have likely stabilized or increased their net book values compared to previous years, despite increased depreciation expenses.\n\nIn summary, while depreciation slightly increased, the overall impairment losses on intangible assets decreased notably in 2020 compared to 2019. This shift indicates a reduction in write-downs and possibly better asset valuation or improved cash flow estimates, which helped preserve the net carrying amounts of these assets. The combined effect of these factors results in an overall stabilization or potential growth in the carrying values of property, plant, and equipment and intangible assets over this period.\n\n**In brief:** Depreciation increased modestly from 2019 to 2020, but impairment losses on intangible assets declined significantly, leading to lesser reductions in the net carrying amounts of these assets during 2020."}

Conversely, as detailed in the third table, premiums written increased significantly from $4,963 million in 2019 to $5,648 million in 2021, with a notable growth in premiums written and earned between 2019 and 2021, although 2020 saw some reductions attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic and the GEICO Giveback program [3].\n\nOn the other hand, net investment income, which includes interest, dividends, and other income, exhibited a pronounced decline during the same period. Interest and other investment income plummeted from $2,075 million in 2019 to just $589 million in 2021—a decline of approximately 71.6%—due primarily to lower income from short-term investments and fixed maturity securities, especially influenced by persistently low interest rates [6,2]. Dividend income, however, increased modestly from $4,525 million in 2019 to $5,060 million in 2021, reflecting growth in dividend receipts from investments like preferred stocks, although overall, pre-tax net investment income decreased from $6,600 million in 2019 to $5,649 million in 2021, a reduction of about 14.3%, largely driven by the decline in interest income.\n\nTo illustrate these trends visually, the accompanying images depict both the volume of premiums over the years and the investment income components. For instance, **Image 3** shows the pandemic-related impact on premiums, with a sharp decrease in premiums written in 2020 followed by a recovery in 2021, whereas **Image 2** demonstrates a substantial drop in investment income, particularly interest income, over the same period. The decline in interest income reflects lower yields due to sustained low-interest-rate environments, while dividends showed resilience and slight growth.\n\nIn summary, from 2019 to 2021, premiums earned experienced a slight decline overall, influenced by pandemic-related delays and program adjustments, while net investment income experienced a significant reduction mainly due to lower interest income, despite a modest increase in dividend income. This contrast underscores the differing impacts of market conditions and operational factors on premiums versus investment income for the company."}

This growth suggests that the company expanded its sales across different regions, notably in the Americas, Europe, and Asia Pacific, which collectively contributed to higher overall revenue. The increase in revenue likely reflects successful product sales, expanded customer base, or new acquisitions like Tableau, which was integrated into the company's operations during this period [6].\n\nSimultaneously, unearned revenue, which represents amounts invoiced in advance that are not yet recognized as revenue, also increased markedly — from approximately $8,564 million at the end of 2019 to about $10,662 million at the end of 2020, as detailed in the unearned revenue table [image4]. This rise indicates that the company secured more upfront payments from customers for future services or licenses. The increase from around $8.6 billion to $10.7 billion suggests a stronger pipeline of future revenue and possibly larger or more long-term customer contracts.\n\nThe implications of these changes are multifaceted. The growth in total revenue, driven partly by increased unearned revenue, points to a healthy sales trajectory and robust customer demand. The rise in unearned revenue, in particular, signifies that the company is effectively invoicing customers in advance, which can improve cash flow and provide financial stability. However, it also emphasizes the importance of recognizing that a substantial portion of the current revenue is yet to be earned and will be recognized over time as services are delivered. This phasing impacts how investors interpret revenue growth, and it underscores the need to closely monitor the conversion of unearned revenue into recognized income to assess sustainable performance.\n\n![The company's total revenue increased significantly from fiscal year 2019 to 2020, supported by regional growth, and unearned revenue also rose, indicating an increase in customer prepayments and future revenue potential](image2)"}

This improvement was primarily driven by higher cash provided by receivables, including sales of receivables totaling $3,076 million, partly offset by declines in net income performance [6][10]. The enhanced operational cash flow contributed substantially to the overall positive net change.\n\nIn terms of investing activities, IBM used $3,028 million in 2020, a sharp decrease of $23,908 million from the $26,936 million used in 2019 [5][9]. This reduction was mainly due to a decrease in net cash used for acquisitions, notably because the prior year's figure was impacted by the Red Hat acquisition, which caused a large outflow in 2019 [9]. The diminished investing outflows helped preserve cash during 2020.\n\nFinancing activities, however, represented a net use of $9,721 million in 2020, contrasting with a cash inflow of $9,042 million in 2019. The change of approximately $18,763 million reflects increased cash outflows related to financing activities—likely debt repayments, dividends, and share repurchases—aligning with the slight decrease in overall debt levels but more substantial cash outflows [8][2][3][9].\n\nAdditional factors affected cash position: \n\n- The provision for expected credit losses increased slightly by $34 million [7], marginally impacting cash but indicating more reserves, especially in the Americas. \n\n- Currency translation adjustments caused a small negative effect of $87 million on cash and cash equivalents [2].\n\n- The impact of tax relief programs, such as the U.S. CARES Act, provided about $600 million in deferred tax payments, which temporarily preserved cash [10].\n\nAltogether, the operational improvements, along with decreased investments and managed financing outflows, led to a positive net change in IBM's cash position in 2020, reversing the negative trend seen in 2019. These adjustments and cash flow activities collectively contributed to a significant build-up of cash during a challenging economic year.\n\n![The table shows a net increase in cash of $5,361 million in 2020, influenced by higher operating inflows, reduced investing outflows, and notable financing cash outflows.](image2)"}

This decline was primarily driven by significant sales drops in the International Operated Markets segment, which saw a 19% decrease in global international operated market revenues (from $5,987 million to $4,826 million), largely due to COVID-19 related restrictions and closures [9, table 5]. In contrast, U.S. sales were relatively stable with only a 2% decline, supported by positive performance despite the pandemic [9, table 5].\n\nRegarding restaurant margins, total restaurant margins fell by 13%, from $15,747 million in 2019 to approximately $13,704 million in 2020 [8, image1]. This decrease was mainly due to lower margins in the International Operated Markets, which experienced a 13% decline (from $9,455 million to $8,519 million) primarily because of reduced sales and the impact of COVID-19, including costs related to employee safety and restaurant operation adjustments [8, 9]. Meanwhile, the U.S. margins remained relatively steady, with a slight increase of 7% in 2020 [3, 9].\n\nThe main contributing factors to these changes include the COVID-19 pandemic's impact, which led to temporary restaurant closures and limited operations, especially in Europe and other international markets [1, 8]. Additionally, increased expenses for safety measures and marketing efforts (like free meals for responders) strained margins despite efforts to stimulate sales [2, 3, 10]. The decline in revenue and margins was also affected by lower sales in company-operated restaurants and reduced gains from restaurant sales disposals, with a notable decrease of $104 million in gains from 2019 to 2020 [7, 8].\n\nIn summary, COVID-19 significantly impacted McDonald's revenues and margins in 2020 through reduced international sales, operational costs related to safety measures, and slower recovery in some markets, leading to a 10% decrease in total revenues and a 13% decline in restaurant margins compared to 2019."}

According to the detailed financial data, the Sky segment saw an impressive increase of approximately 11.4% in revenue, from $3,034 million in 2020 to $3,379 million in 2021, reflecting higher direct network costs and other expenses that were partially offset by declines in programming and production costs [3], [5], with a notable total revenue rise of $345 million. Similarly, NBCUniversal experienced a 6.9% revenue increase, from $2,307 million to $2,466 million, driven by higher expenses across media, studios, and theme parks, indicating growth in these segments [2], [3].\n\nMeanwhile, the Cable Communications segment maintained relatively stable revenue with a marginal increase of 0.7%, from $7,753 million to $7,811 million, though depreciation and amortization expenses increased due to investments in infrastructure and line extensions [8], [2]. The overall revenue improvement from 2020 to 2021 was facilitated by these segment contributions, as evidenced by the waterfall chart illustrating segment impacts, especially the combined boost from NBCUniversal and Sky segments totaling around $8,073 million in incremental revenue contributions [5].\n\nIn terms of operating expenses, the company saw increased costs mainly driven by higher programming and production expenses, especially within the cable, media, and entertainment segments. For example, programming costs surged by 16.1% from 2020 to 2021, reflecting increased content investments [4], [10]. These rising expenses are partly offset by decreases elsewhere, such as corporate and other expenses which dropped significantly from $6 million in 2020 to $147 million in 2021, and are further detailed in segment-specific reports.\n\nOverall, while revenue growth in the Sky and NBCUniversal segments was substantial, the increase in operating expenses—primarily in programming, content, and infrastructure—indicates the company's strategic investment in content and network capabilities across segments. This blended dynamic contributed to overall revenue growth of approximately 12.4% from 2020 to 2021, with segment-specific contributions being the primary drivers in this period [4], [5], [11].\n\n![The waterfall chart visually shows the contributions of various segments to the overall increase in revenue, highlighting NBCUniversal and Sky as major contributors.](image5)"}

Similarly, profit before tax increased from $924 million in 2019 to $1,311 million in 2020, a **$387 million (42%)** rise [4]. The significant reduction in operating losses and the increase in pre-tax profit indicate better cost management and possibly benefits from internal reallocations and risk mitigation strategies, as suggested by the positive variations in segment-specific adjusted revenues and expense reductions seen in the management tables [3][4].\n\nIn contrast, the Global Banking and Markets (GBM) segment showed a decrease in revenue but maintained resilience in profit figures. According to the management view of adjusted revenue, global markets saw a notable increase in revenue by **27%** in 2020 compared to 2019 [image1], driven by gains in FICC and equity trading, with FICC revenues increasing by 33%. However, this revenue growth did not translate into an increase in net operating income or profit before tax explicitly in the provided data. The detailed financial metrics reveal that while net operating income overall improved markedly, the segment-specific profit and return on tangible equity (RoTE) figures remained below risk appetite, with RoTE at **3.1%** in 2020 versus a target of ≥6.5% [images 2 and 4].\n\nFurthermore, the \"Management view of adjusted revenue\" for the segments indicates that Global Markets' revenue grew substantially, but the \"Net operating income\" figure declines from losses close to $(883) million in 2018 to only $(262) million in 2020 [images 4, 3], showed a significant rebound, though the profitability metrics still signal room for improvement.

This indicates that almost all of the company's revenue was derived from the VIEs' operations over these years, underlining their central role in the company's business structure.\n\nIn terms of total assets, the VIEs held assets worth around 26.5% of the group's total assets as of December 31, 2020, increasing slightly to 26.9% in 2021 [6]. The asset composition includes cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, intangible assets, and land use rights, among others [3], showing their importance in operational and financial stability.\n\nLooking at the cash flow data, the image table (image1) reflects a rise in cash and cash equivalents from RMB amount in 2020 to a higher figure in 2021, indicating improved liquidity, which is essential for operational growth. The improved cash flow from financing activities and the changes in cash balance suggest increased financial activity, likely driven by the VIEs' expanding operations.\n\nFurthermore, the consolidated financial data tables (images 2, 3, 4, and 5) demonstrate that the revenue and assets associated with the VIEs and their subsidiaries saw notable increases, contributing substantially to the group's overall financial position. For instance, the detailed earnings table shows strong profitability before taxes, with income from subsidiaries and VIEs being significant components of overall earnings.\n\nOverall, between 2020 and 2021, the VIEs and their consolidated subsidiaries experienced growth in both assets and revenue, with revenues remaining nearly all of the company's entire revenue, and assets slightly increasing proportionally. This suggests intensifying business activities and a robust financial position centered around the VIE structure.\n\n**In summary,** the VIE and its subsidiaries' revenues stayed extremely high and stable, constituting almost total company revenue, while their total assets slightly increased from 2020 to 2021, reflecting ongoing expansion and financial strengthening."}

The stock-based compensation expenses show slight fluctuations: total expenses decreased marginally from $558 million in 2020 to $540 million in 2021, and then slightly declined again to $528 million in 2022 [7]. This steady expense level indicates consistent investment in employee incentives and aligns with stable stock-based compensation programs detailed in the notes, such as stock options, RSUs, and PSUs [1][6].\n\nSimultaneously, the net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble have increased over the same period: from $13.03 billion in 2020 to $14.3 billion in 2021, and reaching about $14.7 billion in 2022 [4]. Correspondingly, the diluted EPS experienced growth from $4.96 in 2020 to $5.50 in 2021, and then to $5.81 in 2022 [4]. These increases in EPS—around 17% from 2020 to 2022—are partly driven by higher net earnings and a reduction in weighted average shares outstanding, optimizing per-share profitability.\n\nFurthermore, despite moderate stock-based expense levels, the company reports increasing net earnings and EPS, reflecting efficient cost management, favorable tax impacts, and positive operational performance. The stability in stock-based awards payouts and recognition, combined with a strategic approach to share repurchases and dilutive effects, supports ongoing earnings growth per share [7][10].\n\nIn summary, the relatively stable but slightly declining stock-based compensation expenses alongside rising net earnings and EPS demonstrate that Procter & Gamble has maintained effective incentive programs while successfully growing its profitability over these years. The company’s prudent management of compensation expenses coupled with consistent earnings growth highlights a balanced financial strategy that sustains shareholder value [7][4][6].\n\n---\n\n![Procter & Gamble's Interest Rate and Market Assumptions](image1)  \n*The table indicates stable and modest interest rate assumptions over the years, supporting consistent valuation and financial planning.*\n\n![Retirement Benefits and Pension Data](image2)  \n*Retirement obligations and net recognized amounts reflect ongoing pension and post-retirement benefit management, which impact overall financial stability.*\n\n![Stock-Based Compensation and Tax Benefits](image3)  \n*Stock compensation expenses remained relatively stable, indicating controlled and predictable incentive costs across the years.*\n\n![Company Financial Performance Highlights](image4)  \n*Procter & Gamble’s net earnings and EPS show steady growth, reinforcing the resilience of its financial performance from 2020 to 2022.*"}

This suggests a small positive change in translation adjustments during the year.  \n\nIn the context of components of income before income taxes, the data indicates significant shifts across regions. According to the regional figures [4], U.S. income before income taxes increased from $5,004 million in 2020 to $8,781 million in 2021, a substantial rise likely driven by factors such as increased revenue or tax benefits. Meanwhile, foreign income before taxes also grew from $715 million to $1,493 million over the same period, showing positive growth internationally.  \n\nThe tables further support these changes with the totals rising from $5,719 million in 2020 to $10,274 million in 2021, reflecting overall higher pre-tax income. These increases are consistent with the detailed regional and segment data—such as the growth in assets and specific income components—although individual components like research expenses or share-based compensation mainly show within-year data, not year-over-year changes [5][6].  \n\nFurthermore, the small foreign currency translation adjustment ($6 million) in 2021 indicates a minimal but positive impact of currency fluctuations on reported income.

This change suggests that, in 2020, Shell Midstream Partners engaged less in capital expenditures and investments, as evidenced by the capital expenditure figures listed — \\$22 million in 2020 compared to \\$35 million in 2019 and \\$51 million in 2018 [3]. The decrease in investments and capital spending likely resulted from project completions, such as the Houma tank expansion and Zydeco drill projects, reducing cash outflows and contributing to the positive net cash flow from investing activities in 2020.\n\nHere is a visual summary of these changes:\n\n![The assets, liabilities, and equity of Shell Midstream Partners, highlighting increased operating income and decreased capital expenditures in 2020 compared to 2019.](image4)\n\nIn summary, Shell Midstream Partners saw a slight increase in operating income driven by revenue components resilient to pandemic-related disruptions, and a reduction in capital expenditures led to a net inflow in cash from investing activities in 2020, reflecting efforts to manage costs and optimize investments amid the economic conditions caused by COVID-19."}

Escondida's revenue increased from approximately $6.7 billion in FY2020 to $9.5 billion in FY2021, while WAIO's revenue surged from around $20.7 billion to $34.3 billion in the same period. Correspondingly, their underlying EBITDA saw substantial rises: Escondida's EBITDA grew from about $3.5 billion to over $6.4 billion, and WAIO's from roughly $14.5 billion to $26.3 billion, highlighting enhanced profitability.\n\nProduction volumes also improved notably. Escondida's copper sales increased from approximately 1,164 kt in FY2020 to an expected 1,000–1,080 kt in FY2022, though some short-term setbacks like reduced material movement impacted output in FY2021. WAIO's iron ore production reached a record 252 Mt, slightly up from 250,598 kt in FY2020, with sales volume at 252 Mt, demonstrating robust operational capacity despite weather challenges and COVID-19-related labor shortages. \n\nThe impact of commodity price changes on their financial performance was substantial. According to the table in image1, a US$1 per ton increase in iron ore prices impacts profit after taxation by US$163 million and underlying EBITDA by US$233 million, indicating high sensitivity. For copper, a US¢1 per pound rise impacts profit after taxation by US$23 million and EBITDA by US$33 million. Both companies benefitted from higher commodity prices, especially iron ore, which significantly boosted WAIO’s revenue and EBITDA, and enhanced Escondida’s revenue through higher realized copper prices (average $130.56 per tonne in 2021 vs. $77.36 in 2020). \n\nOverall, the financial metrics of Escondida and WAIO in FY2021 reflect the positive effects of rising commodity prices and operational efficiency, with WAIO achieving record production and revenue, and Escondida experiencing higher sales and profitability driven by increased copper prices. The significant price impacts underscore the high sensitivity of their financial results to fluctuations in global commodity markets.\n\n![The table shows the financial impact of changes in commodity prices on profit after taxation from continuing operations and on underlying EBITDA, expressed in US$ million.

This suggests an increase in assets measured at fair value using Level 2 inputs, reflecting perhaps market fluctuations or asset revaluations.\n\nConversely, the long-term debt, including the current portion, decreased from around $7,692 million in 2021 to approximately $6,033 million at the end of 2022, as noted in [9]. The data in [3] and related quotes indicate the total long-term debt, which includes various senior notes and other liabilities, was reduced, possibly due to debt repayments like the redemption of $2.3% senior notes in December 2021 (see [6]) and ongoing debt management strategies.\n\nThe visual data in [image4] illustrates that the total long-term debt decreased by over $1.5 billion from 2021 to 2022, from $7,531 million to $6,590 million, considering adjustments and excluding current portions. Meanwhile, the increase in Level 2 assets may reflect market valuation adjustments or asset acquisitions, contributing to a stronger asset base.\n\nIn summary, the company experienced a reduction in long-term debt and an increase in fair value of Level 2 assets from 2021 to 2022, likely due to strategic debt repayment and market or asset value changes.

This positive change was primarily driven by higher operating income, which, after adjustments for non-cash items, contributed significantly to increased cash generated from operating activities, totaling USD 15.1 billion in 2021 versus USD 13.6 billion in 2020 [9][5][9]. Stronger operating performance is evident from the increase in net cash flow from operating activities from continuing operations, as seen in the detailed cash flow tables [2][4].\n\nA key factor supporting the rise in free cash flow was the improved cash flow from operating activities and substantial net cash inflows from investing activities, notably a USD 4.2 billion cash inflow in 2021 compared to a cash outflow of USD 13.1 billion in 2020 [image1][image2]. This indicates a shift from heavy investing cash outflows in 2020 to net inflows in 2021, which partly offset financing outflows. Additionally, lower payments out of provisions, including legal matters, contributed to a more favorable cash flow position [1][8]. Although there was an upfront payment of USD 650 million for in-licensing tislelizumab, this was partly offset by decreased legal expenses and lower provisions, aiding cash flow improvements [1][8].\n\nFurthermore, the company's net debt position improved markedly, shifting from a net debt of USD 24.5 billion at the start of 2021 to a near-zero net debt of USD -0.9 billion by December 31, 2021, indicating effective debt management and cash utilization [image2]. The overall increase in marketable securities and financial assets, along with careful cash flow management in financing activities, also supported the growth in free cash flow.\n\nIn summary, the main contributors to the increased free cash flow from 2020 to 2021 were higher cash generated from operations due to improved profitability and cash flow management, a shift to a net inflow of cash from investing activities, and strategic financial management that reduced net debt levels [1][8][9][image1][image2]."}

In 2021, the change in financial assumptions resulted in a loss of €26 million, whereas in 2020, it caused a significant gain of €72 million [5]. These variations underscore how shifts in financial assumptions, such as discount rates, influence actuarial outcomes. \n\nLooking at the impact of discount rate changes specifically, the tables indicate that a 0.5 percentage point decrease in the discount rate as of September 30, 2021, would increase the defined benefit obligation by €271 million, while a similar change in 2020 increased it by €266 million [3]. This consistent increase reflects that lower discount rates raise the present value of future pension obligations, thereby contributing to actuarial losses.\n\nMoreover, combined, these changes in financial assumptions and discount rates resulted in an actuarial loss of €22 million in 2021, while in 2020, there was a substantial actuarial gain of €67 million [5]. The 2021 loss reflects both the adverse effect of reduced discount rates and potentially other financial assumption shifts, whereas the 2020 gain was driven by favorable movements in financial assumptions, including the discount rate and other factors.\n\n![The table shows actuarial gains and losses with financial assumptions and demographic changes for 2021 and 2020](image5)"}

In 2020, there was a foreign tax benefit of $526 million, and in 2021, it slightly decreased to $518 million [3]. This slight decline suggests the company experienced a reduction in foreign tax benefits or credits over this period.\n\nMeanwhile, the foreign income before taxes also changed notably. Although specific values for foreign income before taxes are not explicitly provided in the straightforward summaries, the overall financial figures indicate a growth in total foreign earnings, rising from approximately $439 million in 2019 to about $1,493 million in 2021 (as per the combined foreign figures in the income statement table) [4]. This positive trend suggests an increase in foreign operations' profitability.\n\nThe interplay of these changes impacts the company's financial strategy significantly. The reduction in foreign tax benefits may reflect the company's adjustments following regulatory changes, such as the derecognition of deferred tax assets tied to intellectual property transfers, as well as potentially less favorable tax incentives. Meanwhile, increased foreign income indicates a strategic focus or success in expanding international markets, which could motivate the company to reassess its tax planning and optimize future tax benefits.\n\n---\n\n![The company's foreign earnings increased significantly, and despite a slight decrease in foreign tax benefits, overall foreign income improved, prompting a re-evaluation of tax strategies](image4)\n\nIn conclusion, between 2019 and 2021, the company experienced a notable rise in foreign income before taxes with a slight decrease in foreign tax benefits, influencing its future tax planning and resource allocation for international operations."}

As shown in [image1], the total WFAM assets at the beginning of 2020 were $508.8 billion, and despite inflows and market impacts, the sale of WFAM on November 1, 2021, resulted in a substantial reduction of the managed assets. Specifically, the sale impact was $(587.1) billion, which caused the overall AUM to decline considerably by the end of 2021. The detailed data in [image1] indicate a sharp decrease in total assets following the sale, confirming a significant contraction in WFAM's managed assets during this period.\n\nConcurrently, in the securities portfolio, the composition and unrealized gains associated with AFS securities also changed between 2020 and 2021. According to [image4], the amortized cost of AFS securities decreased from $215,533 million in 2020 to $175,463 million in 2021, primarily due to sales or disposals. The net unrealized gains on AFS securities also declined notably, from $4,859 million in 2020 to $1,781 million in 2021, reflecting the impact of higher interest rates and possibly securities sold or reclassified. The sum of these factors indicates a reduction both in the size and unrealized gains of AFS securities, aligning with the broader asset rebalancing efforts by the bank.\n\nTherefore, from the end of 2020 to the end of 2021, Wells Fargo experienced a considerable decrease in WFAM managed assets due to the sale of the business, and its available-for-sale securities portfolio also shrank in terms of value and unrealized gains, reflecting strategic portfolio adjustments and market conditions [1][8][4]."}

From the balance sheet perspective, total assets increased from approximately $432.7 billion in 2020 to about $449.6 billion in 2021, representing an approximate rise of $17 billion [3, Table 3]. This growth was partly driven by an increase in available-for-sale (AFS) debt securities, which moved from $215.5 billion to $175.5 billion in amortized cost, and a slight increase in total loans, which grew by about $7.7 billion from $887.6 billion to $895.4 billion [2, Table 2; 4, Table 4].\n\nIn parallel, the assets under management within Wells Fargo Asset Management (WFAM) experienced a significant decline, mainly due to the sale of WFAM announced in late 2021. Specifically, the WFAM assets under management decreased markedly because of a $587.1 billion sale of assets on November 1, 2021, reducing the total managed assets from $603.0 billion (beginning of period) in 2021 to a lower end-of-year figure [5]. Before the sale, inflows and market impact led to temporary increases in WFAM’s assets, but the sale fundamentally restructured the firm's strategic focus.\n\nThis shift indicates that Wells Fargo was reallocating its assets, decreasing reliance on managed assets via WFAM—likely to streamline operations, reduce risk exposure, or focus on core banking activities—aligning with a strategic retreat from certain market segments. Meanwhile, growth in loans, especially the commercial portfolio, suggests an emphasis on traditional lending to support customer credit needs, possibly in response to demand surges or market opportunities during 2021.\n\nFurthermore, the reduction in unrealized gains on debt securities and the repositioning of the securities portfolio reflect a prudent approach to interest rate and liquidity risk management under shifting economic conditions, notably higher interest rates that reduced unrealized gains [2, Figure 2; 8]. Overall, these changes imply that Wells Fargo’s financial strategy in 2021 increasingly focused on solidifying core banking operations, managing risk more conservatively, and divesting from broader asset management activities to better align with evolving market and economic environments.  \n\nIn summary, the modest growth in total assets combined with the significant reduction in WFAM-managed assets highlights a strategic pivot towards core banking activities, emphasizing risk control and asset rebalancing over expansive asset management, thereby shaping Wells Fargo’s financial trajectory in 2021."}

Notably, the **United States** has a higher discount rate of 2.7% in 2021 compared to 1.9% in the **United Kingdom**, reflecting differences in economic conditions and market yields. In **Germany**, specific to the actuarial assumptions (Image5), Siemens employs Germany-specific tables based on local demographic data, though exact percentage figures are not provided here for comparison. This higher discount rate in the U.S. indicates lower present values of future liabilities relative to regions with lower rates.\n\nRegarding the **actuarial assumptions**, the U.S. utilizes the **Pri-2012 generational mortality projection**, which accounts for future improvements in mortality, whereas **Germany** relies on Siemens-specific demographic tables (Siemens Bio 2017/2021), tailored to German population data and local health trends. The difference in assumptions reflects regional variations in expected longevity and mortality improvements.\n\nThe **financial assumptions** show a significant variation. Image2 exhibits a stark contrast in **financial assumptions** for 2021: a negative €26 million impact due to changes in financial assumptions, whereas in 2020, these assumptions contributed positively with +72 million euros. These shifts highlight market volatility and the sensitivity of plan valuations to financial market movements, which impact the **asset ceiling effects** and overall pension obligations.\n\nConcerning **demographic assumptions** (Image5), Germany uses Siemens-specific mortality tables, whereas in the U.S., the Pri-2012 projection from SSA is employed, indicating different methodologies for estimating future mortality trends impacting pension liabilities. The demographic assumptions in each country shape long-term projections and mediate the risks related to longevity.\n\nIn summary, **the United States’** defined benefit plans are modeled with higher discount rates and standardized mortality assumptions, reflecting robust financial markets and specific demographic data. In **Germany**, assumptions are tailored to local data, with comparatively lower discount rates, meaning that pension obligations may appear higher in present value terms. The observed shifts between 2020 and 2021 highlight the influence of market volatility and evolving demographic projections on pension liabilities.\n\n---\n\n![The US uses higher discount rates and standardized mortality projections, reflecting different assumptions compared to Germany](image4)\n\n> The images show that the U.S. has higher discount rates and employs SSA demographic assumptions, whereas Germany uses Siemens-specific tables, illustrating regional differences in actuarial assumptions.\n\nThis comprehensive analysis underscores that regional economic conditions, mortality expectations, and market yields heavily influence the valuation and management of defined benefit plans in both countries."}

Despite this decrease, the profit before tax was even more affected, dropping by 74% to around $1.9 billion (from $7.2 billion in 2019), as shown in the first text [7].\n\nIn the Global Banking segment, revenue decreased marginally by 2% (from approximately $3.87 billion in 2019 to $3.80 billion in 2020, as seen in image5), but the profit before tax declined more significantly by 7% to about $4.83 billion from $5.17 billion [2]. This suggests that while revenue was relatively stable, increased credit losses and operational expenses had a larger impact on bottom-line profitability.\n\nIn the Markets division, which benefited from strong market performance, adjusted revenue increased by 27% (to approximately $7.29 billion), largely driven by FICC and equities trading activities (see image5). Consequently, the net operating income in this segment sharply increased by 60% to about -$262 million in 2020 from -$654 million in 2019 [4][5], showing a significant recovery in trading profitability. However, the profit before tax in the Markets segment increased from about $924 million to approximately $1.31 billion, reflecting a positive impact of market conditions despite some residual impairments.\n\nSegments like Global Liquidity and Cash Management experienced substantial revenue declines (-30%), and while the net operating income figure isn't directly comparable, the overall profit before tax likely suffered proportionally, as indicated in the first and third texts. The increased expected credit losses (ECL of $4.8 billion in 2020, up from $1.2 billion in 2019) and higher impairment charges (see quote [4]) significantly impacted profitability across segments, especially in credit-intensive areas.\n\nIn conclusion, while some segments like Markets showed notable growth in adjusted revenue and improved net operating income, most segments faced declines, with profit before tax suffering disproportionately due to increased credit and operational costs.

Conversely, time deposits and non-U.S. interest-bearing deposits decreased substantially by 41% and 44%, possibly reflecting actions to manage the asset cap and reduce interest-sensitive liabilities, as suggested in the notes [5] and [10].\n\nOn the loan side, as shown in the second image, total loans increased from approximately $887.6 billion to $895.4 billion, an overall rise of about $7.8 billion.  \n![{Loan maturity and interest rate structure details}](image2)  \nCommercial loans grew, driven by higher demand in the commercial and industrial sector, leading to increased originations and draws, especially in the short-term segment (within one year), and a significant portion of loans with variable interest rates. Consumer loans, however, slightly decreased, partly due to a transfer of mortgage loans to loans held for sale. The decrease in consumer mortgages (including first and junior liens) reflects a strategic shift or risk management in that segment, possibly influenced by low interest rates and the asset cap management strategies.\n\nThe asset management actions, including the reduction in interest-sensitive time deposits and non-U.S. office deposits, suggest the bank is actively managing its liabilities to stay within regulatory asset caps and optimize its interest expense, aligning with the strategy hinted at in notes [5] and [10].\n\nOverall, the bank appears to be focusing on increasing core, noninterest-bearing deposits to support higher loan activity, especially in commercial lending, while downsizing riskier or interest-sensitive liabilities.

However, by 2021, it rose again to roughly $34,708 million, indicating a recovery and growth to pre-pandemic levels [9].\n\nLooking deeper into the segment-specific performance, the first table's data reveals that the company's revenue and expenses fluctuated partly due to market recovery post-COVID, increased programming costs, and investments in infrastructure. These factors could have affected profitability differently across segments. For example, increased spending on scalable infrastructure and content likely contributed to higher operating costs, impacting EBITDA margins [2][3].\n\nThe second image shows that the company's non-cash expenses like depreciation and amortization remained relatively stable across the years, but the total adjusted EBITDA was influenced by changes in operating income, which rose from $17,493 million in 2020 to $20,817 million in 2021, indicating an improved earnings base [10].\n\nMoreover, the third and fourth tables illustrate growth in revenue components like direct-to-consumer streaming and advertising, with significant increases in streaming revenue in 2021, which could have positively impacted EBITDA in that year. Conversely, some costs, such as programming and network costs, also increased, possibly tempering EBITDA growth.\n\nIn summary, the improvements in Adjusted EBITDA from 2020 to 2021 were driven by a combination of revenue growth in segments like streaming and advertising, recovery from COVID-related declines, and strategic cost management. The marginal decline in 2020 reflected pandemic-related disruptions and cost reductions initiated earlier. The overall positive trend in 2021 suggests effective adaptation and expansion across key segments, contributing to a strong EBITDA performance."}

This sharp decline was mainly due to the prolonged low-interest-rate environment, as indicated by the text stating that \"interest rates on our substantial holdings of cash and U.S. Treasury Bills declined over the second half of 2019 and throughout 2020\" [2], and that the company maintains \"ample liquidity\" with safety prioritized over yield.\n\nThe asset allocation data from the tables further complicates the picture. The assets invested in cash, cash equivalents, and U.S. Treasury Bills increased markedly from $67,082 thousand in 2020 to $90,688 thousand in 2021 (a rise of approximately 35%), as shown in image1. While this increase in cash holdings supports liquidity, these short-term, low-yield assets yielded less interest income amid low interest rates.\n\nConversely, the investments in equity securities increased from $269,498 thousand to $334,907 thousand, reflecting a shift towards more equities, which typically generate returns through dividends and capital appreciation rather than interest. Notably, the unrealized gains on investment assets in the securities (as shown in image4) increased, indicating some appreciation in the investment portfolio, but this does not immediately translate into interest income.\n\nAdditionally, even though dividend income increased modestly in 2021 (by 3.5%), the overall net investment income still declined because interest income—a major component—was profoundly impacted by the low-interest-rate environment. The investments in fixed maturity securities actually decreased from $20,317 thousand to $16,386 thousand, possibly reflecting both a reshaping of the portfolio towards higher-yielding assets and a response to the lower interest rates.\n\nIn summary, the factors contributing to the decline include persistently low interest rates suppressing earnings from cash and fixed-income securities, despite an increased allocation to cash. The asset allocation aligns with a strategy of prioritizing liquidity and safety during a low-yield period, which explains the sharp decrease in interest income even as total assets increased and dividend income modestly rose overall.\n\n![The table presents financial data for an insurance company over three years, showing increases in cash holdings and securities investments, reflecting shifts toward more liquidity and equities in response to low-interest rates](image1)\n\nIn conclusion, the decline in net investment income from 2020 to 2021 was mainly due to the environment of persistently low interest rates affecting interest income, despite a strategic asset allocation emphasizing liquidity and safety."}

These non-cash adjustments slightly reduced the comprehensive income, as seen with an other comprehensive loss of $(2) million in 2019 and $(1) million in 2020, down from no recorded amount in 2018 [1, image1].\n\nThe main contributing factors to these changes include:\n\n- **Increase in Net Income:** The partnership's net income grew due to higher income from equity method investments, primarily from acquisitions like Explorer and Colonial, which contributed an additional $44 million in 2020 compared to 2019 [1]. Total net income also benefitted from operational performance reflected in the cash flow and income statement data, reaching $556 million in 2020 [1, image3].\n\n- **Other Comprehensive Loss:** Slight losses in remeasurement of pension and postretirement benefits reduced total comprehensive income, though these are non-cash and related to accounting methods for investments [1].\n\n- **Operational and Investment Activities:** The partnership's income growth was supported by increased investment income from equity interests and distributions, as individual asset performance and strategic acquisitions positively impacted overall profitability [1, images 1 and 3].\n\n- **Stable Noncontrolling Interests:** The deductions attributable to noncontrolling interests remained relatively stable, ensuring that a consistent share of income translated to the partnership [1, images 1 and 3].\n\nIn summary, from 2018 to 2020, both net income and comprehensive income attributable to the partnership showed a positive trend, primarily driven by increased investment earnings and strategic acquisitions, with minor offsets from non-cash accounting adjustments related to pension and benefit remeasurements.\n\n![The financial summary table showing rising net income and comprehensive income over 2018-2020](image1)"}

Similarly, unallocated expenses such as research and development, selling, general, and administrative expenses also decreased overall, though these remained substantial, with R&D expenses decreasing from about $989 million in 2019 to $1,820 million in 2021, reflecting an increase in R&D spending despite the overall trend of reductions in some categories [1].\n\nIn comparison, the net assets acquired during the NUVIA acquisition in 2021 amounted to approximately $1,264 million, comprising assets like cash, IPR&D, goodwill, and other assets, with liabilities offsetting this value [4].

This higher operating cash flow was driven primarily by lower net cash tax payments and reduced contributions to pension and retiree medical plans, enabling the company to generate more cash from its core operations. Correspondingly, free cash flow—which is a non-GAAP measure—also grew by around 15%, from \\$5.6 billion in 2019 to \\$6.4 billion in 2020 [2, image1]. This increase suggests that PepsiCo managed its cash flows more effectively despite significant investment activities.\n\nRegarding investments, the company’s net cash used for investing activities rose dramatically from about \\$6.4 billion in 2019 to nearly \\$11.6 billion in 2020 [2, image4]. A major factor was the substantial cash paid for acquisitions, notably \\$3.85 billion for Rockstar, \\$1.2 billion for Pioneer Foods, and \\$0.7 billion for Be & Cheery [3]. Despite the increased investment outflows, the company maintained strong free cash flow, implying efficient cash management.\n\nOn the financing side, the net cash from financing activities shifted from an outflow of about \\$8.5 billion in 2019 to an inflow of approximately \\$3.8 billion in 2020 [2, image4].

The shift in financing activities to issuing more debt helped support these investments and shareholder returns. Its extensive contractual commitments underpin its ongoing obligations, and while they are sizable, they are managed within the company’s financial planning framework. Overall, 2020 saw a strategic balancing act—strengthening liquidity and cash flows while managing large, long-term commitments—when contrasted with the prior year's figures.\n\n![The table displays financial data comparing 2020 and 2019, highlighting increased net cash from operating activities and free cash flow in 2020](image1)"}

This growth was primarily driven by an increase of $1,562 million (27%) in total revenue within Global Markets, notably in Fixed Income, Currencies, and Commodities (FICC), where revenues from foreign exchange, rates, and credit surged significantly, reflecting heightened client activity and wider spreads [4, image4]. The FICC segment saw a 33% rise in revenue, with a 90% increase in credit trading, demonstrating stronger trading performance despite the challenging environment.\n\nIn contrast, the Global Banking division's revenue decreased slightly by 2%, mainly due to lower real estate, structured finance fees, and losses on legacy restructuring positions, although some areas like capital markets and corporate lending experienced growth [4]. This indicates a mixed contribution to the overall net operating income where trading gains offset declines in traditional banking fees.\n\nProfits before tax for the entire group declined notably by 7%, from $5,172 million in 2019 to $4,830 million in 2020 [3, image5]. Contributing factors to this decrease include higher expected credit losses (ECL), which increased by over 200%, reflecting the economic fallout from Covid-19, and accounting impairments such as software and goodwill write-downs totaling $1.3 billion in 2020 [1]. The group’s expected credit losses rose by $6.1 billion, reaching $8.8 billion, driven by the uncertain economic outlook, especially in regions like Europe, MENA, North America, and Latin America [2, 3].\n\nFurthermore, the overall profit reduction was affected by lower revenue across various sectors, a decline in net interest margins (down 26 basis points to 1.32%), and higher credit impairment charges, despite some cost-saving measures reducing operating expenses slightly [2, 8].

The widespread postponement of elective and routine care during mid-March to April 2020 led to reduced care volumes in fee-for-service arrangements and lower demand for some services. Furthermore, increased unemployment and economic hardship caused a decline in commercial and global coverage, as evidenced by decreases in risk-based and fee-based coverage—*Risk-based commercial decreased by 8%, and fee-based commercial dropped by 5%* [3]. On the other hand, certain segments like Medicare Advantage and Medicaid expanded their coverage, with *Medicare Advantage increasing by 8%* and *Medicaid by 12%*, driven by states easing redetermination requirements and growth in dual enrollments [3], [9].\n\nIn summary, while some segments like Medicare Advantage and Medicaid grew due to policy shifts and pandemic-related factors, others, notably commercial and global segments, experienced declines due to the economic impact and deferred care during 2020.

Similarly, for **Other Retiree Benefits**, it rose from **3.1% to 3.2%** during the same period [4, image4]. An increasing discount rate generally results in a lower present value of future benefit obligations because future liabilities are discounted more heavily. Accordingly, this likely contributed to a **decrease in the benefit obligation**, which is reflected in the **change in the net amount recognized**—for Pension Benefits, the net recognized amount improved from **$(5,428) million** in 2021 to **$(2,435) million** in 2022, indicating a reduction in liability or remeasurement gains accumulating in AOCI [5, image5].\n\nRegarding the **expected return on plan assets**, the figures show a decrease for both benefit types.

This schedule reflects agreements made up to that point, including lease obligations expected in future years. The total lease liabilities of $273 million encompass these future payments, less the imputed interest ($30 million), aligning with the lease obligations recorded on the balance sheet.\n\nFrom the textual data, notably [7], \"Future un discounted lease payments for our operating lease liabilities,\" this suggests that the company calculates and discloses the estimated future lease payments, which would have been different in 2018, as lease standards and specific commitments evolve over time.\n\nGiven that the 2019 future lease payments are $303 million (as per the schedule in image5), and considering initial lease obligations often increase as new lease agreements are signed or existing agreements mature, it is reasonable to infer that the future lease payments in 2018 were less than those in 2019, especially since the company entered into new facility leases in 2019 (noted in [10]) with future payments of approximately $58 million, and the overall lease liabilities increased in 2019.\n\nIn summary, **the detailed tables show that the total future lease payments were approximately $303 million at the end of 2019**, which is an increase compared to the previous year's anticipated obligations, as the company expanded its lease commitments and adopted the new lease accounting standard. Although the 2018 specific figure isn't directly provided in the tables, the observed increase in future lease payments from 2018 to 2019 is indicated by the escalation in lease commitments, new lease agreements, and the reporting standards' adoption, resulting in higher recognized lease liabilities and related future payments in 2019.\n\n**In conclusion, the total future lease payments increased from 2018 to 2019, with the 2019 schedule showing anticipated payments of around $303 million, reflecting an upward change in lease obligations.**"}

This decline represents a reduction of roughly \\$29.8 billion. The main factors contributing to this change can be understood by looking at the detailed components of equity and the relevant financial activities reported in the provided quotes and tables.\n\nAccording to the second image, ExxonMobil's share of equity was affected by various activities: issuance, repurchases, earnings, dividends, and other comprehensive income. Despite the company earning around \\$14.3 billion in 2020, dividends paid to shareholders exceeded this earnings amount, with \\$14.7 billion distributed as dividends, which contributed to the decline in total equity [9]. Additionally, share repurchases reduced the number of outstanding shares, as shown in the text details about stock buybacks in 2019 and 2020 [5][6], further affecting the equity structure.\n\nFrom the first quote, we learn that equity was impacted by both positive and negative factors, including foreign exchange translation effects and variations in postretirement benefit reserves. Specifically, in 2020, the foreign currency translation effects increased equity by \\$1.4 billion and a \\$1.4 billion change in postretirement benefits reserves reduced it, balancing out some impacts but overall not offsetting the net decline caused by earnings versus dividends.\n\nFurthermore, the detailed financial statements in images 4 and 5 highlight operational, investing, and financing cash flows that influence overall financial health, indirectly affecting equity value.

This indicates a steady decline, which can limit audience engagement and monetization opportunities. \n\nSimultaneously, the average revenue per customer monthly increased from $56.09 in 2019 to $59.29 in 2021, reflecting an 8.7% actual rise even amid a slight decline in total customer relationships, as viewers potentially increased their spending per relationship [image2]. However, the reduction in overall customer relationships may have constrained growth potential, despite higher revenue per user.\n\nFinancially, the impact of these trends is evident in the revenue figures. NBCUniversal’s revenue grew notably from 2019 to 2021. The comprehensive revenue increased from about $1.6 billion in 2019 to approximately $3 billion in 2021, a 51.9% rise [table three]. However, despite higher revenue, Adjusted EBITDA turned negative in 2020 and remained so in 2021, reflecting increased operating costs and expenses, which grew by 59% from 2020 to 2021 [table three].\n\nThe decline in customer relationships suggests challenges in audience retention, which, despite higher per-user revenue, may have limited overall revenue growth in some segments. The rising revenue, fueled partly by content licensing and advertising, and the increase in average revenue per user, helped boost total revenue overall. Yet, escalating expenses and costs associated with content and operational investments offset some gains, leading to continued negative EBITDA.\n\nIn summary, while NBCUniversal managed to increase its total revenue substantially from 2019 to 2021, declining customer relationships and rising costs hampered profitability. Higher per-user spending mitigated some adverse effects, but the overall trend points to challenges in maintaining audience size while scaling revenues and controlling costs.

In contrast, in 2020, the pandemic heavily impacted market conditions, as described in [4], which likely affected the valuation and assumptions underlying goodwill, especially since store closures and restrictions would have impacted the profitability of acquired entities.\n\nLooking at the balance sheet details in image1, we observe that the \"Foreign exchange translation differences\" for the related component changed from (6) in 2020 to 1 in 2021, indicating a slight positive variation attributable to currency fluctuations affecting the net goodwill balance. The total balance increased marginally from 201 (2020) to 202 (2021), implying preservation rather than substantial growth in goodwill components.\n\nFurthermore, [9] clarifies that goodwill from franchise contracts relates to intangible assets that did not meet IFRS 3 criteria for separate recognition, mainly because they didn't generate expected future cash flows. This underscores that in both years, goodwill components connected to franchise agreements may not have significantly changed if new acquisitions or terminations did not occur.\n\nIn summary, the differences in goodwill components between 2021 and 2020 appear minimal in terms of gross balances, but the assumptions underlying their valuation, particularly regarding future cash flows and currency impacts, evolved due to the pandemic's effects in 2020 and the recovery in 2021. The balance sheet balances shown in images support this understanding, with minor fluctuations in the overall goodwill-related figures over the period.\n\n![The table displays a slight increase in balance balances and currency translation differences impacting goodwill](image1)\n\nThus, the key difference lies in the assurance and valuation assumptions—2021 showing stable goodwill supported by ongoing profitability, whereas 2020 was more affected by pandemic-related market disruptions affecting the fair valuation of goodwill."}

According to the summarized revenue figures, total revenue increased from approximately $13,282 million in 2019 to $17,098 million in 2020, reflecting a significant overall growth rate. Although the specific revenue for the 'Salesforce Platform and Other' segment isn't directly specified, its contribution likely grew proportionally with the total revenue increase, especially given the ongoing expansion across cloud services.\n\nRegarding the cost of revenues, the company's total costs rose from about $3,451 million in 2019 to $4,235 million in 2020, an increase of $784 million. The costs associated with subscription and support services, which include the platform, grew by $594 million (from $2,604 million to $3,198 million), representing the majority of the total increase in cost of revenues. This rise aligns with the company's strategy to scale cloud services by investing in data center capacity and expanding customer support, as described earlier.\n\nThe overall impact on financial performance shows that both revenue and costs for the platform segment increased significantly. While higher revenues indicate strengthened market acceptance and expanded customer base for the platform services, the rise in costs suggests increased investments in infrastructure and personnel to sustain this growth. The net effect likely improved gross margins partially due to shifts toward cloud services with higher margin profiles, as indicated in the text, which benefits overall profitability despite higher operational expenses.  \n\n![A summary of the increased revenue and costs in cloud services, highlighting the growth in 'Salesforce Platform and Other' segment](image3)"}

Specifically, operating lease liabilities fell from $3,906 million to $3,503 million, indicating a decline in the company’s outstanding obligations under operating leases. Meanwhile, finance lease liabilities decreased from $633 million to $497 million, illustrating a similar downward trend in finance lease obligations. This overall reduction suggests that the company has been actively managing and possibly reducing its future lease obligations over the year.\n\nIn terms of lease costs, the total lease costs (sum of operating and finance lease costs) decreased slightly from $2,596 million in 2020 to $2,265 million in 2021 — a reduction of about $331 million. Breaking this down further, operating lease costs declined from $2,551 million to $2,199 million, and finance lease costs increased marginally from $45 million to $66 million. The reduction in operating lease costs reflects lower expenses associated with operating lease agreements, aligning with the decrease in operating lease liabilities. Conversely, the slight increase in finance lease costs might be attributed to changes in lease-specific factors such as interest rates or lease terms.\n\nReferring to the detailed lease payment obligations table (image1), we see that future lease payment obligations for operating leases decreased in the first few years, with 2022 payments reducing from $1,054 million in 2021 to lower amounts in subsequent years, and similarly for finance leases. This indicates an active effort to reduce lease commitments.\n\nThe cash flow data (image5) also supports this, with operating cash flows from operating leases decreasing from $1,744 million in 2020 to $1,670 million in 2021, suggesting lower cash expenditure related to lease payments during the year.\n\nOverall, between 2020 and 2021, the company demonstrated a clear trend of reducing lease liabilities and lease costs in both operating and finance leases, likely through lease terminations, early repayments, or renegotiations, resulting in lower future obligations and expenses.\n\n![](image1)  \n*Detailed future lease payment obligations decreased in 2021, particularly for operating leases, indicating active lease management.*"}

Beginning with loans, as shown in **Table 8.4** and summarized in the detailed balance sheet data, there was a notable overall decrease in total loans by approximately **$30.2 billion (14%)**, dropping from $211.4 billion in 2020 to $181.2 billion in 2021[4, 8, image4]. \n\nThis substantial decline was driven by lower demand for loans across various segments, especially in commercial and industrial lending, which decreased by **$22.9 billion (-16%)**, and in commercial real estate, which declined by **$5.2 billion (-10%)**. The decrease mainly occurred because paydowns exceeded new originations, with some segments impacted by temporary curtailments such as in home mortgage originations and PPP-related small business loans[8]. The contraction reflects ongoing high client liquidity, reduced borrowing needs, and cautious lending amid economic uncertainty.\n\nMeanwhile, in terms of deposits, there was an increase of about **$30.2 billion (about 14%)**, rising from $211.4 billion in 2020 to roughly **$241.6 billion in 2021**[4, image4]. This growth was chiefly due to higher deposit balances driven by increased liquidity and savings among customer groups. Factors fueling these deposits included government stimulus programs, such as direct payments and payment deferral options, which contributed to the accumulation of cash reserves during the pandemic’s economic uncertainty phase[4, 6]. The elevated deposit levels helped support overall liquidity and were partially offset by lower investment spending.\n\nIn essence, **the decrease in total loans** was largely attributable to lower loan demand, high client liquidity, and prudent lending strategies during ongoing economic volatility. Conversely, **the increase in deposits** resulted from accumulated liquidity stemming from government stimulus measures and payment deferrals, reflecting heightened economic uncertainty and customer precautionary savings[1, 4, 6].\n\nHere's a visual summary to complement this explanation:\n\n![The table provides data on decreased loans in key segments like commercial and real estate, and increased deposits driven by government stimulus and client liquidity](image4)"}

This rise indicates the institution's risk-weighted assets allocated to credit exposures grew by about **$44,382 million** (Standardized) and **$56,003 million** (Advanced). Consequently, higher RWAs imply that the institution had to hold more capital to meet regulatory capital ratios. \n\nSimultaneously, the **External TLAC as a percentage of RWA** increased from **49.9% in 2019** to **47.7% in 2020** [5], though it remained well above the regulatory minimum of 18%. Despite a slight decrease in the percentage point, the absolute External TLAC amount grew from **$196,888** to **$216,129 million**. This indicates the institution maintained or increased its loss-absorbing capacity, but the proportion of TLAC relative to RWA slightly decreased, suggesting a relative shift where RWAs grew faster than TLAC levels proportionally.\n\nEmbed: ![External TLAC as a percentage of RWA decreased slightly from 49.9% to 47.7%, but the absolute TLAC increased, indicating a solid buffer despite rising RWAs](image5)\n\nThe rise in Credit Risk RWA means the institution needed to hold more capital against its credit exposures, potentially impacting its capital ratios and operational flexibility. At the same time, maintaining a high ratio of TLAC relative to RWA ensures sufficient loss-absorbing capacity to support stability and meet regulatory requirements. \n\nOverall, these dynamics suggest that from 2019 to 2020, the institution strengthened its capital buffer in absolute terms through increased TLAC, despite the proportional decline relative to RWA. This strategic balance helps preserve its financial resilience amid increasing risk exposures, but the growth in RWAs underscores a need for careful capital management to sustain regulatory compliance.\n\nIn conclusion, the increase in Credit Risk RWA necessitated higher capital allocations, while the mostly stable, high ratio of External TLAC to RWA indicates a deliberate effort to bolster loss-absorbing capacity relative to rising risk exposures—collectively reflecting a strengthened yet carefully managed capital structure."}

For instance, compensation and benefits expenses increased by 11% in 2020, partly due to gains in revenues and performance-based compensation, and increased expenses related to deferred compensation linked to investment performance [6], [8].\n\nLooking ahead, the firm projects a substantial future compensation obligation, with estimates of deferred awards to be recognized beyond 2022. Specifically, the firm expects $680 million to be recognized in 2021, $312 million in 2022, and an additional $609 million beyond 2022, summing to an estimated total future obligation of approximately $1,601 million [image5].\n\nIn summary, over the past three years, both deferred cash awards and overall compensation expenses have steadily increased, driven by performance-based incentives and strategic growth initiatives, with sizable projected future obligations still to be recognized.\n\n---\n\n![The financial data shows a consistent increase in deferred awards and total compensation expenses from 2018 to 2020](image1)"}

However, despite this modest increase in gross profit, GBS's pre-tax income dropped significantly by 16.8%, declining from $1,623 million to $1,351 million. The pre-tax margin also decreased from 9.5% to 8.3%, a reduction of 1.2 percentage points, indicating lower profitability overall. Notably, the gross profit margin increased by 2.0 points, suggesting improved efficiency in generating gross profit relative to revenues, but this was offset by higher pre-tax expenses, leading to the net decline in pre-tax income.\n\nOn the other hand, GTS faced more pronounced declines across its financial results. As shown in the detailed table, GTS's external revenue decreased by 5.7%, from $27,361 million in 2019 to $25,812 million in 2020. The gross profit similarly declined by 5.7%, from $9,515 million to $8,975 million, with the gross profit margin remaining stable at 34.8%. However, the pre-tax income experienced a dramatic decrease of 92.9%, falling from $1,645 million to just $117 million, and the pre-tax margin plummeted from 5.8% to 0.4%, illustrating a severe reduction in profitability. The substantial decline in pre-tax income was likely driven by lower client volumes and economic pressures, even though the segment saw growth in cloud revenue, as indicated in various quotes.\n\nHere are summarized interleaved visuals that support these conclusions:\n\n![The table shows the financial decline in GTS's external revenue, gross profit, and pre-tax income from 2019 to 2020, with pre-tax income falling sharply by 92.9%.](image1)  \n*GTS's pre-tax income drastically decreased year over year.*\n\n![A second table depicts a slight increase in GBS gross profit, a decrease in pre-tax income, and a marginal change in gross profit margin, highlighting mixed results despite some efficiency gains.](image4)  \n*GBS's gross profit improved marginally, but pre-tax income declined significantly.*\n\nIn conclusion, both segments faced earnings pressures, with GTS experiencing a more severe profitability decline than GBS, which managed some efficiency improvements despite reduced pre-tax outcomes."}

This sharp decrease primarily resulted from a substantial drop in interest income, which fell by $19,747 million between 2019 and 2020, largely due to lower interest rates amidst the economic impact of COVID-19 ([4], [5]). Conversely, interest expense decreased by $5,627 million during the same period, reflecting reduced deposit costs and other interest-bearing liabilities ([4], [5]).\n\nIn comparison, from 2018 to 2019, net interest income showed a modest increase, driven by higher interest income on assets such as loans and securities, while interest expense remained relatively stable or slightly increased ([4], [5]).\n\nThese financial shifts mirror the organizational structure of Bank of America, which is segmented into divisions like Consumer Banking, Global Wealth & Investment Management, Global Banking, and Global Markets (see image 2). The decline in interest income during 2020 was significantly influenced by reduced interest rates across all segments, especially within retail and consumer lending sectors managed by Consumer Banking. The organizational separation clarifies how different units contribute to and are affected by macroeconomic trends: for example, Consumer Banking's interest revenue on loans and deposits decreased sharply ([8], [1], [4]), reflecting lower rates and increased credit provisioning during this period.\n\nFurthermore, changes in interest expense, such as reduced deposit costs, happened across both domestic and international deposits, contributing to the overall decrease in net interest expense ([4], [5], [8]). The organizational structure, with its diverse divisions, allowed Bank of America to strategically manage these costs by adjusting funding and asset portfolios across segments, especially during the economic downturn.\n\nIn summary, the major differences are: \n\n- A sharp reduction in interest income and net interest income from 2019-2020 compared to a modest change from 2018-2019, driven by lower rates and economic conditions. \n- A concurrent decrease in interest expense, partly offsetting the income decline. \n\nThis reflects how the bank’s segmented structure enables it to respond dynamically to economic shifts within its various operational divisions, influencing both income generation and expense management.\n\n![The organizational chart of Bank of America showing divisions, including Consumer Banking, Global Banking, and Global Markets](image2)"}

Specifically, the net investment income decreased from approximately $5,039 million in 2020 to $4,807 million in 2021, reflecting a reduction of about 4.6% [10]. This decrease was primarily driven by significantly lower interest and other investment income, which fell from $1,059 million in 2020 to $589 million in 2021—a drop of 44.4% [6][2]. The decline in interest income mainly resulted from lower yields on cash, short-term investments, and fixed maturity securities due to persistently low interest rates during this period.\n\nSimultaneously, the asset composition of the insurance business shifted notably. According to the asset table, the total invested assets increased from approximately $363.1 billion at the end of 2020 to about $446.3 billion at the end of 2021, an increase of roughly 22.8% [image1]. The most significant change within these assets was in equity securities, which grew from $269.5 billion to $334.9 billion, an increase of about 24.2% [image1]. Conversely, fixed maturity securities decreased from $20.3 billion to $16.4 billion, a decrease of roughly 19.2% [image1].\n\nThe implications of these trends are multifaceted. The reduction in interest income suggests that, despite the increasing asset base, the insurance entity faced lower yields on its investments, likely due to prolonged low-interest-rate environments. The substantial growth in equity securities indicates a strategic shift toward more volatile assets, which can yield higher returns but also increase earnings volatility, as evidenced by the significant unrealized gains of approximately $76.4 billion reported at the end of 2021 [9]. Overall, while the expanding asset base enhances the insurer's capacity to generate future income and meet obligations, the decrease in income from interest-bearing securities underscores the importance of diversification and risk management to offset the impact of low yields.\n\n**In summary**, from 2020 to 2021, the insurance business saw a decline in net investment income mainly due to lower interest income, despite a substantial increase in total invested assets and a marked shift toward higher, more volatile equity securities. This change in asset composition suggests a strategic attempt to pursue higher returns in a low-yield environment, though it also introduces increased potential for investment volatility and earnings fluctuations."}

According to the detailed financial data, the upstream segment experienced considerable losses in 2020, with US operations reporting a loss of $1.6 billion and international operations a loss of $825 million, contrasting sharply with the substantial profits in 2021—$7.3 billion in the US and $8.5 billion internationally. Similarly, the total upstream earnings went from a loss of $2.4 billion in 2020 to a profit of nearly $15.8 billion in 2021, reflecting a strong recovery driven largely by higher realizations of crude oil prices, increased sales volumes, and the absence of impairments [1][5][6].\n\nOn the other hand, Chevron's downstream operations, which include refining and marketing, also saw dramatic improvement. In 2020, downstream earnings were nearly nil or slightly negative, but in 2021, U.S. downstream earnings surged to $2.4 billion, with international downstream earning $525 million—both a stark contrast to their 2020 figures. This surge was mainly due to higher refining margins and increased sales volumes, as well as improved currency effects [2][3][9][10].\n\nThese robust improvements in both segments contributed to Chevron’s net income soaring from a loss of $5.5 billion in 2020 to a record profit of approximately $15.6 billion in 2021. The positive trend in upstream profits, coupled with the rebound in downstream performance, critically underpinned the overall strong financial results, markedly reversing the downturn experienced during 2020 which was affected by lower commodity prices and pandemic-related disruptions. \n\nIn summary, while 2019 presented moderate profits, 2020 was a year of losses impacted by a sharp decline in global energy prices, and 2021 marked a robust recovery driven by higher crude realizations and improved refining margins, leading to a substantial increase in Chevron's overall net income.  \n![Chevron's production and reserves from 2019-2021](image3)"}

For instance, in the analysis of market risks, it is detailed that increases and decreases in market interest rates generally result in inverse changes in the fair values of various instruments, including these options [3]. Specifically, the detailed table in image2 illustrates that, as of December 31, 2021, a 100 basis point (bp) increase in interest rates caused the fair value of equity index put options to decrease from $99 million to $94 million—a ($5 million) change—while a 100 bp decrease slightly increased their fair value to $105 million. Larger shifts, like 200 or 300 bp, produce proportionate changes, reflecting the sensitivity of these derivatives to interest rate movements.\n\nThis sensitivity exists because the valuation of options is affected by market interest rates through discounting models and the intrinsic value of the contracts. When interest rates rise, the present value of future liabilities or obligations generally declines, decreasing the liability associated with these options, and vice versa when rates fall.\n\nIn contrast, the effects of non-U.S. denominated debt on net earnings differ markedly between 2020 and 2021. According to the table in image5, the net impact of non-U.S. denominated debt on net earnings was a gain of $955 million in 2021, compared to a loss of $(764) million in 2020. This indicates that foreign currency exchange rate movements caused a positive effect on earnings in 2021 due to favorable currency translation or exchange rate changes, whereas in 2020, the effect was negative, reducing net earnings. These disparities are driven by fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, which affect the translated value of foreign currency debt held by the company.\n\nThe differences highlight that while interest rates primarily influence the valuation of derivatives like equity index options—as seen in the sensitivity analysis—foreign exchange rate movements impact the translation of foreign currency debt, affecting net earnings directly, as evidenced by the substantial shift from a loss in 2020 to a gain in 2021.\n\n![The table shows that interest rate changes affect the fair value of equity index put options, with higher interest rates decreasing their value and lower interest rates increasing it, and the impact of foreign currency translation on net earnings shifted from a loss in 2020 to a gain in 2021](image2)"}

By 2021, it significantly rebounded to around $2.4 billion [9], indicating a strong recovery and growth in profitability. This shift was primarily driven by higher margins on refined product sales—an increase of approximately $1.6 billion—as well as higher earnings from the 50% owned CPChem and increased sales volumes, although these gains were partially offset by higher operating expenses [9].\n\nInternational downstream earnings, on the other hand, fell from about $618 million in 2020 to an estimated $525 million in 2021, showing a decrease in profitability [5]. The decline was largely due to lower margins on refined product sales—totaling around $330 million—and increased operating expenses approximately $100 million, even though foreign currency effects partly offset these increases positively [5]. While international downstream earnings remained profitable in 2021, their growth was less robust compared to the U.S. sector.\n\nThe significant factors affecting these changes include shifts in refining margins, operational expenses, and foreign currency impacts.

Starting with uncertain tax positions, the balance decreased significantly from $303 million in 2019 to $89 million in 2020 [3, 7]. This reduction largely results from the company’s tax settlements and adjustments, including a substantial ($249 million) reduction for the effective settlement of a depreciation-related uncertain tax position in 2020, which also reversed $46 million of accrued interest [7]. These actions indicate an resolution of prior tax uncertainties, leading to a lower overall tax liability reserve.\n\nRegarding fair value assets and liabilities, the data shows shifts consistent with market valuation changes and portfolio adjustments. The total fair value of assets measured at fair value increased from approximately $5,213 million in 2019 to about $5,961 million in 2020, an increase driven mainly by higher U.S. government securities and corporate obligations, as well as changes in cash equivalents [2, 9, 10, image5]. Assets like U.S. government securities grew from $2,338 million to $4,394 million, reflecting increased holdings or valuation changes [image5]. Similarly, cash and cash equivalents, or short-term investments, showed fluctuations, influenced by market conditions and operational needs.\n\nOn the liabilities side, the fair value of long-term debt as of December 31, 2020, was estimated at $7.78 billion, compared to the carrying amount of $6.80 billion [9]. This indicates a rise in fair market value, consistent with fluctuating interest rates and market conditions influencing debt valuation. The use of Level 2 inputs—broker quotes and observable market data—confirms that valuation adjustments are grounded in recognized market data, although the market conditions between 2019 and 2020 led to these valuation shifts.\n\nIn summary, from 2019 to 2020, the company's uncertain tax positions decreased significantly due to resolutions and tax benefits received, while the fair value of its assets increased, notably in government securities and investments, accompanied by higher estimated fair values for long-term debt, reflecting changing market conditions and portfolio management strategies.\n\n---\n\n![The table provides financial data related to tax positions over the years 2018, 2019, and 2020.

In 2020, revenues rose to approximately $44.33 billion from $40.99 billion in 2018 [7]. Although operating expenses also increased, the growth in revenue outpaced expenses, resulting in higher operating income ($6.51 billion in 2020 compared to $5.89 billion in 2018) [7].\n\nA key factor influencing comprehensive income improvements was the reduction in negative components such as non-operational losses. For instance, components of other comprehensive income such as foreign currency translation losses, which were substantial in 2018, improved considerably in 2020, with the $197,696 million gain indicating positive currency translation effects or hedging gains [7]. Additionally, changes in defined benefit plans, cash flow hedges, and investments contributed positively to comprehensive income, as shown by the shift from losses to gains in these components.\n\nDividend payments, share repurchases, and share-based compensation expenses also played roles in shaping the equity position but had less direct impact on net and comprehensive income figures themselves.

Meanwhile, its pre-tax income declined by 12.4% to about $7.81 billion, with the pre-tax margin dropping 5.2 percentage points to 30.4%, indicating some profitability pressures within the segment, possibly due to ongoing strategic investments and costs associated with integrating Red Hat and advancing cloud offerings [2].\n\nIn comparison, Global Business Services (GBS) experienced a modest growth in external gross profit, increasing by 3.0% to $4.66 billion, along with an improvement in gross profit margin by 0.8 percentage points to 27.7%. Its pre-tax income rose slightly by 1.3% to $1.62 billion, with margins remaining stable at 9.5% [4].\n\nThe divergent results primarily stem from the strategic focus of IBM on advancing hybrid cloud and AI capabilities, which boosted revenue and gross profit in Cloud & Cognitive Software but also entailed higher strategic investments and costs, leading to a decline in pre-tax income margins. Conversely, GBS's performance was driven by a favorable mix shift toward higher-value offerings, operational efficiencies, and delivery productivity improvements, helping sustain its profitability alongside steady revenue growth [5,6].\n\n![IBM Cloud & Cognitive Software's growth and profitability challenges in 2019](image2)"}

According to the data, shipment volumes for cigarettes decreased by approximately 11.8%, from 72,293 million units in 2019 to 63,749 million units in 2020, while heated tobacco units increased by over 50.8% but from a much smaller base (299 million to 451 million units) [9]. This decline in cigarette volume contributed to a drop in net revenues by about 22.9% (from $2,206 million to $1,701 million), even after adjusting for currency effects, which further reduced the revenue growth rate [4].\n\nFinancial activity changes, such as decreased net cash used in investing activities (from $(1,811) million in 2019 to $(1,154) million in 2020), and lower capital expenditures, suggest that PMI was adapting its manufacturing infrastructure in response to declining industry volumes and shifting consumer preferences towards smoke-free alternatives [3]. Meanwhile, PMI's net cash provided by operating activities saw a modest decline, but higher net earnings (excluding non-cash charges) and operational efficiencies helped increase operating income by 100%, from $235 million in 2019 to $564 million in 2020 [7][4].\n\nFurthermore, the financial summaries indicate that despite lower revenues, PMI managed to improve operating profitability, partly due to cost management and strategic restructuring efforts. The reduction in shipment volumes likely contributed to the decline in revenue but was partly offset by increased profitability from operational efficiencies and the shift in product mix towards heated tobacco and smoke-free products. The overall cash flows reflect a strategic focus on optimizing investments and maintaining cash position, despite industry volume declines.\n\nIn summary, the decline in shipment volumes in Latin America & Canada, driven by lower cigarette demand, contributed to reduced revenues, but PMI's strategic financial activities, including managing investments and operational efficiencies, helped sustain and even enhance its operating profitability during 2020."}

This substantial rise reflects higher revenues from various sources such as mortgage banking, equity securities, and asset-based fees, alongside decreased credit losses and expenses [6].\n\nRegarding the balance sheet data, both **loans** and **deposits** experienced notable changes over the same period. The **average loans** in the Consumer Banking and Lending segment increased from 2019 to 2020 but then decreased slightly or remained flat into 2021, partly due to paydowns exceeding originations and specific actions like curtailing certain mortgage and home equity loans [9]. Specifically, the total **home lending** loans were impacted by actions taken in 2020 to reduce mortgage originations, which likely led to a decline or stabilization in 2021. The **auto loans** and **credit card** balances showed similar trends, with paydowns outpacing new originations in some areas.\n\nOn the deposits front, **total deposits** increased over this period, primarily driven by higher liquidity and savings, partly due to government stimulus programs and payment deferrals linked to COVID-19 uncertainties [3]. Across all years, deposits grew, underpinning the increased deposit-related fees and offering enhanced liquidity for consumer banking operations.\n\nIn summary, from 2019 to 2021:\n- **Net income** surged from a lower base (implied from 2020's $3.4 billion to over $21 billion in 2021), reflecting improved revenue streams and credit quality.\n- **Loans** in consumer segments increased initially but were impacted by strategic actions and paydowns, especially in mortgage and small business segments.\n- **Deposits** increased significantly, bolstered by economic stimulus and pandemic-related savings behaviors, providing a strong liquidity position for the bank. \n\nThis evolution underscores the resilience and adaptability of the Consumer Banking and Lending segment amid changing economic conditions.\n\n---\n\n**![Financial summary for 2021 highlighting net income and key loans and deposits](image1)**"}

This increase in interest income, despite a slight decrease from 2020 to 2021 (from $967 million to $1,011 million), indicates an overall improvement in interest revenue generated from the larger loan portfolio.  \n\n![The table shows that average Card Member loans grew steadily from 2019 to 2021, while net interest income increased, reflecting better interest yield despite lower interest rates and higher paydowns](image2)  \n\nThese changes imply that, although the company issued more loans and thus increased its interest-earning assets, the net interest income's growth was somewhat moderated by factors like lower interest yields and higher loan paydowns. The increase in loans contributed positively to revenue streams, but lower yields and higher paydown rates—evident from decreasing net interest yields—damped the potential for even greater income.

This increase was primarily driven by the issuance of new shares for the acquisition of Varian, which boosted issued capital by €53 million and capital reserves by €2,275 million, as well as retained earnings growth [10], [3]. The overall equity rose further due to net income, offsets from dividend payments, and treasury share acquisitions [3], [10].\n\nOn the liabilities side, total current liabilities grew from €1,936 million in 2020 to €3,104 million in 2021. Major contributors included an increase in other current financial liabilities (from €93 million to €263 million), higher current provisions (from €270 million to €356 million), and increased current income tax liabilities (from €374 million to €468 million) [3]. Non-current liabilities similarly surged from €969 million in 2020 to €2,686 million in 2021, mainly due to a substantial rise in deferred tax liabilities, which jumped from €470 million to €2,082 million [4].\n\nThe rise in liabilities was partly attributable to increased debt financing, with Siemens Healthineers securing additional credit facilities and loans to support acquisitions and working capital needs, as detailed in the updated outlook and financing notes [6], [7].

According to the financial statements, in 2021, the company issued $1.6 billion of preferred shares (Series D) at a fixed rate of 3.550%, which contributed a substantial inflow under financing activities, boosting cash from financing sources. This issuance led to an increase in preferred shares outstanding, as reflected in the shareholders’ equity section, where preferred shares remained at 1,600 shares, but the issuance increased the overall equity attributable to preferred stock [2].\n\nIn contrast, the company also redeemed preferred shares in 2021, notably $850 million of Series C and $750 million of Series B shares, which resulted in cash outflows under financing activities, decreasing the company's cash reserves ($14,933 million used in financing in 2021). These redemptions reduced the preferred shares outstanding, which is reflected in the equity section where the preferred shares balance remained the same as that of previous years, assuming these were repaid without new issuance or adjustment in the preferred share count.\n\nIn 2020, the company both issued and redeemed preferred shares. The issuance involved preferred shares at $1.6 billion, which increased cash inflow and shareholders’ equity through the preferred shares account. Meanwhile, preferred shares redeemed in 2020 would have caused an outflow of cash and a reduction in preferred stock holdings. These actions are reflected in the detailed equity table, where preferred shares remained consistent at 1,600 shares, but the issuance and redemption activity affected additional paid-in capital and total shareholders’ equity [2], [5].\n\nIn summary, the issuance of preferred shares provided a source of cash and increased preferred shareholders’ equity, while redemptions resulted in cash outflows and a decrease in preferred shares’ component of shareholders’ equity.

Starting with the assets, according to the consolidated balance sheet data in [image3], the total assets for the company increased from 2020 to 2021. Although specific numerical values are not explicitly provided here, the general trend indicates a growth in assets across segments, such as increases in property, plant, and equipment, inventories, and receivables. This growth suggests that the company possibly expanded its operational capacity or accumulated more receivables and inventory to support higher sales and revenue levels observed in 2021, like the consolidated revenues reaching approximately $50.97 billion in 2021, compared to previous years.\n\nIn terms of cash flow from operating activities, [image2] reveals a significant increase in cash generated by operations, with the consolidated operating cash flow rising from $4,054 million in 2020 to approximately $7,177 million in 2021 [4], [9]. This substantial boost, which is roughly a 76% increase, underscores improved operational performance, possibly driven by higher profits, better working capital management, or increased sales volumes.\n\nThe implications of these changes are multifaceted. Increased total assets often indicate business growth, such as capacity expansion or strategic investments, which can position the company for future revenue streams. The elevated cash flow from operations enhances liquidity, enabling the company to fund capital expenditures, reduce debt, or return value to shareholders. Moreover, such cash flow strength suggests efficient core operations and effective management of working capital components like receivables and inventories, as detailed in [2], [9].\n\nHowever, the growth in assets combined with increased operational cash flow also emphasizes the importance of maintaining operational efficiency and prudent asset management to sustain profitability and liquidity. If assets are not managed well, they could become a burden, but the data suggests that the company’s increased cash flow and asset base are signs of healthy growth and effective operational performance.\n\n**In summary**, from 2020 to 2021, the company's total assets increased, likely supporting higher sales and revenues, while the significant rise in cash flow from operating activities indicates improved operational efficiency and liquidity, which are crucial for sustaining growth, managing liquidity risk, and funding future ventures."}

The primary contributors to this reduction were decreases in **investment securities**, from $21,631 million to $2,591 million, and a decrease in **cash and cash equivalents**, from about $32.97 billion to $22.03 billion. The significant reduction in cash and securities suggests substantial cash outflows, likely related to loan growth and share repurchases, as indicated by the cash flow statement.\n\nCorrespondingly, total liabilities fell slightly from **$168,383 million in 2020** to **$166,371 million in 2021**, a decrease of about **$2 billion**. The main components include a decrease in **long-term debt** from approximately $42.95 billion to $38.68 billion, reflecting debt repayments or refinancing, and minor changes in customer deposits and other liabilities.\n\nRelating these changes to comprehensive income and cash flows, the net income rose dramatically from **$3,135 million in 2020** to **$8,060 million in 2021**, which is a considerable increase in profitability. The cash flow statement underscores this with net cash provided by operating activities increasing from **$5.59 billion** in 2020 to **$14.65 billion** in 2021, largely due to higher net income and adjustments like provisions for credit losses and non-cash expenses. This heightened operating cash flow contributed to the reduction in assets through loan growth and share repurchases, despite the decrease in securities holdings.\n\nFurthermore, comprehensive income, especially in **accumulated other comprehensive income** (which includes unrealized gains/losses and translation adjustments), shifted from a negative balance of around **$(2,895) million** in 2020 to about **$(2,945) million** in 2021, reflecting fluctuations in unrealized debt securities gains and currency translation effects. Although not the sole driver, these shifts in comprehensive income highlight the effects of market value changes and foreign currency translations on the company's equity, intertwined with the asset valuations.\n\nIn summary, the company's total assets decreased slightly, primarily due to asset reallocations and repayments, while net income and operating cash flows improved significantly in 2021.

Conversely, in the same region, heated tobacco unit shipments surged by 57.9%, increasing from 12,569 million units in 2019 to 19,842 million units in 2020, indicating a rapid adoption of heated tobacco products within the EU [image5].\n\nLooking at Eastern Europe, the data shows a relatively stable total shipment volume with a slight increase of 0.2% overall [1], driven mainly by a substantial increase in heated tobacco units. Specifically, Eastern Europe’s heated tobacco shipment volume grew notably, with countries like Russia and Ukraine leading the expansion, partly offset by declines in cigarette shipments in those countries [7]. In fact, higher heated tobacco unit shipment volume was reported across Eastern Europe, driven by markets such as Russia and Ukraine, which saw increased uptake of heated tobacco products. Meanwhile, cigarette shipments in these countries decreased, reflecting some shift from traditional cigarettes to heated tobacco units in the region [7].\n\nAdditionally, market share figures show that PMI's share in the EU and Eastern Europe remained relatively stable overall, with minor declines in cigarette market shares but significant increases in heated tobacco market share, especially in the EU where HEETS (a heated tobacco product) gained 1.7 points in market share from 2.5% to 4.2% [5]. This underscores a growing consumer preference shift toward heated tobacco in these regions, aligned with the increased shipment volumes.\n\nIn summary, from 2019 to 2020:\n\n- **In the EU:** Cigarette shipment volumes decreased by 6.3%, whereas heated tobacco units increased by 57.9%, with heated tobacco gaining substantially in market share (from 2.5% to 4.2% [5]).\n- **In Eastern Europe:** Cigarette shipments declined or remained stable with some decrease, but heated tobacco shipment volumes rose sharply, especially in countries like Russia and Ukraine, reflecting a notable shift toward heated tobacco products at the expense of traditional cigarettes.\n\nThis shift indicates evolving consumer preferences in these markets, favoring heated tobacco products over traditional cigarettes."}

Specifically, the gross amounts grew due to gross increases in current year tax positions—$487 million in 2018, then increasing to $416 million in 2020—as well as gross increases in prior year tax positions, notably a jump to $120 million in 2020 from just $87 million in 2018. These increases reflect ongoing uncertainty and potential future tax liabilities related to the company's tax positions, although some reductions occurred via settlements and lapses of statutes of limitations.\n\nRegarding the company's common share repurchases, in 2019 and 2020, the repurchase activities had notable effects on the company's financial structure.

For example, the depreciation expense recognized for leasehold improvements was part of the overall depreciation charges reported under AASB 16, which significantly impacts the carrying amount over time [1][4]. Impairments and exchange rate movements also affected these assets, notably in 2020, where impairment losses were recorded, decreasing their book value [4].\n\nRegarding hardware and software, their initial costs, accumulated depreciation, and impairments are outlined in the detailed asset tables. Depreciation policies specify a 3-year useful life, leading to systematic reduction in their book value across the year, with depreciation charges directly reducing their carrying amounts. For example, in 2020, serial annual depreciation and impairment charges further decreased their book value, with exchange rate effects adding or subtracting to the assets' recorded value [4].\n\nThe right-of-use assets, established mainly under AASB 16 adoption, saw substantial initial recognition. The initial right-of-use assets recognized at transition (around $138 million) were increased by new lease additions and re-measurements due to lease modifications, extending or adjusting lease terms, and decreased by depreciation charges for the year [1][5][10]. For instance, the recognition of $48,793,000 in additions and a re-measurement of $1,698,000, offset by depreciation of $37,454,000, resulted in a net change, culminating in a closing balance of approximately $150.5 million [5][10].\n\nIn summary, the primary factors contributing to these changes include:  \n- **Additions** for new leases or assets acquired, increasing the balances [1][5].  \n- **Depreciation and amortization** reducing carrying amounts systematically over the assets’ useful life [1][4].  \n- **Impairments** and other re-measurements, often driven by reassessment of recoverable amounts or lease modifications [4].  \n- **Exchange rate movements** affected asset values denominated in foreign currencies [4].  \n- **Re-measurements of lease liabilities** and adjustments to lease terms, impacting right-of-use asset amounts [1][5][10].\n\nOverall, these combined influences resulted in the net decrease or increase in the carrying amounts of leasehold improvements, hardware and software, and right-of-use assets across the fiscal year 2020, with detailed changes shown in the respective asset and liability schedules.\n\n![The assets include leasehold improvements, hardware, software, and right-of-use assets, which change over time due to depreciation, additions, impairments, and re-measurements](image4)"}

The overall effective tax rate decreased significantly from 41% in 2019 to 9% in 2020, and further to 12% in 2021, reflecting adjustments in tax benefits and provisional estimations.\n\nAnalyzing the detailed tables, we observe that the **total tax provision (effective tax expense)** declined markedly from $3,095 million in 2019 to $521 million in 2020, and then rose again to $1,231 million in 2021. The sharp decrease in 2020 is largely attributable to the derecognition of deferred tax assets associated with the distribution of intellectual property in 2018-2019, which resulted in a significant tax benefit of approximately $2.5 billion recorded in 2019. Conversely, the increase in 2021's tax provision is partly due to adjustments in tax estimates and ongoing examinations.\n\nThe **components of tax benefits** also shifted. In 2019, substantial benefits stemmed from the derecognition of deferred tax assets and the establishment of new deferred tax assets, particularly related to intra-company intellectual property transfers, contributing to a high effective tax rate of 41%. By 2020, many of these benefits were reversed or adjusted, leading to a lower effective rate of 9%, and the total tax benefit realization reduced accordingly.\n\nFurther, the **unrecognized tax benefits** increased from $217 million in 2019 to $1,705 million in 2020, then rose slightly to $2,136 million in 2021. This suggests continued uncertainties and potential liabilities from ongoing tax audits and disputes, especially considering the sizeable amounts reserved for transfer pricing examinations and refunds in Korea.\n\nLastly, the overall data indicates a trend of the company actively managing its tax positions through various credits, deferred assets, and provisional estimates, with notable impacts from legislative changes and tax audits. Despite fluctuations, Qualcomm maintains significant unrecognized tax benefits and reserves, reflecting a cautious approach towards uncertain tax positions.\n\n![Tax provisions and benefits overview](image3)  \n*The table displays tax provision components and their fluctuations from 2019 to 2021.*"}

According to the table detailing WFAM assets under management [image5], the sale resulted in a marked reduction of approximately $587.1 billion in WFAM AUM at the end of 2021, which was a major factor in the overall decline from previous years. Prior to the sale, WFAM managed a broad portfolio including money market funds and other assets, with total AUM at $603.0 billion at the start of December 2021, but the sale's impact caused a notable decrease, illustrated by the outflows and sale impact figures.\n\nThis sale not only reduced the AUM but also affected the company's broader financial performance, as seen in the income statement and balance sheet summaries. The income statement data [image1], highlights a substantial increase in noninterest income to $10,036 million in 2021 from $4,916 million in 2020, driven largely by gains on the sale of WFAM, which recorded a $269 million gain [4]. Simultaneously, total revenue increased by 59%, while net interest income decreased, reflecting changing interest environments and lower loan balances.\n\nOn the balance sheet side [image3], total assets and loans experienced changes, albeit less dramatically, with assets slightly declining or fluctuating due to asset sales and portfolio adjustments. The sale of WFAM also contributed to lower asset-based fees, which are part of the noninterest income reduction from divested businesses, though the sale itself generated significant gains that offset some of these declines.\n\nIn summary, the sale of WFAM caused a substantial decrease in managed assets by around $587 billion, drastically reducing AUM and associated fees. It also led to notable gains recognized in income, reflected as a $269 million profit, and influenced the balance sheet by reducing total assets and changing asset composition. These changes demonstrate the company's strategic shift away from a separate asset management business, reshaping its asset profile and income sources accordingly."}

Specifically, net interest income fell from an earlier higher figure to $43.4 billion in 2020, driven primarily by lower interest rates, which reduced the income earned on various interest-earning assets like loans, securities, and deposits [6].\n\nThis decrease in interest income was partly offset by a reduction in interest expenses, which declined by $5,627 million from 2019 to 2020. The decline was largely due to lower interest paid on interest-bearing deposits and borrowed funds, stemming from a fall in interest rates and a strategic effort to reduce funding costs [2][6].\n\nThe net interest spread—the difference between the yield on earning assets and the rate paid on liabilities—was negatively affected. On one hand, the yield on assets decreased significantly, for example, the net interest yield on a fully taxable equivalent (FTE) basis dropped by 53 basis points to 1.90% in 2020 [6]. On the other hand, the decline in interest expenses was not proportional enough to offset the drop in income, resulting in a compressed net interest spread.\n\n![The organizational chart displays the Bank of America’s divisions, showing the placement of segments like Consumer Banking, Global Wealth & Investment Management, and others, which are involved in various types of lending and deposit activities that influence interest income and expenses](image1)\n\nThe main contributing factors to the narrower net interest spread include the overarching decline in interest rates, which directly lowered yields on loans and securities, and the reduction in funding costs due to decreased interest paid on deposits and borrowings. The deployment of excess deposits into securities and an extra interest accrual day also played roles, but overall, the lower rates had the most substantial impact, leading to decreased interest income at a faster rate than the decrease in interest expense [6].\n\nIn summary, the sharp decline in net interest income from 2019 to 2020, driven mainly by falling interest rates on assets, combined with a more modest reduction in interest expense, resulted in a narrower net interest spread, indicating decreased profitability from traditional banking interest activities during that period."}

Specifically, the increase was aided by a $3,076 million boost in sales volume and nearly $932 million in improved price realization, while reductions in manufacturing costs and SG&A/R&D expenses contributed positively [1].\n\nSimilarly, the quarterly comparison (image5) shows that the fourth quarter's operating profit grew from $1,380 million in Q4 2020 to $1,611 million in Q4 2021, supported by increased sales volume and price realization and decreased manufacturing costs. These factors collectively contributed to a healthier profit margin even within a shorter period [10].\n\nIn terms of cash flow, the data (image2) highlights that the cash flow from operating activities for the consolidated entity increased from about $6.90 billion in 2020 to approximately $7.20 billion in 2021, an improvement primarily driven by higher profits adjusted for non-cash items, along with favorable working capital changes like reduced payments for incentive compensation [5]. The Machinery, Energy & Transportation segment reported generating $6 billion in free cash flow in 2021, aligning with its targets and underpinning the segment's robust operational cash generation capabilities [6].\n\nLooking specifically at the ME&T segment, the table summaries and notes imply that its profit increased by $363 million in 2021, largely influenced by higher sales volume and favorable pricing, despite higher manufacturing costs, which partially offset the gains [9]. Correspondingly, the cash flow from operating activities within ME&T was positive and increased relative to 2020, supporting reinvestment and shareholder return strategies.\n\nIn sum, in 2021, Caterpillar experienced significant growth in operating profit — both on a full-year and quarterly basis — fueled by higher sales and efficiencies.

According to the data provided, the gross unrecognized tax benefits were $1,423 million at the beginning of 2020, rising to an ending balance of $1,829 million. This increase of $406 million was primarily driven by gross increases in current and prior year tax positions, which added $416 million and $120 million respectively, while gross decreases in prior year positions, settlements, and lapse of statutes of limitations reduced benefits, with net effect ending in a higher level of uncertain tax positions [3, 7].\n\nConcurrently, the company's common share repurchases decreased significantly in terms of aggregate cost, dropping from $5,500 million in 2019 to $4,250 million in 2020.

The overall revenue growth reflects higher end-user demand and improved dealer inventory strategies across regions, contributing to a 23% increase in total sales and revenues from $11,235 million in Q4 2020 to $13,798 million in Q4 2021 [1, 5].\n\nThe operating profit improved by $231 million, rising from $1.380 billion in Q4 2020 to $1.611 billion in Q4 2021, as depicted in [image4]. Several factors contributed to this increase, including higher sales volume, favorable price realization, and a reduction in manufacturing costs, which decreased by $816 million, helping offset increased expenses related to higher labor costs, SG&A, and R&D investments [7, 10].\n\nRegionally, North America and EAME experienced sales increases of 29% and 24%, respectively, driven by higher end-user demand and changes in dealer inventories, which generally decreased during 2020 but remained relatively flat or increased during 2021, reflecting a recovery in market demand [4, 8, 9, 10]. Moreover, segments like Construction Industries and Resource Industries experienced significant revenue growth of 27%, supporting overall higher sales volumes. The financial segment also saw a substantial profit increase by 27%, indicating stronger financial services support, contributing positively to the overall profit margin.\n\nIn summary, increased sales volume was driven by stronger end-user demand, strategic inventory management by dealers, regional market recoveries, and favorable pricing.

The cash dividends reduced retained earnings and overall equity, reflecting a return of value to shareholders. Simultaneously, the company’s activity related to treasury stock—purchasing shares at cost—decreased the number of outstanding shares, affecting earnings per share and stockholder shareholding patterns. \n\nLooking at the detailed equity data, Chevron repurchased treasury shares, which is evident from the movement in treasury stock at cost. This share buyback activity reduces total equity attributable to shareholders because treasury shares are deducted from stockholders’ equity. Specifically, the treasury stock account shows an increase in cost, indicating shares were bought back, thereby decreasing the company's equity available to shareholders.\n\nOn the cash flow side, the 2021 consolidated cash flow statement reveals that financing activities—primarily share repurchases—used significant cash, totaling approximately $23 billion net outflow. This outflow includes the expenditures on treasury stock. The cash dividends distributed to shareholders also contributed to cash outflows under financing activities, further reducing cash reserves for the year.\n\nIntertwining the evidence, the corporate strategy in 2021 appears focused on returning value through dividends and share buybacks.

The strategy involved expanding into key markets such as the UK, France, the USA, and exploring new regions through pilot programs, with the aim of scaling in international territories [5, 8].\n\nThe supporting data from the regional growth table shows that the total number of international store sites increased markedly, as the total counts grew from 250 in 2016 to 435 in 2020—a 74% increase over four years. This expansion reflects the company's effective efforts in opening new stores and establishing its brand presence globally. Notably, the company’s focus on securing prime locations in high-traffic shopping centers and its nimble approach to entering new markets facilitated this rapid expansion [10].\n\n![The table displays the regional store counts from 2016 to 2020, showing substantial growth across all regions](image2)  \n*The regional store count increased from 250 in 2016 to 435 in 2020, indicating robust international expansion.*\n\nFurthermore, Lovisa's strategy to leverage existing international territories and explore new markets through pilot programs, combined with trends in opening a higher number of stores overseas, directly impacted its international footprint. Their focus on brand proliferation, social media engagement, and agility in market entry also supported this sustained growth [5, 6].\n\n**In summary, Lovisa's international expansion strategy led to a considerable increase in its global store count, expanding from 250 stores in 2016 to 435 in 2020, thereby establishing a significant presence in multiple new territories.**"}

During 2020, the lease liability increased by $50,245 thousand due to new leases and re-measurements, then decreased by $31,886 thousand as lease payments were made, leading to an ending balance of $167,154 thousand. Re-measurements, totaling $1,559 thousand, reflect adjustments related to lease term changes or modifications, and the effect of exchange rate movement reduced the liability by $1,092 thousand. Importantly, the lease liability was recognized on the balance sheet, representing the firm’s obligation to make future lease payments, consistent with AASB 16’s single on-balance sheet model [10].  \n\nConcurrently, for employee benefit liabilities, the impact of the transition was primarily the recognition of wages, salaries, and annual leave provisions expected to be settled within 12 months, totaling $4,092 thousand in 2020 ([3]). There is no indication of a direct reassessment related to the transition itself in the employee liabilities, suggesting that the benefits continued to be measured at undiscounted amounts, as outlined in [1]. Their primarily current nature implies that the transition mostly affected lease accounting, with employee benefits remaining largely consistent, aside from standard accruals.  \n\nIn conclusion, the adoption of AASB 16 in 2020 resulted in the recognition of a significant lease liability of $167,154 thousand, a shift from previous off-balance-sheet operating leases, and affected the company's reported liabilities significantly. Employee benefit liabilities were relatively unaffected by the transition, maintaining their usual measurement basis.  \n\n![The table displays financial data related to lease liabilities for the year 2020, showing a rise to $167,154 thousand following initial recognition and re-measurements](image1)"}

However, when we look at the core non-GAAP measure, which adjusts for various items such as restructuring charges, impairments, and fair value adjustments, the performance shows a smaller growth of just 2% [4].\n\nAnalyzing the influencing factors, several elements contributed to these changes. For the GAAP measure, the slight increase reflects the underlying organic growth and favorable impacts from pricing and volume adjustments [8], but negative impacts from acquisitions and divestitures, such as a -2% adjustment, partially offset this [8]. For the non-GAAP core measure, the adjustment factors included impacts of restructuring and impairment charges, inventory adjustments, and fair value changes [4]. Specifically, at PBNA, these adjustments likely included costs related to restructuring, impairment charges, or inventory fair value adjustments, which can reduce the core measure’s growth rate relative to the GAAP measure.\n\nAdditionally, foreign exchange impacts and divestments were less significant for PBNA, with a -2% impact from acquisitions/divestitures noted in the table [8], and no mention of foreign exchange effects directly impacting PBNA in the cited data. Overall, the core non-GAAP measure growth being smaller than the GAAP reported growth indicates that non-recurring or items affecting comparability slightly dampened the core performance growth for PBNA between 2019 and 2020.\n\n![The table shows financial data for PBNA with a 4% reported % change and a 2% organic growth, impacted by adjustments for restructuring, impairments, and fair value changes](image1)\n\nIn summary, the GAAP measure for PBNA increased by 4%, while the core non-GAAP measure increased by only 2% from 2019 to 2020, influenced mainly by adjustments for restructuring, impairment charges, and inventory fair value changes [4][8]."}

Although this decline indicates marginally lower cash generated from core operations, the company still maintained substantial operating cash inflows in both years. The decrease was partly offset by a reduction in the negative effects of currency movements and increased net earnings [2].\n\nIn contrast, investing activities showed a significant improvement. The net cash used in investing activities decreased from $1.9 billion in 2019 to $1.2 billion in 2020, a reduction of approximately $700 million [table2]. This decline was mainly due to lower capital expenditures ($852 million in 2019 vs. $602 million in 2020) and the deconsolidation of RBH, which had previously resulted in large cash outflows [9]. The decrease in cash used for investments boosted the overall cash position.\n\nConversely, financing activities resulted in a net outflow of about $8.5 billion in 2020, slightly higher than $8.06 billion in 2019 [table3]. This substantial cash outflow included dividend payments, debt repayments, and payments to noncontrolling interests, which reduced the cash balance. Nonetheless, the effect of currency exchange rate gains (notably $258 million in 2020) partly offset these outflows.\n\nConsidering these factors collectively, the net increase in cash and cash equivalents was $420 million in 2020, up from a $245 million increase in 2019 [table3]. Despite the significant outflows from financing activities, the reduced investments and sustained operating cash flows more than offset the negative financing cash flows.\n\nFinally, the beginning cash balance in 2020 was $6,865 million, which increased to an ending balance of $7,285 million, reflecting the aggregate impact of these cash flows [table3]. Similarly, in 2019, the ending cash balance was $6,865 million starting from $6,620 million, showing a smaller net increase.\n\nIn summary, although the company's net cash from operating and investing activities decreased or remained conservative, the net effect, combined with the effect of exchange rate changes and other factors, resulted in a higher overall cash balance at the end of 2020 compared to 2019. This demonstrates that effective management of cash flows across these activities contributed positively to increasing liquidity at year-end 2020.\n\n![The company’s improved cash position at year-end 2020 is supported by reduced investment outflows and sustained operating inflows, despite higher financing outflows](image2)"}

The evaluation framework primarily revolves around two key criteria: **consolidated operating income** and **share price volatility**, each weighted equally at 50% [3], [8].\n\nThe **consolidated operating income** serves as a direct measure of business performance, assessed against a reference value of 1 trillion yen, with a performance target of 150% of this base, indicating ambitious growth goals [3], [7], [9]. This metric captures how well Toyota is achieving its financial targets and sustaining profitability.\n\n![Toyota’s evaluation framework table](image3)  \n*Evaluation is based on the degree of achievement of targeted operating income (50%) and stock price stability (50%).*\n\nSimultaneously, **share price volatility** functions as a proxy for shareholder value, emphasizing stock market perceptions of Toyota’s stability and value creation. The evaluation compares Toyota’s share price (6,501 yen) to the Nikkei average (18,917 yen), with a 50% weight assigned to this metric to reflect investor confidence and market perception [3], [7], [9].\n\nIn addition to financial metrics, Toyota incorporates qualitative assessments such as **individual performance evaluations** and efforts aligned with the principles of the “Toyoda” concept, ensuring that leadership efforts and contributions influence remuneration [1], [5], [9].\n\nThe remuneration system also features a **performance-linked component**, which is derived after deducting fixed monthly remuneration, allowing incentives to align with measurable outcomes [3], [4], [6], [10]. This structure motivates executives to focus on both achieving financial targets and maintaining stock stability, directly tying their rewards to tangible indicators that influence shareholder value.\n\nThis evaluation methodology ensures that Toyota’s executive remuneration system is not only aligned with financial health but also promotes shareholder confidence and sustainable growth, by explicitly rewarding performance in both operational results and market valuation.\n\n![Toyota’s executive remuneration breakdown](image4)  \n*Remuneration components include fixed and performance-based pay, linked to company performance metrics.*\n\nIn conclusion, Toyota’s executive remuneration evaluation reflects a deliberate integration of **business performance** (via operating income) and **shareholder value indicators** (via share price volatility and market confidence), fostering leadership accountability and long-term sustainability."}

According to the data, the sales volume contributed an increase of approximately $7,563 million, while price realization added around $932 million to the total sales growth, as illustrated in the bar chart (image2). These factors indicate that more units were sold and that prices achieved were higher, both positively impacting revenue.\n\nBreaking down the segment improvements, Construction Industries experienced a 31% rise in sales, the most significant among all segments, increasing by $5,188 million from 2020 to 2021 [5]. This growth was fueled by higher end-user demand, increased sales volume, and favorable pricing, in addition to positive currency impacts [4]. Similarly, Resource Industries and Energy & Transportation segments also showed notable growth, 26% and 16% respectively, reflecting broad-based gains across sectors.\n\nThe regional data supports these findings; North America sales increased by 23% and Asia/Pacific by 15%, driven mainly by higher end-user demand and inventory adjustments by dealers, who decreased inventories after 2020's buildup, indicating a rebound in sales activity [2][3][10]. This demand surge contributed directly to the increased sales volume.\n\nIn summary, higher sales volume contributed roughly $7.5 billion, while improved price realization added nearly $932 million, collectively yielding a significant revenue boost for Caterpillar in 2021.

In terms of client assets, GWIM experienced growth, with total client balances increasing from approximately $3.05 trillion in 2019 to about $3.35 trillion in 2020, driven mainly by higher market valuations and positive client flows [6][2]. Although the revenue dipped, the segment’s assets under management rose, reflecting growth in client wealth.\n\nMeanwhile, the net income for GWIM and Private Bank also fell notably. While specific net income figures for GWIM and Private Bank alone aren't directly provided, the overall bank’s net income decreased by 28% from $4,251 million in 2019 to $3,075 million in 2020, largely attributed to lower revenues, higher credit provisions, and increased expenses [3][6][7][8]. The decrease in net interest income and noninterest income impacted profitability.\n\nTurning to Consumer Banking, the segment faced more significant challenges. The net income in Consumer Banking dropped sharply by 50%, from approximately $13 billion in 2019 to around $6.5 billion in 2020 [8]. This decline was driven by lower revenue—mainly due to decreased net interest income (down $3.5 billion) as a result of lower interest rates—and higher credit losses and expenses [8]. Despite a growth in client balances (up $302 billion to $3.3 trillion), revenue reductions and elevated provisions for credit losses severely impacted profitability.\n\nIn terms of revenue, Consumer Banking's total revenue decreased by about 5%, from approximately $19.5 billion in 2019 to $18.58 billion in 2020, reflecting reduced net interest income and service charges due to lower client activity [3][8]. The net income's steep decline emphasizes the adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which caused a decline in loan applications, average loan balances, and increased credit loss provisions [4][8].\n\nInterleaving the summarized financial data visually, the following images highlight the segments' asset evolution and revenue streams:\n\n![The table provides financial data for Merrill Lynch Global Wealth Management and Bank of America Private Bank for the years 2020 and 2019.

These charges are reported as a component of expenses and likely affected both the operating profit and net income.\n\nIn contrast, during 2019, the restructuring charges were much smaller or even negative due to adjustments and reversals, amounting to \\(\\$(15)\\) million, indicating some restructuring-related income or reversals rather than charges [5]. This suggests less restructuring activity or completion of certain initiatives in 2019 compared to 2020.\n\nFurthermore, the inclusion of restructuring charges in the operating profit for 2020 shows a direct reduction in operating earnings, with specific charges of 24 million in the second quarter and an overall 25 million recognized during the year [3]. These expenses lower operating profit and, subsequently, net income, which would be reflected in both the consolidated statements of income and the restructuring accrual balances on the balance sheet [8].

This positive shift was primarily driven by substantial gains in other comprehensive income, notably the foreign currency translation adjustments, which increased remarkably from a loss of about $632 million in 2018 to a gain of approximately $2,918 million in 2020 [2]. The increase in foreign currency translation adjustments reflects favorable currency translations in 2020, compared to losses in previous years, significantly boosting overall comprehensive income.\n\nAdditionally, the company’s net earnings grew steadily over this period, from about $2.7 billion in 2018 to roughly $3.6 billion in 2020, contributing to higher overall comprehensive income [6]. The detailed financial data table illustrates this upward trend in net earnings, which was supported by broader revenue growth and successful acquisitions like Cytiva, which contributed over 30% core sales growth and helped offset some decline in the first quarter of 2020 due to COVID-19 [4].\n\nFurthermore, despite increased pension and postretirement plan benefit adjustments — which slightly negatively impacted comprehensive income with losses of $13 million in 2018, $90 million in 2019, and $147 million in 2020 — these factors did not overshadow the overall improvements driven by foreign currency gains and higher earnings.\n\nThe substantial foreign currency translation gain in 2020 was a major contributor, offsetting other losses, and the overall rise in net earnings, coupled with favorable other comprehensive income components, resulted in an overall increase in Danaher’s comprehensive income over these years.

Contrastingly, Rural Development projects are predominantly localized, with most projects implemented directly within their respective districts and states, such as in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, often with smaller budgets (e.g., between ₹0.07 crore and ₹1.05 crore) and mainly through direct execution [2].\n\nIn terms of implementation modes, **COVID Relief projects** tend to leverage both direct implementation and partnerships with specialized agencies, especially for PAN India initiatives which require large-scale logistics and outreach. Agencies with CSR registration numbers frequently handle these projects, facilitating faster execution in times of crisis. On the other hand, **Rural Development projects** are frequently implemented directly by the organization or through local agencies, focusing on regional needs such as skill training and community development [3].\n\nThe key differences are:\n- **Scope and Scale**: COVID relief efforts include large PAN India projects with higher budgets, while Rural Development projects are generally smaller and localized.\n- **Implementation Modes**: COVID relief projects often involve partnerships with external agencies, whereas rural projects are mostly directly executed in target districts.\n- **Geographical Focus**: COVID relief spans nationwide, with some large-scale projects, whereas rural development projects focus on specific rural districts within states.\n\n![COVID relief and rural development projects map](image2)  \n*The tables depict detailed project locations and budgets, illustrating the regional focus and implementation strategies.*  \nThus, the primary distinction lies in scale and mode of implementation: pandemic response projects often utilize agency partnerships for large impact, while rural development projects tend to be localized, direct initiatives."}

Similarly, its comprehensive income was about $10,497 million [3,4], higher than the operating cash flow but still exceeding the cash generated from operations.\n\nMoving to 2019, net income slightly decreased to $7,353 million [1,2], while net cash provided by operating activities increased to around $9,649 million [7,3], surpassing the net income and suggesting improved cash collection or operational efficiency. The comprehensive income for 2019 was approximately $8,172 million [3,4], close to net income but still higher.\n\nBy 2020, net income slightly declined again to $7,175 million [1,2], whereas net cash from operating activities further increased to roughly $10,613 million [7,3], significantly outpacing net income and comprehensive income, which was about $5,944 million [3,4]. This divergence might reflect non-cash adjustments, working capital changes, or other financing activities captured in operating cash flow.\n\nThe interleaved table and images help visualize this discrepancy. The financial statements, especially the cash flow statement (images 3 and 4), show that operating cash flow tends to be higher than net income in recent years, indicating strong cash management, despite fluctuations in net income and comprehensive income.\n\n![The table presents financial data for PepsiCo over three years—2020, 2019, and 2018.

First, regarding the DBO, the effects of a 0.5 percentage point change in critical assumptions such as the discount rate, compensation increase, and pension progression are detailed in the table shown in image1. For September 30, 2021, a decrease of 0.5% in the discount rate led to an increase of €271 million in the DBO, while a similar decrease in compensation increase added €16 million, and pension progression decreased the DBO by €144 million [1].\n\n![The effects on DBO due to assumption changes for 2021](image1)\n\nThis evidence indicates that lower discount rates, which often reflect worsening market or economic conditions, significantly increase the DBO, as shown by the €271 million rise for a 0.5% decrease in the discount rate in 2021. Similar but slightly smaller effects are seen for 2020, with a €266 million increase under the same assumptions change, highlighting that actuarial assumptions significantly influence obligation valuations [1].\n\nIn contrast, plan assets, which include various categories of investments such as equities, bonds, and derivatives (shown in image2), experienced notable growth from €2,813 million in 2020 to €3,259 million in 2021. The increase in assets, especially in government and corporate bonds, indicates a strategic response to liability risks and market developments [2].\n\n![Plan assets composition for 2021 and 2020](image2)\n\nExamining actuarial gains and losses (image3), the total losses in 2021 amount to €22 million, largely driven by changes in financial assumptions, with a significant impact of -€26 million, compared to a substantial gain of €72 million in 2020 due to financial assumptions. This suggests that fluctuations in actuarial assumptions and financial market developments contributed directly to the valuation of the obligations and the assets' performance [3].\n\n![Actuarial gains and losses for 2021 and 2020](image3)\n\nMoreover, the discount rate's percentage increase to 1.7% in 2021 from 1.5% in 2020 (shown in image4) reflects adjustments in market conditions, which affect both discounting of liabilities and asset valuations. An increase in discount rates generally decreases the DBO, but other assumptions like mortality rates, experience, and financial market movements also play crucial roles [4].\n\n![Interest rate changes for 2021 and 2020](image4)\n\nIn summary, from 2020 to 2021, changes in actuarial assumptions such as discount rates, pension progression, and demographic factors led to significant impacts on the DBO—primarily increasing it when assumptions worsened or market conditions deteriorated—and influenced the valuation of plan assets and actuarial gains or losses. The adjustments in assumptions align with evolving economic and social conditions, affecting the overall pension and benefit obligations of Siemens Healthineers.\n\n**In brief:** Changes in actuarial assumptions, especially discount rates and demographic factors, significantly increased the defined benefit obligation and affected the valuation and risk profile of plan assets between 2020 and 2021."}

Looking at the data, the **total RWA increased** from $394,177 million in 2019 to $453,106 million in 2020, which is an increase of approximately $58,929 million. This increase stemmed from various component changes, notably:\n\n- An **increase in Credit Risk RWA** of $44,382 million in the Standardized approach and $56,003 million in the Advanced approach, mainly due to higher exposures in Derivatives, Securities Financing, and Investment Securities, driven by market volatility and acquisitions [5][6][7].\n- A rise in **Market Risk RWA**—$14,547 million (Standardized) and $14,443 million (Advanced)—primarily due to increased Regulatory VaR and market volatility [6].\n- The **Operational Risk RWA** decreased in the Advanced approach by $7,791 million, but overall, the increase in Credit and Market risks drove the total higher [5][6][9].\n\nDespite this rise in total RWA, the **External TLAC** increased from $196,888 million in 2019 to $216,129 million in 2020, reflecting a growth of about 10%. However, because the total RWA expanded more proportionally, the **TLAC as a percentage of RWA decreased** from approximately **49.9% in 2019 to 47.7% in 2020** [5].\n\nThis decline indicates that, although the absolute TLAC amount grew, the increase in RWA was more substantial, effectively lowering the ratio of TLAC to RWA. The increased component risks and exposures mainly contributed to higher RWA, while TLAC requirements did not increase at the same pace, affecting the ratio negatively.\n\nIn summary, the significant rise in various RWA components—especially credit and market risk—led to a decreased TLAC-to-RWA ratio from 49.9% in 2019 to 47.7% in 2020, despite an overall increase in the TLAC amount."}

Despite this slight decline, the proportional revenue contribution from the U.S. remained relatively stable at approximately 41% of total revenues in 2020, slightly down from 43% in 2019 based on the pie charts [4]. The U.S. experienced a temporary dip in sales growth, but strategic marketing investments, including support for marketing initiatives and initiatives like free Thank You Meals for responders, helped to support recovery [1][2][4]. The margin data indicates that U.S. margins slightly decreased, reflecting the impact of COVID-19 expenses and reduced traffic [6]. The 4% decrease in company-operated sales (from $2,495 million to $2,395 million) underscores the pandemic's effect on dine-in and other edge services, though the strong drive-thru and delivery channels mitigated some declines.\n\nIn contrast, the **International Operated Markets** faced a much more pronounced decline, with revenues decreasing by 17% in 2020 compared to 2019 [3], and revenue contribution dropping from an estimated 46% in 2019 to roughly 44% in 2020 (based on pie chart proportions) [4]. The comparable sales declined sharply by 15%, primarily driven by COVID-19 related restaurant closures and restrictions in key markets like France, the U.K., Germany, Italy, and Spain [3][4]. These declines reflect the significant impact of government regulations, restaurant closures, and limited operations affecting the revenue streams. The margins for these markets suffered considerably, decreasing by 13%, with additional expenses for employee costs, lower gains on sales, and higher restaurant closing costs contributing to the overall decline [5][6]. The revenue shrinkage was also influenced by reductions in company-operated sales (19% decrease) and franchised revenues (14% decrease), indicating an overall contraction across the segment.\n\n**What might have influenced these changes?**  \nThe primary driver was the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to widespread restaurant closures, limited operations, and government-imposed restrictions, especially impacting international markets [3][4]. The U.S. market, buoyed by delivery and drive-thru growth and targeted marketing support, was better positioned to recover and sustain sales [4]. However, the international markets, with greater dependence on dine-in and more severe restrictions, experienced larger declines. Additionally, increased costs related to safety measures and employee support further pressured margins across both regions [6].\n\n![The U.S. segment maintained a relatively stable revenue contribution with slight declines, aided by strategy shifts towards delivery and drive-thru orders, contrasting the sharp downturn experienced internationally](image4)\n\nIn conclusion, from 2019 to 2020, McDonald's U.S. segment saw a minor revenue decline with resilient growth due to strategic shifts and delivery efforts, whereas the International Operated Markets suffered substantial revenue and margin decreases primarily due to COVID-19 related restrictions and closures, reflecting how regional differences and pandemic responses shaped their financial performance."}

The cash flow statement further clarifies this reduction was primarily due to decreased operating earnings caused by the impact of COVID-19.\n\nRegarding the number of systemwide restaurants, as shown in the restaurant count table, there was a slight increase from 2019 to 2020. The total systemwide restaurants grew from approximately 38,695 in 2019 to 39,198 in 2020, an addition of about 503 establishments, mostly driven by growth in foreign affiliated and developmental licensed locations [2][6].\n\nThis combination of a decrease in cash from operations alongside an increase in systemwide restaurants suggests that although the company expanded its footprint internationally and through licensed models, its core operational cash flow faced pressures—likely due to pandemic-related challenges. The growth in restaurants, coupled with reduced cash flow, indicates that the company possibly relied more on franchise and licensing arrangements, which are less dependent on direct operational cash flow, to expand during a difficult operating environment. This strategic shift could have helped maintain growth while managing operational risks during a period of economic uncertainty."}

This large sale resulted in a marked reduction in total managed assets, which is evident in the balance sheet data.\n\nExamining the balance sheet, total loans increased slightly by $7.8 billion from 2020 to 2021, reaching $895.4 billion, indicating moderate growth in lending activities despite asset management shifts. Total assets also rose somewhat but remained relatively stable, with a minimal increase from $432.7 billion in 2020 to $447.5 billion in 2021 for period-end totals[7][5]. The sale of WFAM and other asset management businesses likely contributed to this stabilization, as cash and securities were reallocated or exited the balance sheet.\n\nFurthermore, the management of assets via sales impacted securities holdings: available-for-sale debt securities decreased significantly (from $220.4 billion to $177.2 billion in fair value), aligning with the asset divestment and rebalancing efforts described in the figures and disclosures[1][4][image1]. This transition affected the composition of the assets, reducing WFAM-related securities on the balance sheet and reallocating resources accordingly.\n\nIn summary, the significant withdrawal of assets under management, combined with large asset sales, led to a decrease in certain asset categories and influenced overall asset composition, balancing the balance sheet after strategic divestitures.

This steady growth signifies a consistent effort to strengthen its footprint across various regions, including New Zealand, Singapore, and Malaysia.\n\nThroughout this period, Lovisa aimed to build a robust international presence by opening new stores in key markets such as the UK, France, the USA, and the Middle East, supported by pilot programs and franchise opportunities [4]. The strategy emphasized assessing local market conditions—building knowledge through local contacts and evaluating market opportunities carefully—as well as being nimble enough to accelerate or defer market entry depending on external conditions like COVID-19’s impact on retail leasing markets [3]. This is reflected in the company's ongoing efforts to explore new markets, conduct regular evaluations, and expand into regions with favorable conditions.\n\nA key achievement during this period was the substantial growth in the number of international stores, with 47 new stores opened outside Australia by 2020, encompassing diverse markets such as the UK, France, the USA, and franchise operations in the Middle East and Vietnam [4].

Additionally, the company’s strategic focus on securing premium store sites in high-traffic locations—with an optimized store size and layout—has facilitated quick expansion at relatively low costs, exemplified by the rapid 14-day store fit-outs [9].\n\nHowever, Lovisa faced challenges such as highly competitive industry barriers, the low entry barriers for new competitors, and changing customer preferences that impact store performance and selection [7]. The COVID-19 pandemic further complicated expansion efforts by impacting retail leasing activities and international market conditions, requiring the company to remain agile in its growth plans [3].\n\nIn summary, from 2016 to 2020, Lovisa progressively scaled its international footprint by opening numerous stores, expanding into new and existing markets, and refining site selection and operational strategies. Its achievements include a growing global presence, successful pilot programs, and the application of a flexible, market-sensitive expansion model, while challenges stemmed from industry competitiveness, consumer trends, and pandemic-related disruptions.\n\n---\n\n![The table presents a consolidated financial summary comparing two fiscal years, 2020 and 2019, along with percentage changes from 2019 to 2020.](image1)"}

According to the summarized income statement in [5], net interest income declined by approximately $\\S2.7$ billion or 9%, excluding the effects of significant items and foreign currency translation, reflecting the impact of lower interest rates and asset growth.\n\nConcurrently, interest expense decreased notably, with the fourth quarter of 2020 experiencing a $\\S2.9$ billion reduction year-on-year [6], primarily driven by lower funding costs resulting from declining market interest rates and growth in interest-bearing customer accounts. As shown in the table in [2], the overall net interest income for 2020 was $\\S27.6$ billion, down from previous periods, with net interest margin (NIM) narrowing to 1.32% for 2020 compared to higher levels in prior years.\n\nThis decline in net interest income has directly impacted the organization's net operating income. Since net interest income is a core component of total operating income, its reduction contributed to the overall drop in operating profit, as shown in [10], where the profit before tax and profit for the year both fell in 2020 compared to 2019. The decrease in interest income and the compression of NIM reflect the challenging interest rate environment, which diminished the organization's ability to generate income from its assets, thereby reducing profitability.\n\n![Interest Yield and Margin Trend (2020)](image2)  \n*The table shows a decrease in net interest margin to 1.32% for 2020, down from previous years, reflecting narrower spreads.*\n\nIn conclusion, the decline in interest income and interest expense from 2019 to 2020 led to a notable reduction in net interest income, which, along with narrower interest margins, translated into decreased net operating income and overall profitability for the organization."}

This downturn was primarily driven by a significant fall in interest and other investment income, which dropped from $1,059 million to $589 million, a decline of 44.4%, mainly due to lower yields from short-term investments and fixed maturity securities as a result of persistently low interest rates through 2021 [2]. Conversely, dividend income increased from $4,890 million to $5,060 million, offsetting some of the decline but not fully compensating for the decrease in interest income, leading to a slight overall reduction in total net investment income.\n\nIn contrast, railroad operating earnings experienced a substantial increase from $5,161 million in 2020 to $5,990 million in 2021, an improvement of about 16.0% [7], which is quite significant. This rise can be attributed to higher operating revenues, which grew from $20,181 million to $22,513 million, a 11.6% increase. This growth was driven by higher volumes reaching pre-pandemic levels and increased revenue per unit, supported by higher fuel surcharge revenue due to rising fuel prices and business mix changes [7]. Additionally, operating expenses rose modestly but were offset by productivity improvements, resulting in a decreased expense-to-revenue ratio and thus higher earnings.\n\nThe differing trends reflect that while investment income was negatively impacted by persistent low interest rates limiting yield income, the railroad segment benefited from a recovery in volumes and revenue per unit as demand for transportation rebounded and economic activity improved post-pandemic disruptions [3], [4], [7].  \n\n![The table displays financial data related to railroad earnings and investment income for 2020 and 2021, showing a decrease in investment income and an increase in railroad earnings.](image2)  \n\nIn summary, the company’s net investment income declined mainly due to lower interest income caused by low interest rates, whereas railroad operating earnings increased due to higher volumes, improved revenue per unit, and continued operational efficiencies."}

These increases are partly due to new leases initiated during 2020, likely influenced by the Cytiva acquisition and expansion of operational facilities, as well as standard lease renewals or new agreements. The weighted average lease term remained stable at about 7 years, but the discount rates slightly decreased, suggesting favorable financing conditions. \n\n![The table illustrates growth in lease assets and liabilities from 2019 to 2020, indicating increased leasing commitments and assets associated with operational expansion](image4)\n\nCollectively, these changes reflect a strategic expansion of operational capacity and supply chain infrastructure, aligned with the company's growth trajectory. The increase in inventories may temporarily impact cash flows and working capital, but supports higher sales volumes, particularly in high-growth markets and in response to demand for COVID-19 related products. The rise in lease assets and liabilities demonstrates a shift towards using operating leases rather than outright purchases, impacting the balance sheet but providing flexibility and alignment with operational needs. \n\nIn summary, the development of lease assets and inventories between 2019 and 2020 indicates a period of growth and capacity expansion, which is reflected in higher assets on the balance sheet and is consistent with the company's increased sales and acquisition activities."}

Analyzing the provided evidence, we see that **deferred tax assets before valuation allowance** decreased slightly from $662 million in 2019 to $645 million in 2020, mainly due to reductions in deferred losses, accrued expenses, and other assets [table in image2]. Meanwhile, **valuation allowances** remained nearly the same, with a negligible change from -$180 million in 2019 to -$179 million in 2020, indicating minimal impact on net realizability of these deferred assets.\n\nFurthermore, **deferred tax liabilities** reduced from $363 million in 2019 to $213 million in 2020, primarily driven by decreases in property, plant, and equipment, and intangible assets [image2]. The reduction in liabilities (by approximately $150 million) positively impacted the net deferred tax asset, which increased from $119 million in 2019 to $253 million in 2020 [image3].\n\nNotably, the **uncertain tax positions** exhibit drastic changes, with the balance of uncertain tax positions decreasing from $303 million in 2019 to $89 million in 2020 [image4]. This reduction resulted mainly from large adjustments—such as a $249 million tax benefit related to prior years' tax positions in 2020—that lowered the overall uncertain tax liabilities. These adjustments reflect settlement or favorable resolutions, which decrease the potential tax obligations and therefore increase the net deferred tax asset.\n\nIn addition, while the **cash payments for income taxes** increased from $570 million in 2019 to $720 million in 2020 [image10], this reflects ongoing tax payments rather than direct changes in deferred tax components but indicates active tax management.\n\nIn conclusion, the **decline in uncertain tax positions**, coupled with **decreases in deferred tax liabilities**, and consistent valuation allowances contributed to the **increase in the net deferred tax asset** by approximately $134 million between 2019 and 2020.

Correspondingly, the breakdown of operating expenses, including selling, marketing, and general administrative expenses, also increased — for instance, total operating expenses grew from RMB 4,744 million in 2019 to RMB 6,687 million in 2021, with the latter comprising 60% of total expenses [3][5][7].\n\nThe breakdown shows that service costs, a significant component of the cost of revenues, increased from RMB 14,967 million in 2019 to RMB 18,992 million in 2021, indicating heightened costs possibly due to expanding content licensing, payment channels, or platform support [4][8]. Operating expenses like selling and marketing expenses grew moderately, from RMB 2,041 million (43%) in 2019 to RMB 2,678 million (40%) in 2021, suggesting the company maintained efforts in user acquisition and branding even as revenue increased [3][5][7]. Similarly, general and administrative expenses saw a notable increase, reflecting investments in management, R&D, and infrastructure, which are vital for long-term competitiveness [3][9].\n\nThese trends highlight that the company has been progressively allocating more resources towards content, marketing, and administrative functions to support ongoing growth and market penetration. This strategic increase in expenses, particularly in R&D and marketing, demonstrates active investment to expand product offerings and improve technological capabilities. Overall, the rising expenses suggest a management focus on fostering future growth, even as it entails higher costs in the short term.

For example, the overall prices in 2020 tend to be different compared to those in 2019, and while the exact 2018 figures are not explicitly numbered in the extracts, the trend can be inferred from the progressive data available.\n\nSpecifically, in **Image 5**, the table highlights the average production prices for crude oil and NGL across regions for 2020 and 2019. Comparing these, we observe a general decrease or fluctuation in prices, which is typical given market volatility influenced by global demand, supply constraints, or geopolitical factors during that period. \n\nThe detailed data shows:\n- In 2020, regional prices tend to be lower compared to 2019, reflecting market impacts such as the COVID-19 pandemic and its effect on oil demand.\n- Specific regions like the United States and Canada experienced notable price shifts, which are detailed in the table but not explicitly listed for 2018 in the provided quotes.\n- Since the data mentions a three-year review in section 6, it suggests a comparison trend over these years.\n\nAdditionally, **Text quote [6]** indicates that the tables from the report summarize these figures across years, implying that the prices for 2018 would have been higher or more volatile before 2019 and 2020 adjustments.\n\n**In summary**, while explicit 2018 prices are not directly listed in the quotes, the overall trend across regions from 2018 to 2020 indicates that *average production prices for crude oil and NGL generally declined or fluctuated downward in 2020 relative to 2018*, aligning with industry-wide impacts during this period.\n\n![The table shows regional and overall average production prices for crude oil and NGL in 2019 and 2020, reflecting a decline in prices in 2020 compared to 2019](image5)"}

As shown in the data, noncurrent assets increased by approximately $3,039 million ($829 million adjusted for currency), rising from $113,767 million in 2019 to $116,806 million in 2020 [image2]. This increase primarily reflects investments in long-term assets, possibly supporting growth initiatives or strategic infrastructure.\n\nAlongside this, IBM’s long-term debt experienced a slight uptick, from $54,102 million in 2019 to $54,355 million in 2020, indicating an incremental increase of about $253 million [image2]. However, overall, IBM’s total company debt decreased from $62,899 million to $61,538 million, primarily driven by early debt retirements and maturities totaling around $11,267 million, partially offset by new issuances totaling $8,982 million [image4]. Notably, Global Financing segment debt specifically decreased by approximately $3.56 billion, aligning with the portfolio reduction strategy.\n\nIn terms of cash flows, IBM's net cash from operating activities increased by roughly $3.4 billion, from $14,770 million in 2019 to $18,197 million in 2020 [image3], which positively impacted liquidity. The net cash used in investing activities decreased significantly, from about $26.9 billion outflow in 2019 to approximately $3 billion in 2020, signifying a slowdown in asset acquisitions or a strategic wind-down of certain operations such as OEM IT financing [image3].\n\nLooking at shareholders' equity, total equity declined slightly by $258 million, from approximately $2,968 million in 2019 to around $2,465 million in 2020 [image1]. This decrease was mainly due to dividends paid of about $5.8 billion and foreign currency translation impacts, despite net income of roughly $5.59 billion and small increases in common stock.\n\nIn synthesis, the rise in noncurrent assets coupled with a modest increase in long-term debt, alongside improved operational cash flows and reductions in overall debt, suggests IBM strengthened its liquidity position and restructured its asset base to support strategic objectives. These changes contributed to maintaining financial stability, although slight equity declines reflect the impact of dividends and currency effects. Overall, these movements indicate a measured approach to balancing asset growth, debt management, and shareholder returns, ultimately sustaining IBM’s financial robustness.\n\n---\n\n**![The increase in noncurrent assets and the slight rise in long-term debt reflect strategic investments and asset management, impacting IBM's overall financial stability](image2)**"}

The risk-adjusted margin for credit cards increased from 8.28 to 9.16, indicating a better risk profile possibly because of lower balances and more selective lending (second image). Additionally, the number of new accounts dropped from 4,320,000 in 2019 to 2,505,000 in 2020, suggesting reduced consumer engagement in opening new credit lines during the pandemic.\n\nRegarding home equity, outstanding balances decreased by about \\$5.9 billion, from \\$15.0 billion in 2019 to \\$9.1 billion in 2020, primarily due to paydowns outpacing new originations, as shown in the ninth image.

The production of home equity also fell, with applications declining by about \\$2.8 billion, reflecting a cautious approach from consumers regarding new borrowing.\n\nThese declines in credit card spending and home equity borrowing suggest that during 2020, consumers prioritized reducing debt and conserving cash amid economic uncertainty, lower retail and travel spending, and the effects of government stimulus benefits.

According to the report, fluctuations in these prices can significantly affect the company’s profits and cash flows. For instance, a US$1 per ton increase in metallurgical coal prices leads to an uplift of US$35 million in underlying EBITDA, and a similar increase in energy coal adds about US$13 million, as shown in the impact table [image1]. This indicates that higher coal prices directly enhance the company’s profitability by increasing revenue from coal sales.\n\nIn terms of nickel, the impact of price changes appears more subdued—an increase of one cent in nickel price per pound results in only an additional US$1 million in both profit after taxation and EBITDA [image1]. The underlying report highlights that BHP’s average realised nickel price in FY2021 was US$16,250 per tonne, benefiting from strong demand and supply disruptions, which supported higher prices [10].\n\nThe key drivers behind these impacts include market demand dynamics, global supply disruptions, investor sentiment, and specific market events. For example, the report mentions that positive investor sentiment and supply chain issues boosted nickel prices, while broader commodity market fluctuations influenced coal export prices. The effect of commodity prices on financial results is further reinforced by the company’s recognition that revenue and asset valuations are sensitive to such external market movements [5]. \n\nFurthermore, the report underscores that during FY2021, a brief correction in nickel prices occurred after a major producer announced converting nickel pig iron to nickel matte, but prices rebounded due to strong demand factors [10]. This demonstrates that market sentiment and strategic industry shifts are key influences on commodity prices and, consequently, on BHP’s financial outcomes.\n\nIn summary, rising coal and nickel prices tend to improve BHP’s profitability with the primary drivers being market demand, supply disruptions, investor optimism, and strategic industry developments, all of which are reflected in the company’s financial performance metrics and outlined impacts.\n\n![The table shows the financial impact of changes in commodity prices on profit after taxation from continuing operations and on underlying EBITDA, expressed in US$ million.

According to the detailed financials, net cash from operating activities rose from $14.8 billion in 2019 to $18.2 billion in 2020, representing an increase of approximately $3.4 billion [3][1]. This boost was primarily driven by an increase in cash provided by receivables, despite some performance-related declines in net income.\n\nIn terms of cash reserves, IBM's cash, restricted cash, and marketable securities at the end of 2019 were around $9.0 billion. By the end of 2020, this figure had grown to $14.3 billion, marking an increase of about $5.3 billion [7][8]. The rise in cash reserves was complemented by a reduction in global financing receivables and total debt, indicating stronger liquidity and improved balance sheet strength during this period.\n\nVisually, the image of the table detailing the cash and short-term securities confirms this growth, showing a jump from $9.0 billion in 2019 to $14.3 billion in 2020 [image2].

This decline was primarily due to lower interest rates, reduced loan balances, elevated prepayments, and refinancing activity, along with the sale of the student loan portfolio, unfavorable hedge results, and higher securities premium amortization, partially offset by lower interest-bearing deposit and debt costs. In 2021, interest income included $518 million from PPP loans and about $1.1 billion from loans purchased from GNMA securitizations [3].\n\nConversely, noninterest income increased substantially from $4,916 million in 2020 to $10,036 million in 2021, reflecting gains from equity securities, mortgage banking income, and asset-based fees. Specifically, the release shows a rise of $5,120 million or 104% year-over-year, driven by higher gains on securities sales, favorable market impacts, and sales of businesses like the Corporate Trust Services and WFAM [1], [7]. \n\nThese contrasting changes in net interest and noninterest income had a mixed effect on total revenue. While net interest income substantially decreased by about $3.9 billion, the rise in noninterest income by roughly $5.1 billion resulted in total revenue increasing from $5,357 million in 2020 to $8,495 million in 2021—an improvement of 59%.

As demand rises, the system dispatches additional e-Palettes immediately to the demand areas, ensuring that the fleet adapts quickly to fluctuating needs. The process emphasizes operation consistency, preventing variations such as delays or shortages. It manages the vehicles remotely, allowing for emergency stops, restarts, and rapid deployment to replace units, maintaining smooth and flexible service [3].\n\nAn infographic depicting this system illustrates the flow from increased demand to real-time dispatch, highlighting the system’s ability to respond swiftly and effectively through remote management and automated deployment, ensuring mobility services remain efficient even during surges in customer demand [image3].\n\nOverall, Toyota’s fleet management responds to increased waiting customers by dynamically dispatching additional vehicles *in real time*, effectively managing the fleet to meet customer needs promptly and maintaining high service levels through an integrated, automated system."}

South Korea’s regional revenue increased from around $2.9 billion in 2019 to approximately $4.0 billion in 2021, showing continued market presence [4].\n\nSince the major segments QCT and QTL generate the majority of the company's revenue, their combined revenues—over $14 billion in 2019 and exceeding $33 billion in 2021—are significantly larger than the revenues reported from individual regions like China and South Korea.

Similarly, share repurchase activity contracted sharply in 2020, coinciding with the company’s cautious approach during the pandemic, though dividends increased per share, emphasizing steady income distribution to shareholders [4][5].\n\nIn summary, from 2018 to 2020, McDonald's reduced both its capital investments and total shareholder returns, with capital expenditures halving and total shareholder returns decreasing almost by half, partly due to operational adjustments during the COVID-19 pandemic, while maintaining dividends per share growth."}

Specifically, interest expense rose from $(59.7) million in 2014 to $(64.2) million in 2015, representing an 8% increase [(from -$59.7M to -$64.2M)] [4]. This increase indicates that the company paid more interest on its debt during 2015, partially offset by the beneficial impact of interest rate swaps, which reduced overall interest costs in previous periods.\n\nRegarding the impact on total non-operating income (expense), there was a significant improvement in the company's net non-operating income, which increased from $(51.3) million in 2014 to $(29.3) million in 2015, showing a 43% reduction in net expense [4]. This substantial decrease in non-operating expense (or increase in net income) was mainly driven by an increase in interest and other income (expense), net, which rose sharply from $7.3 million to $33.9 million, due to gains on sale of property and higher investment income [4].\n\nThus, despite the rise in interest expense, the overall non-operating expenses decreased notably, mainly because of increased investment income and gains, leading to a better net non-operating position in fiscal 2015 compared to 2014.

Conversely, heated tobacco units in the same region experienced a significant increase of 10.4%, rising from 30,677 million to 33,862 million units, illustrating a shift toward heated tobacco products (HTPs) [image2].\n\nThis shift was driven by changing consumer preferences and product innovation, with higher adoption of HTPs possibly due to their perceived reduced harm and growing promotional efforts in Japan, a key market in the region. The decline in cigarette volume may also be attributed to pandemic-related mobility restrictions and adult smokers down-trading to more affordable or alternative options.\n\nIn Latin America & Canada, cigarette shipment volume dropped more sharply by 11.8%, from 72,293 million units in 2019 to 63,749 million units in 2020 [image4]. Heated tobacco units, however, showed an impressive growth of 50.8%, increasing from 299 million to 451 million units, indicating rapid market penetration of heated tobacco products in this region.\n\nThe primary factors influencing these changes include pandemic impacts leading to reduced social smoking, lower overall consumer spending, and retail out-of-stocks affecting cigarette sales [5]. Meanwhile, the rise in heated tobacco units reflects a strategic shift by PMI to diversify product offerings and tap into markets where HTPs are gaining popularity, driven by innovative smoking alternatives and possibly favorable regulatory environments.\n\nOverall, the decrease in cigarette sales and the corresponding increase in heated tobacco units suggest a strategic consumer shift from traditional cigarettes to newer, potentially less harmful alternatives, influenced by health perceptions, regulatory changes, and the pandemic’s impact on smoking behaviors."}

In contrast, Chris Lauder's remuneration comprises a larger fixed component, with 67% of his total pay being fixed, and only 33% at-risk, primarily tied to performance-based incentives [1].\n\nThis distinction indicates that Shane's compensation is more heavily weighted toward performance-driven incentives, aligning his interests more closely with the company's long-term shareholder value creation.

Specifically, in 2018, Tesla reported a net loss of approximately  $1,063$ million [3], indicating an unprofitable year. By 2019, the company’s net loss narrowed to about  $(775)$ million, showing a substantial reduction in losses. The most notable change occurred in 2020, when Tesla achieved a net income of approximately  $862$ million [3], transitioning from losses to profitability.\n\nThis progression reflects a clear positive trend, with Tesla moving from consistent losses in 2018 and 2019 to net income in 2020. The trend suggests improving operational efficiency and increasing revenue streams, as indicated by higher sales and revenue figures across all sectors, along with improved margins. The company's strategic restructuring, increased production, and sales efforts have likely contributed to this turning point. The following image illustrates Tesla's overall financial trajectory, including the net income growth and related equity changes over the years:\n\n![The table provides financial data for 2018, 2019, and 2020, showing a shift from net loss to net income, with 2020 marked by a notable profit of $862 million](image3)"}

In 2019, the preferred stock began with a balance of $1,600 million and increased to $3,268 million in 2020, reflecting new issues of MCPS, particularly notable in 2020. This increase directly contributed to overall stockholders’ equity, as preferred stock is part of equity.\n\n![The preferred stock component increased from $1,600 million in 2019 to $3,268 million in 2020, reflecting additional preferred stock issuance](image1)\n\nSecondly, cash flow from financing activities (detailed in the cash flow statement [5]) shows that in 2020, Danaher generated a net inflow of $1,006 million from financing activities, including proceeds from stock issuances, borrowings, and other financing sources. These inflows facilitated the company's capacity to fund acquisitions (like Cytiva) and service preferred stock dividends, ultimately supporting an increase in total stockholders’ equity. \n\nIn 2018 and 2019, the company experienced relatively stable or moderate financing cash flows, but the large inflow in 2020 bolstered the total equity by enabling the company to undertake substantial acquisitions and strengthen its equity structure.\n\nAdditionally, as seen in the comprehensive statement [4], the net earnings steadily grew from $2,651 million in 2018 to $3,646 million in 2020, strengthening retained earnings, which also influences total stockholders’ equity.\n\nFinally, combining these factors, the issuance of preferred stock increased the preferred component of equity, and positive financing cash flows in 2020 provided resources for growth and investments, cumulatively leading to a notable increase in Danaher’s total stockholders’ equity from approximately $30,271 million in 2019 to $39,766 million in 2020. \n\n**In conclusion,** the issuance of mandatory convertible preferred stock and positive cash flows from financing activities both contributed to the growth of Danaher Corporation’s total stockholders’ equity during 2018-2020."}

Additionally, earnings benefited from higher earnings from the 50 percent-owned CPChem joint venture, adding about $1 billion, and increased sales volumes, which added roughly $470 million [10].\n\nSupporting this, the total revenues for the downstream segment rose markedly from about $94.5 billion in 2020 to approximately $155.6 billion in 2021 [image2]. The sharp rise in revenue correlates with improved sales and operational performance, likely boosting profit margins.\n\nFurthermore, the improvement was partly due to a recovery from the adverse effects of 2020, where lower margins, reduced sales, and pandemic-related disruptions negatively impacted profits. The increase in earnings reflects not only higher product margins but also enhanced overall market conditions, facilitating the segment’s transition from a loss to significant profit.\n\n![U.S. downstream earnings](image5)  \n*Earnings in 2021 reached $525 million compared to $618 million in 2020, but this includes foreign currency effects, indicating that operational earnings improved notably despite currency fluctuations.*  \n\nIn summary, the combination of higher refined product margins, increased sales volumes, and overall revenue growth contributed to the U.S. downstream segment’s shift from a loss in 2020 to a substantial profit in 2021."}

The relationship is structured so that higher EBIT growth rates lead to a larger proportion of incentives being exercisable, indicating a performance-based reward system that aligns executives’ incentives with the company's financial performance.\n\nFor instance, as shown in the images, when EBIT growth reaches certain thresholds, specific percentages of incentives become exercisable. In particular, one table illustrates that if EBIT growth is less than the set threshold, no incentives are exercisable—meaning 0%. Once EBIT growth hits 24%, approximately 10% of incentives are exercisable, and as it increases further, the percentage of exercisable incentives rises sharply. At 26% EBIT growth, nearly all the incentives—up to 100%—are exercisable, emphasizing a clear tiered structure that rewards higher performance with proportionally greater incentives.\n\nThis tiered approach, visually represented in the images, underscores that the greater the EBIT growth over the period, the higher the percentage of incentives an individual can access thereafter. Essentially, achieving predefined EBIT growth targets unlocks increasing levels of reward, thus incentivizing better financial performance.\n\n![The tiered incentive structure based on EBIT growth, showing increased exercisable incentives at higher growth rates](image4)"}

Specifically, net income rose from a loss of approximately \\$5.56 billion in 2020 to a profit of about \\$15.69 billion in 2021, reflecting an increase of roughly \\$21.25 billion [4]. Similarly, comprehensive income, which includes net income and other comprehensive gains or losses, increased markedly from a loss in 2020 to a substantial gain of about \\$17.41 billion in 2021 [4][4a].\n\nSeveral key financial activities contributed to these positive changes. The rise in net income was primarily driven by higher upstream realizations, improved downstream margins, and the absence of impairments and write-offs that negatively impacted 2020 [4][9]. The results from international upstream and downstream segments saw dramatic improvements; for instance, international upstream earnings increased from a loss of \\$825 million in 2020 to \\$8.5 billion in 2021, largely due to higher realizations and the absence of impairments [6], and U.S. upstream earnings went from a loss to \\$7.3 billion, reflecting higher realizations and lower impairments [9]. U.S. downstream also shifted from a loss to \\$2.4 billion, benefiting from higher refining margins and sales volumes [8].\n\nFurthermore, the comprehensive income was bolstered by gains on derivatives, unrealized gains on securities, and other comprehensive income components [4][4a], which collectively contributed to the overall positive change. The table illustrating comprehensive income shows a notable increase in unrealized gains and favorable adjustments related to currency effects and derivatives, culminating in a jump from a comprehensive loss in 2020 to a significant gain in 2021 [4a].\n\nIn terms of corporate activities, stock repurchases and changes in equity components contributed to the overall financial health, although the primary drivers of income improvements stem from operational performance rather than change in equity structure. The cash flow statements demonstrate robust operational cash flow in 2021, supporting higher investments and debt management activities [2][2a].\n\nIn summary, Chevron’s net income and comprehensive income improvements from 2020 to 2021 were chiefly due to increased operational earnings across upstream and downstream segments, enhanced realized prices, and favorable adjustments on derivatives and securities, compounded by strategic financial activities aimed at managing liabilities and shareholder returns.\n\n---\n\n![Chevron's comprehensive income components, highlighting gains in 2021](image4)"}

This change is primarily influenced by significant swings in several key components of comprehensive income, particularly foreign currency translation, pension and postretirement benefits, derivative financial instruments, and available-for-sale securities.\n\nIn 2020, the company experienced a foreign currency translation gain of $577 million and a minimal pension and other postretirement benefits loss of $29 million. However, in 2021, the foreign currency translation loss widened to $(598) million, which heavily negatively impacted total other comprehensive income. Despite this, the company saw a major positive swing in pension and postretirement benefits, which shifted from a loss of $(29) million in 2020 to a negligible $(30) million loss in 2021, partly offsetting other detractors.\n\nAdditionally, the changes in derivative financial instruments and securities contributed to this shift: from a gain of $97 million and $34 million respectively in 2020 to losses of $(3) million and $(34) million in 2021. The total other comprehensive income (loss), therefore, moved from a gain of $679 million in 2020 to a loss of $(665) million in 2021, significantly offsetting the increase in net income.\n\nThe net effect was a rise in total comprehensive income attributable to shareholders from roughly $3.7 billion in 2020 to approximately $5.8 billion in 2021, primarily driven by improved net income figures (from $3,003 million in 2020 to $6,493 million in 2021) and contrasted by substantial changes in the other comprehensive income components.\n\nIn summary, the main factors influencing this change include:\n- A notable deterioration in foreign currency translation (from a gain to a loss)\n- Slight improvement in pension and other postretirement benefits, reducing overall losses\n- Variability in derivative and securities adjustments contributing to overall movements in comprehensive income\n\n![The table presents detailed changes in comprehensive income over the years, highlighting significant swings in currency translation and other comprehensive income components](image3)"}

By 2020, this distribution changed markedly; the chart shows the segment that accounted for 48% in 2019 now representing 39%, indicating a decrease, while the segment that was 41% in 2019 increased to 45%, becoming a larger share of total operating income [image4]. Conversely, the segment that had 11% in 2018 and 2019 appears to have increased slightly to 16% in 2020, as shown in the pie chart, suggesting a redistribution of operating income toward that segment.\n\nThis shift is also supported by the financial data in the tables. The revenue for the U.S. segment decreased from $4,069 million in 2019 to $3,789 million in 2020, but the overall operating income distribution was affected more by margins and segment contributions than just revenue amounts. The tables, especially the breakdown of revenues (image3) and margins (image5), show that while revenues declined across most segments, the proportion of operating income attributed to each segment shifted, likely due to differential impacts of COVID-19, changes in costs, and strategic priorities.

In 2020, IBM generated **$18,197 million** from operating activities [4], which is an increase of approximately **$3,426 million** compared to **$14,770 million** in 2019. This uptick suggests improved operational efficiency and cash generation, likely driven by factors such as sales of receivables and reduced financing receivables due to receivable sales [6][9]. The increase in operating cash flow enhances liquidity and supports strategic investments and debt management.\n\nConversely, net cash used in investing activities dramatically decreased from **$(26,936 million)** in 2019 to **$(3,028 million)** in 2020 [4]. This substantial reduction of **$23,908 million** indicates a slowdown or postponement in capital expenditures, acquisitions, or asset purchases, reflecting possibly a cautious approach during the COVID-19 pandemic or a focus on conserving cash amidst uncertain market conditions. The decreased outflows freed up cash, contributing positively to overall cash flow.\n\nOn the financing side, IBM's net cash flow turned from a **source** of **$9,042 million** in 2019 to a **use** of **$9,721 million** in 2020 [4]. This shift of approximately **$18,763 million** signifies that IBM repaid more debt and possibly paid dividends and bought back shares, although share repurchases were suspended at the Red Hat acquisition [5]. The increased debt repayment and share repurchases or other financing activities resulted in net outflows, which reduced cash reserves but also helped in lowering overall debt levels.\n\nIn summary, the improved cash flow from operations, coupled with reduced investments, helped offset significant debt repayments, but the net effect was a decrease in overall cash holdings. The increased use of cash in financing activities indicates a strategic focus on debt reduction and returning value to shareholders, although it also reduces liquidity buffers. These shifts collectively reflect IBM’s efforts to optimize cash flow management during 2020, balancing operational strength with debt reduction efforts amid external challenges.\n\n---\n\n**[Interleaved visual aids]**\n\n![This table presents a financial summary of transactions or adjustments over the course of a year](image1)  \n*This table shows changes in financial balances, illustrating IBM's cash and receivables adjustments over 2020.*  \n\n![The table provides financial data related to Global Financing for 2020 and 2019, including return on equity](image2)  \n*Global Financing's steady return on equity indicates consistent profitability, supporting cash flow via interest income.*  \n\n![The table presents financial data for 2020, including gross profit, margins, and expenses](image3)  \n*Operational improvements, reflected in higher pre-tax income and margins, contributed to increased cash flow from operations.*  \n\n![Summary of cash flow statements for 2020 and 2019, showing net cash from operating, investing, and financing activities](image4)  \n*The net cash inflow from operating activities rose, while investing cash outflows decreased sharply; financing cash outflows increased, reflecting debt repayments.*  \n\n![Comparison of 2019 and 2020 GAAP and adjusted results, highlighting changes in income and cash flow](image5)  \n*Despite the adjustments and charges, the core cash flow improvements helped strengthen the company's liquidity position.*"}

Even though specific annual figures for stock-based compensation expense are not directly provided in the quotes, the overall context suggests that such expenses are part of the company's ongoing expense management.\n\nLooking at the detailed tax benefits, the company recognized total net tax benefits of $130 million in 2022, $163 million in 2021, and $81 million in 2020 [3]. A significant component of these benefits, $94 million in 2022, and $75 million in 2021, relates specifically to stock-based compensation [3]. This indicates that the tax benefits associated with stock-based compensation were substantial but slightly decreased from 2021 to 2022.\n\nThe data on valuation allowances for foreign tax credits were $313 million in 2022 and $214 million in 2021, primarily related to foreign tax credits the company believes will not be realized due to carryforward limitations [2]. This suggests a strategic adjustment or uncertainty in applying certain tax benefits related to stock-based compensation and foreign credits.\n\nFurthermore, the unrecognized tax benefits that could favorably affect future effective tax rates were $15 million at the end of 2022—down from $30 million in 2021—implying adjustments in tax planning strategies [6].\n\nHere's an interleaved visual representation of the trend:\n\n![A chart showing fluctuations in tax benefits related to stock compensation - 2020 to 2022](image2)  \n*The table shows increasing total tax benefits in 2021 followed by a slight decrease in 2022, aligning with the trend in stock-based compensation-related benefits.*\n\nAdditionally, the company continues to evaluate its tax positions, with ongoing audits and assessments that could influence future tax benefits or liabilities [7]. The consistent recognition of tax benefits and the adjustments in valuation allowances suggest a focus on optimizing tax benefits related to stock compensation as part of their broader financial strategy.\n\nIn summary, the company's stock-based compensation expense and associated tax benefits increased from 2020 to 2021, then decreased slightly in 2022. These fluctuations likely reflect strategic decisions around employee compensation, tax planning, and the realization of beneficial tax attributes, aiming toward balancing expenses and optimizing tax advantages.\n\n**In brief:** The company's stock-based compensation expenses and related tax benefits increased through 2021 and slightly declined in 2022, indicating ongoing adjustment of its compensation and tax strategies."}

By 2022, the figures shifted to 1,411 stores in Spain, 3,239 in Rest of Europe, 823 in the Americas, and 1,356 in the Rest of the World, with an overall increase to 6,829 stores [9][4].\n\n![Overall store distribution 2022](image4)  \n*The table shows an increase in total stores across all regions in 2022 compared to 2021.* Notably, Spain saw an increase of 144 stores, and the Rest of Europe grew by 39 stores, indicating an expansion strategy within these mature markets. The Americas also expanded by 66 stores, while the Rest of the World increased by 103 stores, suggesting a focus on international growth [4].\n\nThis augmentation in store count could be attributed to the ongoing store optimization initiatives that ended in 2021, where Inditex absorbed 578 stores and opened new ones across 40 markets [4]. The company’s diversification into new markets and strengthening presence in existing ones are likely responses to recovering market conditions post-pandemic, which severely restricted mobility and led to store closures in 2020. Between 2020 and early 2021, store closures up to 90% in some markets impacted physical retail operations [10].\n\n![Stores in different regions](image3)  \n*The distribution of stores by region shows active management and expansion opportunities, with significant counts in Europe and emerging markets.* The implementation of online sales channels, strategic store openings, and refurbishments—such as 130 refurbishments and 57 enlargements in 2021—further facilitated this growth [4]. External factors like recovery from pandemic-related restrictions and a focus on high-growth markets likely drove these regional changes.\n\nIn summary, from 2021 to 2022, Inditex increased its store base in all regions through both opening new stores and refurbishing existing ones. The recovery from pandemic disruptions and a strategic focus on expanding in both established and emerging markets explain these changes, supporting their broader growth and market presence."}

This progressive decrease reflects a combination of factors, primarily driven by higher paydown rates on revolving loan balances which led to lower interest yields, as well as changes in the interest income and expense components.\n\nSpecifically, lower interest income was primarily due to a reduction in interest yields on loans, driven by higher paydown rates, meaning customers repaid their revolving balances more quickly, reducing the interest earned from those loans [4]. Additionally, interest expense decreased substantially over these years, partly due to lower funding costs, which impacted the net yield calculations [1][3].\n\nThe visual data supports this trend. For instance, the increase in average paydown rates and the overall decline in interest income contributed directly to the decreased net interest yield. The spread between interest income and interest expense narrowed, especially with a significant reduction in interest expense, but overall, the yield on loans still declined because of the higher paydowns reducing the interest accumulated over the principal balances.\n\n![The table shows the decline in net interest yield from 11.1% in 2019 to 10.2% in 2021, primarily due to higher paydown rates and lower interest income](image4)\n\nIn essence, the major factors influencing this change were increased customer repayment speeds leading to lower interest yields, and lower funding costs reducing interest expenses, which collectively resulted in a downward trend in the net interest yield over the period."}

This change was driven by several key factors. First, the adoption of the new accounting standard CECL resulted in an initial increase of $41 million in the ACL [4, 5], indicating an adjustment to better reflect expected credit losses. Additionally, gross charge-offs in 2020 amounted to $105 million, partially offset by recoveries of $8 million, resulting in net charge-offs of $97 million [4]. To counterbalance these losses, the firm increased provisions for credit losses substantially, totaling $762 million in 2020, which represents a major contributor to the ACL growth [4].\n\nFurthermore, the economic impact of COVID-19 heightened credit risk assessments, leading to further increases in the ACL based on internal risk management standards that consider borrower financial strength, industry, collateral, and broader economic conditions [4]. The aggregate allowance growth was also influenced by the rising total loans and lending commitments, which expanded by approximately $28 billion in 2020, primarily in securities-based and residential real estate loans within the Wealth Management segment and relationship lending commitments within Institutional Securities [6].\n\nLooking at the detailed breakdown, the ACL for loans increased from $590 million in 2019 to $835 million in 2020, while the ACL for lending commitments rose from $0 (not separately provided for 2019, but implied to be lower) to $396 million. This indicates a concerted effort to reserve for potential future losses as credit exposure grew and economic uncertainties persisted. Overall, the main contributors to the increase in ACL from 2019 to 2020 include the adoption of CECL, higher provisions due to COVID-19-related economic risks, and increased exposure in various loan and commitment categories [4].\n\n![The balance sheet's ACL increased notably in 2020 due to provisions for credit losses and adjustments for expected future risks](image4)"}

According to the detailed financial analysis, the net price impact contributed an impressive $16,965 million to EBITDA growth, primarily driven by higher commodity prices for iron ore, copper, nickel, and other resources [5]. This substantial gain reflects how favorable market conditions and increased realized prices elevated the company's earnings.\n\nIn addition, changes in volumes had a smaller but still positive effect. There was a decrease of $312 million in EBITDA due to natural field declines, lower grades at mines like Escondida and Spence, and other operational challenges [5]. Nevertheless, the record production volumes achieved at WAIO and Olympic Dam helped offset some volume-related downturns, maintaining overall productivity.\n\nThe combination of rising sales prices and stable or increasing production volumes resulted in a robust boost in EBITDA, illustrating the company's ability to capitalize on higher commodity prices while managing operational output effectively. This dynamic is visually supported by the bar chart showing EBITDA growth from $22,071 million in 2020 to $37,379 million in 2021, emphasizing the dominant role of market prices and operational stability in earnings enhancement.\n\n![The bar chart indicating increasing EBITDA from FY2017 to FY2021](image3)  \nIn conclusion, the positive impact of increased sales prices was the primary driver, supplemented by relatively stable or improved volumes, jointly elevating the company's EBITDA between 2020 and 2021."}

For instance, GPI's index reached a peak around 106 and dipped to about 84, while the Sensex varied between 98 and 84, indicating that GPI's stock was somewhat more volatile but generally tracked the market trend.\n\nLooking at the **monthly high and low prices in image5**, GPI’s stock experienced its peaks in July 2002 at Rs.420 high and September 2002 at Rs.371, before declining sharply towards March 2003, ending at Rs.329 in high terms and Rs.286 in lows. The trend depicts an initial rise followed by a consistent downward movement in the latter part of the period, reflecting declining investor confidence or weaker market conditions during that time. The Sensex likely followed a similar trajectory, as indicated by its performance in the normalized index graph, which shows both lines moving in tandem with fluctuations, though GPI's stock sometimes exhibited larger swings.\n\nOverall, both the monthly high-low prices and the normalized index performance demonstrate that GPI's stock prices closely followed the general market trend as represented by the Sensex, with periods of growth in mid-2002 and subsequent decline through early 2003. This parallel suggests that GPI's stock performance was significantly influenced by overall market movements during that period, with GPI experiencing higher volatility but overall aligned with the broader market trend.\n\n![GPI stock and Sensex performance from April 2002 to March 2003](image4)  \n*The line graph shows GPI and Sensex moving together over the months, indicating market influence on GPI's stock.*"}

According to the tax provision table [5], the R&D tax credit contributed to reducing the overall tax expense each year, reflected as negative values indicating credits. In 2013, the R&D tax credit amounted to $13.8 million, decreasing the provision for income taxes by that amount. This impact increased in 2014 to $18.7 million, further lowering the taxes owed. By 2015, the R&D credit was even more substantial at $29.4 million, providing a considerable reduction in the tax expense for that year.\n\nThis trend is supported by the narrative in the text quotes, which mention the reinstatement and extensions of the Federal R&D credit: in 2014, the credit was retroactively reinstated for 2014, and in 2015, it was extended permanently [3][6]. Specifically, as noted in quote [6], the company recognized the retroactive benefit of approximately $16.5 million for 2015, which aligns closely with the reported $16.5 million impact in 2015's tax provision. Likewise, the initial increases in the credits for prior years, such as 2014 and 2015, effectively reduced the company's overall tax liabilities as reflected in the decreasing provision figures.\n\nThe visual data indicates that the larger the R&D credits, the greater their impact on lowering the provision for income taxes. This pattern underlines the importance of the R&D tax credits as a tax-saving mechanism for the company during this period.\n\n![The table shows the breakdown of the provision for income taxes, highlighting the significant reduction caused by the increasing R&D tax credits over the years.](image5)\n\nIn summary, the R&D tax credit substantially decreased the company's tax expenses annually from 2013 through 2015, with the impact growing as the credits were extended and replenished, thereby playing a crucial role in the reduction of the provision for income taxes."}

Many COVID relief projects are implemented directly or through specialized agencies, with the goal of providing urgent support during the pandemic, including activities such as disaster management and health emergencies. For instance, one of the COVID relief projects with a nationwide scope had the highest expenditure among the listed initiatives and involved agencies with CSR registration, indicating organized and substantial efforts to combat COVID-related crises.\n\nIn contrast, Rural Development projects, as detailed across images 4 and 5, tend to involve smaller individual expenditures, generally ranging from around ₹0.14 crore to ₹2.09 crore per project. These projects are primarily focused on community upliftment, including areas like rural healthcare, education, and infrastructure development, and are mostly implemented indirectly through specialized agencies. The emphasis is on localized impact, with projects spread across various states such as Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar, and others.

Specifically, the annual decrease of $5.5 billion to $43.4 billion in 2020 [8] signifies this downward trend.\n\nSupporting this, the detailed comparison of interest income and expense highlights that for the year 2020, interest income decreased notably due to lower interest rates and reduced earning assets, while interest expenses declined but not enough to offset the drop in income. This resulted in a reduced net interest income overall.\n\n![Interest Rate Environment](image4)  \n*The interest rate trends and asset yields over the years underpin this decline, with lower interest rates reducing the income earned on loans and investments.*\n\nFurthermore, the quarterly data suggest that during 2020, the lower net interest income was consistent throughout the year, with some expected recovery in the latter half as economic activity improves.

This decline is influenced by several factors discussed in the quotes. Firstly, all segments experienced a decrease in gross margin due to declines in core merchandise categories, notably in fresh foods and sundries, as well as impacts related to inflation and higher merchandise costs, including a LIFO charge [1, 5, 6]. For example, the increase in merchandise costs driven by inflation and higher tariffs contributed to a reduction in gross margin [3].\n\nAdditionally, gasoline sales, which generally have a lower gross margin percentage but positively impact net sales, played a role. While higher gasoline prices increased net sales and positively impacted certain revenue figures—such as a 42% rise in the average price per gallon and a 22% increase in gasoline volume—this activity tends to lower overall gross margin percentage because gasoline has a comparatively lower margin [2, 7]. The impact of gasoline is mixed: it benefits total sales but generally depresses gross margin margins due to its lower profitability.\n\nMoreover, changes in foreign currencies negatively affected gross margin by approximately $176 million, reducing profitability, particularly in international operations [5]. The decrease was also partially offset by benefits from ceasing incremental wages related to COVID-19, which positively impacted gross margin by 5 basis points, but overall, the combination of higher merchandise costs, category shifts, and currency fluctuations led to the overall decrease. \n\nIn summary, the decline in 2022 gross margin percentage was mainly driven by higher merchandise costs due to inflation and tariffs, decreases in core merchandise margins, and the effects of the lower-margin gasoline business, compounded by currency exchange impacts and strategic pricing responses.\n\n![The decline in gross margin percentage from 2020 to 2022 was driven by inflation, increased merchandise costs, and lower margins in core categories](image2)"}

Specifically, the Chair of the Board receives a bonus award valued at CHF 949,263, which is in the form of shares blocked for ten years, ensuring long-term alignment with shareholder interests. These bonuses are typically decided at the end of each reporting year, based on performance against objectives, and approved in a shareholder vote [9].\n\nIn contrast, the Corporate Executive Committee members’ bonuses are also based on annual performance, but the form can vary. As described in [9], the Remuneration Committee decides on the bonus amounts and their form (cash, shares, or blocked securities) shortly after each reporting year. While senior managers may receive bonuses in cash, CEC members can also be granted stock-settled appreciation rights (S-SARs) and restricted stock units (RSUs), which have different vesting and expiration periods outlined in [3].\n\nAdditionally, the bonus for the CEC includes variable long-term incentives in the form of S-SARs and RSUs, with vesting periods of four and ten years respectively, creating a layered long-term incentive scheme [3], [4], [5].\n\nIn summary, **the fundamental differences** are:\n- **Form of bonus**: The BoD's bonus (especially for the Chair) is primarily in long-term blocked shares, while the CEC's bonus can be both cash and equity-based (S-SARs and RSUs).\n- **Vesting periods**: The BoD's shares are blocked for ten years, whereas S-SARs and RSUs for the CEC vest over four years with no specified expiration for RSUs.\n- **Timing and decision process**: Bonuses for the BoD are decided post-year and subject to shareholder approval, whereas for the CEC, bonuses are allocated based on performance and decided shortly after each reporting period [8], [9].\n\n![Distribution options for bonuses](image1)  \n\n*These differences reflect that the Board's bonuses are designed to promote long-term alignment with shareholders through permanent share blocking, while the CEC's bonuses balance short-term performance with long-term incentives via a mix of cash and equity.*"}

According to the textual excerpt [1], net interest income decreased due to various factors such as lower loan balances, declining interest rates, and increased securities premium amortization. Specifically, the quantitative data from the financial overview table (image1) confirms this downward trend, with net interest income dropping from \\$6,134 million in 2020 to \\$4,960 million in 2021—an approximate decrease of **19%**. Similarly, the year-end balance sheet data (image4) indicates a reduction, reinforcing the decline.\n\nLooking at the **total loans**, the data demonstrates a consistent decrease from 2020 to 2021 across all segments. The summarized balance sheet data (images 2 and 4) shows that total loans contracted from \\$211.4 billion in 2020 to \\$181.2 billion in 2021—a reduction of **around 14%**. The decline was widespread across different loan categories: commercial and industrial loans fell by roughly 16%, commercial real estate loans declined about 10%, and lease financing decreased approximately 13%. The detailed breakout in image4 confirms increased balances in some sectors at period-end, but on average, the loans decreased across most categories.\n\nDelving into **sector-specific changes**:\n\n- Within the **Middle Market Banking** segment (image2), loans decreased by nearly 9% from \\$112.8 billion in 2020 to \\$102.9 billion in 2021, aligning with the overall loan decline trend.\n- In the **Asset-Based Lending and Leasing** segment, a more pronounced decline of 21% was observed, dropping from \\$98.6 billion to \\$78.4 billion (images 2 and 4).\n- The **balance sheet data** also indicates larger increases in certain loan types, like commercial real estate, which saw approximately a 4-10% increase year-over-year in some measures (images 4 and 5), but these are smaller compared to the overall decline in total loans, suggesting a shift in loan composition.\n\nThe decline in net interest income is primarily driven by softer demand for loans, lower interest rate environment, prepayments, and the sale of certain portfolios, as explained in [2] and [3]. Conversely, some income components like deposit-related fees and gains from securities contributed to noninterest income, partly offsetting the interest income decline.\n\nIn summary, from 2020 to 2021, net interest income decreased roughly by 19%, primarily caused by reduced loan balances and declining interest rates across sectors. Simultaneously, total loans decreased by around 14%, with notable declines in segments like Asset-Based Lending and Leasing, while some real estate segments saw modest increases. This pattern reflects a cautious lending environment and a shift in asset composition during 2021.\n\n---\n\n![A financial overview chart showing declining net interest income from 2020 to 2021, with a decrease of about 19% and a significant reduction in total loans by 14%.](image1)\n\n![Balance sheet data indicating reductions in total loans across most segments, with a 14% overall decrease, and notable declines in individual loan categories.](image2)"}

Specifically, in 2018, the net cash used was approximately $1.2 billion, which escalated dramatically to about $21.2 billion in 2020 [7]. This indicates a substantial rise in investment activities, mainly due to large cash payments for acquisitions like Cytiva, as well as other investments.\n\nMeanwhile, the total operating cash flows from continuing operations have increased markedly over the same period. In 2018, operating cash flows were approximately $3.6 billion, which went up to about $6.2 billion in 2020, representing roughly a 70% increase [4]. Despite this growth in operating cash flows, the magnitude of cash used in investing activities far exceeds the inflow from operations in 2020, highlighting aggressive investment strategies that required significant cash outflows beyond operating cash inflows.\n\nInterleaved with this, the accompanying images depict financial data over these years, with Image 4 illustrating an upward trend in operating cash flows alongside increasing investment cash outflows, reinforcing the data trends summarized above.

But this doesn't give us exactly 58%.  \nNow, importantly, **the image quotes** provide detailed data points about perceptions at different times. In `image2`, the bar chart shows public opinion on presidential success at various points.  \n- For Trump (Jan 2019):  \n  - **Success:** 65% (Rep), 3% (Dem)  \n  - **Unsuccessful:** 9% (Rep), 80% (Dem)  \n  - **Too early to tell:** 25% (Rep), 16% (Dem)  \n\n- For Obama (Jan 2011):  \n  - **Too early to tell:** 45% (Rep), 47% (Dem)  \n\n- For Bush (Dec 2003):  \n  - **Too early to tell:** 28% (Rep), 43% (Dem)  \n\n- For Clinton (Feb 1995):  \n  - **Too early to tell:** 35% (Rep), 51% (Dem)  \n\nThe combined \"too early to tell\" percentages are highest for Clinton and Obama at around 47-51%, and lower for Bush, and quite low for Trump in Jan 2019.  \nBut maybe the relevant data refers to earlier moments in Trump’s presidency; considering the broader context, perhaps the **most relevant** is the general statement in [10], which states that *\"far fewer\"* rate Trump as \"too early to tell\" compared to Obama and Bush, and mentions that at comparable points he had **more negative perceptions**.  \n\nHowever, given that the question specifies **\"In the year when 58% of people thought it was too early to tell\"**, the exact figure isn't directly quoted but seems to refer historically to former presidents at comparable times.  \n\nFrom [10], the key is:  \n> \"fewer than at comparable points for previous presidents,\" and  \n> \"more said it was too early to tell\" about Clinton (51%) and Obama (47%), compared to Trump's (which is much lower at around 16-25%).  \n\nSince 58% is higher than these prior percentages, it suggests a different or more recent period. The closest data point indicating a similar high percentage for “too early to tell” (around 58%) isn't explicitly provided, but considering historical context, the only *explicit* high figure similar is about 47-51%, which is lower than 58%.  \n\n**But wait,** in the context of the question, we can pair the 58% figure with the data point in [5], which states:  \n> \"Far fewer say it is 'too early to tell' [about Trump], at comparable points.\"  \n\nSince the question asks about the year when **58%** thought it was too early to tell, it aligns with an early period in Trump’s presidency—probably before Jan 2019, perhaps around 2018 or earlier.  \nGiven all this, and focusing on the data that directly mentions this figure, the most relevant quote is in [10], which notes that \"far fewer\" say \"too early to tell\" — implying that the 58% figure might be a hypothetical or approximate value from that context.  \n\n---\n\n### Final Step: Extract the core data required\n\n**Question:**  \n*In the year when 58% of people thought it was too early to tell if Trump was a successful president, how many believed his economic policies had not much effect?*  \n\nFrom the context of [6], in January 2019, 29% say Trump's policies have not had much effect.  \nFrom the data in the images, particularly `image4`, which compares opinions from January 2019 and October 2017, the \"not much effect\" perception among total respondents is:  \n- **January 2019:** 29%  \n\nSince the 58% figure indicates an earlier period with higher \"too early\" perception, the most recent data with 29% \"not much effect\" aligns with January 2019.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n**Number of people (percentage) who believed Trump's economic policies had not much effect during that time (around January 2019):** **29%**\n\n---\n\n### Final concise answer:\n\nIn the year when 58% of people thought it was too early to tell if Trump was successful, approximately **29%** of people believed his economic policies had not much effect on the economic situation.\n\n![A bar chart showing 29% of respondents believing Trump’s policies had little effect](image4)"}

This indicates a predominant focus on initial funding during that period. Conversely, by 2007, the investment landscape shifted markedly: the proportion dedicated to Seed funding plummeted to just 10%, while Early Stage investments skyrocketed to 74%, and Mid-Stage investments increased slightly to 16%. The visual representation in [image1](image1) highlights this transition, showing a clear decrease in early seed investments and a substantial rise in Early Stage funding, illustrating a maturation of the venture capital focus toward supporting startups in their growth phases.\n\nThis trend aligns with the broader European VC market developments described in the quotes, where the early-stage ecosystem was strengthening, and venture funds became more adept and willing to fund companies at more advanced stages. The growth in Early Stage investments suggests increased confidence and capacity among investors, shifting away from initial seed funding towards nurturing companies that have already achieved initial milestones.

Meanwhile, Non-GCC regions maintained a relatively steady view of government jobs as an employment choice. Overall, the shift reflects changing attitudes toward government employment over these years, with a clearer decline in the GCC regions.\n\nIn summary, from 2012 to 2014, preferences for working in government sectors decreased substantially in GCC countries, while in Non-GCC regions, the decline was more modest, indicating evolving job market perceptions across Arab regions."}

This indicates a generally unfavorable view of Trump's conduct during the campaign, partly due to supporters themselves not being highly positive about his behavior, with only 17% granting him an A [6].\n\nIn contrast, Hillary Clinton, the losing candidate, garnered a higher proportion of positive grades, with about 43% of voters giving her an A or B—the highest ever for a losing candidate in recent elections—though still less than the ratings given to Obama in 2008, who received approximately 75% of A or B grades [8]. Voters also awarded Clinton more favorable grades overall compared to Trump, especially considering that her supporters were moderately satisfied with her conduct. Nonetheless, both candidates' campaign conduct received lower grades relative to previous winners, with Trump's grades being particularly low in a historical context [7].\n\nSupporting this, a broader pattern shows that favorite candidates tend to score higher in public regard than their opponents. For the 2016 election, voter confidence in the candidates' conduct was mixed, with both Trump and Clinton having similar levels of confidence in the accuracy of vote counts (47% vs. 44%) [9], but the perceptions of their conduct specifically reflected a more negative view of Trump’s campaign behavior.\n\n![The 2016 winning candidate, Donald Trump, received particularly low grades from voters, with only 30% giving him an A or B and 35% giving him an F, indicating widespread dissatisfaction with his campaign conduct](image3)"}

Conversely, comfort levels with NATO are relatively close, with Germans at 57% and Americans at 52%, but still with a slight edge for Germans. This indicates that Germans tend to hold a more favorable view of the EU, likely influenced by their direct involvement and historical engagement with European integration, whereas Americans display more mixed sentiments, with roughly half supporting these organizations [1].\n\nFurthermore, the textual data underscores that Germans generally view international organizations more positively than Americans, including NATO and the EU. About seven-in-ten Germans favor the EU, contrasted with half of Americans, and Germans tend to view both NATO and the EU more favorably overall, with Germans' approval ratings exceeding U.S. scores notably [5]. In particular, Germans’ stronger support for the EU aligns with their national identity and regional cooperation mindset, while Americans tend to be more ambivalent or less supportive of such supranational entities. Additionally, Americans show less enthusiasm for Russia and China, which influences their broader outlook on international cooperation, whereas Germans, especially in East Germany, are comparatively more open to Russia [5,7].\n\nPolitically, within each country, ideological divides influence attitudes toward these organizations: conservatives in the U.S. and on the right in Germany are less favorable, possibly perceiving these organizations as less aligned with national sovereignty. Liberals and moderates in both countries tend to hold more positive views, especially towards the EU [3,5].\n\nIn summary, Germans generally hold a more favorable view of the EU and NATO than Americans, reflecting different historical, political, and cultural attitudes toward international cooperation.

This suggests that most self-identified Hispanics in the U.S. are descendants of earlier waves of immigration or have deeper generational roots. Notably, indigenous or ancestral ties, such as speaking Spanish or having a Spanish last name, diminish markedly in higher generations—only 7% of third-plus generation Hispanics speak Spanish, and 7% retain Spanish last names [5, 10]. This indicates a blending and eventual attenuation of traditional cultural markers over generations despite ongoing self-identification as Hispanic.\n\nIn contrast, non-Hispanics with Hispanic ancestry are overwhelmingly of the third or higher generation (96%) and are less likely to identify strongly with Hispanic heritage in terms of language or cultural practices [4, 10]. While some may carry familial ties, their identification with Hispanic culture is generally weaker or more integrated into broader American identity as generations progress.\n\nThe images reinforce these findings: the bar charts illustrate that the proportion of recent immigrants (foreign-born) remains low among self-identified Hispanics, with the majority being third or more generations [image4]. Similarly, the decline in language use and retention of Hispanic surnames among higher generations underscores the gradual erosion of traditional heritage markers, even as individuals continue to identify as Hispanic.\n\nIn summary, the data reveals that as generations advance, heritage ties—such as language, cultural participation, and surnames—tend to diminish among self-identified Hispanics, while their identification with Hispanic identity remains strong or persistent. Conversely, non-Hispanics of Hispanic ancestry are predominantly further removed generations-wise and less likely to maintain strong cultural markers, signifying integration or assimilation over time.\n\n**In simple terms:** The generational shift shows that heritage markers fade over time, but many descendants still identify as Hispanic, highlighting a complex relationship between cultural identity and ancestral roots."}

In 1870, the population was merely 130, but by 1880, it surged to over 8,267, largely driven by the expansion of the railroad and the Homestead Act, which encouraged westward migration and settlement [9]; this boom was facilitated by the completion of the Union Pacific Railroad, which connected Omaha to Colorado, transforming Nebraska into a flourishing agricultural region [9]. The early 1900s saw the population stabilize around 13,300-13,400, but from the 1920s onward, there was a steady decline, with the population dropping below 10,000 by 1940, and continuing to fluctuate modestly afterward, as seen in the recorded 9,403 residents in 2000 [3].\n\nThe historical factors influencing these population changes include the initial rush of settlers enabled by the Homestead Act of 1862, which granted 160 acres of land to pioneers who built and maintained a residence for five years, fueling emigration into Nebraska [9]. The arrival of the railroad played a crucial role in establishing towns, facilitating transportation, and supporting agriculture, particularly the dominance of corn farming [4]. However, over time, agricultural mechanization, farm consolidation, and urbanization contributed to rural depopulation, as smaller farms merged into larger ones, and younger generations moved to urban centers for better opportunities. This is reflected in the declining number of farms despite their increased average size, which indicates fewer but larger agricultural operations [4].\n\nCommunity development, such as the construction of churches like St. John’s Lutheran Church in Kronborg and the consolidation of school districts, also reflect demographic shifts. The church, established in the late 1800s, served as a cultural and spiritual hub for Scandinavian immigrants, especially Danes and Swedes, who settled in northern and western parts of the county [7][8]. Over time, many rural institutions such as schools and churches have consolidated or disappeared, paralleling the population decline.  \n\n![The historic St. John’s Lutheran Church in Kronborg, with Gothic-style windows and a cemetery, exemplifies the rich immigrant heritage and enduring community roots](image1).  \n\nIn summary, Hamilton County’s population increased rapidly during the late 19th century due to railroad expansion and land grants, peaked around 1890, and gradually declined throughout the 20th century due to agricultural mechanization, farm consolidation, and rural depopulation."}

Similarly, Democrats' support has also declined, though more modestly, with a slight reduction from 34% to 28% over the same period [6].\n\nThis trend reflects a waning enthusiasm within both political groups for increased European military spending, with Republicans showing a more significant drop in support. The line graph illustrates this decline clearly, emphasizing the diminished backing over just two years for increased defense contributions from European allies (image2). This shift could be linked to changing perceptions of international security commitments or skepticism towards European allies' contributions, as partisanship influences views on U.S. defense policies.\n\nOverall, the data indicates that between 2017 and 2019, both Republicans and Democrats became less supportive of increased defense spending in Europe, with Republicans exhibiting a more pronounced decline. This suggests a growing wariness about committing additional military resources or potentially reassessing the importance of burden-sharing among European allies.\n\n**In summary**: Support among both Republicans and Democrats for increased European defense spending has decreased between 2017 and 2019, especially among Republicans who showed a significant drop in support [2][6]."}

This robust backing underscores a widespread concern for human safety and health in the face of increasing automation.\n\nIn comparison to other automation-related policies, this position stands out as particularly popular. For instance, support for providing all Americans with a guaranteed income (about 60%) or establishing a government-funded national service program (around 58%) is substantial but less pronounced than support for limiting machines to dangerous jobs [1], [7], and [10]. Likewise, support for the option to pay extra to interact with a human instead of a machine is noticeably lower, with just over 60% in favor but lacking the near-universal backing seen for limiting dangerous tasks [1], [3], [5].\n\nLooking at political differences, both Democrats and Republicans support limiting machines in dangerous roles—around 85% acceptance—indicating a bipartisan consensus on the safety-related use of automation [7]. Interestingly, the support is consistent regardless of party, contrasting sharply with more divisive opinions on policies like universal basic income.\n\nVisually, the bar chart in image5 emphasizes this point: it shows that nearly half of Americans strongly favor limiting robots to dangerous or unhealthy jobs, with an additional significant portion favoring it.

In contrast, among the youngest age group, ages 18 to 29, nearly two-thirds oppose such limitations, indicating a tendency to favor more open international student policies. This age-based divide is further reinforced by their perceptions of China; older adults are more likely to describe China as an enemy and to see China as a serious problem, which correlates with their higher support for restricting Chinese students [8].

The overall decline from this peak indicates a shift in public confidence, likely influenced by economic challenges such as the COVID-19 pandemic and the global economic shifts.\n\nThe perception gap is also evident in the changing attitudes toward China, with the Chinese economy seen as less dominant over time by the U.S. populace (from 26% in 2008 to about 32% in 2020), while the U.S. perceived as more dominant [1], [2]. This perception is complicated by increasing concerns over China’s handling of the pandemic and other geopolitical issues, as reflected in public confidence in Chinese leadership decreasing, especially among those unhappy with China’s pandemic response [6].\n\nFurthermore, attitudes toward the U.S. as a global economic leader have become increasingly polarized along political lines. The **area chart in image4** shows rising skepticism: the percentage of Americans with no confidence at all in U.S. leadership regarding world affairs has grown from around 58% in 2014 to 77% in 2020, indicating growing mistrust across the political spectrum. \n\nData from **image3** underscores this divide: Republican or Republican-leaning Americans have shown a marked increase in confidence in Xi Jinping, from 17% in 2012 to 38% in 2020, while Democratic-leaning individuals have generally maintained lower confidence levels, rising slightly from 11% to 19% over the same period.

This trend indicates that perceptions of America’s standing are closely linked to political affiliations, with Republicans tending to have a more favorable view of the U.S. as a global economic leader compared to Democrats.\n\nIn summary, Americans’ perceptions of their country’s economic dominance have fluctuated over time, with a general decline in confidence over recent years, especially amid political polarization.

In Germany, a significant majority (53%) view China as the leading economic power compared to only 24% who see the U.S. as such [1][2]. \n\nFurthermore, the approval ratings of international entities reflect these differences. For instance, Germans tend to view China more favorably; 41% of Germans have a positive opinion of China, which is notably higher than the 26% of Americans who hold a favorable view [1][7]. The comparative bar chart confirms that Germans are more supportive of China's rising influence and have a more positive perception of the EU and China in general compared to Americans [image1].\n\nAdditionally, Americans are more inclined to see their country as the global economic leader and believe the U.S. should use military force when necessary, reflecting a more assertive and confident stance (e.g., 80% of Americans think military force is sometimes necessary, versus about 50% of Germans) [4].

In contrast, Republicans’ approval ratings dropped sharply from 74% to 53% over the same period, reflecting a steep decline of 21 percentage points [2], [4], [6], [9].\n\nThe accompanying images support and illustrate these trends visually. For example, the line graph in image3 shows the approval ratings over time: Democrats’ approval of CDC officials decreased slightly, while Republicans’ approval declined significantly. Additionally, image4’s confidence chart confirms this divide, where 72% of Democrats trust public health officials compared to only 53% of Republicans ([6]).\n\nFurthermore, the decline among Republicans is even more pronounced when considering their overall trust in institutions and leaders, as depicted in the trust chart, emphasizing a widening partisan gap in perceptions of public health officials’ response effectiveness. The steep decline among Republicans reflects growing skepticism or divergence in views about the response to the outbreak, possibly influenced by political narratives and leadership, as evidenced by the substantial drop in approval for figures like Trump among Republican/Lean Republican groups.\n\nIn summary, between March and August, Democrats’ approval of public health officials remained relatively high and declined only modestly, while Republicans’ approval fell sharply, illustrating a deepening partisan divide in perceptions of public health officials' response to the pandemic.\n![The line graph showing approval ratings from March to August](image3)"}

Overall, a larger proportion of Democrats support independent commissions or changes to redistricting processes, whereas Republicans tend to be less supportive or more uncertain about these reforms. For example, [2] notes that approximately 49% of adults approve of House Democrats' proposal to establish independent commissions for redistricting, with only 13% disapproving, and 38% unsure. This indicates broad Democratic support for reforming districting processes. Conversely, [4] highlights that conservative Republicans are more likely (70%) to require documented reasons for absentee voting, suggesting cautious attitudes toward electoral reforms, which may extend to redistricting policies. Moreover, in general, Republicans are more inclined to disapprove or be unsure about non-legislative commissions for redistricting than Democrats [8], with 19% of Republicans disapproving and 42% unsure, compared to only 8% and 32% of Democrats, respectively [4,8]. The visual data in images also support this disparity: [4] depicts Republicans' lower overall support for reform-oriented policies, and the visual comparison in [5] indicates partisan voting differences, which influence opinions on redistricting reforms.\n\n![The image displays a bar chart showing that Democrats are more likely than Republicans to approve of independent redistricting commissions](image4)\n\nAdditionally, racial and demographic variations play a role in approval levels.

As shown in [1], pre-training consistently yields about 3 BLEU points improvement for many language pairs, but the gains can be much larger in extremely low-resource languages like GL, which achieved up to an 11 BLEU point increase. This indicates that pre-trained word embeddings can effectively bootstrap translation models that are on the verge of producing reasonable output.\n\n![The table shows the effects of aligned pre-training on BLEU scores for different language pairs](image1) Interestingly, the alignment of embeddings influences the results: in some cases, like GL→EN, the aligned embeddings actually slightly decreased BLEU scores, while in others like AZ→EN and RU→EN, small improvements were observed, implying that the impact of alignment can vary depending on the language pair and resource availability.\n\n![Line graphs illustrate that pre-training boosts BLEU scores more prominently at smaller training data sizes](image2). The bottom graph clearly demonstrates that the BLEU score gains from pre-training are most significant when training data is limited—highlighting that pre-training is particularly beneficial in low-resource scenarios, which aligns with the observation in [4] that the highest gains occur when baseline systems are weak (BLEU around 3-4).\n\nFurthermore, the datasets in [5] and [9] show that for very low-resource languages like HE, RU, and even less related languages such as French or Italian, pre-training often results in larger relative improvements. For example, the translation from HE to PT improved by 8.9 points, demonstrating the effectiveness of pre-training in boosting performance where initial BLEU scores are low. In contrast, for more similar or higher-resource pairs, the gains tend to be smaller as the models already perform better.\n\n![The tables of dataset sizes and scores support that larger datasets combined with pre-training tend to improve BLEU scores](image5), emphasizing that pre-training enhances model capabilities by leveraging additional, possibly multilingual, data. Additionally, as indicated in [6], injecting pre-trained source language embeddings significantly improves the encoding process, further enhancing BLEU scores, especially in low-resource conditions.\n\nOverall, the evidence suggests that pre-training especially benefits low-resource and distant language pairs by providing better initial representations, leading to higher BLEU scores. Its effectiveness diminishes as the available data grows and baseline performance improves. In sum, pre-training acts as a crucial strategy to enhance translation quality across diverse language pairs, particularly in data-scarce scenarios."}

When comparing the two scenarios—using only reference translations versus using the references along with the source—there is a consistent increase in the scores, indicating that references add valuable information that enhances the metric’s ability to assess translation quality. \n\nSpecifically, in the data presented in **image2**, the scores for \"COMET-RANK (ref. only)\" are consistently lower than the combined \"COMET-RANK\" scores that include references. For example, for \"en-de,\" the score improves from 0.764 (ref. only) to 0.799 with references, and similarly, \"en-ru\" increases from 0.764 to 0.799 [2]. The Δτ values quantify these improvements, with higher values (e.g., 0.155 for \"de-en\" and 0.132 for \"tr-en\") indicating substantial gains when references are incorporated. This pattern suggests that references substantially contribute to more accurate and human-aligned evaluations, especially in reverse translation directions where the source language is involved [2].\n\nIn **image3**, the line graphs reveal that the Kendall Tau scores are highest when all top systems are considered and decrease as the number of top systems reduces, but the importance of referencing remains evident across different language pairs. The inclusion of references appears to bolster the correlations, especially notable in the reverse language pairs, such as \"cs-en\" or \"fi-en,\" where the scores are generally lower without references, implying references help stabilize and improve the evaluation’s reliability [3].\n\nFurthermore, the comprehensive evaluation metrics in **images 4 and 5** reinforce that leveraging reference translations enhances metric performance.

This enhancement is particularly important because references capture the expected output, guiding the metric to better evaluate translation adequacy and fidelity.\n\nIn summary, **the inclusion of references consistently enhances the effectiveness of the COMET-RANK metric for English-involving language pairs, with larger improvements observed in reverse translation directions, thereby aligning the metric more closely with human judgments across diverse language pairs**."}

Interleaving the textual results with visual data, we observe that increasing the number of demonstrations generally improves the models' performance, but the presence of logical constraints significantly enhances this effect.\n\nFrom the data summarized in the tables and graphs, it is evident that without logical constraints, increasing demonstration samples from 1 to 10 or even 20 yields some improvements, yet these gains are relatively moderate. Specifically, the left graph in image4 illustrates that for datasets like MAVEN-ERE and CTB, adding more demonstrations (samples) enhances the Micro-F1 scores, but with diminishing returns beyond a certain point. The performance plateau indicates that merely increasing demonstrations without additional guidance may not optimize results efficiently.\n\nIn contrast, incorporating logical constraints into the demonstrations amplifies the benefits substantially. The same graph shows that with logical constraints (w. lc), the Micro-F1 scores are consistently higher across different numbers of demonstrations compared to scenarios without constraints (w/o. lc). For instance, on MAVEN-ERE, as the number of demonstrations increases, the Micro-F1 improves more markedly when logical constraints are used, surpassing the performance with more demonstrations but no constraints.\n\nFurthermore, the right graph in image4 demonstrates that as the number of iterations increases, logical inconsistency decreases, and performance improves, especially with fewer demonstrations. This trend suggests that logical constraints not only boost initial performance but also help in reducing errors more effectively than just increasing demonstration samples.\n\nIn conclusion, increasing the number of demonstration samples tends to improve Micro-F1 scores on both MAVEN-ERE and CTB datasets; however, the positive impact is significantly amplified when logical constraints are incorporated into the demonstrations. This combined approach allows models to achieve higher accuracy with fewer demonstrations, highlighting the importance of \"what\" is demonstrated and \"how\" it is guided through logical instructions."}

According to the studies presented, over 90% of the errors occur during the reasoning step, with reasoning errors and math errors being the most significant contributors [9]. This indicates that while the abstraction step in Step-Back Prompting manages to facilitate easier retrieval, the core challenge lies in the complex reasoning required to derive correct answers.\n\nIn the error analysis depicted in Figure 5 (right), reasoning errors constitute the majority of mistakes made by the model, with other categories like scoring errors or retrieval issues being comparatively less frequent [8]. Specifically, the accuracy fluctuations across different shots suggest that even with abstraction and retrieval augmentation, reasoning remains the bottleneck.\n\nComparing to other error types such as principle errors—those related to the failure of the abstraction step—these are relatively small, constituting less than 10% of total errors [9].

In the single-task model (Figure 1a), the decoder employs a standard attention mechanism that attends solely to the encoder’s hidden states to generate output tokens. This setup involves a single decoder focusing directly on the input sequence to produce predictions, with the attention weights determining which parts of the source input are most relevant at each decoding step.\n\nConversely, the multitask model depicted in Figure 1b introduces a more complex attention structure. It features separate attention mechanisms for the encoder states and additional attentions from other decoders or representations. This means that in the multitask framework, the secondary decoder receives information not only from the encoder directly but also via the first decoder’s output, essentially leveraging higher-level intermediate representations such as transcriptions or phonemes. The attention weights in this model are thus distributed across multiple sources, allowing the second decoder to focus on both the raw source input and the intermediate outputs from the first task decoder.\n\nThe images further clarify these differences.

Interleaving the descriptions with relevant images clarifies this architecture.\n\nFirstly, the **Multimodal Retriever** is responsible for encoding images and associated data into multimodal embeddings and storing them in an external memory bank. This component employs an **Image Encoder** to extract feature embeddings from dataset images. These embeddings are then stored and indexed efficiently, often using algorithms like HNSW to facilitate fast retrieval, even at large scales [7]. This indexing allows quick querying of relevant visual and textual information based on similarity.\n\n![The multimodal retriever's architecture with image encoder, index, and memory](image3)\n\nDuring the retrieval phase, when an input image is provided at inference time, the system queries the index to find the top- $k$ most similar embeddings—these represent candidate categories or related images [8]. This process relies on techniques like k-nearest neighbors for accurate retrieval of relevant data.\n\nNext, the **Retrieving & Ranking** module takes these top- $k$ candidate categories, alongside the retrieved information, and feeds them into a **Large Language Model (MLLM)**. The MLLM is guided by a carefully designed prompt that merges the image features and retrieved category information [5]. It then ranks these candidates based on their relevance or likelihood, utilizing both internal knowledge and retrieved data [4]. This step refines the classification by emphasizing the most probable category.\n\n![Pipeline illustrating retrieval of top-k categories and ranking in the RAR system](image4)\n\nThe **Memory ($\\mathcal{M}$)** plays a central role here by storing multimodal embeddings, enabling the system to leverage prior knowledge for unseen or fine-grained categories [6]. The combination of storage, retrieval, and ranking makes the system adaptable and scalable to large datasets.\n\nIn addition, to enable rapid retrieval, especially with large datasets, the system employs an **index system** that uses the HNSW algorithm to reduce the dimensionality of embeddings, accelerating the search process [7].\n\nFinally, the **Inference Stage** integrates the retrieved categories with the image embedding through a **prompt** that guides the MLLM to rank and select the most accurate label for the input image [5][6]. The output is a highly precise classification that combines the strengths of retrieval-based methods with language models' understanding.\n\n![Diagram of the entire RAR pipeline with pre-processing, retrieval, and ranking stages](image3)\n\nIn summary, the main components of the RAR pipeline include:\n- The **Multimodal Retriever**, which encodes and stores embeddings for efficient retrieval.\n- The **Index System** (e.g., HNSW) for fast similarity searches.\n- The **Memory ($\\mathcal{M}$)** that holds the multimodal embeddings.\n- The **Retrieval mechanism**, extracting top-$k$ relevant categories.\n- The **MLLMs with ranking prompts**, which evaluate and order retrieved candidates to produce the final prediction.\n\nThis integrated architecture effectively improves the recognition accuracy, especially in fine-grained, few-shot, or zero-shot scenarios, by combining retrieval, ranking, and language understanding.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe main components of the RAR pipeline are the multimodal retriever (encoding and storing embeddings), the index system (for fast retrieval), the external memory ($\\mathcal{M}$) holding the embeddings, the retrieval process (finding top-$k$ candidates), and the MLLMs with ranking prompts (refining and selecting the final category), all working together to leverage multimodal data for accurate recognition."}

Conversely, for higher confidence scores, which correspond to easier samples, the performance gain from LLM reranking diminishes or diminishes slightly, indicating that LLMs are particularly beneficial in improving the classification of difficult samples [5].\n\nThis suggests that LLM reranking enhances overall micro-F1 by focusing on challenging samples—those with lower confidence—leveraging LLMs' external knowledge and reasoning capabilities to rectify initial predictions made by the SLM.

The graph (image4) illustrates that the \"With Coreference\" curve maintains higher precision across the recall spectrum, with an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.751 compared to 0.695 without coreference.

Specifically, as described in [2], the model receives a tuple $\\chi = (s, h^+, h^-, r)$, where $h^+$ is a hypothesis ranked higher than the inferior $h^-$ hypothesis relative to the source $s$ and reference $r$. The loss function encourages the embedding of the better hypothesis $h^+$ to be closer to the source and reference embeddings, effectively learning to distinguish higher-quality translations from lower-quality ones.\n\nThe architecture (illustrated in Figure 2) processes these segments through a cross-lingual encoder and pooling layer to generate sentence embeddings. The triplet margin loss then guides the model during training to minimize the distance between the \"better\" hypothesis and the source/reference, while maximizing the distance to the \"worse\" hypothesis. This results in an embedding space where translation quality is reflected by proximity, enabling the model to rank hypotheses accurately based on their semantic similarity to the source and reference inputs.\n\n![The diagram of the translation ranking architecture, showing separate encodings and the triplet loss to optimize translation quality ranking](image2)\n\nIn summary, the purpose of the triplet margin loss in this model is to improve the embedding space such that higher-quality translations are ranked closer to the source and reference, facilitating more accurate ranking of translation hypotheses."}

This external feedback can be in the form of scalar scores or natural language explanations, pinpointing specific issues like factual inaccuracies, logical inconsistencies, or toxic content [2], [6].\n\nThe process, as depicted in the diagram, involves an external system acting as a \"doctor\" that diagnoses problems in the language model's output and suggests corrections or refinements [2], [6].

As illustrated in the diagram (image2), **Tree Traversal** begins by encoding the query and then traversing the tree layer-by-layer, selecting the top-k relevant nodes at each level based on cosine similarity, progressively moving toward finer details. This method carefully prunes and explores the tree, allowing for precise, stepwise refinement of relevant information [2][7][9]. Conversely, **Collapsed Tree Retrieval** simplifies this process by flattening the multi-layered tree into a single layer, bringing all nodes onto the same level, and evaluating their relevance collectively across all layers at once. This approach, depicted in the same diagram as well as in the summary, considers all nodes simultaneously, facilitating broader and more flexible retrieval across the entire structure (image2) [3].\n\nThe advantages of the collapsed approach include ease of comparing nodes directly and considering a more holistic context, which helps retrieve information that is at the appropriate level of granularity for a question. In contrast, tree traversal offers more control over specificity by adjusting parameters like depth and the number of nodes selected per layer, enabling a stepwise focus from broad to detailed information [9].\n\nPerformance comparisons (image1 and images 3 and 5) further suggest that the collapsed tree approach often yields better results in tasks such as question answering, especially when dealing with lengthy and complex contexts. It retrieves from all relevant thematic layers efficiently, as also shown by the superior metrics achieved when using the collapsed method (images 1,3, and 5). The hierarchy and retrieval strategy directly impact the quality and relevance of the information gathered for downstream tasks.\n\n![The diagram shows two methods: Tree Traversal, which iteratively selects top relevant nodes layer-by-layer, and Collapsed Tree, which flattens all nodes for simultaneous evaluation, facilitating flexible and comprehensive retrieval.](image2)"}

This process allows the model to globally reason about the relationships between different object proposals and the entire image context. The object queries are independently transformed into output embeddings, which are then passed through a shared feed-forward network to predict class labels and bounding boxes for each object or classify them as \"no object\" [5].\n\nThe importance of object queries is also visualized in the architecture diagram (image3), where each query corresponds to a specific \"slot\" intended to capture an individual object. During training, the transformer uses bipartite matching to assign each query to a ground-truth object, enabling the model to learn to produce a diverse set of predictions without duplicates [1][5].\n\nAdditionally, the attention mechanisms within the decoder facilitate the exchange of global information among queries and image features, enabling the detection of objects at various scales and positions [4][5].

This trend is clearly shown in the line graph where the F1 scores for relation extraction decrease as the number of entities rises, whether using \"DyGIE\" alone or \"DyGIE-RelProp\" (relation propagation) [image2]. Both systems perform well with two entities, but their F1 scores notably drop in sentences with six or more entities, indicating increased difficulty with complex sentences.\n\n![Relation F1 scores decrease as entity count increases, with \"DyGIE\" outperforming \"DyGIE-RelProp\"](image2)\n\nIncorporating relation propagation, which involves propagating relation scores across broader context and multiple relation types within sentence graphs, aims to mitigate this decline. According to the text, relation propagation achieves significant improvements especially in sentences with more entities — as shown in the figure capturing the effect of relation propagation iterations, where the system reaches optimal performance typically at the second iteration [images: 3b]. However, the results indicate that despite the added effort, the benefit of relation propagation is somewhat limited compared to the baseline \"DyGIE\" without propagation, as evidenced by the generally higher F1 scores of \"DyGIE\" across all entity counts.\n\nThis suggests that while relation propagation improves the system's ability to leverage broader contextual information and help with complex sentences, its overall impact on relation extraction performance across sentences with many entities might still be constrained. The graphs and performance metrics imply that the primary challenge remains in managing the complexity introduced by many entities, and that relation propagation provides some relief but may not fully overcome these difficulties.\n\nIn summary, relation extraction performance decreases with increased entities in a sentence, and incorporating relation propagation offers incremental improvements, especially in complex, multi-entity contexts, though its effectiveness varies depending on the sentence complexity [images: 2, 3b]."}

According to the data presented, when models incorporate repetition control, the frequency of question-asking tends to decrease compared to models without such control. For instance, the line graph in **image4** illustrates that the question-asking rate in models with repetition control (purple line with squares) increases more gradually as the control level ramps up, reaching a maximum of about 80% questioning at the highest control levels. This is in contrast to the question-controlled model without explicit repetition control (blue line with circles), which approaches nearly 100% question-asking as the control level increases, indicating a more aggressive questioning behavior.\n\nFurthermore, in the text, it is noted that adding repetition control reduces question-asking rates. Specifically, **quote [3]** mentions that controlling question-asking with conditional training and incorporating repetition control results in a question-asking rate of approximately 79.67%, which is slightly below the near 100% questioning observed in models without repetition constraints. The introduction of repetition control aims to prevent the model from parroting or repeating phrases, which can inadvertently suppress the diversity and frequency of questions generated, especially since questions often share common bigrams like \"do you\" or \"what is\" that repetition controls discourage. \n\nThe visual data and textual evidence together suggest that while repetition control improves conversation quality by reducing redundant responses, it can also limit the model’s questioning frequency, making the dialogue less inquisitive but more coherent and less repetitive overall. This trade-off reflects a balancing act between maintaining engaging, question-rich conversations and avoiding unnecessary repetition.\n\n![The graph shows how question-asking increases with control levels, but models with repetition control reach a lower maximum, indicating a reduction in questions compared to models without such control.](image4)"}

When models are trained with adversarial distractors, they tend to recover some of their original accuracy even when tested on challenging adversarial or type-filtered distractor datasets. For example, as shown in the comparison of performance metrics, models trained with adversarial examples improved their F1 scores from 46.84 to 60.10 when evaluated on adversarial distractors after retraining [4], and from 40.73 to 58.42 when evaluated on adversarial distractors with entity type filtering [5]. This indicates that adversarial training helps models become more resilient to challenging distractors and reduces their vulnerability to distribution shifts. However, the data also demonstrates that without such retraining, models trained only on standard data might perform poorly on adversarial or filtered distractors, revealing a dependence on adversarial training for maintaining accuracy in more complex or unseen scenarios [2], [4], [5]. Overall, incorporating adversarial examples during training improves generalization and robustness against challenging distractor sets, but still leaves open the challenge of developing more comprehensive distractor sets that fully induce multi-hop reasoning [6].\n\n![This image is a diagram illustrating how a BERT-based question-answering system processes question-paragraph pairs to predict answer spans or yes/no responses, highlighting the incremental selection process among multiple paragraphs.](image1)\n\n![The table shows that the model’s F1 score drops significantly on open-domain data with more paragraphs or distractors, but improves notably when a gold paragraph is included, illustrating the positive effect of high-quality retrieval on model performance.](image2)\n\n![The table categorizes question types, showing that the possibility of correctly answering varies across multi-hop, context-dependent, and single-hop questions, with higher F1 scores for less complex questions.](image3)\n\n![Performance metrics indicate that models trained with adversarial data outperform those trained only on original data when evaluated on adversarial or filtered distractor datasets, confirming adversarial training’s role in robustness.](image4)\n\nThe impact of adversarial training, based on the evaluation data, is that it generally increases the model’s robustness and performance in more challenging and diverse testing scenarios."}

When gold paragraphs are available, models tend to perform substantially better, as shown in images and tables. For instance, as depicted in **image5**, the F1 score jumps from 39.12 in a setting with 500 distractor paragraphs alone to 53.12 when a gold paragraph is included, indicating that gold paragraphs provide critical accurate evidence that eases the reasoning process. Similarly, **image4** shows that models like BERT achieve an F1 of 70.54 on single-hop questions, which typically require less complex reasoning, highlighting the importance of context.\n\nConversely, the inclusion of distractors—irrelevant or misleading paragraphs—degrades performance, as seen in **image5** where the F1 drops to 39.12 without gold paragraphs. This highlights the challenge of retrieval accuracy; standard retrieval methods like TF-IDF often fail to fetch relevant paragraphs, especially in multi-hop or complex questions, as discussed in **text quotes [5] and [10]**. For example, in **text [10]**, the model's F1 score drops from 53.12 to 39.12 when fewer gold paragraphs are retrieved, emphasizing retrieval's critical role.\n\nFurthermore, the tables suggest that well-designed distractors can make questions more challenging, encouraging models to develop multi-hop reasoning capabilities, but the task remains difficult. As **text [7]** indicates, adversarial distractors can reduce accuracy even when training models on them, implying that current models are still insufficiently robust against complex distractors. This underscores the need for improved retrieval and distractor selection methods, as standard approaches often fall short.\n\nIn summary, **the inclusion of gold paragraphs enhances model performance by providing reliable evidence, whereas distractors hinder it by introducing irrelevant information.** These dynamics imply that advancements in retrieval accuracy and distractor mitigation are essential to improve multi-hop QA systems, enabling them to reason effectively in open-domain scenarios with complex evidence retrieval."}

Based on the quotes, especially [2], sentiment analysis tasks benefit notably from word-order features because small shifts in word placement can drastically change the conveyed sentiment—comparing \"not really good\" versus \"really not good\" illustrates this variation. LSTM models, which can capture sequential dependencies and the positional context of words, outperform simple pooling-based models like SWEM in sentiment classification, highlighting the importance of word order.\n\nReferring to the experimental results, the table in image1 shows that when the training data is shuffled—effectively removing word-order cues—the performance of models like LSTM drops more substantially on sentiment datasets like Yelp P. (from 95.11 to 93.49) compared to other tasks such as topic categorization, where performance remains relatively stable. This indicates that word order contributes critically to the model’s ability to distinguish sentiment, as the model relies on sequences to identify negations or sentiment-laden phrases accurately.\n\nAdditionally, the comments in image2 emphasize that subtle shifts in word order, like placement of negative words, influence the sentiment perception. The overall evidence suggests that word-order information is crucial for sentiment analysis because it helps LSTM models interpret and differentiate sentiment-laden expressions that share similar words but differ in meaning solely due to their order.\n\nIn sum, word-order features significantly enhance sentiment analysis accuracy in LSTM models by allowing them to understand the exact arrangement of words that convey positive or negative sentiments, whereas ignoring this information—such as shuffling words—diminishes their effectiveness."}

According to the detailed analysis, when a repetition control is introduced during weighted decoding, the question-asking rate at z=10 drops from nearly 100% to approximately 79.67%, as shown in the table [4]. This reduction occurs because the repetition control feature (extrep bigram) discourages repeated bigrams that are common in questions, such as \"do you\" and \"what is,\" effectively limiting the model’s ability to produce questions at maximum levels.\n\nComplementing this, the image illustrating question-asking control levels [4] demonstrates that with pure question control (blue line), the question rate quickly approaches near 100% as the control level increases. However, when repetition control is combined with question control, the maximum achievable question rate is lower—around 80%—indicating that repetition control constrains the model’s capacity to generate questions at the highest question-asking setpoint.\n\nThis interplay suggests that introducing repetition control during decoding intentionally suppresses frequent question bigrams, thus reducing the question-asking rate from the ideal 100% to about 80-80% in practice. As a result, while repetition control improves overall dialogue quality by reducing repetitive outputs, it limits the model’s ability to ask questions at the highest targeted rate.\n\nIn summary, the introduction of repetition control at the z=10 level reduces the question-asking rate from nearly 100% to approximately 79.67%, primarily because the discouragement of common question bigrams prevents the model from fully reaching the maximum question-asking rate despite the question-control settings [4]."}

Originally, BERT achieved a peak performance of about 77%, suggesting strong ability; however, this was largely due to exploiting spurious cues rather than genuine comprehension [1]. Using the adversarial dataset, which involves negating claims and balancing cues to remove potential shortcuts, BERT's maximum performance drops to around 53%, with an average near 50% for both train and test sets [5].\n\n![The architecture diagram illustrates how BERT processes tokenized input, showing deep interconnections within the model](image3) \n\nThis decline indicates that previous high scores were not a result of real reasoning but rather the model picking up on superficial patterns. Comparison with other models like BoV and BiLSTM, which had similar performance drops, confirms that the adversarial transformation neutralizes cues that models previously relied on too heavily [1, 5].\n\n![Test performance metrics for different models show that all models’ accuracy drops to around chance level after adversarial training](image1)\n\nIn addition, the data on productivity and coverage shows that models trained on adversarial data produce less consistent results across datasets, emphasizing the challenge of achieving robust argument comprehension [2].\n\nOverall, the adversarial transformation exposes that BERT's apparent high performance was largely due to exploiting dataset-specific cues. When these cues are removed, BERT's ability to genuinely understand arguments is essentially nullified, aligning its true reasoning capacity with that of simpler, cue-dependent approaches. This underscores the importance of adversarial methods in assessing real model understanding, revealing that BERT learns very little about argument comprehension beyond superficial patterns."}

Specifically, as depicted in the schematic of the architecture, one part of the system involves a fixed BERT model acting as a feature extractor for candidate values, such as a list of hotel price ranges or attraction types [3], [9]. This fixed BERT processes candidate value lists, producing value representations (`y_cls`, `y1`, ..., `yc`), which serve as schema element embeddings.\n\nMeanwhile, the other component is a fine-tuned BERT model that processes the current dialogue context along with domain-slot pairs (e.g., \"hotel, price range\") [3], [6], [9]. It outputs contextualized representations including start and end position vectors (`r_cls`, `r1`, ..., `rK`) for each domain-slot pair and dialogue turn, capturing the semantics of the ongoing conversation.\n\nThe matching itself occurs through a cosine similarity measurement, which compares the context-aware slot representations with the candidate value embeddings [1], [3], [6], [9]. When a user mentions a value in conversation—say, \"the hotel is expensive\"—the model encodes this reference in the BERT-derived representation. The cosine similarity then quantifies how close this context portrayal is to each candidate value's embedding, allowing the model to identify the most relevant value based on the highest similarity score.\n\nIn summary, the DS-DST model encodes both candidate values and dialogue context into vector space representations and performs similarity measurement to determine the best match [1], [3], [6], [9].\n\n![The architecture of DS-DST leveraging dual BERT encoders for matching candidate values with dialogue context](image3)\n\nThis approach ensures that the model effectively correlates specific slot values with the evolving dialogue, enabling more accurate dialogue state tracking."}

Initially, the **Problem Formulator** utilizes large language models (LLMs) with in-context learning to convert a natural language problem into a precise symbolic representation, capturing entities, facts, and rules relevant to the task [2]. For instance, it transforms a sentence about an electrical circuit into a logical formula, such as `Complete(Circuit, True) ∧ Has(Circuit, LightBulb) → Glowing(LightBulb, True).`  \n![{problem formulation}](image5)\n\nNext, the **Symbolic Reasoner** takes this formalized problem and performs logical inference using specialized methods suited to the problem type—like logic programming for rule-based reasoning, first-order logic provers for entailment, or constraint solvers for optimization tasks [2, 5]. For example, it might apply a logic solver to deduce whether the circuit implementation satisfies conditions for the light bulb to glow. The reasoning process is deterministic, ensuring faithful and transparent results.  \n![{symbolic reasoning}](image5)\n\nFinally, the **Result Interpreter** translates the symbolic inference output back into understandable natural language answers, offering clear explanations or conclusions based on the logical deduction [2]. For example, it might interpret that \"the circuit is complete and connected, so the light bulb will glow,\" providing a natural language response that addresses the original question [4].  \n![{result interpretation}](image5)\n\nThis modular pipeline—formulating the problem, reasoning logically, and interpreting the result—allows LOGIC-LM to leverage both the natural language understanding of LLMs and the logical rigor of symbolic reasoning, resulting in reliable and faithful problem-solving. In essence, the model first formalizes the problem, then applies deterministic logic for reasoning, and finally translates the outcome into an understandable answer."}

However, they may struggle with out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words, misspellings, or morphological variations, especially in low-resource settings or for rare words. For example, a new or misspelled word might have no corresponding pre-trained embedding, leading to poor representations [1].\n\nOn the other hand, character-level embeddings, generated via models like Char Bi-LSTM, analyze the internal structure of words, such as prefixes, suffixes, and morphemes. This helps the model to understand morphological features, recognize patterns in word formation, and handle unseen or inflected forms effectively.

As shown in the system diagram, the first step involves cropping and resizing the image regions based on proposal bounding box coordinates [4]. This targeted cropping isolates individual objects within a complex scene, allowing the system to focus specifically on each object of interest rather than the entire image. Resizing these cropped regions to a fixed proportion standardizes the input, ensuring consistency in the subsequent embedding extraction process which is performed using an image encoder. \n\n![{pre-processing step of cropping and resizing to isolate objects}](image2)  \nThis pre-processing strategy addresses the variability in object sizes and positions within detection datasets, as explained in the quote, by normalizing the data to facilitate better feature extraction. Moreover, surrounding non-target areas are blurred to direct the model’s attention toward the objects of interest [4]. This focus-guiding technique reduces distraction from irrelevant background information, improving the accuracy of object embeddings.\n\nOnce the individual embeddings are generated, they are used in a k-NN search within a memory bank to find similar objects, assisting in zero-shot recognition by matching unseen objects based on their features [4]. Without such pre-processing, mixed or cluttered images could produce noisy embeddings that hamper the retrieval and ranking processes, ultimately reducing zero-shot recognition performance.\n\nIn summary, the pre-processing step—through cropping, resizing, and blurring—standardizes object representations and emphasizes relevant features, significantly contributing to the system’s ability to recognize objects accurately in a zero-shot setting."}

Starting with the **2010** milestone, the introduction of the \"Time tensor with Random Indexing\" marked one of the earliest computational attempts to model semantic change over time [image1]. This approach conceptualized a word's meaning as a tensor that captures its semantic vectors across different time periods. \n\n![The timeline chart illustrating key milestones from 2010 to 2017 in the evolution of distributional models for semantic shifts](image1)  \nIn **2011**, researchers began utilizing the \"Google Ngrams corpus\" to analyze language change, providing access to large-scale, digitized data for diachronic studies [2]. This dataset greatly facilitated empirical research into semantic variation over decades, as highlighted by multiple studies analyzing word usage differences across the 50-year span.\n\nMoving into **2012**, the focus shifted to \"Word epoch disambiguation,\" where techniques aimed to distinguish between different senses or meanings of words across time, further refining semantic shift detection [2]. The following **2013** milestone involved the advancement of \"Prediction-based models,\" particularly neural embedding models like Skipgram with negative sampling (SGNS), which allowed for more precise modeling of word semantics as they evolve [7].\n\nThe **2014** milestone was notable for employing \"Word embeddings,\" notably exemplified by \"word2vec,\" which became widely adopted for capturing semantic relationships and changes across time slices [7]. By **2015**, efforts centered on \"Models alignment,\" where methods were developed to align vector spaces obtained from different time periods to compare meanings directly [1].\n\nIn **2016**, the use of large corpora such as the \"NYT corpus\" and \"COHA corpus\" represented significant advances, allowing researchers to analyze subtle semantic shifts with higher temporal resolution [9]. This year also saw the exploration of statistical laws of semantic change and the understanding that local measures might be more effective for capturing cultural shifts [1].\n\nFinally, **2017** marked a comprehensive synthesis of these advancements with insights into \"Laws of semantic change,\" discussions on \"Diachronic relations,\" and critiques of the existing theoretical frameworks [1]. The concept of \"Joint learning across time spans\" was also introduced, aiming to improve models' ability to learn semantic dynamics over extended periods [1].\n\nTo summarize, the key milestones from 2010 to 2017 include the conceptualization of temporal tensors, large-scale corpus utilization like Google Ngrams, development of neural embedding models for semantic shift detection, and the refinement of alignment and analytical techniques to study how language evolves over time.\n\n**In essence, this timeline highlights the progression from foundational conceptual models and large corpora usage to sophisticated neural embedding techniques and analytical frameworks that continue to shape our understanding of semantic change.**"}

Next, entities with inadequate images, determined through Google Image Search API, were filtered out to ensure enough visual data for each entity [6]. Additionally, entity names with ambiguous Wikipedia pages were eliminated to maintain clarity and specificity [6]. This multi-layered filtering—consisting of Wikipedia page validation, image availability, and page disambiguation—progressively reduced the dataset to a reliable subset of 7,568 entities. Moreover, when gathering images, the process included filtering by Creative Commons licenses via Google Image Search and further human validation, ensuring the images used are legally permissible and suitable for dataset inclusion [3].\n\nHere's a visual summary of part of this filtration workflow:\n![{Filtering statistics and Google Image Search example}](image3)\n\nIn essence, the key steps are: **(1) validating entities via Wikipedia pages, (2) filtering entities with sufficient and license-compliant images gathered through Google Image Search, and (3) disambiguating entity names to avoid ambiguity**, culminating in a refined, high-quality dataset of entities with relevant images."}

For example, as shown in the ablation study [5], removing the abstract from the textual input leads to a substantial decrease in performance, highlighting the importance of the abstract in capturing the paper’s key content. Likewise, adding authors as features unexpectedly deteriorates performance, possibly due to the sparse and noisy nature of author names in the corpus, which might hinder the model’s ability to learn meaningful document relations. Conversely, adding venue information slightly decreases overall performance on document classification but can aid certain subtasks, indicating that some metadata may introduce noise or irrelevant variations.\n\nThe model's core training relies heavily on citation-based signals, particularly hard negatives (papers that are closely related but not directly cited), as emphasized in [2] and [8].

The difference between training with and without hard negatives further underscores the significance of carefully selected metadata in shaping the learned representations.

According to the summarized results in Table 1 and from the detailed discussion, the standard BERT (without any cue restriction) attains a maximum test accuracy of approximately 77% [1], [4], which is just three percentage points below the average untrained human performance. This high score suggests that BERT might be exploiting dataset-specific statistical cues rather than truly understanding the arguments.\n\nBreaking down the performance across configurations, BERT using only warrants (W) achieves about 71% accuracy [2], [6], indicating a considerable performance jump from using just warrants, but still evident of cue exploitation rather than genuine reasoning. When cues including reasons (R) and claims (C) are integrated with warrants (W), the accuracy increases slightly, contributing to the total 77% performance observed [2], [6].\n\nHowever, when evaluated on an adversarial dataset designed to eliminate these statistical cues—by, for example, negating claims and flipping labels—the performance drops close to chance levels, around 53% [3], [7], [9]. This dramatic decrease demonstrates that previous high performance was largely due to reliance on spurious cues.\n\nIn terms of detailed metrics, the results from different runs show some variability; the mean performance across multiple training seeds is about 71.6%, with the median slightly below at 71.2%, emphasizing consistency but also highlighting issues like training failures in some runs [4], [8].\n\nIn sum, the BERT model's performance is highest (~77%) when it possibly exploits dataset cues, but its true comprehension ability, as measured through adversarial testing, drops to around 53%, pointing to limited genuine understanding across different configurations.\n\n![The table presents test performance metrics (Mean, Median, and Max) for different models and configurations, showing the high peak performance close to 77% for the full model and lower on cue-restricted setups](image1)"}

Interleaving these insights with visual aids helps clarify their strengths and limitations.\n\nStarting with citation evaluation, as shown in the comparison table [image5], GPT-4 generally outperforms ChatGPT across most metrics. For instance, under the general setting, GPT-4 scores a higher alignment (90.9 vs. 82.7) and correctness (97.6 vs. 94.5), indicating that GPT-4 more accurately aligns generated citations with source materials. This trend persists in the specific setting, with GPT-4 again displaying superior alignment (92.0 vs. 84.5) and correctness scores, which suggests that GPT-4 is more reliable for tasks requiring precise attribution of sources [5].\n\n![{Citation Performance Comparison}](image5)  \n*GPT-4 shows higher citation alignment and correctness scores than ChatGPT, especially in the specific setting, indicating better source attribution.*\n\nIn contrast, the text evaluation metrics reveal that ChatGPT tends to perform slightly better in coherence, conciseness, fluency, and relevance, especially in the general setting. For example, in the general setting, ChatGPT scores 4.64 in coherence versus GPT-4’s 4.38. The differences become more pronounced in the specific setting, with ChatGPT maintaining higher scores across all four text quality dimensions. This suggests that while GPT-4 excels in source attribution, ChatGPT may generate more naturally flowing and relevant text, which is advantageous for producing human-like responses [10].\n\n![{Text Quality Scores}](image5)  \n*ChatGPT generally produces more coherent, fluent, and relevant text, especially in specific questions, indicating its strength in natural language generation.*\n\nThe visual data on evaluation settings further illustrate these differences. Under the \"General\" context, GPT-4's superior citation metrics imply it's better suited for tasks where source precision is critical, such as academic referencing or fact-based summaries. On the other hand, ChatGPT’s higher text quality in the same setting makes it preferable for conversational or user-centered applications where naturalness and clarity are valued. When moving to \"Specific\" questions, both models improve, but GPT-4 maintains the edge in citation accuracy, which is crucial for ensuring credibility in scientific or technical domains [9].\n\nMoreover, the performance variation between general and specific questions suggests that the models respond better when instructions explicitly mention specific knowledge, leading to more accurate and thorough outputs in the specific context. This has implications for designing prompts: specifying the type of response desired can enhance the quality and relevance of generated content, especially for citation accuracy.\n\nIn summary, GPT-4 demonstrates stronger capabilities in citation accuracy and source alignment, making it more suitable for tasks demanding precise attribution. Conversely, ChatGPT excels in producing natural, fluent, and relevant text, valuable for conversational and explanatory contexts. Understanding these differences guides users to select the appropriate model based on whether source correctness or natural language quality is the priority in their specific application.\n\n**Answer:**  \nGPT-4 outperforms ChatGPT in citation accuracy and source alignment under both general and specific settings, making it better suited for tasks requiring precise attribution. Meanwhile, ChatGPT typically generates more coherent and fluent text, especially in specific question contexts. This suggests GPT-4 is preferable for source-critical applications, whereas ChatGPT is more effective for natural language generation, depending on the evaluation focus."}

Specifically, the use of head-word supervision (image2) boosts ultra-fine label prediction, and removing any of these sources weakens the model’s ability to accurately predict the most detailed categories.\n\n![The table compares how excluding different supervision sources impacts Ultra-Fine category performance, showing that no single source alone suffices, and comprehensive supervision yields the best results](image4)\n\nAdditionally, the detailed breakdown in Table 6 highlights that the combination of all supervision data results in the best overall performance, emphasizing that the exclusion of any data source diminishes the model's ultra-fine categorization effectiveness. \n\nIn summary, removing data sources like crowdsourced data, head-word supervision, or entity linking consistently leads to lower performance in Ultra-Fine categorization, underscoring the importance of multi-source supervision for fine-grained entity typing."}

As shown in the diagram related to the certification (image1), candidates should concentrate on five core components: identifying talent through search, engaging talent via LinkedIn presence and InMail, building a talent pipeline using pipelining tools, posting jobs effectively, and maximizing efficiency with organization and collaboration tools [1]. These areas ensure recruiters can efficiently source and manage candidates throughout the recruiting lifecycle.\n\nFurthermore, the exam emphasizes the importance of understanding how to construct and interpret Boolean search strings, which are fundamental for precise searches. While Next-gen Recruiter tools aim to simplify searching without deep knowledge of Boolean modifiers, a solid understanding remains crucial [7]. This necessity is exemplified by the use of Venn diagrams, like the one in image2, which visually represent the intersections of candidate skills in different categories—such as \"Engineering,\" \"Java,\" and other skill sets. Analyzing these intersections allows recruiters to identify candidates with the right combination of skills, refining their search strategies.\n\nThe relevance of Boolean logic to these topic areas is that it helps pinpoint candidates fitting multiple criteria, as shown in the overlapping sections of the Venn diagram (e.g., \"E\" for Engineering and Java, or \"G\" for all three skills). Mastery of Boolean search operators enables recruiters to filter candidate pools effectively, ensuring that search results align precisely with job requirements.\n\nIn summary, candidates should focus on mastering talent identification, engagement, pipeline building, job posting, and efficiency tools—areas visually summarized in the certification diagram (image1). Simultaneously, understanding Boolean search logic, illustrated by the intersections in the Venn diagram (image2), directly supports precision in sourcing candidates across these key focus areas.\n\n![The diagram illustrates key focus areas for LinkedIn Recruiter Certification](image1)"}

The paired chromosomes are held together as tetrads, and crossing over may have occurred earlier, exchanging genetic material between homologs, which contributes to genetic diversity [1, 2]. This alignment ensures that, during Anaphase I, homologous chromosomes will be pulled apart to separate the homologs, reducing the chromosome number by half [4, 5].\n\n![The chromosomes align at the metaphase plate during Metaphase I, with spindle fibers attached](image2)\n\nA key feature is the orderly placement of homologous pairs along the metaphase plate, which is essential for the reductional division characteristic of meiosis I. The spindle microtubules attach to kinetochores on each homolog, ensuring they are pulled to opposite poles during subsequent separation. This process differs from mitosis, where sister chromatids align and separate, because in meiosis I, homologs are separated, maintaining sister chromatids together until Meiosis II [4, 7].\n\nIn summary, key processes during Metaphase I include the alignment of homologous chromosome pairs at the spindle equator, attachment of spindle fibers to kinetochores, and the preparation for the homologous chromosomes to be segregated into daughter cells.

This difference underscores that volcano distribution is primarily dictated by geological activity, whereas airport placement is influenced more by human settlement and infrastructure needs [1].\n\n![The map contains several maps with red dots indicating volcanoes mostly near the Pacific Ring of Fire and airports around the equator](image1)\n\nTurning to the comparison within the Netherlands, the maps in image2 highlight the spatial distribution of public libraries and national heritage sites with red dots. The map labeled “Public libraries in The Netherlands” shows that libraries are relatively evenly dispersed across urban and suburban areas, ensuring accessibility throughout the country. Meanwhile, the \"Dutch national heritage sites\" map indicates that heritage sites are often concentrated in historically significant locations, frequently in or near cities or regions with cultural importance. Both distributions exhibit clustering in populated areas, but heritage sites tend to be more geographically concentrated in specific historically and culturally rich locations, whereas libraries aim for broader coverage to serve the population [3].\n\n![The map shows three maps of libraries, heritage sites, and big cities in the Netherlands, with red dots indicating their locations](image2)\n\nMoreover, the map in image4 provides detailed locations of individual public libraries, illustrating their wide but evenly distributed presence across the Netherlands. The overall spatial pattern demonstrates that public libraries are strategically placed to serve community needs, which results in a more uniform distribution compared to the more regionally clustered heritage sites that reflect historical significance [4].\n\nFinally, the map in image5 depicts the general placement of various points within the Netherlands, emphasizing a dense network of data points in urban areas, reinforcing the idea that infrastructure and population density significantly influence the distribution of libraries and other facilities.\n\nIn summary, volcanoes are distributed primarily along tectonic boundaries, resulting in clustered zones like the Pacific Ring of Fire, while airports tend to be located around navigable and populated regions near the equator, leading to a broader, more dispersed pattern. In contrast, within the Netherlands, public libraries are spread fairly evenly to improve access, whereas heritage sites are clustered in culturally significant areas, reflecting historical and cultural priorities.\n\n**In conclusion:** The distribution patterns show that geological phenomena like volcanoes follow natural boundary lines, while human infrastructure such as airports and libraries are distributed based on accessibility, population, and historical significance."}

Progressing toward more advanced analytics like statistical analysis, forecasting, and predictive modeling (\"Why?\", \"What if?\", \"What will happen?\") embodies the shift to BA, increasing both business value and analytical intelligence [3].\n\nThis evolution is visually demonstrated in **image4**, where data flows through phases from raw data (\"Data\") to reporting, analysis, action, and ultimately value. In BI stages, data handling is primarily about organizing and summarizing information for understanding past performance. Moving into BA involves deeper analysis—applying statistical methods and predictive models—to extract insights that inform strategic decisions, bridging the gap from mere reporting to prescriptive actions [4].\n\nSupporting this, **image5** contrasts reporting and analysis. Reporting (descriptive, backward-looking) focuses on \"what happened,\" providing data and information, but often lacks context or forward-looking insights.

From the provided quotes and images, it appears that the main stages of binary fission can be summarized clearly.\n\nFirstly, as shown in [6], a prokaryotic chromosome is present inside the cell, which contains the genetic material. The process begins with the duplication of this chromosome, as described in [7], where the chromatin becomes highly compact, and the chromosome duplicates to produce two identical sister chromatids joined at the centromere. This ensures each daughter cell will inherit an exact copy of genetic information ([9]).\n\nNext, the cell elongates, as illustrated in [5] and [10], allowing the duplicated chromosomes to segregate, and the cell prepares for division. The plasma membrane then starts to grow inward at the midpoint to form a septum that will eventually divide the cell into two ([5], [10]).\n\nThe diagrams, especially images 2 and 5, visually depict this process with the elongation of the cell, chromosome separation, and formation of two new cells, completing binary fission.\n\nIn total, the key steps involved in prokaryotic binary fission are:\n\n1. Chromosome duplication.\n2. Cell elongation.\n3. Segregation of duplicated chromosomes.\n4. Formation of a division septum.\n5.

According to [2], Mendel discovered that traits are inherited through heritable factors called genes, which are located at specific gene loci on homologous chromosomes [3][7].\n\nIn the classic monohybrid cross involving purple (P) and white (p) flower traits, the parental plants are homozygous (PP and pp). When these are crossed, all F₁ hybrids are heterozygous (Pp) and display the dominant purple phenotype due to at least one dominant allele [5][10]. \n\nWhen F₁ plants are self-crossed, the alleles segregate according to Mendel's laws, producing an F₂ generation with a phenotypic ratio of approximately 3 purple to 1 white flowers, corresponding to the genotypic ratio of 1 PP : 2 Pp : 1 pp [5][10]. This segregation occurs because homologous chromosomes exchange alleles during meiosis, leading to gametes that carry either the dominant or recessive allele.\n\nThe phenotypic ratio (3:1) arises because335 of the heterozygous and homozygous dominant plants exhibit the dominant phenotype, while only the homozygous recessive (pp) exhibit the white flower trait. The genotypic ratio reflects the specific combinations of alleles—most importantly, how often heterozygous versus homozygous recessive genotypes occur [5][10].\n\nHere’s a visual representation of how alleles segregate and combine:\n![The illustration shows a genetic cross between purple-flowered and white-flowered plants, resulting in 3 purple and 1 white flower in the F₂ generation due to dominant and recessive allele interactions](image5). \n\nThis illustration demonstrates Mendel’s laws of segregation and dominance, explaining why traits segregate into distinct ratios in the F₂ generation.\n\nIn summary, Mendelian inheritance explains the observed ratios by showing how alleles segregate during gamete formation and combine randomly during fertilization, resulting in the characteristic phenotypic and genotypic ratios in the F₂ plants."}

As detailed in the educational materials, each module builds on the previous one, guiding learners from fundamental map creation to advanced off-Wiki map development.\n\nInitially, **Module 1** emphasizes understanding the basics of map creation with Wikidata. The goal is to teach learners how to make basic flat and layered maps using geo-referenced items and SPARQL queries, enabling the visualization of data points such as public libraries in the Netherlands [2]. In the related image, a map displays numerous markers indicating geographic locations, like the public libraries, demonstrating the foundational skills of mapping [image4].\n\nProgressing to **Module 2**, the focus shifts to embedding these maps into Wikimedia projects like Wikipedia and Wikimedia Commons. This module aims to familiarize learners with techniques to integrate dynamically generated maps within Wikimedia platforms, utilizing tools like OpenStreetMap, GeoJSON, and the MediaWiki Extension [2]. The collage of screenshots illustrates this stage, showing how maps can be embedded in wikis with interactive features [image2].\n\nFinally, **Module 3** addresses creating interactive, layered maps that can operate outside of Wikimedia sites, such as standalone HTML pages. This advanced module involves integrating data-driven maps that users can toggle and explore independently, often employing Python, Jupyter notebooks, and other programming resources [2]. An infographic highlights these objectives with references to off-Wiki map use and associated coding tools, culminating in comprehensive skills for data visualization [image3].\n\nIn summary, the structured learning objectives aim first to teach basic map-making techniques, then the embedding of maps into Wikimedia projects, and finally the development of sophisticated, interactive maps for broader applications.\n\n---\n\n![The Netherlands map with multiple location markers](image1)  \nThis map shows various public libraries across the Netherlands and parts of Belgium, illustrating a practical example of geographic data visualization that aligns with the initial module's objectives of creating layered maps with geo-referenced data [2]."}

Several quotes highlight the improper postures and conditions that can lead to inaccurate readings. For example, [3] explicitly states that \"Incorrect postures when measuring blood pressure\" can affect the measurement. Additionally, [4] emphasizes that if the measurement is taken with the wrist positioned above the heart, the results tend to be lower and less accurate. Proper posture involves sitting with the wrist at heart level, avoiding positions where the wrist or arm is below or above the heart, which can distort the measurement [4].\n\nFurthermore, the illustrations in image4 depict various wrist positions marked with 'X', indicating these are incorrect postures. The images show improper angles and placement of the wrist during measurement, which can lead to errors, as emphasized in the guidance that the wrist should be kept at heart level and in a relaxed, standard position to obtain reliable readings. Poor posture, such as slouching, crossing legs, or leaning, can also exert pressure on the abdomen or shift the position of the wrist, resulting in higher or lower readings as explained in [4].\n\nIn summary, incorrect postures when measuring blood pressure include those where the wrist is not at heart level, the body is tense or stressed, or the posture is inconsistent with the proper seated position.

As shown in the instructional graphic, the key learning objectives for each module are distinct but build upon each other to develop comprehensive map-making skills. \n\nStarting with **Module 1, basic**, the primary goal is to understand how to create simple flat and layered maps using Wikidata. This involves working with geo-referenced items, specifically those with the property P625, and writing SPARQL queries to visualize geographic data. The focus here is on foundational skills—making basic maps that showcase spatial data points—illustrated by the map in Belgium, the Netherlands, and Germany with colored dots representing such data points [image1].\n\nMoving onto **Module 2, intermediate**, the emphasis shifts to embedding these maps within Wikimedia projects like Wikipedia and Wikimedia Commons. This involves understanding how to integrate more complex maps into web pages, utilizing tools like OpenStreetMap, GeoJSON, and the MediaWiki extension for maps. This stage enhances the skillset by allowing interactive maps to be incorporated into Wikimedia content, as depicted in the collage showing different map screenshots and their embedding options [image4].\n\nFinally, **Module 3, advanced**, aims to teach creating interactive, layered maps that can be used outside of Wikimedia, such as in standalone HTML pages. This module introduces more sophisticated techniques, including coding with Python and Jupyter notebooks, to generate dynamic maps driven by Wikidata data. An example includes maps displaying public libraries in the Netherlands with data overlays, indicating a move towards more customized and functional off-Wiki maps [images2, 3].\n\nIn summary, each module progresses from understanding basic map creation and data querying (Module 1), to embedding maps within Wikimedia platforms (Module 2), and finally to developing standalone interactive maps for external use, with increasing technical complexity and scope.\n\n### ![A map showing public libraries in the Netherlands with various data overlays, exemplifying detailed off-Wiki map creation](image2)"}

Similarly, [1] describes injectors \"prays fuel from above throttle valve,\" implying the injection occurs before or above the throttle valve.\n\nConversely, [3] explicitly mentions \"Injector located in each branch of inlet manifold below throttle valve,\" which directly indicates a configuration where the injectors are placed beneath the throttle valve. This corresponds to systems where the fuel injectors are positioned downstream of the throttle valve, injecting fuel into the intake manifold *after* the throttle valve.\n\nLooking at the images, **image4** shows a diagram of a Single Point Fuel Injection (TBI) system, where the fuel is injected into the airflow coming through the throttle valve, which suggests the injector is located above or within the throttle body. Meanwhile, **image3**, illustrating a multi-point system, seems to suggest injectors placed in the branches of the inlet manifold, which could be below the throttle valve, aligning with [3].\n\nTherefore, the system in which the throttle valve is placed beneath the fuel injector is the **multi-point fuel injection system** that has injectors located in each branch of the inlet manifold below the throttle valve, as described in [3] and shown in **image3**.

This pattern of decreasing marginal utility indicates that each extra hot dog provides less satisfaction than the previous one, eventually becoming unpleasant and reducing overall happiness.\n\n![Diminishing marginal utility and negative utility from excessive hot dog consumption show how taste satisfaction declines with overconsumption, exemplifying the law of diminishing returns](image4).  \nThis pattern implies that, in consumption behavior, individuals tend to stop consuming once the additional satisfaction drops to zero or becomes negative, aligning with the concept of diminishing marginal utility from behavioral economics [9]. Additionally, the large utility jump at 64 hot dogs suggests that under certain conditions, like a competitive eating event, the perceived reward or differential outcome can dramatically influence behavior, even overriding typical diminishing returns [5]. \n\nIn essence, the utility from each hot dog decreases with each additional one, discouraging overconsumption once satisfaction diminishes to negative levels.

During **meiosis I**, homologous chromosomes pair up and are separated, reducing the chromosome number by half. This is highlighted in the diagram and images showing the **separation of homologous pairs** during stages like **prophase I**, **metaphase I**, and **anaphase I**, where the homologous chromosomes are pulled to opposite poles, resulting in two haploid cells, each with one set of chromosomes [2], [7], [5]. The process involves homologous chromosomes aligning and separating, as indicated in images showing homologous pairs and tetrad formation.\n\nIn contrast, **meiosis II** resembles mitosis, where **sister chromatids** are separated. The diagrams and images illustrate stages like **anaphase II** and **telophase II**, where sister chromatids are pulled apart to opposite poles, resulting in four haploid cells from the original two. Notably, the chromosome number remains the same after sister chromatids separate in meiosis II, but the overall process ensures four genetically distinct haploid gametes [4], [7], [10].\n\nThe key differences are visually emphasized in the images: **image1** illustrates the separation of homologous chromosomes during meiosis I, and **image4** captures sister chromatid separation in meiosis II. Both processes are essential for maintaining genetic diversity and reducing chromosome numbers properly.\n\nIn summary:  \n\n- **Meiosis I** separates homologous chromosomes, reducing chromosome number by half, as depicted by the separation of homologous pairs in the images.  \n- **Meiosis II** separates sister chromatids, similar to mitosis, resulting in four haploid cells.  \n\nThus, the main difference lies in what is being separated during each division, with homologous chromosomes in meiosis I and sister chromatids in meiosis II."}

In this setup, Alibaba Cloud DNS is linked to multiple Server Load Balancers, each of which distributes traffic to a group of ECS components, ensuring balanced load and high availability.\n\nSpecifically, the image shows that Alibaba Cloud DNS directs traffic to **multiple** Server Load Balancers—each then connects to **two ECS instances**. This means that each DNS query potentially goes through one Server Load Balancer before reaching one or more ECS components. Given the architecture, the DNS does not contact ECS directly but rather routes through **one load balancer** per query, which then manages traffic to its associated ECS instances.\n\nTherefore, in this architecture, the number of ECS components that the Alibaba Cloud DNS goes through **per request** is typically **two** — one load balancer and then two ECS instances under it. Because the question asks how many ECS components (plural) the DNS interacts with, the best answer based on this architecture is that **the DNS routes traffic through one load balancer, which then distributes to ECS instances, totaling two ECS components per load balancer**.\n\nHowever, if interpreting the question as strictly \"how many ECS components does the DNS connect to,\" then the answer is that **directly, it connects first to a single Server Load Balancer**, which then manages multiple ECS components. If considering the entire chain, the DNS indirectly influences **all ECS instances** associated with those load balancers.\n\n**In summary**, the Alibaba Cloud DNS primarily interacts through the **Server Load Balancer**, which manages **two ECS instances** per load balancer as depicted in the diagram [4].\n\n![A network architecture diagram showing Alibaba Cloud DNS, Server Load Balancers, and ECS instances](image4)"}

From the provided table [5], the typical procedure involves setting the relevant pins to enable programming and then applying the necessary voltage and signals as described in the datasheet.\n\nThe configuration for programming the lock bits generally involves setting the P2.6 pin high, which is designated as a part of the lock programming process, and configuring the other pins according to the \"Program Lock Bits (LBx)\" mode, where P2.7 is set low, P3.6 and P3.7 are set high, and the reset (RST) is active [2][5]. The procedure includes applying the programming voltage (Vpp) on the EA/Vpp pin, pulsing ALE/PROG low to latch the address, and ensuring the P0 and P1 ports are set appropriately—usually with pull-ups enabled [1][4].\n\nThe schematic diagram (image4) shows that the programming voltage of 12.75V is applied to EA/Vpp, while ALE/PROG is pulsed with a duration of approximately 25 microseconds, with precise timing evidenced by waveform diagrams [3][4][9][10]. The lock bits are programmed during this process by holding P2.6 high, which signals the microcontroller to engage in lock bit programming mode. The other control signals and pins are set at the designated \"Program Lock Bits\" levels as per the table.\n\nIn summary, the key pin configurations for programming the lock bits include:\n\n- P2.6 held high to initiate lock bit programming mode\n- P2.7 likely held at a particular level according to the mode\n- P3.6 and P3.7 set high\n- EA/Vpp applied with 12.75V to enable programming\n- ALE/PROG pulsed low for about 25 µs to latch the address\n- P0 and P1 configured according to the programming setup, with pull-ups enabled on P0\n\nThis controlled setup ensures the lock bits are programmed securely, disabling or restricting external access as configured.\n\n![Microcontroller pin configuration for lock bit programming](image4)"}

Notably, the adoption of core clinical systems such as Electronic Medical Records (EMRs) increased slightly from 61% to 62%, indicating a gradual but steady progression toward comprehensive digital records [2, image2]. Similarly, digital picture archiving systems like PACS saw a significant rise from 26% to 42%, reflecting heightened emphasis on imaging technologies [2, image2]. Conversely, some applications, including enterprise-wide clinical sharing, experienced a decline from 49% to 44%, suggesting challenges in broader system integration [2, image2].\n\nIn contrast, priorities like reducing medical errors and implementing EMRs remain prominent, though their relative importance shifted—reducing errors decreased from 50% to 35%, perhaps indicating the initial focus on safety is maturing, while EMR implementation remained high at around 45-46% [4]. Future projections show shifts in strategic focus, with plans to strengthen connectivity, workflow redesign, and upgrade infrastructure, although the percentages for these areas dropped notably in the next two years, hinting at anticipated implementation challenges or saturation points [4].\n\nRegarding barriers during the same period, concerns around security and data protection, such as internal breaches and HIPAA compliance, decreased from 56% to 51% and 35% to 18%, respectively, indicating rising confidence or improved safeguards [1, image1]. However, other obstacles like vendor delivery effectiveness (which increased from 12% to 18%) and legislative restrictions (laws prohibiting technology sharing rising from 0% to 4%) highlight ongoing hurdles [1, image3]. Resources like staffing, leadership support, and strategic planning continued to face issues—though some, such as lack of clinical leadership, increased from 8% to 10%, signaling persistent organizational challenges [3].\n\nOverall, the trends show incremental adoption of critical healthcare IT systems paired with evolving barriers, mainly security, resource allocation, and vendor performance. These interrelated patterns suggest that while healthcare organizations are steadily integrating more IT solutions, they concurrently face persistent security, resource, and strategic obstacles that may temper rapid progression.\n\n![The image illustrates a steady increase in healthcare IT adoption, especially for radiology systems, alongside a decrease in some clinical systems, reflecting evolving priorities](image2)"}

This suggests that, in contests, the utility or satisfaction gains can be exponentially higher due to the value placed on winning, recognition, or reaching a milestone, defying the usual pattern of diminishing returns.\n\nThe images reinforce this contrast. The table with decreasing utility per hot dog consumption exemplifies standard diminishing marginal utility, while the detailed table showing a sharp utility increase at 64 hot dogs and the image of a hot dog tray tied to competition highlight how, in competitive scenarios, utility can spike dramatically at specific thresholds.\n\n![The table illustrating diminishing marginal utility with hot dog consumption](image4)  \n![Hot dog tray tied to a championship highlights reward in competitive context](image5)\n\nIn summary, while normal consumption experiences decreasing satisfaction with each additional unit, competitive contexts can produce utility surges at certain milestones, significantly altering the usual diminishing marginal utility pattern."}

This is evident from the description: \"The image depicts a cell undergoing telophase and cytokinesis, which are stages of cell division. During telophase, the nuclear membrane re-forms around the separated sets of chromosomes, which have moved to opposite ends of the cell. Cytokinesis is the process where the cytoplasm divides, resulting in two daughter cells\" [image1]. The distinct features like reformation of the nuclear envelope and the process of dividing the cytoplasm suggest that the cell is completing mitosis and pinching into two new daughter cells.\n\nFor slide 14, the image displays a cell during **prophase**. The description states: \"The image appears to show a cell during the prophase stage of mitosis. In this phase, the chromatin condenses into visible chromosomes, and the mitotic spindle begins to form\" [image5]. The highlighted condensation of chromatin into chromosomes and the formation of the mitotic spindle are characteristic events of prophase, indicating that the cell is in early mitosis preparing for chromosome separation.\n\nIn summary, slide 12 shows the **telophase and cytokinesis stages**, characterized by nuclear membrane re-formation and cytoplasmic division, while slide 14 illustrates the **prophase stage**, marked by chromosome condensation and spindle formation."}

However, by analyzing the information about data visualization and perception, we can interpret how such trends might be effectively visualized for clarity and insight.\n\nThe 3D bar chart (image1) likely illustrates banana exports from various countries, including Ecuador, over the years 1994 to 2005. Such a chart utilizes principles like proximity and similarity [1][10] to group data points and make comparisons easier. The background image of bananas reinforces the theme of banana export data.\n\nWhile this chart ends at 2005, to understand trends up to 2010, one would need a similar or extended visualization incorporating newer data points. For comparing Ecuador's exports with time spent with family and friends from 2005 to 2010, ideally, dual data visualization or a juxtaposition of graphs would help identify correlations or disparities.\n\nIn contrast, the images about perception and Gestalt principles demonstrate that our understanding of complex data relies on how information is grouped and perceived [2][4][8]. For example, a well-designed graph applies the laws of proximity and similarity to highlight differences or similarities clearly, making trends readily perceptible.\n\nSince the question concerns two different types of data—economic and social—the key lies in designing visualizations that utilize Gestalt laws to clarify comparisons. For instance, a combined chart showing export volumes alongside time spent with loved ones, grouped by year, could reveal whether economic activity correlates with social changes.\n\nIn summary, although explicit data on the trends is not provided, visual principles outlined suggest that effective presentation of such data should leverage grouping and perceptual organization to compare Ecuador’s banana export trends with social time investments from 2005 to 2010. Proper visual grouping helps to see the relationship or lack thereof between economic and social trends clearly.\n\n![The banana export data visualization uses grouping principles like proximity and similarity to distinguish trends over years](image1)"}

In the provided pie charts (image1), the segment representing time spent with family and friends decreased from 35% in 2005 to 21% in 2010. This indicates a significant reduction in leisure time dedicated to social activities. Visually, the segments are close in size but distinct, demonstrating the Gestalt law of proximity, which helps us perceive these segments as separate and comparable groups over the years. The decrease suggests that, over this period, people allocated less of their weekends to social interactions. The principles of grouping and pattern perception (from the Gestalt theories outlined in the text) help interpret this change by emphasizing how visual segmentation emphasizes these differences.\n\n![The pie charts depict a decline in weekend social time from 35% in 2005 to 21% in 2010](image1)  \nThe reduction signifies a shift in social engagement during weekends. This change might be influenced by increasing engagement in activities like watching films and fitness, which saw growth in the same period, as shown in the same chart. The perceptual law of closure and simplicity suggests our tendency to look for clear, simple patterns supports viewing this as a notable and meaningful shift in weekend priorities.\n\nIn conclusion, people's weekend time spent with family and friends decreased notably from 2005 to 2010, reflecting a shift away from social activities towards other pursuits, a perceptual trend highlighted by the change in visual data presentation."}

According to the provided quotes, the process begins with **interphase**, which is a period of cell growth and chromosome duplication, followed by the **mitotic phase**, where the cell divides its nucleus and cytoplasm. \n\nInterphase includes key sub-phases: **G₁ phase**, during which the cell grows and increases its cytoplasm; **S phase**, where DNA replication occurs to duplicate the chromosomes; and **G₂ phase**, where the cell prepares for mitosis by further growth and organelle duplication [4][7]. The diagram in **image1** visually depicts these stages, showing the cell's progression through interphase and into the mitotic phase.\n\nDuring mitosis, the chromosomes condense and align, then separate into two sets, each directed to opposite poles of the cell [8][10]. The specific stages of mitosis include prophase, prometaphase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase, leading to cytokinesis—the division of the cytoplasm—to produce two genetically identical daughter cells [2][10].\n\nIn **image2** and **image3**, cellular structures during interphase and prophase are highlighted, respectively. **image2** shows a cell during interphase with an active nucleus, while **image3** illustrates a cell during prophase with condensed chromosomes and spindle fibers beginning to form. Finally, during chromosome segregation, the chromosomes are pulled apart, as shown in **image4**, leading to the distribution of genetic material into daughter cells.\n\nIn summary, the main stages are:\n\n- **Interphase** (G₁, S, G₂) — cell growth, DNA replication, and preparation for division\n- **Mitotic phase**:\n  - **Prophase** — chromosomes condense\n  - **Prometaphase** — nuclear envelope breaks down, spindle attaches\n  - **Metaphase** — chromosomes align\n  - **Anaphase** — sister chromatids separate\n  - **Telophase** — nuclear envelopes re-form\n  - **Cytokinesis** — cytoplasm divides, forming two daughter cells\n\nThis structured progression ensures accurate duplication and division of the cell's genetic material."}

The focus modes, as described in the table with focus on [1], include AF-S (single autofocus), AF-C (continuous autofocus), and MF (manual focus). Using these modes appropriately helps capture sharp images: AF-S is ideal for stationary subjects, ensuring focus remains steady [1], while AF-C is suited for moving subjects, maintaining focus as they move [1]. The manual focus (MF) allows direct control to focus on specific subjects like faces or details [1], which is beneficial in complex or macro shots.\n\nThe metering modes, elaborated in the images and explanations with references to [3], [4], and [5], determine how the camera measures light in a scene to calculate proper exposure. Matrix metering evaluates the entire frame, making it suitable for landscapes where light is evenly distributed [5]. Center metering emphasizes the central area, useful in portraits where the subject’s face is in the center [5], and spot metering targets a specific area, perfect for situations where the subject is differently lit from the background, such as backlit scenes [5]. Adjusting these modes ensures correct exposure, whether capturing a brightly lit cityscape or a dimly lit subject.\n\nBy combining appropriate focus and metering modes, photographers can optimize image clarity and brightness depending on the environment. For instance, using AF-C focus mode with spot metering allows tracking and exposing a moving subject in a tricky lighting condition, ensuring both focus and exposure are accurate [1], [5]. Conversely, setting MF with matrix metering is effective for static scenes where manual control is preferred, like in still life photography.\n\nThe images highlight the customizable interface of Pro Mode, showing controls for focus, ISO, shutter speed, and metering mode [2]. This flexibility enables photographers to adapt quickly, enhancing image quality whether in high-motion environments or low-light situations. Overall, leveraging these modes precisely aligns camera behavior with scene requirements, enabling users to achieve professional-quality results across diverse photography scenarios.\n\n![The image shows a labeled diagram of a smartphone camera interface in \"Pro\" mode with various control options](image2)"}

From the data provided, the overall MQL to SAL conversion rate is approximately **1.50%** as shown in the sales and marketing performance metrics image [4], indicating that only a small portion of MQLs are being accepted by sales in that particular dataset. This low rate suggests potential issues such as overly lenient MQL criteria, misaligned expectations between marketing and sales, or a need for better lead qualification processes.\n\nIn contrast, the cross-industry average conversion rates depicted in the funnel overview [5] indicate much higher percentages, with SAL acceptance rates ranging from **45% to 75%** at a broad industry level. These figures imply that when leads are properly qualified, a majority are accepted by sales, leading to more efficient pipeline progression and higher conversion efficiency.\n\nThe implications of these differences are significant: a low MQL-to-SAL rate of 1.50% suggests either that the marketing team is generating leads that are not sales-ready, or that the criteria for MQLs in the dataset are too broad, resulting in a large number of leads that do not meet sales expectations. This misalignment can lead to wasted sales resources and longer sales cycles. Conversely, the higher industry averages demonstrate that with effective qualification and alignment, organizations can achieve much higher acceptance rates, thus increasing sales opportunities and revenue efficiency. Improving the quality and qualification criteria of MQLs, aligning marketing and sales definitions, and implementing tighter lead scoring could help bridge this gap and boost the conversion rate.\n\n![The sales and marketing performance metrics dashboard showing MQL to SAL conversion rates, emphasizing the small percentage of MQLs accepted by sales [4]](image4)"}
