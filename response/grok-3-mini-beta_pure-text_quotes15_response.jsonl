Among the public, only 41% rate the GOP's ethical standards as high, and similar criticism applies to the Trump administration, with deep partisan splits: 75% of Republicans view the administration's ethical standards positively, while 86% of Democrats rate them negatively [5, 8]. ![A bar chart displaying varied ratings of performance or standards, such as poor or excellent, segmented by total public and political affiliations](image1) This data underscores how ethical concerns are polarized, with Republicans showing more favorable views compared to Democrats.\n\nWhen comparing these aspects directly, the line graphs illustrate that confidence in economic policy has risen slightly to 53% by May 2018, reflecting a more mixed but improving sentiment over time ![Line graphs showing the increase in public confidence in Trump's economic policy decisions from 46% in January 2018 to 53% in May 2018, alongside trends in other areas](image3). In contrast, ethical standards lag behind, as seen in the broader ratings where Democrats overwhelmingly disapprove, highlighting a gap where economic policy garners more confidence among Republicans than ethical perceptions do across groups.\n\nIn summary, views on Trump's economic policy are somewhat more positive and improving among Republicans, while perceptions of his ethical standards are largely negative and highly divided by political affiliation."}

This connection is evident in how demographic and ideological divides, such as those among Republicans and Democrats, influence both ethical views and job approval, with Trump's ratings showing consistent patterns of disapproval that align with the ethical critiques. Ultimately, the lower ethical standards ratings for Trump's administration directly correlate with his job approval being relatively modest compared to past presidents. \n\nIn summary, Trump's administration ethical standards are rated lower than those of previous administrations, and this is closely tied to his own job approval ratings remaining subdued."}

For instance, conservative Republicans tend to emphasize a tougher stance, often linking human rights concerns with broader economic pressures, as seen in sentiments where 81% of them advocate for getting tougher on China rather than building stronger ties [9]. This reflects a perception that economic relations should not overshadow human rights, potentially leading to more confrontational policies.\n\nOn the other hand, Democrats, particularly liberal ones, also strongly favor promoting human rights, with about 76% of liberal Democrats supporting this priority even if it harms economic relations, though they are more inclined toward maintaining or building economic ties compared to Republicans [6].

These trends suggest that streaming's rapid growth to become the largest share of the business [7] is reshaping how genres compete, with streaming favoring genres that offer bite-sized, accessible content.\n\nThe implications for the music industry are noteworthy: genres like rock, which thrive on album sales and catalogs, may face challenges as streaming prioritizes immediate, genre-agnostic hits, potentially pushing artists toward creating content for platforms that emphasize trends over longevity [5]. This could lead to a greater focus on digital strategies, revenue shifts toward streaming services, and the elevation of trendsetters in streaming-heavy genres, influencing marketing, artist development, and overall market share.\n\nIn summary, streaming trends favor R&B/hip-hop and pop for their high engagement, while album sales remain stronger in rock, implying a broader industry shift toward digital formats that may prioritize accessibility and current content over traditional sales."}

This bias is particularly evident in scenarios with low query budgets, where these methods often fail to select data from all classes, resulting in unbalanced outcomes.\n\nTo illustrate, the analysis in Figure 7 shows that VAAL heavily prefers certain classes like femur-right and platelets while ignoring others, such as lung or monocyte, even with a larger initial budget [6]. Similarly, across multiple datasets, graphs comparing strategies with and without enforced diversity reveal that methods like VAAL and Margin perform worse in terms of balanced class coverage when diversity is not prioritized ![Strategies like VAAL and Margin show lower AUC without diversity due to poor label balance](image3).\n\nOn the PathMNIST dataset specifically, a detailed bar graph highlights the class distributions for each strategy, where VAAL exhibits the lowest entropy (2.800), indicating a highly imbalanced selection that favors classes like muscle while neglecting others such as mucus and mucosa ![VAAL demonstrates the worst label diversity with the lowest entropy and skewed class distribution](image5).\n\nIn summary, based on the consistent patterns of bias and low entropy observed across these datasets, VAAL generally yields the worst label diversity."}

For instance, the dataset emphasizes functions like simple lookups, which involve directly retrieving a cell's value, and comparisons, which assess relationships between numbers, as key components of the reasoning process [3].\n\nTo illustrate these reasoning types and their proportions, consider the following breakdown from the dataset's evaluation: ![A table showing the proportions of various reasoning functions, such as simple lookup at 20.6% and comparison at 19.5%](image1). This distribution highlights that straightforward tasks like simple lookups and comparisons dominate, making up over 40% of the reasoning, while more specialized functions, such as those requiring closed-domain knowledge (12.1%) or basic arithmetic like subtraction (5.3%), play supporting roles.\n\nThese reasoning types are closely tied to the distribution of reasoning steps, which indicates the depth of analysis needed for each claim. For example, the dataset reveals a spectrum where \"shallow\" claims (1–2 steps) are common, but many require \"deep\" reasoning with multiple steps: ![A histogram of reasoning steps, showing that 6% of claims involve 1 step and up to 20% involve 5 steps, with deeper claims generally increasing complexity](image3). This suggests that reasoning types like comparisons or arithmetic operations often align with claims needing more steps, as they build upon initial lookups to handle layered verifications.\n\nFurthermore, the relationship between these reasoning types and common error types underscores the challenges in the dataset. Errors frequently arise from mismatches in how models handle these functions, such as grounding errors when associating data with table cells or ambiguity in claims that involve knowledge-based reasoning [3]. As seen in the error analysis, the proportions of these issues include grounding errors at 50%, which often stem from complex reasoning types like those requiring domain knowledge: ![A table detailing error proportions, such as grounding errors at 50% and ambiguity errors at 22%](image5). This connection implies that reasoning types with higher cognitive demands, like comparisons or knowledge extraction, contribute to errors in multi-step processes, amplifying inaccuracies in deeper claims.\n\nOverall, the main reasoning types in the ScITab dataset, such as simple lookups and comparisons with proportions from 20.6% to 5.3%, relate to reasoning steps and error types by showing that more complex functions often lead to errors in multi-step verifications, highlighting the dataset's realistic challenges."}

Specifically, the most prevalent reasons include incorrect calculation results, which account for a significant portion, followed by issues with approximation words and partial accuracy in claims. This diversity underscores the dataset's complexity, as these errors reflect real-world challenges in interpreting scientific data.\n\nTo visualize this breakdown more clearly, consider the distribution of refuted reasons as shown in the following table: ![The table summarizes the main reasons for refuted claims in SciTab, including incorrect calculations at 41.7% and wrong approximations at 33.3%.](image1)\n\nTurning to the performance of large language models (LLMs) in fact-checking these claims, evaluations reveal that models struggle significantly in both zero-shot and in-context settings, particularly when dealing with the nuances of scientific tables [2, 3]. In zero-shot scenarios, where models lack specific training on the dataset, even top performers like FLAN-T5-XL achieve only modest results, with F1 scores around 38.05 for 3-class classification, far below human benchmarks of 84.73 [3]. When provided with in-context examples, improvements are noted but remain limited, as table-based LLMs do not consistently outperform text-based ones due to differences in table structures and claim complexity [7]. For example, confusion matrices for models like InstructGPT and GPT-4 in zero-shot 3-class tasks illustrate this, with GPT-4 showing better accuracy in predicting \"supported\" claims but still misclassifying many as \"refuted\" or \"NEI\" [8].\n\nHere's a direct comparison of LLM performances across various categories: ![The table compares LLM performances in zero-shot and in-context settings, showing scores for 2-class and 3-class classification, with human performance exceeding all models.](image4)\n\nAdditionally, the confusion matrices highlight specific weaknesses, such as models frequently confusing \"refuted\" claims with \"NEI,\" which points to difficulties in handling ambiguity: ![The image presents confusion matrices for InstructGPT and GPT-4 in zero-shot 3-class classification, revealing high misclassification rates for NEI and refuted claims.](image3)\n\nIn summary, the primary reasons for refuted claims in the SciTab dataset are errors like incorrect calculations and wrong approximations, while large language models generally underperform compared to humans in fact-checking these claims across zero-shot and in-context settings."}

For instance, refuted claims frequently involve issues like incorrect calculation results or wrong approximation words, which account for a significant portion of errors [8], and this diversity in error types reflects the dataset's realistic representation of scientific complexities [3]. Similarly, NEI claims are commonly due to a lack of matching evidence in the tables or the need for additional background knowledge, including closed- or open-domain information, which can make claims unverifiable without further context [3].\n\nThese reasons directly challenge model performance in zero-shot 3-class classification, where models must classify claims as 'supported', 'refuted', or 'NEI' without prior training on the dataset. As highlighted in analyses, models like InstructGPT and GPT-4 struggle particularly with the NEI category, often misclassifying it due to overconfidence or a tendency to default to safer predictions, which exacerbates errors in distinguishing verifiable from unverifiable claims [6, 10]. ![Confusion matrices for InstructGPT and GPT-4 showing frequent misclassifications of NEI claims in zero-shot 3-class tasks](image2) This pattern of misclassification, evident in the confusion matrices, underscores how the ambiguities in NEI and refuted claims lead to poorer overall accuracy compared to 2-class settings, as models fail to handle the nuanced reasoning required [10].\n\n![Table detailing the primary reasons and proportions for refuted and NEI claims in ScITaB](image4) Ultimately, the prevalence of these error types in refuted and NEI claims highlights the dataset's demanding nature, contributing to subpar model performance by exposing limitations in handling complex scientific reasoning.\n\nTo summarize, the primary reasons for refuted and NEI claims in ScITaB—such as calculation errors and lack of evidence—significantly hinder models' accuracy in zero-shot 3-class classification by causing frequent misclassifications."}

For instance, GPT-4 achieves a higher accuracy in predicting the \"Supported\" and \"Refuted\" classes, with 32.1% true positives for \"Supported\" compared to only 9.1% for InstructGPT, while both models struggle with the \"NEI\" (Not Enough Information) class, though in different ways [10]. This difference highlights GPT-4's stronger capability in complex reasoning tasks, as it tends to be more confident but overconfident, often misclassifying NEI claims as supported or refuted, whereas InstructGPT is less confident and frequently defaults to NEI for uncertain cases, as detailed in the confusion matrices.\n\nTo visualize this performance gap, the confusion matrices provide a clear breakdown: InstructGPT shows lower precision across all classes, with high NEI predictions for both supported and refuted claims, contributing to its overall weaker results ![Confusion matrices show InstructGPT's lower accuracy and frequent NEI misclassifications compared to GPT-4's higher accuracy but overconfidence in zero-shot 3-class task](image3).\n\nFurther analyzing the types of errors that drive these performance differences, the evaluation reveals that both models face challenges like grounding errors—where the model fails to correctly reference table data—and ambiguity errors, which are particularly problematic for scientific claims involving vague language [9]. For example, InstructGPT's errors are exacerbated by its tendency to err on the side of caution with NEI, potentially due to issues in accurately grounding claims to table cells, while GPT-4's overconfidence might stem from calculation or program-related mistakes.

For instance, InstructGPT tends to exhibit a \"less confident\" approach, frequently misclassifying supported and refuted claims as NEI, which suggests it prioritizes caution over precision in ambiguous scenarios, as evidenced by its confusion matrix showing high percentages of NEI predictions for actual supported (26.8%) and refuted (23.6%) claims. ![The confusion matrix illustrates InstructGPT's tendency to over-predict NEI for supported and refuted claims, while GPT-4 shows overconfidence by misclassifying NEI as supported or refuted](image2) In contrast, GPT-4 demonstrates greater overall accuracy, achieving a macro-F1 score of 64.80 in the 3-class setting, but it leans toward overconfidence, often incorrectly labeling NEI claims as supported (10.3%) or refuted (8.5%), which highlights its strength in complex reasoning but also a vulnerability in discerning unverifiable claims [6].

For instance, InstructGPT tends to exhibit \"less confidence,\" often misclassifying supported or refuted claims as NEI, which suggests it errs on the side of caution when faced with ambiguous or insufficient evidence, leading to over-prediction of the NEI category [5]. In contrast, GPT-4 shows \"overconfidence,\" frequently categorizing actual NEI claims as either supported or refuted, which indicates a tendency to force interpretations even when evidence is lacking [5]. This difference underscores a key challenge: InstructGPT's conservative approach may stem from its reliance on probabilistic predictions that prioritize neutrality, while GPT-4's aggressive classification could arise from its advanced reasoning capabilities that sometimes overgeneralize from limited context.\n\nTo visualize these patterns, the confusion matrices for both models reveal the extent of their misclassifications, ![The confusion matrix illustrates the percentage distribution of predictions for InstructGPT and GPT-4 across Supported, Refuted, and NEI classes, highlighting their specific errors in NEI classification](image5) with InstructGPT showing higher NEI predictions for true supported/refuted claims (e.g., 26.8% for actual supported) compared to GPT-4, which has a more balanced but erroneous distribution for NEI (e.g., only 10.4% correct NEI predictions) [5].

Similarly, [7] highlights that increasing the number of demonstration samples from 1 to 5 yields evident improvements in micro-F1, and combining this with logical constraints provides even more stable gains, sometimes outperforming setups with more demonstrations alone.\n\nThis pattern is evident in experimental results, where models like GPT-4 and Llama2 show significant enhancements when logical constraints are added to chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting [4], and pre-training with these constraints leads to substantial performance increases [9].

For instance, logical constraints involve incorporating rules directly into prompts or training to guide LLMs toward more accurate reasoning, as noted in the studies [8] and [9], which highlight how retrieval-based logical constraints significantly lower LI while improving overall performance, such as in Table 2 where models like Turbo, Davinci, and GPT-4 show reduced LI percentages when constraints are added. In contrast, post-processing involves correcting outputs after generation, which guarantees zero LI by enforcing rules retrospectively, but it can sometimes compromise the quality of responses due to potential semantic shifts or the need for additional operations.\n\nThis comparison is further illustrated in the performance data across models. For example, the table in image1, which summarizes model evaluations on MAVEN-ERE and Causal-TimeBank, reveals that while post-processing consistently achieves 0% LI for models like GPT-4 and Llama2, logical constraints provide a more balanced improvement by reducing LI (e.g., to low percentages) without drastically altering the original output, as seen in the Micro-F1 scores that remain competitive. ![A table comparing model performance on MAVEN-ERE and Causal-TimeBank, showing reductions in LI with logical constraints and post-processing](image1) Similarly, the detailed results for fine-tuned models in image3 demonstrate that for Vicuna-13B-PT and Llama2-13B-PT, logical constraints often yield strong Micro-F1 scores alongside moderate LI reductions, whereas post-processing hits 0% LI but may not always match the efficiency of constraints in real-time applications. ![A table detailing performance improvements for Vicuna-13B-PT and Llama2-13B-PT on datasets, with post-processing achieving 0% LI](image3) Additionally, image4 provides a broader view, showing that across models like RoBERTa-Large and GPT-4, logical constraints integrated with chain-of-thought prompting lead to more reliable LI reductions compared to post-processing, which excels in eliminating inconsistencies but at the risk of over-editing responses. ![A table evaluating various models on tasks, including LI reductions with logical constraints](image4)\n\nOverall, logical constraints tend to be more effective for maintaining both accuracy and consistency in a proactive manner, while post-processing is highly effective at achieving perfect consistency but may introduce trade-offs in response quality.\n\nIn summary, logical constraints are generally more effective than post-processing for reducing logical inconsistency in LLMs across the MAVEN-ERE and Causal-TimeBank datasets, as they improve performance holistically without overly disrupting original outputs."}

For instance, it supports iterative or adaptive flows, like the Demonstrate-Search-Predict framework, where modules interact to refine queries and retrieval based on specific scenarios, reducing redundancy and improving precision [6].\n\nA dedicated visualization of these advanced processes demonstrates how Modular RAG enables techniques like iterative retrieval, where the system alternates between retrieval and generation to build richer context, or adaptive retrieval, which decides on-the-fly whether external knowledge is needed ![This image details iterative, recursive, and adaptive retrieval processes used in Modular RAG for enhanced query handling](image4).

However, [5] highlights that this benefit is not uniform across all cases; alignment may not be necessary for bilingual systems but proves more advantageous in multilingual ones, as seen in the varying impacts on different language pairs.\n\nTo illustrate this, consider the evaluation metrics in a comparative table ![A table demonstrating that alignment improves evaluation scores in multilingual setups](image3), which shows higher scores for \"align\" compared to \"std\" or \"pre\" in pairs like GL to EN (e.g., 22.4 vs. 20.8) and AZ to TR (7.5 vs. 5.9), indicating that alignment generally boosts performance for similar language pairs. Similarly, another table ![A table illustrating the changes in scores when aligning embeddings for various language pairs](image4) reveals mixed results: for GL → EN, alignment slightly decreases the score (from 12.8 to 11.5), suggesting potential downsides in some cases, while for RU → EN, it shows a small improvement (from 21.1 to 21.4), underscoring that the effect depends on the language pair's inherent similarities and the specific translation task.\n\nRegarding the observed differences in F-measure scores for target words based on their frequency in the training corpus, pre-trained embeddings tend to provide a notable advantage, especially for less frequent words, as they offer better representations when training data is limited. [8] explains that pre-training improves translation accuracy across the vocabulary, with the most substantial gains for low-frequency words, which aligns with the experimental findings.\n\nThis is visually supported by a bar chart ![A bar chart showing that pre-trained embeddings often outperform standard ones in F-measure for words across frequency ranges](image2), where the \"pre\" bars (in red) generally exceed the \"std\" bars (in blue) for lower frequency ranges (e.g., words with frequency 1 or 2), though both increase with higher frequencies up to 1000+. For example, in the lowest frequency bins, the \"pre\" F-measure is higher, demonstrating that pre-training helps mitigate the challenges of rare words, but the gap narrows as word frequency rises.\n\nIn summary, aligning word embeddings enhances translation performance more in multilingual systems and for certain language pairs, while pre-trained embeddings improve F-measure scores, particularly for low-frequency words in the training corpus."}

These ablations reveal that the model's reliance on these elements varies, with overall performance generally declining due to the loss of relational and contextual information that aids in multi-hop reasoning tasks [1, 3].\n\nFor instance, the removal of the R-GCN component, which updates mention representations based on their relations, leads to noticeable drops in accuracy. In one set of experiments, using ELMo without R-GCN results in scores of 62.4 for unmasked and 63.2 for masked conditions, compared to higher performances when R-GCN is included [2, 4]. This highlights that R-GCN's role in propagating information across related entities is crucial, especially since its absence means the model loses the ability to leverage inter-entity connections effectively. Similarly, when GloVe embeddings are used instead of ELMo and R-GCN is removed, performance falls further to 51.2 in unmasked and 11.6 in masked settings, underscoring the compounded impact in scenarios where contextual encoding is already weakened [3].\n\nTurning to relation types, eliminating them entirely—such as by fully connecting nodes without distinguishing edge types—only yields marginal improvements over a baseline without R-GCN, with scores of 62.7 for unmasked and 63.9 for masked [9]. This suggests that a naive graph structure doesn't provide significant benefits, as the model needs more sophisticated edge distinctions to perform well. Digging deeper into specific relations, as explored in the ablations, removing DOC-BASED connections (which link mentions in the same document) results in 62.9 for unmasked and 65.8 for masked, while omitting MATCH (exact matching of mentions) leads to 64.3 for unmasked and 67.4 for masked [1]. Interestingly, removing COREF (coreference links) has a slightly less severe effect, with 64.8 for unmasked, but this still indicates that coreference, though not always reliable, contributes to overall accuracy [1]. These findings are visually summarized in a comparative table that outlines performance metrics across these configurations, as seen here: ![A table showing performance drops when removing R-GCN and relations, with unmasked scores ranging from 51.2 to 68.5 and masked from 11.1 to 71.6](image1).\n\nIn summary, the evidence shows that these removals typically degrade performance, with greater impacts in masked conditions where contextual cues are scarcer, emphasizing the importance of relational structures for robust reasoning.\n\nRemoving components like R-GCN, relation types, and specific relations such as MATCH and COREF generally leads to decreased model accuracy in both unmasked and masked settings, with the extent of the drop depending on the component's role in capturing entity connections."}

In the unmasked setting, where mentions of entities might differ (e.g., \"US\" vs. \"United States\"), coreference helps connect these variations, but the results show a slight performance drop on the test set, possibly due to the coreference system's limitations on harder documents [6]. ![A graph illustrating nodes connected by coreference links as bold-red lines, showing how such connections integrate with other relations like co-occurrence and exact matches](image1) This visual representation underscores how coreference edges (bold-red lines) are integrated into the entity graph, potentially aiding in capturing relational dependencies, though their overall benefit appears marginal compared to other connections like those based on document co-occurrence.\n\nIn contrast, the masked setting simplifies entity references by using consistent identifiers (e.g., MASK1), reducing the need for coreference resolution [2], and experiments indicate that models perform stronger here without it, as seen in ablation studies [6]. For instance, the performance metrics from comparative evaluations reveal that removing coreference edges leads to better results in masked scenarios, with Entity-GCN without coreference achieving 70.5 on masked development, while with coreference it drops slightly in unmasked test accuracy from 67.6 to 66.4 [6]. ![A table comparing model performances, including the effects of removing coreference features, with scores for unmasked and masked settings](image2) This table further demonstrates the trade-offs, as \"No COREF\" configurations show improved or maintained accuracy in masked evaluations relative to unmasked ones.\n\nOverall, while coreference can provide additional relational context, its inclusion often results in mixed outcomes, with potential benefits in development sets but risks of degradation in test sets due to system reliability issues. ![A table showing Entity-GCN performance with and without coreference, indicating higher unmasked test accuracy without coreference and strong masked development scores](image4)\n\nIn summary, the inclusion of coreference information tends to have a neutral or slightly negative impact on Entity-GCN performance, particularly in unmasked settings where it may introduce errors."}

This trend is further supported by data comparing these systems across eight languages—Spanish, French, Italian, Russian, Ukrainian, Hebrew, Arabic, and German—where accuracy (Acc) is often below 50-60%, and bias metrics like Δ_G (difference in performance between masculine and feminine) and Δ_S (difference between pro-stereotypical and anti-stereotypical roles) reveal stronger biases, with higher Δ_S values indicating poorer handling of anti-stereotypical scenarios [4] [9].\n\nTo illustrate these variations, consider the detailed breakdown of metrics for each system, which shows Google Translate achieving higher accuracy in French (63.6%) and Hebrew (53.7%), while Microsoft Translator excels in German (74.1%), but all systems display significant Δ_S changes, such as in Arabic for SYSTRAN (49.4%) ![This table compares accuracy and bias metrics across multiple machine translation systems and languages, revealing performance differences](image2).

For instance, these systems perform better on sentences with pro-stereotypical assignments—such as associating a female entity with roles like nurse—compared to anti-stereotypical ones, like a male receptionist, which can lead to inaccurate gender portrayals in the target language. To address this, researchers have explored adjustments by incorporating stereotypical gender adjectives, such as adding \"pretty\" before a female entity, which aims to counteract the system's default biases and improve accuracy [8].\n\nThis approach is illustrated in specific data from evaluations, where modifying sentences with such adjectives significantly boosted gender prediction accuracy in certain languages; for example, in Spanish (ES), the original accuracy improved from 53.1% to 63.5%, while Russian (RU) saw an increase from 37.7% to 48.9% ![Table showing improvements in gender accuracy after adding stereotypical adjectives to sentences in Spanish, Russian, and Ukrainian](image2). Meanwhile, a broader comparison across languages reveals the baseline impact of stereotypes, with accuracy consistently higher for stereotypical translations—such as 67% for Spanish versus 46% for non-stereotypical—highlighting the pervasive bias before adjustments ![Bar chart comparing Google Translate's higher accuracy for stereotypical gender translations versus lower accuracy for non-stereotypical ones across eight languages](image1).\n\nReal-world examples further demonstrate how these adjustments work: in cases like translating \"The janitor does not like the baker because she always messes up the kitchen,\" adding \"pretty\" shifts the Spanish translation from a biased male inflection (\"el panadero\") to a corrected female one (\"la panadera\"), effectively reducing gender mismatches [8]. However, while these modifications show promise in languages like Spanish, Russian, and Ukrainian [6], their overall effectiveness varies, as they rely on precise contextual cues and may not fully eliminate bias in more complex scenarios.\n\nIn summary, stereotype-based adjustments in machine translation can enhance gender bias accuracy by providing countervailing signals to the system's biases, particularly in languages like Spanish, Russian, and Ukrainian, though results depend on the language's grammatical structure and the adjustment's implementation."}

This is evident in the data where original training yields a lower F1 of 46.84 on adversarial distractors, but adversarial training boosts it to 60.10, highlighting how robust training data enhances generalization ![Adversarial training improves F1 on adversarial evaluation from 46.84 to 60.10](image4). \n\nIn multi-hop scenarios, where questions often require connecting multiple pieces of information, strategies like using stronger distractors or better retrieval methods are crucial; [4] notes that even with 500 distractors, F1 scores remain insufficient at 53.12, suggesting that future datasets need improved distractor selection to truly test multi-hop capabilities. Similarly, open-domain settings reveal retrieval shortcomings, as [5] explains that failing to retrieve relevant paragraphs drops F1 to 39.12, but adding gold paragraphs raises it to 53.12, underscoring the impact of retrieval strategies ![F1 scores vary by setting, with distractor at 67.08 and improvements when adding gold paragraphs](image2). For single-hop questions, models perform better overall, but the categorization in [2] shows that multi-hop questions achieve only 54.46 F1 compared to 70.54 for single-hop ones, indicating that strategies must account for question type to avoid chance-level accuracy [8] ![F1 scores for question types show multi-hop at 54.46 and single-hop at 70.54](image3).\n\nOverall, these strategies demonstrate that adaptive training and evaluation methods, such as incorporating adversarial data or enhancing retrieval, can substantially improve F1 scores by better aligning models with the demands of multi-hop and single-hop tasks.

For instance, closed vocabulary models, which treat out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words uniformly, generally exhibit lower sensitivity because they map OOV words to similar internal representations, reducing the variety of unique outputs during perturbations [8]. In contrast, open vocabulary models are more sensitive since they differentiate based on character combinations, leading to a higher number of unique predictions and potentially greater vulnerability to attacks [4].\n\nThis difference is evident in experimental results, where the neutral backoff strategy consistently shows the lowest sensitivity across both model types by mapping uncertain predictions (like UNK) to a fixed neutral word, which minimizes options for attackers [7]. However, WER tends to be lower in models using background backoff, as it leverages a larger corpus to handle rare or unseen words more accurately, though this doesn't always translate to better overall robustness [9]. For example, in closed vocabulary settings, the pass-through strategy might maintain similar WER but lower sensitivity compared to open vocabulary models, where the same strategy results in higher WER due to the increased complexity of handling diverse character permutations [10].\n\nTo visualize this trade-off, ![Scatter plots illustrate the relationship between sensitivity and WER, showing that closed vocabulary models (e.g., word-only) have lower sensitivity ranges and moderate WER, while open vocabulary models exhibit higher sensitivity with varying WER, impacting robustness](image4).

For instance, total AUM rose from $471 billion in 2018 to $657 billion in 2020, reflecting strong growth that can be attributed to positive net flows and market impacts, as these elements often boost the assets available for management [9]. This expansion is further detailed in the breakdown of AUM categories, where equity AUM jumped from $111 billion to $174 billion, fixed income from $71 billion to $86 billion, and alternative/other from $131 billion to $145 billion, alongside other factors like inflows and outflows that contributed to this upward trend. ![The table shows increases in AUM for various categories from 2018 to 2020](image4) Additionally, the metrics for AUM changes, including inflows, outflows, and market impacts, highlight how external market conditions played a role in this growth, potentially enhancing the firm's capacity to generate revenue through larger asset bases.\n\nIn contrast, fee rates generally declined during the same timeframe, which could temper the revenue gains from higher AUM. Specifically, the average fee rate for total AUM dropped from 47 basis points (bps) in 2018 to 42 bps in 2020, with similar decreases in categories like fixed income (from 33 bps to 29 bps) and alternative/other (from 66 bps to 58 bps), while equity rates remained stable at 76 bps. ![The table illustrates decreasing fee rates across most AUM categories from 2018 to 2020](image1) This downward trend in fee rates [4] might be linked to competitive pressures or strategic adjustments, such as changes in advisory fees and waivers, which could reduce the per-unit revenue from managed assets even as AUM expanded.\n\nOverall, the combination of rising AUM and falling fee rates suggests a mixed impact on the firm's revenues: the increase in AUM likely drove higher asset management revenues, as seen in the 15% rise in 2020 [9], but the lower fee rates may have partially offset this by decreasing the revenue per dollar of AUM. Factors like market impact [5] could further influence this dynamic by affecting investment performance and fee calculations.\n\nIn conclusion, AUM grew substantially from 2018 to 2020 while fee rates mostly declined, likely resulting in increased firm revenues due to the larger asset base despite lower rates per asset."}

For example, insurance underwriting earnings improved steadily, rising from $325 million in 2019 to $728 million in 2021, though this was partly offset by losses from catastrophes and other factors like increased claims [2]. The railroad segment saw a decline in 2020 due to lower shipping volumes amid the pandemic but rebounded with a 16.1% increase in 2021, reaching $5,990 million, thanks to higher freight volumes and productivity gains [7]. Meanwhile, manufacturing, service, and retailing earnings dropped 11.4% in 2020 from $9,372 million in 2019 but surged 34.0% to $11,120 million in 2021, reflecting stronger demand despite supply chain disruptions [10]. Insurance investment income, however, declined over the period, falling 8.9% from 2019 to 2020 and an additional 4.6% in 2021, largely due to lower interest rates on cash holdings [9].

For instance, the provision started at $3,562 million in 2018 and increased to $4,973 million in 2020, reflecting a rise from 22.3% to 24.0% of the effective tax rate, which can be seen in the breakdown of various components like state income taxes and non-deductible items that added to the overall burden over these years. This pattern aligns with the current income tax provision reflecting taxable revenues and expenses, as noted in the broader explanation of tax consequences [1].\n\nTo visualize these trends more clearly, consider the detailed table of income tax provisions, which highlights the shift in current and deferred components: ![A table breaking down current and deferred income tax provisions for 2018-2020, showing an increase in total provisions driven by federal, state, and foreign elements](image5). From this, we observe that the current provision grew steadily from $3,520 million in 2018 to $4,981 million in 2020, while the deferred provision fluctuated, moving from a $42 million provision in 2018 to a slight benefit of $(8) million in 2020, indicating some offsetting effects from timing differences in tax recognition.\n\nDeferred income tax assets and liabilities play a key role in these trends by creating net liabilities that generally increased over the period, potentially reducing the overall tax benefit and contributing to higher provisions [6]. For example, total deferred income tax assets net of valuation allowances rose from $2,868 million in 2019 to $3,391 million in 2020, but this was outweighed by liabilities growing from $5,861 million to $6,758 million, resulting in a larger net deferred tax liability of $3,367 million in 2020 compared to $2,993 million in 2019. This net increase in liabilities, as illustrated in the relevant table, likely stems from items like intangible assets and depreciation differences, which deferred more taxes into future periods and thus amplified the effective tax provision observed in the reconciliations.\n\nOverall, the trends indicate rising income tax provisions due to increasing taxable income and adjustments, with deferred items contributing by expanding net liabilities and limiting tax benefits. In summary, the company's provisions for income taxes increased from 2018 to 2020, primarily driven by higher current taxes, while growing deferred tax liabilities helped sustain this upward trend by postponing potential relief."}

In 2019, the company's liabilities were composed of current liabilities totaling $3,205 million and noncurrent liabilities at $5,351 million, making for a combined total of $8,556 million [3]. By 2020, these figures had risen significantly, with current liabilities reaching $5,342 million and noncurrent liabilities at $7,789 million, resulting in a total of $13,131 million. This represents a substantial increase of approximately $4,575 million in overall liabilities, as illustrated in the detailed breakdown provided in the table ![The table details current and noncurrent liabilities totals for 2020 and 2019](image2).\n\nThis growth in liabilities can be linked to various factors, such as increases in items like compensation and benefits, taxes, deferred revenue, and derivative liabilities, which may reflect operational expansions or market fluctuations. However, when considering total debt specifically, the picture is different: according to the financial records, total debt decreased slightly from $21,729 million in 2019 to $21,204 million in 2020 [3], as shown in the table outlining debt components ![The table lists total debt amounts for 2020 and 2019, including senior notes and commercial paper](image4). This minor reduction in total debt, despite the rise in broader liabilities, suggests that the company might have managed its debt obligations effectively through refinancing or reduced borrowings under facilities like the Five-Year Facility, while other non-debt liabilities (such as deferred revenue or derivatives) grew due to business activities.\n\nIn summary, the increase in total current and noncurrent liabilities from 2019 to 2020 contrasts with a slight decrease in total debt, likely due to strategic debt management and shifts in liability composition."}

Specifically, according to the detailed financial data, the effective tax rate rose from 18.3% in 2019 to 22.5% in 2020, while net discrete tax provisions shifted from a benefit of $475 million in 2019 to $122 million in 2020, indicating a significant decrease in tax benefits ![The table shows the effective tax rate increased from 18.3% in 2019 to 22.5% in 2020, with net discrete tax benefits decreasing from $475 million to $122 million](image4). This change in tax dynamics appears connected to the Firm's compensation structure, particularly as compensation expenses increased overall in 2020, with factors like higher discretionary incentives and costs linked to deferred compensation plans [9], which could indirectly influence tax outcomes through items like share-based awards. For instance, the total recognized compensation expense grew from $1,878 million in 2019 to $2,119 million in 2020, reflecting rises in deferred cash-based awards and returns on referenced investments ![The table indicates total compensation expenses rose from $1,878 million in 2019 to $2,119 million in 2020, driven by increases in deferred awards and investment returns](image5).

According to the reports, net income saw a notable decline from 2019, dropping by 1% in nominal terms and 22% in constant currencies to $4.7 billion [4], largely driven by a reduction in operating earnings as businesses adapted to global disruptions [9]. This decrease was further compounded by a 19% drop in operating income (or 20% in constant currencies), after accounting for net strategic gains of $268 million from the sale of McDonald's Japan stock [6]. Meanwhile, comprehensive income, which includes net income plus other comprehensive income components such as foreign currency translation and cash flow hedges, fell from $6,152.2 million in 2019 to $4,626.4 million in 2020, primarily due to losses in these additional elements like a $123.3 million net loss from cash flow hedges and a $43.9 million loss from defined benefit pension plans ![Net income decreased to $4,730.5 million in 2020 from $6,025.4 million in 2019, and comprehensive income dropped to $4,626.4 million, mainly due to foreign currency and hedge losses](image4). These factors highlight how currency fluctuations and economic pressures contributed to the overall weakening in comprehensive income, as foreign currency translation adjustments showed a net gain but were offset by other losses.

Starting with the North American divisions, such as FLNA and PBNA, net revenue generally trended upward, potentially benefiting from effective net pricing strategies that accounted for pricing actions, discounts, and product mix variations [4].\n\nTo illustrate these financial shifts, consider the detailed breakdown in the financial performance data: the table highlights how divisions like FLNA and PBNA experienced steady growth in net revenue, while international regions like LatAm and Europe showed more fluctuation, possibly due to regional economic challenges ![The table summarizes net revenue and operating profit for divisions from 2018 to 2020](image4). This growth in net revenue for certain divisions, such as PBNA, could be linked to their stronger focus on beverages, which aligns with broader company trends.\n\nThese changes in financial performance might be closely tied to the distribution of beverage and food/snack categories, as divisions with a higher proportion of beverage sales—such as Europe, which maintained around 55% beverage revenue in 2020—potentially faced different market pressures compared to those dominated by food and snacks [2]. For example, regions like LatAm, with a consistent 90% food/snack focus, may have seen more stable revenue amid the pandemic, whereas beverage-heavy areas like Europe could have experienced volatility due to shifting consumer preferences and e-commerce growth [10].

This growth can be directly observed in the detailed breakdown provided in the relevant financial summary, as illustrated below.\n\n![The image summarizes the gross carrying amounts of intangible assets and property, plant, and equipment, showing totals of €5,005 million and €6,033 million respectively for 2021, compared to €4,549 million and €5,788 million for 2020.](image1)\n\nIn fiscal year 2021, the total intangible assets reached €5,005 million, up from €4,549 million in 2020, indicating a net increase of about €456 million, which could be attributed to factors like new technology developments or business acquisitions. Meanwhile, total property, plant, and equipment grew to €6,033 million in 2021 from €5,788 million in 2020, a rise of approximately €245 million, possibly driven by additions in areas such as technical machinery or leased assets. These changes suggest a strategic expansion in both intangible and tangible resources over the period.\n\nOverall, both categories experienced growth, with intangible assets increasing by roughly 10% and property, plant, and equipment by about 4.2%."}

According to the consolidated statements, the Company includes noncontrolling interests as a separate component of equity, with specific transactions like the acquisition of the Taiwan operations equity for $842 million in 2022 influencing these figures [1]. Over this period, total Costco stockholders' equity increased, driven by factors such as net income, stock-based compensation, and repurchases, as detailed in the equity balance changes [5]. For instance, the statements show net income attributable to Costco rising, while adjustments for foreign-currency translation and other items contributed to accumulated other comprehensive loss [5], [9]. Noncontrolling interests, representing the portion of equity in consolidated joint ventures not fully owned by Costco, also saw changes, including a dividend payment and the aforementioned acquisition, which reduced the noncontrolling stake [1], [6].\n\nTo visualize these equity components more clearly, consider the detailed breakdown in the provided table, which outlines categories like common stock, additional paid-in capital, accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, retained earnings, and noncontrolling interests, showing how these evolved over time ![Table summarizing equity categories including changes in stockholders' equity and noncontrolling interests](image4).\n\nThese shifts in equity are mirrored in the comprehensive income statements, where net income including noncontrolling interests grew significantly, as evidenced by the increasing totals in the financial data for 2022 compared to 2021 [9].

The Standardized Approach uses prescribed risk weights, while the Advanced Approach relies on internal models for more tailored calculations [4]. Over the year, factors such as increased market volatility, acquisitions, and changes in exposures contributed to shifts in these figures.\n\nStarting with capital ratios, which measure the adequacy of capital relative to RWA, there was noticeable improvement from 2019 to 2020 under both approaches. For instance, the Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratio rose from 16.4% in 2019 to 17.4% under Standardized and from 16.9% to 17.7% under Advanced, largely due to increases in retained earnings and the impact of an acquisition, as noted in the financial data [5]. Similarly, the Tier 1 Capital Ratio increased from 18.6% to 19.4% under Standardized and from 19.2% to 19.8% under Advanced, while the Total Capital Ratio went from 21.0% to 21.5% under Standardized and from 21.5% to 21.8% under Advanced. These enhancements are evident in the detailed breakdowns for each year, highlighting stronger capital positions despite rising risks. Meanwhile, required ratios also adjusted, with the Standardized Approach showing higher requirements in 2020, such as 13.2% for Common Equity Tier 1 compared to 10.0% in 2019, influenced by buffers like the Stress Capital Buffer ![A table comparing capital buffers and required ratios for 2020 and 2019 under Standardized and Advanced approaches](image2).\n\nTurning to risk-weighted assets, which account for credit, market, and operational risks, there was a clear increase from 2019 to 2020 under both approaches, driven by higher exposures in derivatives, investment securities, and market volatility [6, 9]. Specifically, total RWA grew from $394,177 million in 2019 to $453,106 million under Standardized and from $382,496 million to $445,151 million under Advanced. This expansion was primarily due to rises in credit risk RWA, such as from derivatives and lending commitments, and market risk RWA from increased Regulatory VaR [9]. Operational risk RWA, however, decreased under the Advanced Approach, reflecting fewer litigation losses [2].

For instance, amortization typically involves the systematic expensing of intangible assets like patents, while impairments represent write-downs when asset values decline, both of which are often excluded in core results to highlight ongoing operational performance [5].\n\nIn 2020, the adjustments played a significant role in boosting operating income, as seen in the financial tables that break down these changes. Specifically, for operating income, the IFRS results started at $1,043 million, and adjustments included $366 million for amortization of intangible assets and $255 million for impairments, leading to a core result of $2,334 million ![In 2020, amortization and impairments adjustments increased operating income by adding back expenses to reach core results](image2). This pattern of adding back these costs is consistent across other 2020 data, where similar adjustments for amortization and impairments helped elevate the core operating income from $9,172 million under IFRS to $13,645 million, primarily by reversing expenses in areas like cost of goods sold and other income ![In 2020, adjustments for amortization and impairments significantly raised core operating income from IFRS figures](image4).\n\nFor 2021, the impact was also upward, though the scale varied.

For instance, derivative financial instruments, such as forward contracts in various currencies, showed higher values in 2020 compared to 2019, as indicated in the detailed data [8], where these instruments are classified as equity investments and forward exchange contracts measured at fair value. This rise suggests greater hedging activity to mitigate currency fluctuations, which, according to [2], means any gains or losses from these hedges are initially held in equity and only recognized in the income statement when the underlying transactions occur, potentially smoothing out financial expenses or income over time.\n\nLooking specifically at the data, the table for derivative financial instruments reveals an overall increase in contract amounts and fair values ![The table summarizes contract amounts and fair values of derivative instruments, including cash flow and fair value hedges for 2020 and 2019.](image1). For example, positive fair values for cash flow hedges rose significantly, indicating more effective hedging that could defer gains to other comprehensive income before impacting the income statement. Similarly, in the financial liabilities overview, derivatives as liabilities jumped from 734 DKK million in 2019 to 1,365 DKK million in 2020 [4], as these are measured based on quoted market prices, which directly affects the fair value hierarchy and could lead to volatility in the company's reported liabilities and net financial position.\n\nShifting to cash flow changes, the data highlights a worsening in working capital dynamics in 2020, with a larger negative change in working capital of 4,353 DKK million compared to 3,388 DKK million in 2019, as shown in the working capital adjustments [10], where non-cash items are reversed to reflect actual cash movements. This deterioration is driven by factors like increased trade receivables and inventories, which tie up more cash, as detailed in the table ![The table outlines changes in working capital components, such as inventories and receivables, showing net outflows for 2020 and 2019.](image5). Additionally, reversals of non-cash items, such as interest income/expenses and share-based payments, totaled 7,849 DKK million in 2020 versus 7,032 DKK million in 2019 [6], indicating adjustments that convert accrual-based income statement items to cash basis, as seen in the related table ![The table lists reversals of non-cash income statement items, including interest and gains, for 2020 and 2019.](image3). These changes ultimately affect the cash flow statement by reducing operating cash flows, which can influence the company's liquidity and, indirectly, its balance sheet through higher working capital requirements.\n\nOverall, these elements contribute to the financial statements by introducing volatility in the income statement through fair value adjustments and by altering cash flows, which impact equity and working capital on the balance sheet, helping the company manage risks but potentially increasing financial complexity.\n\nIn summary, the derivative financial instruments and cash flow changes between 2020 and 2019 show increases that help hedge risks and manage liquidity but lead to greater volatility in the income statement and reduced operating cash flows."}

Within OCI, the components showed mixed but improving patterns: foreign currency translation shifted from a loss of $305,225 in 2018 to a gain of $197,696 in 2020, suggesting better management of currency exposures; defined benefit plans moved from a gain of $21,335 in 2018 to a larger gain of $57,100 in 2020, reflecting positive adjustments in pension and retirement obligations; cash flow hedges fluctuated but ended with a gain of $24,721 in 2020 after a significant loss in 2018; and investments remained relatively minor, with a small loss of $777 in 2020. ![The table summarizes Accenture's net income, OCI components, and comprehensive income figures for 2018-2020, showing overall growth in comprehensive income](image1) Overall, these OCI trends contributed to total comprehensive income growing from $3,730,974 in 2018 to $5,472,296 in 2020, highlighting a recovery and expansion in non-operating factors.\n\nThis growth in comprehensive income directly influenced shareholders' equity, as seen in the adjustments to retained earnings and accumulated other comprehensive loss. For instance, the increases in comprehensive income were incorporated into equity through additions to retained earnings and OCI impacts, which offset activities like share repurchases and dividends. ![The table details changes in shareholders' equity, including additions from comprehensive income that contributed to overall equity growth in 2020](image5) As a result, shareholders' equity expanded due to these income contributions, despite outflows from stock buybacks and payments.\n\nIn summary, Accenture's comprehensive income trended upward from 2018 to 2020 due to rising net income and improving OCI components, which in turn supported increases in shareholders' equity."}

Starting with premiums earned, the data shows a general upward trend over the period, though with some variability [4, 10]. In 2020, premiums earned increased compared to 2019, largely due to growth in policies-in-force and new contracts, as seen in the overall figures for that year [10]. However, in 2021, premiums earned experienced a slight decline from 2020 levels, partly because of factors like the GEICO Giveback program that reduced earned premiums [4]. For instance, the detailed breakdown in the relevant table illustrates this pattern, where premiums earned rose from $4,869 million in 2019 to $5,861 million in 2020, before easing to $5,648 million in 2021, reflecting a 3.6% decrease in the latter year compared to the previous one. ![A table showing premiums earned were $5,648 million in 2021, $5,861 million in 2020, and $4,869 million in 2019](image3)\n\nIn contrast, net investment income displayed a consistent downward trend across the three years, primarily driven by declining interest rates and shifts in investment portfolios [6, 9].

The expected return is a key component in calculating net periodic benefit costs, as it represents the anticipated earnings on the plan's investments, while the actual return influences the plan's overall funded status and accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI).\n\nFrom the financial details, the expected return on plan assets for the U.S. Defined Benefit plans decreased from $41 million in 2019 to $36 million in 2020 [1]. This reduction might reflect adjustments in market-related asset values or economic factors, as these figures are derived from a smoothed fair-value approach that accounts for long-term performance expectations [3].\n\nRegarding the actual return, it isn't explicitly stated in the provided information, but it can be inferred through changes in AOCI, which capture the difference between actual and expected performance. For instance, the net actuarial loss for U.S. Defined Benefit plans increased from $91 million at the end of 2019 to $125 million at the end of 2020, indicating that actual market returns may have fallen short of expectations, contributing to this rise [!](image2 summarizes the net increase in actuarial losses for U.S. Defined Benefit plans from 2019 to 2020, reflecting potential shortfalls in actual asset performance). These actuarial adjustments help reconcile real-world outcomes with projections, affecting the plan's financial health.\n\nThese figures ultimately influence the total plan assets, as the expected return is factored into net periodic benefit costs, which in turn impact the funded status and asset valuations. As of December 31, 2020, the total assets for the U.S. Defined Benefit plans stood at $1,061 million, comprising various investments like fixed income securities and equity securities [!](image5 outlines the composition and total value of U.S. Defined Benefit plan assets as of 2020, showing how asset categories contribute to the overall fair value).\n\nIn summary, the expected return on plan assets for the U.S. Defined Benefit plans decreased from $41 million in 2019 to $36 million in 2020, while indications of actual returns suggest underperformance based on AOCI changes, both of which are integrated into the total plan assets to determine the plan's funded position."}

Specifically, the data shows that consolidated revenue rose due to expanded activities in these areas, with NBCUniversal experiencing growth from higher media and theme park operations, and Sky benefiting from increased direct network costs and other factors.\n\nTo visualize the revenue changes, a detailed breakdown reveals that the Cable Communications segment contributed an increase of about $1,450 million, while NBCUniversal added $6,788 million, and Sky added $1,285 million, though Corporate and Other activities resulted in a net decrease ![A waterfall chart illustrating segment contributions to revenue changes from 2020 to 2021](image5). This pattern underscores how NBCUniversal and Sky were the primary drivers of revenue growth, outpacing Cable Communications, which had more modest gains.\n\nWhen examining operating expenses, the increases were largely tied to higher programming, technical support, and marketing costs across segments [2], [5]. For example, NBCUniversal's expenses rose due to investments in media and theme parks, Cable Communications saw hikes in programming and regulatory fees, and Sky faced elevated direct network costs, though partially offset by foreign currency effects. In comparison, Corporate and Other expenses decreased, mainly from reduced severance charges. A comprehensive view of these trends is evident in the revenue and expense summaries, where operating costs for 2021 totaled $36,231 million, reflecting overall growth but with varying impacts—NBCUniversal and Sky showed the steepest expense increases relative to their revenue gains, while Cable Communications maintained more stable margins ![A chart showing Comcast's revenue, Adjusted EBITDA, and operating margins from 2019 to 2021](image2).\n\nAcross segments, NBCUniversal and Sky not only led in revenue contributions but also in expense growth, indicating aggressive expansion, whereas Cable Communications demonstrated resilience with controlled expense rises despite its revenue uptick. This contrast highlights how segments with high-growth activities, like entertainment and international services, amplified both revenue and expenses more than the more established Cable Communications.\n\nIn summary, the main contributors to the change in Comcast's consolidated revenue and operating expenses from 2020 to 2021 were increases driven by NBCUniversal and Sky for revenue, and rising costs in programming and operations across these segments for expenses."}

Based on the available information, the growth in daily average active content creators shows a notable acceleration, as evidenced by a specific increase detailed in the infographic data ![Image shows a 42% increase in the number of daily average active content creators from 22Q1 to 23Q1](image4). This growth underscores the rising engagement and participation in content creation platforms. In comparison, the year-over-year growth for average daily video views is indicated at 37%, which reflects the expanding viewership and consumption patterns [10]. While both metrics demonstrate positive momentum, the difference in their growth rates provides insight into which area is expanding more rapidly.\n\nTo put this into perspective, the 42% increase for content creators outpaces the 37% growth in video views, suggesting that creator participation is surging ahead at a faster rate than viewer engagement during this period. This pattern aligns with broader trends in content creation, where platforms are seeing more active users contributing to the ecosystem.\n\nIn conclusion, the increase rate of the number of daily average active content creators is 5% higher than that of average daily video views from 22Q1 to 23Q1."}

For the Corporate Centre, which primarily encompasses central treasury activities and consolidation adjustments, net operating income showed a notable improvement from 2019 to 2020, rising from $(654) million to $(262) million—a 60% increase—largely due to reduced operating expenses and better management of legacy portfolios, as this segment benefited from a strong balance sheet and allocated revenues that helped offset economic downturns [10]. ![The table highlights a 60% increase in net operating income and a 42% rise in profit before tax for the Corporate Centre in 2020 compared to 2019, driven by lower expenses and improved financial metrics](image4)\n\nIn contrast, the Global Banking and Markets segments experienced mixed results, with Global Markets seeing a substantial revenue increase of 27% to $7,290 million, driven by strong performance in areas like foreign exchange and rates, which partially mitigated the overall economic instability [4]. However, Global Banking itself faced a slight revenue decline of 2% to $3,804 million, influenced by decreased activity in liquidity management and trade finance amid heightened restrictions and customer support demands. ![The table shows adjusted revenue for Global Banking decreased by 2% and for Global Markets increased by 27% in 2020 versus 2019, indicating varied segment performance](image1)\n\nThese changes relate to key financial metrics such as return on tangible equity (RoTE) and capital ratios; for instance, while the Corporate Centre's improvements contributed to a resilient capital position, the overall group's RoTE remained below target at 3.1% in 2020, reflecting the broader impact of credit losses and economic recovery delays. Ultimately, the variations underscore how the Corporate Centre's internal efficiencies contrasted with the external pressures on Global Banking and Markets, leading to stronger year-over-year gains in the former.\n\nIn summary, net operating income and profit before tax improved more significantly in the Corporate Centre than in the Global Banking and Markets segments, where results were uneven due to market-specific challenges."}

For instance, the VIEs contributed a substantial portion of total revenues, with specific figures indicating a slight decline in their revenue share over the two years, as noted in the company's risk factors and financial summaries [6]. This trend can be further illustrated by examining the detailed revenue breakdown in the relevant financial table, which shows revenues categorized by entity and adjusted for consolidations.\n\nSpecifically, the table for revenues reveals that while the VIE and its subsidiaries generated a high level of revenues in both years, there was a minor decrease in their proportional contribution to the company's total, reflecting broader market or operational dynamics ![The table details revenues for the VIE and its subsidiaries, showing figures for 2019, 2020, and 2021 with adjustments for consolidation](image2).

These expenses have shown a gradual decline over the years, reflecting potentially more efficient compensation structures or changes in grant volumes, as detailed in the relevant financial data.\n\nSpecifically, the stock-based compensation expenses decreased slightly from $558 million in 2020 to $540 million in 2021 and further to $528 million in 2022, with stock options expenses rising initially before easing and RSUs/PSUs expenses dropping overall ![Table showing stock-based compensation expenses for stock options, RSUs, PSUs, and total with a slight downward trend from 2020 to 2022](image3). This reduction could be linked to factors like lower unrecognized costs and changes in vesting patterns, where $166 million in stock option costs and $216 million in RSU/PSU costs remained to be recognized as of June 30, 2022, expected over the next 1.5 to 1.6 years [2, 8].\n\nMeanwhile, net earnings per share (EPS) demonstrated steady growth, with basic EPS rising from $5.13 in 2020 to $5.69 in 2021 and $6.00 in 2022, and diluted EPS increasing from $4.96 to $5.50 and then to $5.81 over the same period. This improvement is driven by higher net earnings, reduced shares outstanding, and other factors like lower taxes and interest expenses, as net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble grew from $13,027 million in 2020 to $14,306 million in 2021 and $14,742 million in 2022 ![Table displaying net earnings, EPS, and shares outstanding with increases in net earnings and EPS from 2020 to 2022](image4).

For Cloud & Cognitive Software, external gross profit saw a modest increase, driven largely by revenue growth from acquisitions such as Red Hat, though pre-tax income declined due to higher costs and investments [5]. Specifically, the data indicates that external gross profit rose by 3.4% to $17,650 million in 2019 from $17,068 million in 2018, but this was offset by a 12.4% drop in pre-tax income to $7,811 million, influenced by factors like purchase price accounting impacts from the Red Hat acquisition [4].\n\nIn contrast, Global Business Services demonstrated more stable growth, with external gross profit increasing by 3.0% to $4,655 million in 2019 from $4,519 million in 2018, supported by a mix shift toward higher-value offerings and productivity improvements [3; 8].

This trend is further supported by [3], which notes a 4.6% decrease in after-tax earnings from insurance investment income, also linked to the negative impact of declining interest rates on cash holdings and U.S. Treasury Bills.\n\nTo illustrate how asset allocations have evolved in response to these factors, the data shows a strategic shift towards more liquid assets, possibly to maintain stability amid market volatility. ![A breakdown of asset categories indicating an increase in cash, cash equivalents, and U.S. Treasury Bills from $67,082 in 2020 to $90,688 in 2021, alongside a decrease in fixed maturity securities from $20,317 to $16,386](image1) This adjustment reflects a preference for safer, more liquid holdings, which, while reducing exposure to higher-yield fixed income securities, contributed to the overall income decline by limiting earnings from those sources.\n\nDirect evidence of the income changes is evident in the detailed investment figures, where interest and other investment income dropped sharply despite a modest rise in dividend income. ![Investment income metrics showing a 44.4% decrease in interest and other investment income from $1,059 million in 2020 to $589 million in 2021, leading to a 5.0% decline in pre-tax net investment income, even with a 3.5% increase in dividend income](image5) Overall, these patterns underscore how the focus on liquidity and safety in a low-rate environment directly affected net investment income.\n\nThe decline in net investment income from 2020 to 2021 was mainly due to lower interest rates impacting fixed income investments, with asset allocations showing a clear shift toward increased cash and equivalents for greater stability."}

This upward trend in net income can be attributed to several key factors, including a significant boost in income from equity method investments, which rose due to acquisitions such as additional interests in Explorer and Colonial in June 2019 and an interest in Mattox in April 2020 [1], helping offset other changes like reduced dividend income from investments. Meanwhile, the comprehensive income, which accounts for net income adjusted for minor other comprehensive losses such as remeasurements of pension benefits, followed a similar path, with the increases largely driven by these strategic investments and operational improvements, as evidenced by the year-over-year figures in the income summary.

This reduction aligns with broader regulatory considerations, such as the adoption of new accounting standards and temporary exclusions, which influenced capital calculations.\n\nTurning to TLAC ratios, these metrics, which include Tier 1 capital and eligible long-term debt, showed an increase from 2019 to 2020, demonstrating improved loss-absorbing capacity amid regulatory requirements [10]. Specifically, the TLAC ratio rose from 24.6% in 2019 to 27.4% in 2020, well above the regulatory minimum of 22.0% for both years ![The table displays TLAC ratios and their regulatory minimums, highlighting an increase from 2019 to 2020 while exceeding the required thresholds](image5). For context, the regulatory minimums include buffers like the 2.5% capital conservation buffer, ensuring firms maintain sufficient capital to withstand stresses [8].\n\nIn summary, risk-weighted assets decreased under both approaches from 2019 to 2020 due to lower lending exposures, and TLAC ratios increased while remaining above the regulatory minimums."}

This comparison highlights how Best Buy's returns evolved alongside broader market benchmarks like the S&P 500 and the S&P Retailing Group, with factors such as market fluctuations and retail sector dynamics playing a role. For instance, the data shows that Best Buy started at $100 in 2018, peaked at around $165.74 in 2021, and ended at $139.12 in 2023, indicating growth followed by a partial decline influenced by economic conditions. To visualize these trends, consider the performance illustrated in the graph, which clearly depicts Best Buy's fluctuations relative to the other indices over this period: ![This graph compares the stock performance of Best Buy to the S&P 500 and S&P Retailing Group from FY18 to FY23, showing Best Buy's peaks and declines against the benchmarks](image4).

For instance, retained earnings typically increase with net income but decrease due to factors such as dividends paid, stock repurchases, and other comprehensive income [3] [8] [9]. These quotes show a pattern where net income contributes positively, while dividends and repurchases act as outflows.\n\nLooking at the specific years, the statements indicate that net income played a significant role in growing retained earnings, as seen in the year-end balances. In 2018, the balance reflects net income additions offset by dividends declared at $2.63 per share and other items like stock repurchases [3]. By 2019, net income continued to drive growth, though dividends increased to $3.21 per share, alongside stock compensation and other adjustments [9]. Finally, in 2020, net income further boosted the balance, but this was tempered by higher dividends at $3.72 per share and substantial stock repurchases, which reduced shares outstanding by 1.4 percent [6] [8]. These factors, including strong cash flow generation (with free cash flow at 38 percent of revenue) and dividend increases, highlight how the company prioritized returning value to shareholders, potentially limiting the net growth in retained earnings [6].\n\nFor a clearer view of the numerical trends, the table in the image provides a set of monetary figures that could align with these financial metrics across three periods, possibly representing aspects like net income or related adjustments ![The table presents three columns of financial data with starting values around $5,000-$5,000 and ending values up to approximately $7,189, suggesting potential growth in key figures over time](image2).\n\nOverall, from 2018 to 2020, the company's net income and retained earnings generally increased due to consistent net income contributions, but this growth was moderated by significant outflows from dividends and stock repurchases."}

For instance, in the commercial segment, there was a clear downturn, as evidenced by data showing a total decrease of about 6% in individuals served, with risk-based commercial dropping by 8% and fee-based by 5% [10]; this decline was largely driven by increased unemployment and related attrition amid the economic challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. ![Table showing decreases in commercial individuals served and increases in Medicare Advantage and Medicaid from 2019 to 2020](image3) Similarly, the global segment saw a 5% reduction in individuals served, which can be attributed to the same economic pressures and more stringent underwriting practices [10]. On a positive note, the public and senior segments demonstrated growth, particularly in Medicare Advantage, which increased by 8%, and Medicaid, which rose by 12%, as states eased redetermination requirements and there was expansion through Dual Special Needs Plans [10]; these increases were partly fueled by demographic shifts and policy adjustments in response to the pandemic. Overall, while revenue growth in areas like Medicare and Medicaid helped offset some losses [5], the broader impacts of COVID-19, including care deferrals and economic-driven attrition, played a significant role in shaping these changes across the segments [9].

For Pension Benefits, the discount rate increased from 1.7% in 2021 to 3.7% in 2022, as detailed in the provided data, which generally reduces the present value of liabilities by discounting future payments at a higher rate [10]. This change is illustrated in the table showing weighted average assumptions, where the higher discount rate contributed to actuarial gains, primarily by lowering the projected benefit obligations ![Table summarizing discount rate changes for Pension Benefits from 1.7% in 2021 to 3.7% in 2022, and for Other Retiree Benefits from 3.2% in 2021 to 5.0% in 2022](image1).

These shifts might impact the net amount recognized, as seen in the financial summaries, where the net amount for Pension Benefits improved from a larger liability of $5,428 in 2021 to $2,435 in 2022, likely due to the higher discount rate offsetting the lower expected return [10]. In contrast, Other Retiree Benefits showed an increase in the net amount recognized from $2,238 in 2021 to $3,819 in 2022, possibly influenced by the discount rate change but also other factors like asset contributions ![Table indicating net amounts recognized, such as Pension Benefits improving from $5,428 liability in 2021 to $2,435 in 2022, and Other Retiree Benefits rising from $2,238 to $3,819](image5).\n\nOverall, these changes suggest that higher discount rates helped reduce liabilities, potentially lowering the net recognized amount for Pension Benefits, while the decreased expected return could add pressure on future costs.\n\nThe discount rate increased for both Pension Benefits and Other Retiree Benefits from 2021 to 2022, the expected return on plan assets decreased for Pension Benefits and stayed the same for Other Retiree Benefits, likely resulting in a reduced net liability for Pension Benefits but an increased net asset for Other Retiree Benefits."}

Specifically, operating lease costs decreased from $2,551 in 2020 to $2,199 in 2021, contributing to a total lease cost drop from $2,596 to $2,265, which aligns with broader cost management strategies mentioned in the reports ![This image summarizes the lease costs for 2021, 2020, and 2019, showing decreases in operating and total costs from 2020 to 2021](image3).\n\nShifting to lease liabilities, both operating and finance leases exhibited reductions, indicating improved financial positioning.

This trend is further supported by details in [4] and [9], which discuss a $12.9 billion overall decrease in debt and finance lease liabilities due to repayments and redemptions, such as the retirement of long-term notes. Additionally, future lease obligations as outlined in the data reinforce this, with total operating lease liabilities calculated after accounting for interest showing a lower commitment in 2021 ![This image details the future lease payment obligations as of December 31, 2021, including totals for operating and finance leases that reflect reduced liabilities compared to 2020](image1).

For instance, total loans saw a general decline, as evidenced by data showing decreases in categories like Home Lending, Auto, Credit Card, Small Business, and Personal Lending, which [3] attributes to lower loan demand, reduced line utilization, and higher paydowns due to clients' strong capital market access and liquidity. This trend is further illustrated in the balance sheet overview, where ![The table details declines in average loans for segments like Home Lending and Auto from 2020 to 2021, alongside increases in total deposits.](image1) specific figures reveal, for example, a 14% drop in total average loans from $211 billion in 2020 to $181 billion in 2021, with Middle Market Banking decreasing by 9% and Asset-Based Lending and Leasing by 21%, as per similar detailed breakdowns in ![The table highlights reductions in commercial and industrial loans by 16% and commercial real estate loans by 10% from 2020 to 2021, reflecting broader loan trends.](image4).\n\nIn contrast, total deposits experienced growth across the board, with [4] and [6] explaining that this was fueled by higher levels of customer liquidity and savings, stemming from government stimulus and ongoing economic uncertainty, which encouraged lower investment spending. This increase is reflected in the data, showing rises in average and period-end deposits linked to these factors. Turning to contributing elements, [8] notes that loan reductions were exacerbated by paydowns exceeding originations, including specific impacts like curtailed mortgage and home equity originations in Home Lending, as well as declines in Small Business loans due to factors like reduced PPP loans, while deposit growth was partially offset by efficiencies in other areas, such as lower noninterest expenses from reduced headcount [7].\n\nOverall, these changes underscore a period of cautious financial behavior amid external pressures.

For instance, credit risk RWA saw a notable increase in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to higher exposures in derivatives, investment securities, and lending commitments, as driven by market volatility and acquisitions [4]. This escalation is evident in the detailed RWA breakdown, which highlights rises from $342,684 million to $387,066 million under the Standardized Approach and from $228,927 million to $284,930 million under the Advanced Approach, potentially straining capital ratios by requiring more capital to cover these heightened risks ![A table showing increases in Credit Risk RWA from 2019 to 2020 under both Standardized and Advanced approaches](image2).\n\nConcurrently, external TLAC as a percentage of RWA decreased slightly from 49.9% in 2019 to 47.7% in 2020, even though the absolute external TLAC amount grew from $196,888 million to $216,129 million [3]. This decline suggests that the growth in RWA outpaced the expansion of TLAC, which includes common equity Tier 1 capital, additional Tier 1 capital, and eligible long-term debt, potentially weakening the institution's ability to absorb losses without breaching regulatory buffers, such as the required 21.5% ratio ![A table indicating a decrease in External TLAC as a percentage of RWA from 2019 to 2020 while showing actual amounts and regulatory minimums](image5). As a result, these changes may have prompted the institution to bolster its capital components, like issuing more equity or debt, to maintain overall stability and comply with capital conservation requirements.\n\nOverall, the increases in credit risk RWA and the dip in external TLAC as a percentage of RWA likely required the institution to enhance its capital base to ensure regulatory compliance and mitigate potential restrictions on distributions."}

This ties directly into the bank's organizational structure, as illustrated in the divisional overview ![The organizational chart outlines Bank of America's divisions, including Consumer Banking where net interest changes are prominent](image2), which shows Consumer Banking as a core division handling deposits and lending—areas heavily impacted by interest rate fluctuations—while other divisions like Global Banking and Global Markets might experience more varied effects based on their focus on investment and commercial activities. Consequently, these shifts highlight how the bank's segmented structure, designed to manage diverse risks [10], exposed consumer-oriented operations to greater volatility during economic downturns.\n\nOverall, the major differences reveal a transition from growth in net interest metrics between 2018 and 2019 to substantial declines between 2019 and 2020, largely due to lower interest rates and economic uncertainty, which disproportionately affected the consumer-focused segments within Bank of America's organizational framework."}

This reduction reflects challenges such as prevailing low short-term interest rates that negatively impacted earnings from cash equivalents and fixed maturity securities [6]. Meanwhile, the asset composition of the insurance business shifted notably, with total assets increasing from $363,117 thousand in 2020 to $446,277 thousand in 2021, largely due to growth in cash, cash equivalents, and U.S. Treasury Bills (rising from $67,082 thousand to $90,688 thousand) and equity securities (from $269,498 thousand to $334,907 thousand) ![A comparative table showing increases in cash and equity assets alongside decreases in fixed maturity securities from 2020 to 2021](image1). These changes suggest a strategic emphasis on liquidity and potentially higher-growth investments, as the company prioritized safety over yield in a volatile economic environment influenced by ongoing supply chain disruptions and market fluctuations [5]. The decline in net investment income could imply short-term pressures on profitability, but the bolstered cash and equity holdings might enhance resilience against economic uncertainties, allowing for better positioning in future market recoveries. Ultimately, these shifts highlight a cautious approach to balancing income generation with risk management in the face of external factors like interest rate changes and pandemic-related effects.\n\nTo summarize, from 2020 to 2021, the net investment income decreased due to lower interest rates, while asset composition grew in cash and equity holdings, likely to maintain liquidity and capitalize on market opportunities."}

For instance, the upstream segment, which is heavily dependent on crude oil prices [3], experienced significant volatility and recovery: U.S. upstream earnings shifted from a loss of $5,094 million in 2019 and $1,608 million in 2020 to a profit of $7,319 million in 2021, primarily due to higher realizations and sales volumes [5], while international upstream earnings fluctuated from $7,670 million in 2019 to a loss of $825 million in 2020 before rebounding to $8,499 million in 2021, boosted by higher prices but offset by factors like increased taxes and depreciation [6]. This upward trend in upstream operations is clearly illustrated in the detailed financial data, which highlights total upstream earnings rising from $2,576 million in 2019 to a loss of $2,433 million in 2020 and then to $15,818 million in 2021 ![Financial performance of Chevron's Upstream and Downstream operations from 2019 to 2021](image1). \n\nIn contrast, downstream operations demonstrated more stability with overall growth: U.S. downstream earnings improved from $1,559 million in 2019 to a loss of $571 million in 2020, then surged to $2,389 million in 2021, driven by higher margins and sales volumes [9], while international downstream earnings dipped slightly from $922 million in 2019 to $618 million in 2020 and $525 million in 2021, mainly due to lower margins and higher expenses [2]. These trends in both segments contributed to Chevron's overall net income, which recovered from $2,924 million in 2019 to a substantial loss of $5,543 million in 2020 before climbing to $15,625 million in 2021 ![Overall net income and related financial metrics for Chevron from 2019 to 2021](image2), as the rebound in operations aligned with rising crude oil prices, such as Brent and WTI crude oil spot prices that dipped in 2020 but steadily increased through 2021 ![Trends in crude oil and natural gas spot prices from 2019 to 2021 influencing operations](image5).

For instance, the fair value of these contracts tends to decrease when interest rates rise and increase when they fall, as higher rates can discount future liabilities more aggressively, while lower rates might amplify their value; specifically, for December 31, 2021, a 100 basis point increase reduced the fair value from $99 to $94, and a 100 basis point decrease raised it to $105, illustrating this sensitivity in various interest rate scenarios ![Equity index put option contracts' fair value decreases with rising interest rates and increases with falling rates](image2). Shifting to the effects of non-U.S. denominated debt on net earnings, the company experienced a notable turnaround between 2020 and 2021, where changes in foreign currency exchange rates led to a loss of $764 million in 2020 shifting to a gain of $955 million in 2021, primarily due to fluctuations in exchange rates affecting senior notes and other liabilities [8]. This difference underscores how currency movements can directly impact earnings, reflecting improved conditions or favorable rate changes in the later year.\n\nIn summary, changes in interest rates inversely affect the fair value of equity index put option contracts, and the effect of non-U.S. denominated debt on net earnings changed from a loss in 2020 to a gain in 2021."}

This means the Standardized approach often includes higher amounts in certain capital components compared to the Advanced approaches, which might apply more stringent or alternative calculations.\n\nFor instance, examining the specific capital metrics reveals that the Standardized approach generally results in higher total capital figures, as it may incorporate broader allowances. Turning to the detailed data in the table that outlines these metrics, we can see the exact values: ![The table details risk-based capital metrics, including total capital amounts for both Standardized and Advanced approaches as of December 31, 2020 and 2019](image4).\n\nBased on this data, the difference in total capital for 2020 is calculated as $181,370 million (Standardized) minus $170,922 million (Advanced), resulting in a difference of $10,448 million. Similarly, for 2019, the difference is $166,567 million (Standardized) minus $158,665 million (Advanced), equating to $7,902 million.

For instance, as detailed in the text, the GAAP effective tax rate for 2020 was (18.6) percent, a significant decrease from 7.2 percent in 2019, largely driven by a net tax benefit from an intra-entity sale that resulted in a $0.9 billion benefit and a foreign tax law change adding another $0.2 billion benefit [6]. This contrasts with the Operating (non-GAAP) effective tax rate, which was (1.5) percent in 2020 compared to 8.5 percent in 2019, where the adjustments excluded these one-time benefits to reflect a more normalized tax position [6].\n\nTo illustrate the 2019 figures, the table for that year highlights how GAAP and adjusted measures diverge, with the GAAP rate at 7.2 percent and the adjusted (non-GAAP) rate at 8.5 percent after accounting for acquisition-related and other charges, emphasizing the impact of these exclusions on tax calculations. ![The table shows the 2019 effective tax rate as 7.2% under GAAP and 8.5% under adjusted (non-GAAP) measures](image1)\n\nSimilarly, for 2020, the table reveals a GAAP effective tax rate of (18.6) percent, influenced by the same tax benefits, while the Operating (non-GAAP) rate improved to (1.5) percent, demonstrating how non-GAAP adjustments remove these anomalies to provide a clearer view of ongoing operations. ![The table indicates the 2020 effective tax rate as (18.6)% under GAAP and (1.5)% under operating (non-GAAP) measures](image2)\n\nOverall, these differences underscore how GAAP rates incorporate all reported items, leading to volatility, whereas Operating (non-GAAP) rates smooth out such effects for better comparability.\n\nThe effective tax rate for GAAP was (18.6)% in 2020 and 7.2% in 2019, while for Operating (non-GAAP), it was (1.5)% in 2020 and 8.5% in 2019."}

For the U.S. downstream sector, earnings started strong in 2019 but shifted to a significant loss in 2020 before rebounding sharply in 2021, as detailed in financial records that highlight key drivers such as changes in margins and sales volumes [9]. Specifically, the sector reported a loss of $571 million in 2020 compared to earnings of $1,559 million in 2019, but it recovered to $2,389 million in 2021, driven primarily by higher margins on refined product sales of about $1.6 billion, increased earnings from partnerships like 50 percent-owned CPChem amounting to $1.0 billion, and higher sales volumes of $470 million, though these gains were partially offset by elevated operating expenses of $150 million [9]. This trend is visually confirmed in a table showing the progression of U.S. downstream earnings over the three years, illustrating the sector's volatility ![U.S. downstream earnings shifted from profit in 2019 to a loss in 2020 and back to profit in 2021](image3).\n\nIn contrast, the international downstream sector saw a more consistent decline in earnings from 2019 to 2021, starting at $922 million in 2019 and decreasing to $618 million in 2020 before further dropping to $525 million in 2021, influenced by factors such as lower margins and rising costs [5]. The decrease was mainly attributed to reduced margins on refined product sales of $330 million and higher operating expenses of $100 million in 2021 compared to the previous year, though this was somewhat mitigated by a favorable shift in foreign currency effects of $337 million [5]. Meanwhile, overall refined product sales volumes increased in 2021 due to easing travel restrictions, which helped boost demand for gasoline, jet fuel, and diesel, but this wasn't enough to reverse the earnings downturn. A corresponding table underscores this downward pattern over the period ![International downstream earnings decreased steadily from 2019 to 2021, peaking in 2019](image1).\n\nSignificant factors affecting these changes included higher upstream realizations, the absence of 2020 impairments and write-offs, and improved downstream margins in 2021, which boosted U.S. earnings, while international results were hampered by cost pressures and margin declines despite some currency benefits.

For instance, net income for this segment rose substantially, reflecting a recovery from the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, with total revenue increasing due to higher mortgage banking income and deposit-related fees, while noninterest expenses decreased through lower operating losses and efficiency initiatives [2][8].\n\nThis positive trend in net income is further illustrated in the financial summary, which highlights growth across key segments, including Consumer Banking and Lending, with net income improving from the effects of higher gains on equity securities and better portfolio credit quality ![Financial summary showing net income for business segments from 2019 to 2021](image3). Meanwhile, selected balance sheet data showed mixed changes: total loans decreased over the period as paydowns outpaced originations, influenced by factors like elevated prepayments, refinancing activity, and a decline in programs such as PPP loans, which led to lower average and period-end loan balances in areas like Home Lending and Small Business [9].\n\nOn the deposits side, there was significant growth, with average and period-end deposits increasing due to higher customer liquidity from government stimulus programs and economic uncertainty, which boosted savings and checking accounts [3].

This pattern is evident in the detailed breakdown of loan metrics, which highlights how external factors like economic recovery influenced lending activities.\n\nFor instance, average Card Member loans decreased from $13.3 billion in 2019 to $12.9 billion in 2020, but then rose to $15.0 billion in 2021, as shown in the table outlining GSBS Card Member loans and related metrics [4]. This growth in 2021 can be attributed to improved portfolio quality and higher customer spending, despite earlier setbacks likely tied to the COVID-19 pandemic [2].\n\nTurning to net interest income, the trend was more downward overall, with fluctuations that underscore challenges in interest yields and loan balances. Specifically, net interest income fell sharply from $330 million in 2019 to $100 million in 2020, before a modest increase to $108 million in 2021, as detailed in the revenue breakdowns [6]. This decline was primarily driven by lower average revolving loan balances and higher paydown rates, partially offset by reduced costs of funds [10]. These changes are further illustrated in the segmented data for U.S. and international operations, where net interest income generally decreased across the years, reflecting adjustments for non-attributable interest expenses and incomes ![Net interest income decreased from 2019 to 2021 across U.S. and international segments, with declines in average Card Member loans initially before a rebound](image2).\n\nThese shifts had mixed implications for the company's financial performance: the increase in average Card Member loans in 2021 contributed to stronger revenue growth and improved liquidity, as seen in total revenues net of interest expense rising from $10,619 million in 2020 to $12,500 million in 2021. However, the overall decline in net interest income highlighted vulnerabilities in interest yields, which were partly offset by reserve releases and lower write-offs, ultimately supporting pretax segment income growth from $936 million in 2020 to $2,928 million in 2021 ![Average Card Member loans increased from $13.3 billion in 2019 to $15.0 billion in 2021, alongside trends in net interest yield and other metrics](image4).\n\nIn summary, average Card Member loans increased from 2019 to 2021, while net interest income experienced a net decline, leading to improved overall financial performance driven by revenue growth and better credit provisions."}

In 2020, adjustments primarily involved significant impairments and other charges that inflated the total, as seen in the detailed breakdown of operating income reconciliations. For instance, the adjustments included amortization of intangible assets, impairments, acquisition or divestment-related items, and other expenses, which collectively transformed the IFRS operating income into a core figure [1].

This strategy involves assessing regions, building local knowledge, and opportunistically opening stores in high-traffic areas, which has allowed the company to adapt quickly to emerging opportunities while monitoring global conditions like those influenced by COVID-19 [8]. For instance, the company targeted expansion in regions such as the UK, France, USA, and franchise markets, aiming to increase its footprint and capitalize on scale [5].\n\nTo illustrate the tangible impact of this strategy on store counts, consider the data from a detailed table that tracks the progression across various countries from 2016 to 2020, showing a clear upward trend in numbers for locations like the UK, France, and USA, with overall totals rising from 250 in 2016 to 435 in 2020 ![A table displaying increasing store counts across international regions from 2016 to 2020](image2).

This change meant that leases previously treated as operating leases under AASB 117 were now capitalized, with lease liabilities measured at the present value of remaining lease payments using the Group's incremental borrowing rate [8]. For instance, the initial application of AASB 16 led to the recognition of a significant lease liability amount right at the start, which is detailed in the financial data showing how this impacted the balance from 2019 to 2020—specifically, the balance at 1 July 2019 jumped to $143,621 after adoption, reflecting additions and adjustments like re-measurements due to lease term changes [3]. ![The table shows the recognition of $143,621 in lease liabilities upon adopting AASB 16 and subsequent changes totaling $167,154 by 28 June 2020](image1) Additionally, the transition involved capitalizing elements like site restoration costs into the right-of-use assets instead of treating them as separate provisions [4], and it eliminated the need for straight-line rent provisions, as payments are now included directly in the lease liability [4].\n\nIn contrast, employee benefit liabilities, such as those for annual leave and long-service leave, appear to have been calculated based on undiscounted amounts related to employee services and remuneration rates [1], without any direct evidence in the provided data linking them to the AASB 16 changes.

In 2020, net cash provided by operating activities decreased slightly compared to 2019, primarily due to higher working capital requirements and certain non-cash charges, as noted in the analysis [10]. This decrease is evident in the operating cash flows, where net cash provided dropped from $10,090 million in 2019 to $9,812 million in 2020, influenced by factors like changes in receivables and inventories ![The table details net cash from operating and investing activities for 2020, 2019, and 2018.](image2). Meanwhile, net cash used in investing activities also decreased, from $852 million in 2019 to $602 million in 2020, mainly because of lower capital expenditures and the absence of significant deconsolidation effects from the previous year [9], which is further illustrated in the same table ![The table details net cash from operating and investing activities for 2020, 2019, and 2018.](image2).\n\nOn the financing side, net cash used increased from $8,061 million in 2019 to $8,496 million in 2020, driven largely by higher payments to noncontrolling interests and dividends [4], as detailed in the financing activities overview ![The table summarizes net cash from financing activities and the resulting cash balance changes.](image3).

In contrast, rural development projects emphasize sustainable growth, such as enabling efficient disbursement of funds under government schemes to boost rural incomes, which were particularly resilient during the pandemic.\n\nWhen comparing the amounts spent, COVID relief projects generally received higher allocations in key states. ![Image shows expenditures on COVID relief projects, including a major ₹24.73 crore for a PAN India initiative, with implementations often through external agencies](image4) For example, in image4, substantial spending is noted on COVID relief across states like Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh, with the highest amount at ₹24.73 crore for a nationwide effort, underscoring the urgency of health-related interventions. On the other hand, rural development projects show more modest expenditures, often concentrated in states like Odisha and Punjab, as seen in ![Image provides details of rural development projects, including amounts spent and their one-year durations in various districts](image2), where allocations per project typically range from smaller figures, such as those in the crores for specific initiatives, reflecting a focus on localized, ongoing support.\n\nKey differences in project implementation modes emerge from these details: COVID relief projects frequently rely on external implementing agencies for efficiency and scale, as indicated in the examples from image3 and image4, where agencies like Give India and State Disaster Development Authority handle operations to ensure rapid response. In comparison, rural development projects, as outlined in image2 and image5, often involve direct implementation by the bank or its partners, ![Image summarizes rural development projects with direct modes and agency details across states](image5) allowing for more hands-on management in local areas, though some still use agencies for specialized tasks. This contrast highlights a more collaborative, agency-driven approach for COVID relief versus a potentially more self-managed strategy for rural projects, adapting to the nature of each initiative.\n\nIn summary, the bank spent more on COVID relief projects, such as ₹24.73 crore for a PAN India effort, compared to rural development projects, and key differences include greater use of external agencies for COVID relief versus more direct implementation for rural initiatives."}

The data reveals trends in cash generation versus reported earnings, highlighting the company's operational efficiency in converting profits into actual cash flow.\n\nFor instance, net cash provided by operating activities represents the cash inflows from core business operations, such as sales and expenses, and is a key indicator of financial health. In 2020, this figure reached $10,613 million, reflecting strong cash generation despite challenges like the global pandemic. This can be compared directly to the net income, which stood at $7,175 million for the same year, showing that operating activities produced more cash than the reported net profit after accounting for various adjustments. ![Image displaying PepsiCo's net cash provided by operating activities for 2018-2020](image3) Similarly, when looking at comprehensive income attributable to PepsiCo, which includes net income plus other comprehensive income items like currency translations and pension adjustments, the value was $5,944 million in 2020. This indicates that while comprehensive income was lower than net income due to non-operating factors, net cash from operations still surpassed it, underscoring PepsiCo's ability to generate liquidity beyond what's captured in adjusted earnings.\n\nOver the full period, in 2019, net cash provided by operating activities was $9,649 million, compared to net income of $7,353 million and comprehensive income attributable to PepsiCo of $8,133 million. In 2018, the cash from operations was $9,415 million, against net income of $12,559 million and comprehensive income attributable to PepsiCo of $10,453 million. ![Image showing PepsiCo's net income and comprehensive income for 2018-2020](image1) These comparisons illustrate that, except for 2018 where net income was higher due to exceptional factors, net cash from operating activities generally exceeded both metrics in the other years, demonstrating robust cash flow management.\n\nOverall, PepsiCo's net cash provided by operating activities was generally higher than its net income and comprehensive income attributable to PepsiCo from 2018 to 2020, reflecting strong operational cash generation."}

For instance, sensitivities to these assumptions show how a change can alter the DBO, with an increase in the discount rate typically reducing it, while increases in compensation or pension progression would raise it, as outlined in detailed sensitivity analyses [1].\n\nLooking at the specific impacts, a table summarizing the effects of a half-percentage-point change in key assumptions reveals notable shifts: for example, an increase in the discount rate led to a decrease in the DBO by €242 million in 2021 (compared to €227 million in 2020), indicating a heightened sensitivity possibly due to economic conditions, while a decrease in the discount rate increased the DBO by €271 million in 2021 (up from €266 million in 2020) ![Table showing effects of changes in discount rate, compensation increase, and pension progression on DBO, with decreases from rate increases reducing obligations](image1). This aligns with the risks highlighted, where changes in assumptions like discount rates can significantly affect the funded status, potentially leading to higher provisions for pensions [4].\n\nAdditionally, broader actuarial gains and losses provide insight into the overall impact: changes in financial assumptions resulted in a loss of €26 million in 2021, contrasting with a gain of €72 million in 2020, and total actuarial losses were €22 million in 2021 versus gains of €67 million in 2020, suggesting that evolving economic factors made assumptions less favorable over the year ![Summary of actuarial gains and losses from demographic and financial assumptions, indicating net losses in 2021](image3). These changes could indirectly influence plan assets, as the company employs a liability-driven investment strategy to manage risks, including adjustments based on actuarial developments [8].\n\nRegarding plan assets, while they aren't directly altered by assumptions, their composition and total value grew from €2,813 million in 2020 to €3,259 million in 2021, with increases in categories like fixed income securities (€1,590 million in 2021) and derivatives (€189 million in 2021), reflecting ongoing risk management to counterbalance DBO volatility ![Breakdown of plan assets across categories like equity and fixed income securities, showing overall growth from 2020 to 2021](image2). This growth likely helped mitigate the risks from assumption changes, as the strategy focuses on aligning assets with liabilities.\n\nSpecific discount rate changes, such as a rise from 1.5% in 2020 to 1.7% in 2021 for the euro and from 2.4% to 2.7% for the U.S. dollar, further underscore how these adjustments contributed to the DBO's fluctuations ![Overview of discount rates for various currencies, highlighting increases from 2020 to 2021](image4).\n\nIn summary, changes in actuarial assumptions primarily increased the DBO's sensitivity to risks in 2021, leading to potential losses, while plan assets were actively managed to grow and stabilize the overall funded status."}

For instance, credit risk RWA rose primarily because of higher exposures in derivatives, investment securities, lending commitments, and equity investments, driven by market volatility and business expansions such as the E*TRADE acquisition [5], while market risk RWA also climbed due to increased regulatory Value at Risk (VaR) from elevated market fluctuations [6]. This overall growth in RWA—evident in the detailed breakdown from 2019 to 2020, where credit risk RWA increased by about $44.4 billion under the Standardized Approach and $56.0 billion under the Advanced Approach, and market risk RWA rose by approximately $14.5 billion and $14.4 billion respectively—![A table showing increases in credit and market risk RWA and a decrease in operational risk RWA from 2019 to 2020](image3) put upward pressure on the denominator of the TLAC ratio, potentially diluting its percentage even as the absolute TLAC amount grew. However, operational risk RWA decreased under the Advanced Approach, partly due to reduced litigation-related losses [9], which may have partially offset the increases but wasn't enough to prevent the overall RWA expansion. As a result, despite the External TLAC amount rising from $196.9 billion in 2019 to $216.1 billion in 2020, its percentage of RWA dropped from 49.9% to 47.7%—reflecting how the disproportionate growth in RWA outpaced the TLAC increase—![A table indicating that External TLAC as a percentage of RWA decreased from 49.9% in 2019 to 47.7% in 2020](image5).\n\nIn summary, the increases in credit and market risk RWA components led to a decline in External TLAC as a percentage of RWA from 2019 to 2020."}

For the U.S. segment, growth rates slowed considerably, with comparable sales increasing by only 0.4% in 2020 compared to 5.0% in 2019, according to detailed performance data that reflects a stabilization effort amid the pandemic [2]. This change was partly due to positive sales performance in the U.S., which included strategic marketing investments and promotional activities that helped boost delivery and comparable sales in the second half of the year, though these gains were offset by support measures like free meals for first responders [4]. Meanwhile, revenue composition in the U.S. saw a slight decrease in both company-operated sales (down 4% to $2,395 million) and franchised revenues (down 2% to $5,261 million), as shown in comprehensive revenue breakdowns that underscore the segment's reliance on franchised models for stability [3].\n\nTurning to the International Operated Markets, the situation was more pronounced, with growth rates plummeting to a 15.0% decline in 2020 from a 6.1% increase in 2019, driven primarily by temporary restaurant closures and limited operations in key markets like France, the U.K., Germany, Italy, and Spain [2]. This segment's revenue composition also deteriorated, evidenced by a 19% drop in company-operated sales to $5,114 million and a 14% decrease in franchised revenues to $4,348 million, which collectively contributed to a 17% overall decline in total revenues for the segment [3]. Factors influencing these changes included the broader impact of COVID-19, such as over $100 million in marketing support and incremental expenses for employee-related costs and safety measures, which exacerbated the downturn despite efforts to drive recovery [5]. ![A table showing declines in growth percentages for International Operated Markets in 2020 compared to 2019](image2) ![Revenue data indicating decreases in both U.S. and International Operated Markets segments in 2020](image3) Additionally, the pie charts for revenue segments reveal a slight shift in overall composition, with the International Operated Markets portion dropping from 37% in 2019 to 41% in 2020, suggesting a rebalancing as U.S. revenues held a larger share amid global disruptions [4].\n\nOverall, these changes illustrate how COVID-19 regulations and operational challenges heavily influenced revenue dynamics, with the U.S. showing resilience through domestic strategies while International Operated Markets faced steeper declines due to regional lockdowns and economic pressures.\n\nFrom 2019 to 2020, McDonald's U.S. segment saw minimal growth and slight revenue decreases, while the International Operated Markets segment experienced significant declines, primarily due to COVID-19 impacts."}

According to the records on share movements [4], S Fallscheer started FY20 with 4,140,000 shares and acquired an additional 1,687,764 shares during the year, resulting in a total of 5,827,764 shares by the end of FY20, which represents a significant increase in their equity stake and could reflect confidence in the company's future or participation in share-based incentives. This growth in shareholding is further contextualized by the broader details on performance rights and options [9], which indicate that such changes are part of the remuneration structure for key executives, potentially linking to long-term incentives.\n\nTurning to remuneration, the breakdown for executive directors like S Fallscheer shows variations across components such as salary, bonuses, and other benefits, as outlined in the relevant table ![The table shows remuneration components for executives including S Fallscheer in 2019 and 2020](image3).

For instance, the cost of revenues, which includes service costs like those related to platform operations, showed steady increases over the period, as evidenced by data indicating that service costs rose from 14,967 million RMB in 2019 to 18,992 million RMB in 2021, while their share of total costs slightly decreased from 89.3% to 87.0% [8]. This suggests a shift toward a more diversified cost base, potentially due to rising external factors like agency fees and payment channel fees, which contributed to the growth in other costs of revenues from 1,794 million RMB in 2019 to 2,848 million RMB in 2021.\n\nMeanwhile, operating expenses as a whole trended upward, increasing from 4,744 million RMB in 2019 to 6,687 million RMB in 2021, with general and administrative expenses playing a larger relative role, rising from 57.0% to 60.0% of total operating expenses [3]. This category encompasses R&D and personnel costs, which grew significantly—R&D expenses alone jumped from 1,159 million RMB in 2019 to 2,339 million RMB in 2021 [1]—indicating ongoing investments in innovation and administrative efficiency. In contrast, selling and marketing expenses increased in absolute terms from 2,041 million RMB in 2019 to 2,678 million RMB in 2021 but decreased as a percentage of total operating expenses from 43.0% to 40.0%, suggesting better management of promotional efforts, possibly through more efficient use of internal channels [5].\n\nTo visualize these changes, consider the detailed breakdown in the cost of revenues, where service costs dominated but other costs grew faster relatively, as shown in the table for 2019-2021: ![The table illustrates the increasing service costs and other costs as percentages of total cost of revenues from 2019 to 2021](image2). Similarly, the operating expenses table highlights the shift toward higher general and administrative costs: ![The table shows the rising total operating expenses with a growing proportion allocated to general and administrative expenses over 2019 to 2021](image3). These trends, when viewed together, point to a strategic focus on core operations and long-term investments, such as R&D, while moderating marketing spend, which could indicate prudent financial management aimed at sustaining growth amid fluctuating revenues.\n\nOverall, the cost structure became slightly more balanced with growing other costs, and operating expenses increased but with a more efficient allocation, suggesting the company's financial management is adapting to support innovation and operational scalability."}

Looking at the numerical details, one set of figures from 2018 appears to show crude oil prices ranging from approximately 60.61 to 70.84 per barrel across regions, alongside NGL prices from about 30.72 to 47.10 per barrel [4], suggesting a baseline for comparison.\n\nAs we move to more recent years, the trends become clearer through detailed regional breakdowns. For 2019 and 2020, prices for crude oil and NGL varied by region, with some areas like the United States and Canada experiencing increases in crude oil prices, possibly due to production adjustments, while NGL prices fluctuated with energy demand ![A table summarizing average production prices for crude oil and NGL across regions for 2019 and 2020, showing variations by year and geography](image5).

For instance, noncurrent assets increased by $3,039 million (or $829 million adjusted for currency), as noted in the financial details [4], which reflects investments that could support long-term revenue generation, such as those tied to Global Financing's asset portfolio. This growth is evident in the data showing noncurrent assets rising from $113,767 million in 2019 to $116,806 million in 2020, as illustrated in a table that summarizes key balance sheet figures for these years ![A table comparing noncurrent assets and long-term debt, showing increases in noncurrent assets and slight changes in long-term debt](image2). \n\nOn the debt side, long-term debt saw a modest increase from $54,102 million in 2019 to $54,355 million in 2020, but overall company debt decreased by $1,361 million (or $2,859 million adjusted for currency), primarily due to debt retirements and maturities [9]. This reduction, particularly in Global Financing debt from $24,727 million to $21,167 million, helped maintain a stable debt-to-equity ratio of 9 to 1 [5], indicating prudent financial management that likely reduced interest burdens and supported operational flexibility. These debt dynamics were influenced by cash flow activities, where financing activities shifted to a net use of $9,721 million in 2020 from a net source of $9,042 million in 2019 [10], as seen in a cash flow summary that highlights increased cash from operating activities at $18,197 million in 2020 compared to $14,770 million in 2019, though investing activities also showed improvement with less cash used ![A table detailing net cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities, indicating stronger operating cash generation in 2020](image3). \n\nEquity, however, decreased slightly by $258 million, driven by dividends and other adjustments [7], which could signal a focus on shareholder returns amid these changes, potentially offsetting some of the asset growth benefits.

This trend aligns with broader declines in credit card purchase volumes, which fell by $26.3 billion to $251.6 billion [6], reflecting reduced consumer spending on activities like travel and entertainment amid economic disruptions.\n\nTo illustrate these credit card changes more clearly, the data in the table highlights a drop in key indicators, such as new accounts from 4,320 in 2019 to 2,505 in 2020, alongside a decrease in purchase volumes from $277,852 million to $251,599 million, while the risk-adjusted margin improved slightly from 8.28% to 9.16% ![Credit card metrics indicate reduced new accounts and purchase volumes in 2020 compared to 2019, suggesting lower consumer engagement](image2).\n\nShifting to home equity, production declined by $3.0 billion overall and $2.8 billion in Consumer Banking [5], with outstanding balances dropping by $5.9 billion [9], primarily because paydowns exceeded new originations.

For instance, as outlined in the report, higher nickel prices contributed to an increase in Underlying EBITDA for Nickel West [1], where the average realized price rose to US$16,250 per tonne in FY2021 due to strong end-use demand and supply constraints, though this was tempered by events like supply chain adjustments in Indonesia [10]. Similarly, for coal, the report highlights that lower prices led to a substantial decrease in Underlying EBITDA, with declines driven by reduced revenue from metallurgical and energy coal, exacerbated by lower volumes and increased costs [2].\n\nThis relationship is further illustrated in the financial data, where a US$1 per ton increase in metallurgical coal prices impacts profit after taxation by $24 million and Underlying EBITDA by $35 million, while a US$1 per ton increase in energy coal prices affects profit after taxation by $9 million and Underlying EBITDA by $13 million; meanwhile, a US¢1 per pound increase in nickel prices results in a $1 million impact on both metrics ![The table details how changes in commodity prices affect BHP's profit after taxation and Underlying EBITDA for commodities including coal and nickel](image1).

Under the Standardized Approach, ratios are calculated using prescribed risk weights, while the Advanced Approach employs models for more tailored assessments [3]. From the data, risk-based ratios, which include Common Equity Tier 1, Tier 1, and Total Capital ratios, showed overall increases in 2020, driven by factors like higher retained earnings and the E*TRADE acquisition [10], despite rises in risk-weighted assets due to increased credit and market risks [6] [9].\n\nFor instance, examining the 2019 figures, the Common Equity Tier 1 ratio was 16.4% under Standardized and 16.9% under Advanced, as seen in the detailed breakdown for that year (![Risk-based capital ratios for 2019 under Standardized and Advanced approaches](image2)).

These figures reflect the company's performance in managing its investments and other financial activities, which can be influenced by market conditions, acquisitions, and operational adjustments.\n\nStarting with \"Gains on strategic investments, net,\" this category primarily includes mark-to-market adjustments and unrealized gains on equity securities [1]. In fiscal 2020, the company saw gains driven by unrealized gains on privately held securities of $208 million and publicly traded securities of $138 million, along with other specific gains from remeasuring prior interests in companies like MapAnything and ClickSoftware [1]. However, overall, these gains decreased compared to the previous year, as the total for 2020 was lower than the 2019 figure, which was largely boosted by $345 million in unrealized gains on publicly traded securities [1]. This decline can be quantified more precisely from the detailed financial data, which highlights the net reduction over the period. ![The table summarizes the decrease in Gains on strategic investments from $542 million in 2019 to $427 million in 2020, representing a $115 million drop, alongside changes in Other expense](image5)\n\nTurning to \"Other expense,\" this mainly encompasses interest expenses on debt and leases, offset by investment income [8]. For fiscal 2020, interest expense was $131 million, down from $154 million in 2019, and was partially offset by a $61 million increase in investment income due to higher cash equivalents and marketable securities [8]. This contributed to a notable overall reduction in Other expense for the year, making it lower than in 2019 and reflecting improved financial management amid growth initiatives. The same data source provides a clear view of this shift, reinforcing how these expenses evolved.\n\nIn summary, Gains on strategic investments, net decreased from $542 million in 2019 to $427 million in 2020, while Other expense decreased from $94 million in 2019 to $18 million in 2020."}

Specifically, the yield increased marginally from 11.1% in 2019 to 11.5% in 2020 before dropping to 10.7% in 2021, indicating a net decrease over the two-year period, which can be attributed to factors such as reduced interest income from lower revolving loan balances [4]. This decline was influenced by higher paydown rates on revolving Card Member loans, which led to a decrease in interest yields and overall net interest income [6], even as lower costs of funds provided some offset [1].

The institution's risk management approach, which considers factors like borrower financial strength, loan-to-value ratios, and broader economic conditions, further shaped these changes [4], especially as total loans and lending commitments grew by about $28 billion, amplifying exposure [6].\n\nIn summary, the ACL's expansion highlights the firm's proactive measures against credit risks, with the primary drivers being the CECL adoption and provisions linked to COVID-19 effects.\n\nThe Allowance for Credit Losses increased from $590 million in 2019 to $1,231 million in 2020, mainly due to higher provisions for credit losses resulting from the economic impact of COVID-19 and the adoption of CECL."}

These adjustments are made to reconcile IFRS results to core results, effectively reducing COGS and thereby boosting gross profit in the core figures. For instance, as detailed in the text quotes, COGS often includes amortization of acquired rights and other restructuring charges [3], as well as adjustments for contingent considerations [4] and provisions like shelf stock adjustments [5], which can vary year over year based on business activities.\n\nIn 2020, the adjustments to COGS were significant, totaling around $643 million, which helped elevate the core gross profit from the IFRS figure. ![The 2020 table illustrates adjustments to Cost of Goods Sold, including amortization and impairments, that increased core gross profit by $643 million](image2) This adjustment directly contributed to a net increase in core gross profit of $643 million compared to the IFRS results, reflecting efforts to account for one-time or non-core items like impairments and restructuring.\n\nBy contrast, in 2021, the adjustments to COGS were much larger, amounting to approximately $3,763 million, driven by higher amortization of intangible assets and other items, which had a more substantial impact on core gross profit. ![The 2021 table shows adjustments to Cost of Goods Sold, such as amortization and other charges, that boosted core gross profit by $3,763 million](image3) This resulted in a greater uplift to core gross profit, increasing it by $3,763 million from the IFRS baseline, indicating a year-over-year escalation in these adjustments likely due to ongoing business rationalization and market changes [7].\n\nOverall, the adjustments to COGS in 2021 led to a larger increase in core gross profit compared to 2020, highlighting a growing influence of non-core items on financial reporting. In summary, the core gross profit was enhanced more significantly in 2021 due to higher adjustment values."}

For instance, the company reported a 3% rise in net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble in 2022 compared to the previous year, primarily due to improved earnings before taxes and lower overall expenses, which contributed to the overall growth from the base year of 2020. To illustrate this progression with specific figures, consider the detailed financial data in the following table, which outlines the net earnings for each year: ![A table summarizing Procter & Gamble's net earnings attributable to the company, showing $13,027 million in 2020, $14,306 million in 2021, and $14,742 million in 2022](image1).

Retained earnings represent profits reinvested in the business after dividends, while other comprehensive income includes items like foreign currency translation adjustments that can affect equity without immediately impacting the income statement [1]. For instance, foreign currency effects are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI), potentially influencing the overall stability of equity in a global company.\n\nFrom the financial data, retained earnings decreased from $11,881 million in 2020 to $11,495 million in 2021, as shown in the equity breakdown, which likely stems from factors like net income growth offset by share repurchases, dividends, and other outflows. ![The table details shareholders' equity components, including a decrease in retained earnings from $11,881 million in 2020 to $11,495 million in 2021, and changes in accumulated other comprehensive income](image4) This reduction suggests that while the company generated strong net income of $8,060 million in 2021, as indicated in the equity changes summary, portions were distributed or used for buybacks, potentially limiting funds available for reinvestment and signaling a more conservative approach to growth.\n\nMeanwhile, other comprehensive income showed a slight worsening, with total accumulated other comprehensive loss increasing from $2,895 million in 2020 to $2,945 million in 2021, driven by factors like foreign currency translation adjustments and net unrealized gains or losses on debt securities. ![The table summarizes net income and other comprehensive income components for 2021 and 2020, showing a net other comprehensive loss of $50 million in 2021 compared to $158 million in 2020](image2) This shift, as detailed in the equity evolution, could reflect external economic pressures, such as currency fluctuations, which might erode the company's equity base and increase vulnerability to market volatility.\n\nOverall, these changes contributed to a modest decline in total shareholders' equity from $22,984 million in 2020 to $22,177 million in 2021, as outlined in the comprehensive equity summary, potentially weakening the company's financial position by reducing net assets and liquidity buffers for shareholders. ![The table shows changes in equity categories over the years, including decreases in retained earnings and increases in accumulated other comprehensive loss between 2020 and 2021](image5)\n\nIn summary, the decreases in retained earnings and the slight expansion of other comprehensive losses between 2020 and 2021 led to a reduced shareholders' equity, indicating a slightly diminished financial stability and capacity for future investments."}

Looking ahead, the expected increase in net periodic benefit cost for 2022, excluding mark-to-market effects, is tied to changes in assumptions like higher discount rates, which could influence future trends [9].\n\nOverall, the relationship between the Total Net Periodic Benefit Cost and mark-to-market adjustments is evident, as these gains or losses act as a key modifier that can turn costs into benefits or vice versa, based on factors like discount rates and asset returns.\n\nIn conclusion, the trend in the Total Net Periodic Benefit Cost shifted from a positive cost in 2019 and 2020 to a negative benefit in 2021 and expected in 2022, primarily due to offsetting mark-to-market gains in 2021."}

This growth can be clearly visualized in the population data, which illustrates a sharp upward trend during this period: ![A table displaying Hamilton County's population growth from 130 in 1870 to a peak of 14,096 in 1890, followed by fluctuations](image3). Key factors influencing this surge included the Homestead Act and the Transcontinental Railroad Act of 1862 [9], which encouraged pioneers to claim land and facilitated easier access to the area, transforming it from a sparsely populated region into a bustling agricultural hub.\n\nAfter 1890, the population began a gradual decline, dropping to 13,330 in 1900 and continuing to fluctuate downward through the mid-20th century, with figures like 9,982 in 1940 and 8,778 in 1950 [5], before a slight recovery to 9,403 in 2000. This long-term trend was influenced by factors such as farm consolidation and mechanization, which reduced the number of farms and altered rural life [4], leading to outmigration as smaller towns struggled to maintain populations [3]. For instance, while Aurora saw some growth peaking in 2000 [2], most rural communities peaked earlier, between 1900 and 1940 [3], amid changing agricultural economies that made large-scale farming more viable but less labor-intensive. Ethnic settlements, such as those by Danish immigrants in the northeast, also played a role in early population booms by creating community focal points, as exemplified by: ![An image of St. John’s Lutheran Church, a key site for Danish settlers that highlights the ethnic enclaves contributing to initial population growth](image1).\n\nOverall, the population of Hamilton County grew rapidly from 1870 to 1890 due to land acts and railroad development but then declined gradually because of agricultural changes and consolidation."}

For instance, research indicates that a significant portion of seniors report conditions that impede their interaction with technology, such as physical or health issues that affect reading or daily activities [6]; [8] notes that 23% of older adults have a condition making reading difficult, and 29% deal with disabilities that limit participation in common activities, leading to lower rates of online engagement and device ownership compared to those without these challenges. This disparity is further emphasized when comparing older adults to the general population, where these conditions are less prevalent [9]. To illustrate this difference visually, a bar chart highlights how older adults (65+) experience higher rates of such health issues than all adults overall ![A bar chart indicates that older adults have higher percentages of physical conditions affecting reading (23% vs. 16%) and disabilities impacting daily activities (29% vs. 18%) compared to all adults](image1).

This pattern underscores how pre-training helps by enhancing the encoding of source sentences, with more significant boosts when source language embeddings are pre-trained, as evidenced by comparisons in BLEU scores that favor better representation of less frequent words and concepts [6].\n\nTo illustrate this variability across language pairs, consider the data from a table that compares unaligned and aligned embeddings, where BLEU scores for pairs like Galician to English show a slight decrease (-1.3 points), but others like Azerbaijani to English exhibit a modest increase (+0.1 points), indicating that alignment can have mixed effects depending on language similarity ![A table comparing BLEU scores for various language pairs under unaligned and aligned conditions, showing changes such as a decrease for GL to EN and increases for others](image1).\n\nFurther supporting this, line graphs demonstrate that pre-training yields higher BLEU scores especially when training data is limited, with languages like Russian to English seeing substantial gains that diminish as dataset size grows, emphasizing the technique's value for under-resourced scenarios ![Line graphs depicting BLEU scores and gains from pre-training for PT, TR, and RU to EN, with greater improvements at smaller training set sizes](image2).

At its foundation, the pipeline begins with a multimodal retriever that creates and stores embeddings for images and text descriptions, addressing challenges in efficiently encoding large volumes of data for quick access [8]. This component extracts image features using an image encoder and builds an external memory bank, which is indexed for fast retrieval, such as through the HNSW algorithm to reduce dimensionality and speed up searches [7]. Once the memory is constructed [6], the inference process kicks in, where an input image is encoded, and the top-k similar category labels are retrieved from the memory based on similarity metrics.\n\nBuilding on this, the retrieving and ranking stage integrates the retrieved categories with the input image and uses MLLMs to rank them based on relevance, ensuring more accurate predictions by combining the model's internal knowledge with external data [1]. For instance, in object detection scenarios, additional pre-processing steps like cropping and resizing the image regions around objects, followed by blurring non-target areas, help focus the MLLMs on key elements, as detailed in the handling of detection datasets [3]. This process is visually represented in the pipeline diagram, which clearly shows how embeddings are stored and retrieved before ranking refines the results for final predictions.\n\nTo illustrate the multimodal retriever's role in creating and storing embeddings, ![The RAR pipeline includes a multimodal retriever for extracting and indexing image embeddings, and a retrieving and ranking process for accurate predictions.](image3) And for object detection specifics, where pre-processing enhances retrieval, ![Pre-processing in RAR involves cropping and resizing images to generate precise embeddings for object detection tasks.](image5) These steps ensure the system can handle diverse datasets effectively, as the ranking prompt further refines the retrieved candidates by guiding MLLMs to evaluate similarity [4].\n\nIn summary, the main components of the RAR pipeline are the multimodal retriever for efficient embedding creation and storage, and the retrieving and ranking process for precise predictions."}

This difference arises partly because BiDAF's architecture, with its bidirectional attention flow and iterative interactions, allows it to better integrate information across multiple documents, whereas FastQA struggles more with cross-document reasoning [9] [10]. For instance, on WIKIHOP, BiDAF achieves higher accuracy scores in standard tests, potentially due to its ability to leverage question tokens and textual contexts effectively, even when answers are masked [4]. In contrast, on MEDHOP, where drug mentions are normalized and multi-step inference is crucial, BiDAF still outperforms but shows a more pronounced drop under masking compared to WIKIHOP, indicating sensitivity to vocabulary reductions [4].\n\nTo illustrate these performance metrics, consider the detailed results from one evaluation: ![BiDAF outperforms FastQA on WIKIHOP and MEDHOP, with scores like 54.5% for BiDAF on WIKIHOP test and 33.7% on MEDHOP test](image1).

From the discussion, these slots pose challenges for span-based methods because their values aren't always explicitly matched in the dialogue, leading to lower performance in DS-DST [10]. For instance, DS-DST struggles with slots where values like times aren't directly extractable, relying instead on limited predictions such as 'none' or 'dontcare'. In contrast, DS-Picklist benefits from access to a full ontology, allowing it to reduce error rates by selecting from candidate-value lists, making it more effective for these slots [10].\n\nTo illustrate this performance gap, consider the detailed metrics in the table, which highlights how DS-Picklist generally outperforms DS-DST for such slots due to its ability to handle formatting and contextual inferences more robustly. ![The table compares performance metrics for slots like taxi-leave at across DS-Span, DS-DST, and DS-Picklist, showing DS-Picklist's higher accuracy when ontology is available](image4)\n\nIn summary, DS-Picklist performs better than DS-DST for 'taxi-leave at' and 'train-arrive by' slots, particularly when a full ontology is accessible, as it reduces errors through candidate-value selection."}

For instance, as detailed in the research [9], excluding any single source of supervision tends to degrade performance, with crowdsourced data making the largest overall impact due to its high-quality, manually annotated examples that help in predicting ultra-fine labels accurately. This is further supported by [10], which analyzes results from Table 4 on the development set, showing that removing sources like entity linking (which includes KB and Wikipedia definitions) particularly hurts fine and ultra-fine label prediction, while head-word supervision is especially beneficial for ultra-fine types as it leverages naturally occurring patterns.\n\nTo illustrate these effects with specific metrics, ![This table demonstrates how excluding crowdsourced data, head-word supervision, or entity linking impacts precision, recall, F1-scores, and MRR across total, general, fine, and ultra-fine categories](image1). From this visualization, we can see that for ultra-fine types, excluding crowdsourced data (\"– Crowd\") leads to a noticeable drop in F1-score, indicating its essential role, whereas excluding head-word supervision (\"– Head\") also reduces ultra-fine performance, though entity linking exclusion (\"– EL\") affects fine-grained aspects more prominently, aligning with the observations in [9].\n\nIn summary, excluding different data sources generally results in decreased precision, recall, and F1-scores for ultra-fine categories, with crowdsourced data showing the most significant negative impact."}

In comparison, models like the 8751BH and 8752BH have a more restricted range, with the EA/VPP pin limited to -0.5V to +13.0V [9], and their input/output voltages generally align with lower maximums to accommodate different operational environments, such as reduced power requirements or integrated circuits with less tolerance for high voltages. This difference highlights how the 8751H is optimized for scenarios involving higher voltage programming, while other models prioritize efficiency and compatibility in standard applications. Ultimately, the 8751H's input and output voltage specifications are broader than those of related models like 8751BH and 8752BH, making it suitable for more demanding voltage conditions."}

In a typical monohybrid cross, such as the one involving flower color in pea plants, Mendel observed that crossing two purebred plants—one with purple flowers and one with white flowers—resulted in the first filial (F1) generation where the dominant trait (purple) appeared in all offspring [5]. This occurs because the dominant allele masks the recessive one, as seen in the genetic interactions described in his work.\n\nTo illustrate this process, consider the parental generation where one plant is homozygous dominant (e.g., PP for purple) and the other is homozygous recessive (e.g., pp for white). When these are crossed, the F1 generation consists entirely of heterozygous individuals (Pp), all expressing the dominant purple phenotype. However, when these F1 hybrids are self-pollinated, the F2 generation reveals the key ratios: three-quarters of the plants display the dominant purple flowers and one-quarter show the recessive white flowers, reflecting a phenotypic ratio of 3:1 [5].\n\nThis outcome is due to the segregation of alleles during gamete formation, where each parent contributes one allele randomly, leading to the genotypic possibilities in the F2 generation: one homozygous dominant (PP), two heterozygous (Pp), and one homozygous recessive (pp), for a genotypic ratio of 1:2:1. ![This image demonstrates the Mendelian cross in pea plants, showing a 3:1 phenotypic ratio and 1:2:1 genotypic ratio in the F2 generation](image4) For a clearer visualization of how genotypes like PP, Pp, and pp interact, ![This image outlines key genotypes, including homozygous dominant and recessive forms, which contribute to the F2 genotypic ratios](image3) these diagrams highlight the predictable patterns of inheritance based on allele dominance and segregation.\n\nIn essence, Mendelian inheritance explains these ratios through the principles of segregation and dominance, ensuring that traits reappear in predictable proportions across generations."}

For instance, the initial hot dogs might provide high enjoyment, but as consumption continues, the added value drops off, prompting a shift in preferences to avoid dissatisfaction. This pattern is clearly illustrated in the data from one table, where utility starts strong but quickly wanes: for the first hot dog, utility is +10, then +4 for the second, 0 for the third, and it turns negative at -1 for the fourth, worsening to -4 and -10 for the fifth and sixth ![A table demonstrating how utility from hot dogs diminishes from positive to negative with increased consumption](image4). Similarly, another visualization expands on this by showing even more extreme examples of diminishing returns, such as utility decreasing from +6 for the first hot dog to -50 for the 66th, though it notes an outlier where utility spikes dramatically at 64 hot dogs due to a special outcome like a competition tie ![A table and image highlighting diminishing marginal utility of hot dogs, with an exception of high utility at a specific consumption point](image5).

In meiosis I, homologous chromosomes pair up and separate, reducing the chromosome number from diploid to haploid, as explained in [7], where it states that during meiosis I, homologous chromosomes separate and the chromosome number is halved, while meiosis II involves the separation of sister chromatids without further reducing the chromosome number. For instance, the diagram in image5 clearly outlines this process, showing Meiosis I stages like prophase I, metaphase I, and anaphase I, where homologous chromosomes align and are pulled apart to opposite poles, leading to two haploid cells after cytokinesis ![This diagram shows Meiosis I with homologous chromosomes separating to reduce the chromosome number](image5).\n\nBuilding on this, image1 provides a visual depiction of the early stages, highlighting sites of crossing over in prophase I and the alignment of tetrads along the metaphase plate, which emphasizes the exchange and separation of homologous chromosomes during meiosis I, ultimately contributing to genetic variation. In contrast, meiosis II resembles mitosis more closely, as sister chromatids separate in a process that maintains the haploid state, as noted in [4] and [7]. This is illustrated in image3, which focuses on the later stages where sister chromatids are pulled to opposite poles and haploid daughter cells form, including features like the cleavage furrow that divides the cell ![The image depicts sister chromatids separating during meiosis II to produce haploid daughter cells](image3).\n\nFurther clarifying meiosis II, image4 offers a detailed view of anaphase II, where chromatids move apart, and telophase II, where new nuclei form in the resulting haploid cells, reinforcing that this division does not alter the chromosome number but ensures each gamete receives a complete set ![This image illustrates chromatids separating in meiosis II and the formation of haploid cells](image4). Overall, these differences ensure that meiosis I reduces the chromosome count and promotes diversity, while meiosis II separates identical chromatids to finalize gamete production.\n\nIn summary, meiosis I differs from meiosis II in that it separates homologous chromosomes and halves the chromosome number, whereas meiosis II separates sister chromatids without changing the chromosome number."}

The WMF care program emphasizes using approved cleaning agents to maintain the machine's performance and hygiene, as outlined in the documentation [4], which directs to accessories and spare parts. This ensures proper care to prevent issues like scale buildup or hygiene hazards.\n\nThe cleaning components are specifically detailed in a list that includes items like special cleaners, tablets, and brushes, all designed for routine maintenance of the coffee machine. For instance, these components are intended for use in the care routines described, such as cleaning the milk system or other parts, and they are generally versatile across models. Here's a summary of the key cleaning items and their details:\n\n- The WMF special cleaner for the milk foamer, special cleaning tablets, pipe cleaner, cleaning brush, and other tools are listed with specific order numbers, making them straightforward to order for maintenance tasks.\n\nIn comparison, the water filter components are part of the accessories that focus on water quality and machine protection, particularly to handle hardness in water supplies. These are tailored to specific setups, like constant water supply or water tank systems, which means their compatibility is more limited than the broadly applicable cleaning components.\n\n![A table listing order numbers for WMF care program cleaning components, compatible with all models](image3)  \nAs shown in the table, the cleaning components such as the WMF special cleaner (order number 33 0683 6000), special cleaning tablets (order numbers 33 2332 4000 and 33 2622 0000), pipe cleaner (order number 33 0350 0000), cleaning brush (order number 33 1521 9000), and care kit (order number 33 2888 2000) are all compatible with \"all\" models, making them universally applicable for maintenance across different machine variants.\n\n![A table of accessories including water filter components, compatible with constant water supply and water tank models](image2)  \nOn the other hand, the water filter components, like cartridges and adapters, are specified for either \"Constant water\" or \"Water tank\" models, as indicated in the accessories list.

For instance, in standard consumption scenarios, variety is often recommended because enjoyment diminishes quickly with repetition, as noted in [3] where it explains that when enjoyment drops due to changing preferences, switching to another choice becomes necessary. This aligns with traditional economic views where focusing on one thing, like repeatedly eating hot dogs, is often counterproductive, as highlighted in [4], because it leads to rapidly declining benefits.\n\nTo illustrate this in standard consumption, consider the data in `![A table showing how utility from hot dog consumption decreases from +10 for the first hot dog to -10 for the sixth, demonstrating diminishing returns](image4)`. Here, each additional hot dog provides less utility, eventually turning negative, which underscores how overconsumption without variety can lead to dissatisfaction.\n\nIn contrast, competitive contexts can alter this dynamic, where focused practice or pursuit might sustain or even boost utility despite initial diminishing returns. As [5] points out, decision training and focus can lead to competitive mastery, and [7] suggests that focused efforts build skill and experience, potentially increasing overall utility through better outcomes. This is evident in the hot dog example from a competitive angle, where the pattern of diminishing utility is disrupted by external factors like competition. For example, `![A table illustrating diminishing marginal utility in hot dog consumption that spikes positively at 64 hot dogs due to a competitive achievement, such as tying a championship](image5)` shows how utility can dramatically increase in a contest, overriding the typical decline and emphasizing the cumulative benefits of focus as mentioned in [10].\n\nUltimately, while diminishing marginal utility in standard consumption leads to decreased enjoyment and the need for variety, in competitive settings, it can be mitigated by the drive for mastery and positive outcomes."}
