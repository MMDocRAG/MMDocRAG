Voters in 2008 were also more likely to be happy about the results of the election than voters in 2016.

Despite generally positive views on Biden's foreign policy, his approval rating specifically concerning China is noticeably lower. ![{Confidence levels in Biden to deal with global issues including China}](image6) While a combined 53% of Americans believe he can somewhat or very effectively deal with China, this is the lowest approval rating compared to other foreign policy areas like improving relationships with allies (67% approval) or dealing with terrorism (60% approval) ![{Confidence levels in Biden to deal with global issues including China}](image6).  This suggests that while Americans acknowledge the seriousness of the challenges posed by China, they are less certain about Biden's capacity to navigate this complex geopolitical landscape effectively.

While many people acknowledge the potential effectiveness of these systems, significantly fewer believe they are fair. For example, [8] 54% believe a personal finance score algorithm would be effective at identifying good customers, yet only 32% find it fair to judge consumers in this way. This discrepancy is starkly highlighted in  ![This bar chart illustrates the discrepancy between the perceived effectiveness and fairness of four automated decision-making systems: personal finance scores, video job interview analysis, resume screening, and parole scoring.](image8) which compares the effectiveness and fairness ratings of four different automated systems. Notably, the personal finance score stands out with a 22-point difference between its perceived effectiveness and fairness, while the parole scoring system shows a more balanced perception.  This difference in perception is particularly striking when we consider the criminal risk score and personal finance score [8]. Despite similar perceived effectiveness in their respective tasks, a larger share of Americans find the criminal risk score fairer than the personal finance score. This suggests that public trust in automated systems hinges not only on their efficacy but also, perhaps more importantly, on their perceived fairness. The disparity between perceived effectiveness and fairness underscores a crucial point: [5] there is broad public concern about the fairness of algorithmic decision-making. This concern stems from a multitude of factors, including the fear that [6] computer programs will inevitably reflect human bias and fail to capture the nuances of complex situations.  Furthermore, [7] many people believe these systems remove the human element from important decisions, leading to a lack of empathy and understanding. This concern is particularly pronounced in scenarios like job interviews, where [7] 16% of respondents specifically highlighted the removal of the human element as a concern with automated video analysis. This is further illustrated in ![This infographic presents data on the acceptability of using video analysis during job interviews. It shows that a larger percentage of respondents (67%) find it unacceptable compared to those who find it acceptable (32%).](image5), which indicates a strong preference for human involvement in evaluating job candidates.  The data suggests that public trust in automated systems is low, particularly when these systems are perceived as unfair. This lack of trust can have significant implications, potentially leading to resistance against the adoption and implementation of such systems. To foster trust, it is crucial to address public concerns about fairness, transparency, and accountability in algorithmic decision-making.  In conclusion, while automated systems are often seen as potentially effective, their perceived unfairness significantly hinders public trust. \n"}

[9] This discrepancy highlights that self-identification plays a significant role in racial and ethnic identity.  A key factor influencing this self-identification is generational difference. [10] While 85% of first-generation immigrants identify as Hispanic, this number drops with each subsequent generation, falling to 77% for the third generation and 50% for the fourth or higher.  Several reasons contribute to this decline. \n\n![This bar chart shows reasons why individuals of Hispanic ancestry may not self-identify as Hispanic.](image3)\n\n[1] A significant 27% attribute their choice to a mixed background or distant Hispanic ancestry.  Upbringing and limited contact with Hispanic relatives account for 16%, indicating the role of cultural immersion. [7] Interestingly, language is not a primary factor, with the majority of self-identified Hispanics, across all generations, stating that speaking Spanish is not a requirement for Latino identity. ![This chart compares the percentage of self-identified Hispanics across generations who speak Spanish and have a Spanish last name.](image1) This suggests that cultural connection might be more influential than language in shaping self-identification.\n\n[6] These trends are significant as they highlight the evolving nature of Hispanic identity in the U.S., especially with the increasing number of U.S.-born Hispanics with mixed heritages. The closer individuals are to their immigrant roots, the more likely they are to identify as Hispanic. However, subsequent generations, with their U.S. upbringing and experiences, may develop a sense of identity more aligned with being American. [3] This shift is evident in the increasing percentage of second and third-generation Hispanics who consider themselves typical Americans, reaching 63% and 73%, respectively. \n\nIn conclusion, generational differences heavily influence how individuals of Hispanic descent self-identify in the U.S., with cultural immersion and connection to heritage playing a significant role. \n"}

This observation is further supported by the analysis of citation quality when knowledge is removed [9].  The recall of citations remains stable at approximately 15, regardless of the amount of absent knowledge, suggesting a limited capacity to identify all absent knowledge [10].

This trend, however, shifts as the difficulty level increases.  While GPT-4V maintains its lead in the \"Medium\" category at 55.6%, the gap narrows.  The \"Hard\" category reveals a further diminishing performance gap, suggesting that as task complexity increases, the advantage of advanced models diminishes [6, 7]. This observation highlights the challenges faced by even the most sophisticated models in handling expert-level queries.\n\nFurther analysis across different disciplines unveils another layer of complexity.  ![The table presents performance metrics of various large multimodal models (LMMs) and large language models (LLMs) across different validation and test sets, and specific categories/disciplines.](image3)  Both GPT-4V and LLaVA-1.5-13B exhibit varying performance levels depending on the subject matter. For instance, in disciplines like \"Art & Design\" and \"Humanities & Social Sciences,\" where visual data tends to be less intricate and questions require less complex reasoning, both models perform relatively well [12]. Conversely, in fields like \"Science,\" \"Health & Medicine,\" and \"Technology & Engineering\" — domains characterized by complex visual data and reasoning — both models show lower performance.  Notably, the integration of OCR and captioning technologies does not significantly bridge this performance gap, suggesting that the MMMU benchmark demands a deeper, more integrated understanding of both textual and visual information [12]. ![The image is a chart displaying the distribution of 11.5K multimodal questions across six broad disciplines, 30 subjects, and 183 subfields.](image6) This highlights the need for models that can effectively interpret and integrate both modalities rather than merely relying on textual cues derived from images. \n\nIn conclusion, while GPT-4V consistently outperforms LLaVA-1.5-13B across different difficulty levels and subject categories, both models show limitations in handling complex visual reasoning and domain-specific knowledge, especially in fields requiring intricate analysis of visual data. \n"}

Without the R-GCN component, the model's accuracy drops by 8 points, demonstrating its importance in improving performance [4]. The R-GCN component enables the model to perform better than the Coref-GRU model, even without access to context, by leveraging relations between mentions to update their representations [4].  `![{This table compares the performance of different model configurations, highlighting the impact of removing components like R-GCN and various relation types on accuracy in both unmasked and masked settings}](image4)` shows that the model without R-GCN scores 62.4 in unmasked and 63.2 in masked settings, significantly lower than the full model's scores of 68.5 and 71.6, respectively.\n\nFurther analysis reveals that using ELMo embeddings alone, even without R-GCN, yields better results than removing edges connecting mentions within supporting documents [12].  This suggests that ELMo captures predictive context features effectively [12]. However, relying solely on ELMo without the R-GCN limits the model's ability to perform multi-hop inference, which is crucial for tasks like WIKIHOP [12].  The ablation study on relation types reveals that removing document-based connections has a more noticeable impact on accuracy compared to removing MATCH or COREF connections [7].

It achieves state-of-the-art joint goal accuracy of 48.62% on the MultiWOZ dataset, encompassing five distinct domains [3].  A key strength of TRADE is its ability to share parameters across domains, facilitating zero-shot DST for unseen domains. For instance, in a zero-shot setting, TRADE achieves 60.58% joint goal accuracy on the Taxi domain, as illustrated in ![This table compares \"Trained Single\" and \"Zero-Shot\" performance across five categories: Hotel, Train, Attraction, Restaurant, and Taxi.  ](image2).

GEM, in particular, outperforms naive fine-tuning by preserving knowledge from previously learned domains [1, 4]. This suggests that retaining information about slot similarities across domains is beneficial.

A study [6] examined four popular commercial MT systems and two state-of-the-art academic MT models across eight languages, revealing a significant propensity for gender-biased translations in all tested systems and languages [9]. The study employed three metrics: overall system accuracy, the difference in F1 scores between masculine and feminine scores (ΔG), and the difference in F1 scores between stereotypical and non-stereotypical gender role assignments (ΔS) [9]. \n\n![This table presents accuracy and error metrics for different translation services—Google Translate, Microsoft Translator, Amazon Translate, and SYSTRAN—across various languages.](image4)\n\nThe findings indicated that translation accuracy varied significantly across languages and systems [7]. Notably, German exhibited the highest translation accuracies, potentially attributed to its linguistic similarities with English [7]. Conversely, languages like Arabic and Hebrew showed more significant discrepancies in performance, suggesting a greater susceptibility to gender bias [7].  For instance, Google Translate's performance on stereotypical translations consistently surpasses its accuracy on non-stereotypical translations across all tested languages. \n\n![The image is a bar chart displaying the accuracy of Google Translate's performance on gender translation for different languages, specifically comparing stereotypical and non-stereotypical translations.

This highlights the biased translation arising from stereotypical gender roles.

The company's foreign exchange risk management strategy focuses on minimizing the short-term adverse effects of these fluctuations on earnings and cash flow, aiming to enhance the predictability of its financial results [4]. Novo Nordisk acknowledges that foreign exchange risk is a significant factor that can substantially influence various financial statements, including the income statement, statement of comprehensive income, balance sheet, and cash flow statement [12]. The company's hedging activities primarily involve managing exposures in major currencies such as USD, CNY, and JPY. Notably, the risk associated with EUR is considered minimal due to Denmark's fixed exchange rate policy against the Euro [3]. The company employs hedge accounting to align the impacts of hedged items and hedging instruments in its consolidated income statement [1].  Furthermore, the financial contracts are projected to affect the income statement within the next 12 months, with deferred gains and losses from cash flow hedges subsequently transferred to financial income or expenses [7]. \n\n![The image shows the sensitivity of Novo Nordisk's operating profit to changes in exchange rates](image1)\n\nThe image illustrates the sensitivity of Novo Nordisk's operating profit to fluctuations in exchange rates.

In ‘Markets products, Insurance and  Investments and Other’, revenue was  $0.4 billion  lower, reflecting the impact of lower interest  rates on income earned on capital held in  the business, a fall in revenue from  Insurance, Investments and Markets  products, as well as a reduction in  revaluation gains on shares [6].  – In Global Banking, revenue decreased by $0.1 billion or  2%, reflecting lower real estate  and structured finance fee income and  losses on legacy corporate restructuring  positions [12]. The Global Banking segment, despite a  $0.1 billion decline in revenue, managed to reduce adjusted operating expenses, indicating better cost control compared to the  GTRF segment, which faced larger revenue  declines alongside increased operating expenses [12]. The pandemic's impact is evident in the GTRF segment's  4% revenue decrease due to reduced trade  volumes, highlighting its sensitivity to global economic conditions [7].

In 2021, Peacock generated $778 million in revenue but also incurred substantial operating costs and expenses of $2.5 billion [6].  ![{The table presents financial data for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, in millions}](image1). The growth in revenue can be partly attributed to the return of activities post-pandemic. For instance, the Theme Parks segment experienced a significant 141.2% surge in revenue, reaching $5.1 billion, while its Adjusted EBITDA rose from a loss of $(0.5) billion to a profit of $1.3 billion [6]. This recovery was largely driven by the reopening of theme parks after pandemic-related closures and capacity limitations, coupled with the launch of a new theme park in Beijing, China, in September 2021 [6].\n\nIn conclusion, NBCUniversal's financial performance from 2019 to 2021 was characterized by a significant revenue increase, largely driven by post-pandemic recovery and the growth of Peacock, although the latter also contributed to higher operating costs, impacting the overall profitability. \n"}

Net interest income, a key driver of bank profitability, experienced a significant decrease of $5.5 billion from 2019 to 2020 [5].  This decrease in net interest income was primarily due to the lower interest rate environment, as indicated in the financial data. ![The table outlines changes in interest income and interest expense over two periods: 2019 to 2020, and 2018 to 2019, expressed in millions of dollars.

The organizational structure of Bank of America, encompassing divisions like Consumer Banking, Global Wealth & Investment Management, Global Banking, Global Markets, and All Other, plays a crucial role in its financial performance. ![The image displays an organizational chart of the Bank of America Corporation with five main divisions](image1) Each division contributes to both interest income and expenses through its specific operations, such as lending and deposit-taking.  The data reveals a notable downturn in net interest income from 2019 to 2020, primarily because the decrease in interest income outpaced the decrease in interest expenses.  This suggests that despite efforts to reduce expenses, the impact of lower interest rates on earning assets was more substantial. [2]  The changes in net interest income and net interest expense from 2019 to 2020 differed significantly from the changes observed from 2018 to 2019, mainly due to the unprecedented economic conditions brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting low-interest-rate environment. The organizational structure of Bank of America, with its diverse business segments, influenced how these changes impacted the bank's overall financial performance.  The major difference was a significant decline in net interest income from 2019 to 2020, primarily driven by lower interest rates, in contrast to a more stable situation from 2018 to 2019. \n"}

Furthermore, equity securities, despite their inherent volatility [7],  experienced a significant increase from $269,498 thousand to $334,907 thousand [3]. This strategy, while potentially leading to higher returns in the long run, also exposes the company to greater market fluctuations.

Analyzing the company’s upstream operations reveals a notable trend.  ![{The table provides a summary of the financial performance of both Upstream and Downstream operations, as well as other financial impacts, contributing to the company's overall net income or loss for each year.}](image3) In 2019, both United States and International upstream operations experienced losses, resulting in a total upstream loss of $2,433 million. However, this trend reversed significantly in 2020 and 2021, with both segments reporting substantial profits, contributing to a total upstream earning of $15,818 million in 2021.

Despite these decreases, [2] states that total revenues, excluding interest expense, increased by 17% year-over-year, demonstrating growth in non-interest revenue streams. This growth is attributed to a significant increase in discount revenue, primarily from increased Card Member spending.  The company's focus on premium card portfolios [1] and efforts to enhance its premium value propositions contributed to increased card acquisitions and high card member retention, further boosting revenue [2].  Although net interest income declined, the company's overall financial performance remained strong, as evidenced by a 17% revenue growth. American Express's strategic emphasis on non-interest revenue streams, such as discount revenue and card fees, compensated for the decline in interest income from lower average Card Member loans.  In conclusion, average Card Member loans decreased while net interest income decreased slightly, but overall the company's financial performance remained strong due to growth in non-interest revenue. \n"}

Take, for instance, the effect of price changes on coal. In 2021, BHP's Underlying EBITDA for coal saw a significant decrease, dropping by $\\cup S\\Phi1.3$ billion to $\\cup S\\Phi288$ million. This decline was largely attributed to lower price impacts, which alone accounted for a US$0.7 billion reduction, exceeding the impact of lower sales volumes [2]. \n\n![{This table compares the financial and operational performance of Queensland Coal and NSWEC (New South Wales Energy Coal) over fiscal years 2020 and 2021.}](image8) \n\nThis table further illustrates the impact of price changes on Queensland Coal, where despite relatively stable gross costs and sales volumes, the lower average realised prices for metallurgical and thermal coal in 2021 led to a significant drop in revenue and Underlying EBITDA [6]. \n\nWhile coal prices negatively impacted BHP, nickel presented a contrasting picture. BHP experienced a positive impact from higher nickel prices in 2021, as evidenced by the performance of Nickel West. Underlying EBITDA for Nickel West increased by US$296 million, reaching US$259 million in FY2021. This positive result was attributed to higher nickel prices and increased sales volumes, coupled with lower maintenance costs [9]. However, it's worth noting that the company acknowledges the adverse effects of the strong nickel prices on third-party concentrate purchase costs [9]. \n\n![{The table shows the financial impact of changes in commodity prices on profit after taxation from continuing operations and on underlying EBITDA, expressed in US$ million.}](image5)\n\nThis table provides a concise overview of how individual commodity price changes affect BHP's profit. It highlights that for every US$1 per tonne increase in the iron ore price, the impact on profit after taxation is a significant US$163 million. This data underscores BHP's exposure to commodity price volatility and its dependence on favorable market conditions for strong financial performance [4].\n\nIn conclusion, changes in commodity prices, as exemplified by the contrasting cases of coal and nickel, have a substantial and multifaceted impact on BHP's financial results. Lower coal prices contributed to a decline in earnings, while higher nickel prices had a positive effect. \n"}

[1] This surge was fueled by the arrival of pioneers from various parts of the US and Europe, drawn westward by acts like the Homestead Act of 1862. [2, 5]  This act, along with the Transcontinental Railroad Act, significantly impacted Nebraska's landscape by encouraging settlement and connecting the state to the rest of the nation via the Union Pacific Railroad.

It addresses the challenge of efficiently encoding and storing large volumes of image/text embeddings for quick and accurate retrieval [9].  This module utilizes techniques like the HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World) algorithm to optimize retrieval speed by reducing the dimensionality of the embeddings [7]. Once the multimodal retriever constructs a memory bank (M) of embeddings, the retrieving and ranking module comes into play [6].  During inference, when an input image is presented, this module retrieves the top-k class names most similar to the image from the memory bank [11].  Subsequently, it utilizes Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to rank these retrieved candidate results, leveraging the MLLMs' ability to excel in re-ranking top results obtained through vision-language models [3].  This ranking process, illustrated below with an example of car model recognition, is guided by a prompt that merges the input image with the retrieved category information, enabling the MLLMs to make a more accurate and contextually aware final prediction of the image category [2]. ![This illustrates the process of using few-shot learning and ranking prompts to classify images.](image6) \n\nIn essence, the RAR pipeline combines the strengths of both CLIP (Contrastive Language–Image Pre-training) and MLLMs to enhance few-shot/zero-shot recognition abilities for datasets with extensive and fine-grained vocabularies [12].

[9] Instead of relying on traditional methods like anchor generation or non-maximum suppression, DETR leverages the power of transformers and bipartite matching for object detection. [2]\n\nThe architecture of DETR is depicted in the image below. ![The image illustrates the concept of DETR (DEtection TRansformer), which combines a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with a transformer architecture to predict object detections.](image4) DETR uses a CNN backbone to extract features from the input image. These features are then passed to a transformer encoder-decoder structure. [3] The transformer encoder processes the image features, while the decoder utilizes learned positional embeddings referred to as \"object queries.\" [5] \n\n![The image is an illustration of the DETR (Detection Transformer) model architecture, which is used for object detection tasks.](image5) The decoder interacts with the output of the encoder and refines its predictions using these object queries. [5] Each object query in the decoder is designed to capture information about a potential object in the image. The decoder uses self-attention and encoder-decoder attention mechanisms to reason about the relationships between these object queries and the encoded image features. [5]  For each object query, the model predicts the class label and bounding box coordinates. [5]\n\n Notably, the object queries are crucial for DETR to output a fixed-size set of predictions, regardless of the number of objects present in the image.  The model is trained end-to-end using a set-based global loss, ensuring that each ground-truth object is uniquely assigned to a predicted object. [9] This bipartite matching process contributes to DETR's ability to make unique predictions without relying on non-maximum suppression. [10]\n\nIn summary, DETR uses object queries as learnable positional embeddings in its decoder to represent object candidates. These queries interact with encoded image features through attention mechanisms, allowing the model to reason about object relationships and predict their classes and locations directly. \n"}

The study focuses on three methods [9]: NCF+Most Salient Personality [11], NCF+Soft-labeled Personality [10], and NCF+Hard-coded Personality [8]. The Soft-labeled method utilizes a weighted sum of personality vectors, where weights are derived from OCEAN scores [10].  ![The image is a diagram illustrating a model that uses different methods to integrate personality trait scores represented by the OCEAN model, which includes Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism. In this example, a user has an OCEAN score of {30, 70, 50, 30, 20}. The diagram presents three methods for incorporating these scores into the model:\n\n1. **Method 1: Most Salient Personality** - This method selects the personality trait with the highest score (Conscientiousness in this case, with a score of 70) to create a personality embedding vector. This vector is then used along with a user latent vector and item latent vector in a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) to generate a score.\n\n2. **Method 2: Soft-labeled Personality** - This method applies a softmax function to the OCEAN scores to generate probabilities, which are then used to weight the personality embedding matrix. This matrix encompasses all five OCEAN traits, and each trait is represented as a vector. The weighted sum of these vectors acts as the personality embedding.\n\n3. **Method 3: Hard-coded Personality** - This method scales the raw OCEAN scores and fixes them as a personality vector {0.3, 0.7, 0.5, 0.3, 0.2}, which won't change during training as no gradient is applied to it. Like the other methods, this personality vector is combined with other latent vectors in the MLP to produce a score.\n\nThe outputs from these methods, serving as personality embeddings, are combined with a user latent vector and an item latent vector in an MLP to generate a final score. Each method represents a different approach to incorporating personality data into a machine learning model.](image2) However, the question cannot be answered from the given information as the provided quotes and images lack details about specific user data, including the user A2GBIFL43U1LKJ and the colors assigned to personality vectors within the model.

[1]  ![The image is a graphic illustration showing the interaction between a CD8+ T cell and a liver cell in the context of malaria infection. It highlights the immune response aimed at eliminating the parasite.](image5) The illustration showcases the intricate workings of the immune system in targeting malaria parasites. Specifically, it focuses on the role of CD8+ T cells, a type of white blood cell, in recognizing and destroying infected liver cells.  The process begins when a liver cell becomes infected with the malaria parasite. This infected cell then displays fragments of the parasite, known as Pf peptides, on its surface using MHC Class I molecules. These molecules act as flags, signaling to the immune system that the cell is compromised.  CD8+ T cells, key players in the immune response, possess specialized receptors that can recognize these parasite-derived peptides presented on MHC Class I molecules. Upon recognition, the CD8+ T cell binds to the infected liver cell. This interaction triggers the release of cytotoxic molecules, namely perforin and granzymes, by the CD8+ T cell. Perforin creates pores in the membrane of the infected cell, allowing granzymes to enter and induce a process of programmed cell death called apoptosis. This effectively destroys the infected liver cell, along with the parasites residing within.  The illustration also highlights the involvement of other immune signaling pathways, such as IFN-γ and Fas/FasR interactions, which further contribute to the elimination of the parasite.  In summary, this detailed illustration underscores the complexity of the immune response against malaria infection. The identification of novel antigens involved in this process is crucial for the development of effective malaria vaccines. [5]  According to the illustration, the immune system targets malaria parasites by CD8+ T cells recognizing infected liver cells and releasing molecules to destroy them. \n"}

He discovered that parents pass on heritable factors, now known as genes, to their offspring [4]. These genes are located at specific positions called gene loci on chromosomes [3]. Mendel's experiments, often depicted using Punnett squares like the one shown below, illustrate the principles of inheritance.\n\n![This image illustrates Mendelian inheritance. It shows a cross between purple-flowered and white-flowered plants in the P (parent) generation, resulting in all purple-flowered plants in the F₁ generation due to dominant traits. In the F₂ generation, the offspring consist of ¾ purple-flowered and ¼ white-flowered plants, demonstrating the segregation of alleles.](image4)\n\nA classic example is the inheritance of flower color in pea plants. When he crossed a true-breeding purple-flowered plant (PP) with a true-breeding white-flowered plant (pp), the resulting F₁ generation all had purple flowers. This is because the purple allele (P) is dominant over the white allele (p) [11].\n\n![The image illustrates a genetic cross diagram, showcasing the inheritance of traits in plants. It uses a classical Mendelian genetics approach.](image1)\n\nHowever, when the F₁ generation self-fertilized, the F₂ generation showed a phenotypic ratio of 3:1, with three purple-flowered plants for every one white-flowered plant [11]. This 3:1 phenotypic ratio arises from the genotypic ratio of 1 PP: 2 Pp: 1 pp in the F₂ generation [1]. The white flower phenotype reappears in the F₂ generation because the recessive allele (p) is expressed when two copies are present (pp) [11].\n\n![This image displays information about genotypes:\n\n1. **PP** - This represents a homozygous dominant genotype.\n2. **aa** - This represents a homozygous recessive genotype (also shown in Arabic).\n3. **Bb** - This represents a heterozygous genotype (also shown in Arabic).\n\nEach genotype is labeled with its corresponding genetic description.](image8)\n\nThis segregation of alleles during gamete formation and their random combination during fertilization leads to the observed phenotypic and genotypic ratios in the F2 generation. Offspring inherit a unique set of genes from both parents, resulting in similarities and variations in traits [2].  Mendelian inheritance, through the concepts of dominant and recessive alleles, explains the phenotypic and genotypic ratios observed in the F2 generation by the principles of segregation and independent assortment. \n"}

It includes an electron micrograph of a chromosome on the left, highlighting the centromere. To the right, there are illustrations of a chromosome with labeled parts. An arrow indicates the splitting of the chromosome with the label \"Chromosome distribution to daughter cells.\" This diagram appears to represent the process of chromosome segregation during cell division.](image2)  During mitosis, the chromosomes, duplicated during the S phase [1], condense and become visible [8]. They appear as two sister chromatids joined at the centromere [8].  ![This image depicts the stages of cell division, specifically illustrating the process of mitosis. It shows three main phases:\n\n1. **Interphase**:\n   - The cell contains centrosomes (with centriole pairs), a nucleolus, and a nuclear envelope.\n   - Chromatin is present in the nucleus.\n\n2. **Prophase/Early Mitotic Spindle Formation**:\n   - The centrosomes begin moving to opposite poles.\n   - Chromosomes, made of two sister chromatids, start condensing.\n   - The mitotic spindle begins to form.\n\n3. **Prometaphase**:\n   - The nuclear envelope fragments.\n   - Kinetochore microtubules connect to the chromosomes at their centromeres.\n   - Spindle microtubules extend across the cell.\n\nThese stages illustrate how the cell prepares to divide its genetic material into two daughter cells.](image6) The cell cycle concludes with cytokinesis, resulting in two daughter cells [4]. In summary, the main stages of the cell cycle are interphase (G₁, S, G₂) and the mitotic phase (mitosis and cytokinesis). \n"}
