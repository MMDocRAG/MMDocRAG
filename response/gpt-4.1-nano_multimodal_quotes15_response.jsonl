In September 2014, a substantial 50% of Americans believed Islam was more likely than other religions to encourage violence, reaching a peak of 50% in September 2014 [4]. This belief has since declined slightly, with current figures indicating about 46% agree, and 45% disagree, reflecting a close divide [4].\n\n**Trends Over Time:**\n- Since 2014, the share of Americans who see Islam as more likely to encourage violence has decreased from a high of 50% to roughly 46%, suggesting a slight reduction in this perception [4].\n- Among various demographic groups, older adults (65+) have shown the most significant change, with the percentage believing Islam encourages violence dropping from 64% in September 2014 to 51% now [2, 10].\n- Conversely, perceptions among certain religious groups, like white evangelical Protestants, remain high, with 70% still believing Islam encourages violence, indicating persistent views in these communities [9].\n\n**Across Political Affiliations:**\n- The divide is stark and widening along partisan lines. Among Republicans, a consistently high proportion (around 68-77%) believe Islam encourages violence, with a slight increase to 77% in recent data [6, 8, 10].\n- In contrast, Democrats have seen a significant decline; only about 30% now believe Islam encourages violence, down from roughly 42% in 2014 [4, 8]. This indicates a narrowing of perceptions within the Democratic camp.\n- The ideological divide within parties is even more pronounced. Nearly 75% of conservative Republicans believe Islam encourages violence, whereas only 16% of liberal Democrats agree with this [7].\n\n**Visual Evidence:**\n- The graphs illustrate this polarization vividly. For instance, the partisan divide chart shows Democrats' belief in Islam encouraging violence has dropped substantially, while Republicans' beliefs remain high and relatively stable [5]. Similarly, the overall perception line has decreased slightly over time, but the partisan gap remains the widest ever recorded [4, 5].\n\n**Summary:**\nPerceptions have generally become somewhat less favorable towards Islam regarding encouragement of violence since 2014, especially among Democrats and younger populations. Meanwhile, Republican and conservative groups continue to largely hold strong beliefs that Islam encourages violence, reinforcing the polarization.

A significant majority, around 77% [7], consider the idea to be generally realistic, with nearly 20% viewing it as extremely realistic [7]. Awareness levels greatly influence these perceptions: those who have heard a lot about automation are more likely to see it as realistic and to express enthusiasm, with 48% of them finding it extremely realistic [6], and 47% feeling somewhat enthusiastic [4].\n\nHowever, despite this recognition of plausibility, most Americans tend to worry more than they are enthusiastic. About 72% express worry about machines doing many jobs, compared to only 33% who feel enthusiastic [9], indicating a dominant concern about potential negative outcomes. They are more concerned about economic and social impacts, like inequality and job displacement, though many also support measures like universal basic income and job restrictions to mitigate adverse effects [4].\n\nVisually, the data aligns with their perception. For example, image5 shows that 48% of Americans have heard a lot about this concept, correlating with higher realism and enthusiasm levels.

According to [6], **85% of Americans favor limiting robots and computers to “dangerous and dirty” jobs**, with nearly half (47%) expressing strong support. This suggests a widespread preference for leveraging automation where it poses safety risks to humans, rather than replacing human workers across all domains.\n\nIn addition, about **58% of Americans believe there should be limits on the number of jobs that businesses can replace with machines** (image2). Conversely, 41% think businesses are justified in replacing human workers if they provide better, cheaper work (image2). This indicates a considerable portion of the population supports regulating automation to protect employment levels.\n\nFurthermore, the overall sentiment includes a division on accountability for displaced workers, but a common stance on restrictions: as [4] notes, Americans are **evenly divided on whether government or individuals should support displaced workers**, but there is broader support for limiting how many jobs can be replaced by machines.\n\nAdditionally, in policy preferences, the public responds favorably to initiatives like a **universal basic income (60%)** and **national service programs (58%)** to address displacement, which signals openness to broader social safety measures instead of purely focusing on limiting automation.\n\nIn summary, a large majority of Americans support policies that limit machine use to specific dangerous jobs and favor regulation to prevent excessive replacement of human workers [6]. Although opinions vary, there is broad backing for balancing technological advancement with safeguards for employment [2], [4].\n\n**In conclusion:**\nThe public generally favors regulating and limiting how extensively machines replace human labor, especially in hazardous roles, while supporting social policies to assist displaced workers."}

According to the quotes, 92% of voters believed there was more “mudslinging” or negative campaigning than in past elections, a significant increase from previous years [7][9]. This heightened negativity is reflected in their assessments of various actors; for instance, only 22% of voters gave the press and pollsters high grades, with a substantial portion assigning failing grades (38% for the press, 30% for pollsters) [3]. Similarly, voters rated the political parties poorly—about 22% of voters gave the Republican Party and 26% the Democratic Party an A or B grade, with around 28-30% giving them failing grades, which marks the worst perceptions since 1988 [5].\n\nFurthermore, voter sentiment towards candidates and their campaigns was equally critical. Donald Trump received low marks for his conduct during the campaign, and voters also rated other campaign actors harshly [5]. Despite some voters feeling hopeful (51%) or uneasy (53%) about Trump's election, large segments expressed negative emotions such as sadness, fear, and anger—41% each—and only a small proportion felt proud (36%) or proud (7%) about the election outcome [1][6].\n\nThese perceptions of negativity and dissatisfaction are linked; the overall impression is that voters found the campaign to be “extraordinarily negative,” with record levels of negative campaigning, mudslinging, and poor conduct by political actors—further fueling their negative evaluations of the election process itself [8][9][10].\n\n**In summary**, the high levels of campaign negativity, characterized by increased mudslinging and poor conduct by candidates, parties, and media, directly contributed to voters’ overwhelmingly negative perceptions of the political process and key political entities during the 2016 election. \n\n![More mudslinging in 2016 versus past elections](image1)"}

The widespread mudslinging (92%) emphasizes the highly negative campaign environment, which likely amplified feelings of disappointment and disillusionment among Clinton supporters.\n\n**In summary:**  \nTrump voters mainly reacted with hope, pride, and happiness, influenced by their positive perceptions of Trump’s victory and campaign atmosphere. Clinton voters, on the other hand, experienced shock, disappointment, and disgust, feelings driven by the highly negative, mudslinging campaign and their perception of an unjust or upsetting electoral process."}

Among Trump supporters, while a majority (60%) were surprised, 40% said they were not surprised, indicating some expectation or readiness for his victory, yet still largely unanticipated [5].\n\nIn terms of primary emotions, Clinton voters predominantly felt shock, disappointment, and disgust—emotions that suggest a deep sense of disbelief and perhaps disappointment in an outcome they did not expect [7]. Trump supporters, on the other hand, expressed a range of emotions including happiness, surprise, relief, and excitement, which reflect their optimistic or positive expectations about Trump's potential impact [8] and the fact that they saw his victory as a successful outcome aligning with their preferences.\n\nSupporting this, the data on how voters summed up their reaction in a word corroborates the emotional divide: Trump supporters most often described their reaction as \"happy\" or \"relieved,\" emphasizing satisfaction and possibly expectancy fulfilled, whereas Clinton supporters described their reactions with words like \"shocked,\" \"disappointed,\" and \"disgusted,\" indicative of unmet expectations and disbelief [9].\n\nFurthermore, the overall positivity of reactions among Trump voters contrasts with the more negative and shocked reactions among Clinton voters, reinforcing the idea that many Clinton supporters did not expect Trump to win, leading to feelings of disbelief and surprise. Conversely, Trump supporters’ reactions reflect either anticipation or a positive feeling about his victory, which suggests they either expected or hoped for the outcome.\n\n### Visual Summary:\n- **Image 2** shows a large majority (73%) of all voters were not surprised by Trump's win, but among Clinton supporters, 87% were surprised, indicating low expectations for his victory among that group.\n- **Image 3** highlights the range of emotions, with Trump supporters more likely to describe their feelings as \"happy\" and \"relieved,\" while Clinton supporters more often felt \"shocked\" and \"disappointed.\"\n- **Image 4** also supports the idea of expectation gap, where most voters, especially Clinton supporters, experienced surprise after the outcome.\n\n### In essence:\nThe reactions reveal that **Clinton voters had low expectations of Trump winning, leading to shock and disappointment when he did win, whereas Trump supporters generally anticipated or desired his victory, feeling happy and relieved**. This contrast underscores the divergence in expectations prior to the election, with Clinton supporters largely underestimating Trump's chances, and Trump supporters feeling optimistic or confident about his eventual win."}

About 75% of Americans say that China’s early response played a \"great deal\" or a \"fair amount\" in spreading the virus, with Republicans particularly critical—73% believe China’s handling contributed \"a great deal\"—compared to 38% of Democrats [4,1]. Similarly, around two-thirds (64%) of Americans think China did a \"bad job\" managing the outbreak, with 43% deeming it a \"very bad\" response [10].\n\nIn terms of blame, half of Americans think the U.S. should hold China responsible for its role in the pandemic, even at the expense of worsening economic relations. Politically, this viewpoint is more prevalent among Republicans and GOP-leaning independents (71%) compared to Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents (37%) [7].\n\nWhen examining views on China's overall performance, Republicans and older adults are more critical. For example, 82% of Republicans and 73% of those aged 50 and over believe China has handled the coronavirus badly, with many rating China’s response as \"very bad\" [8]. In contrast, Democrats are comparatively less critical but still largely disapprove of China's handling [8].\n\nSurvey trends over time show a shift toward greater negativity.

Among them, the vast majority—especially conservative Republicans—believe China and the U.S. have not managed the pandemic well (80% and 77%, respectively) [6], [7]. Most Republicans, including conservatives, advocate for the U.S. dealing primarily with its own issues, demonstrating skepticism toward international aid and engagement.\n- **Democrats** hold more supportive views of global engagement.

This indicates a gap between their concerns about China and their confidence in presidential leadership to manage those challenges effectively.\n\n**Summary:** Americans are less confident in Biden's ability to handle China effectively compared to how seriously they view issues like cyberattacks and military threats from China, which are considered very serious by a large majority."}

The trend suggests that Hispanic unemployment remains relatively higher despite improvements.\n\n**Economic Perceptions:**  \n- Hispanics report more optimistic views of the national economy compared to non-Hispanic whites, with 35% considering current conditions good or excellent, versus 25% of whites [9]. Moreover, 34% of Hispanics expect the economy to improve in the coming year, approximately double the share among other groups.  \n- However, their personal financial outlooks are mixed, with only 23% of those with less than a high school education or immigrant Hispanics rating their finances as \"excellent\" or \"good,\" and older Hispanics (65+) showing relatively lower confidence in financial improvement [4].\n\n**Impacts on Income and Wealth Disparities:**  \n- Despite the decline in unemployment, median household income for Hispanics has stagnated at around $42,491 since the Great Recession, while their net worth continued to decline more than other groups, indicating persistent wealth gaps [3].  \n- Wealth disparities are further evidenced by the significant decline in Hispanic household net worth after the recession, contrasted with more resilient white household wealth. The stagnant income and declining wealth are markers of structural economic barriers, despite improved employment figures and positive perceptions.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile Hispanic unemployment rates have improved substantially, they still remain higher than non-Hispanics, and economic perceptions are more positive but do not necessarily translate into income and wealth gains. These trends underscore ongoing disparities in economic stability and wealth accumulation for the Hispanic community.\n\n---\n\n**Interleaved visual insights:**  \n- The first image illustrates that while Hispanic unemployment has decreased, it still surpasses the general population, highlighting persistent disparity.  \n- The second image shows median income stagnation and wealth decline among Hispanics, reinforcing that unemployment improvements have not yet fully translated into income or wealth equality.  \n- The third image indicates that most Hispanics with better finances expect continued improvement, but this optimism varies based on personal circumstances.  \n- The fourth image again emphasizes the gap in economic perceptions between Hispanics and the wider population, with Hispanics generally feeling more optimistic about the national economy.  \n- The fifth image confirms that the Hispanic unemployment rate remains above the non-Hispanic rate, maintaining a key driver of economic inequality.\n\nOverall, the combination of these trends demonstrates that despite positive perceptions and improvements in employment, structural inequalities in income and wealth persist for Hispanics compared to non-Hispanic populations."}

Despite progress, Hispanic income levels lag behind the national average, reflecting persistent economic challenges.\n\n**Poverty Rate:**  \nThe poverty rate for Hispanics declined from a peak of 26.5% in 2010 to 23.6% in 2014, yet stayed above pre-recession levels [7]. They generally face higher poverty levels compared to the overall U.S. population, which had a poverty rate of 14.8% in 2014 [5].\n\n**Wealth:**  \nHispanic households experienced the largest decline in net worth through 2009 among major groups, with continued declines after the recession. Their median wealth was significantly lower ($13,700 in 2014) than that of all U.S. households ($81,400), highlighting substantial wealth disparities [7].\n\nVisual data supports these points, showing that while Hispanic economic perceptions have become more positive, their actual economic indicators—such as unemployment, income, poverty, and wealth—lag behind national averages and face ongoing challenges [image1, image2, image3, image5].\n\n**In summary:**  \nHispanic households have faced higher unemployment, lower income, higher poverty, and less wealth compared to all U.S. households over 2000–2015, though some indicators show signs of gradual improvement.\n\n---\n\n![Economic challenges comparison](image5)  \n*Image showing Hispanic unemployment rates remaining above non-Hispanic rates, indicating persistent unemployment challenges.*"}

For example, in 2001, 46% of Republicans and 42% of Democrats believed there were plenty of jobs available [1]. This gap widened further over the years, with peaks around 2005-2006 when 57% of Republicans versus 24% of Democrats held positive views about job availability. The trend during this period reflects a more optimistic outlook among Republicans compared to Democrats.\n\nHowever, around 2008-2009, perceptions among both groups declined sharply, likely due to the economic recession, with only 29% of Republicans and 24% of Democrats seeing plenty of local jobs [1]. Post-recession, perceptions gradually improved, especially among Republicans, reaching recent high points—by 2019, 71% of Republicans and 53% of Democrats believe there are plenty of jobs available locally [10].\n\nSupporting this, survey data shows a partisan gap of 18 percentage points in 2017 (58% of Republicans versus 47% of Democrats), which increased to 18 points again in 2019 (71% vs. 53%) [10].\n\nVisual data reinforces these trends, where the line graphs show a rising perception of job abundance among Republicans over the past decade, particularly from 2016 onward, whereas Democratic perceptions have remained relatively stable but lower, with slight increases in recent years [1].\n\nAdditionally, over time, perceptions of the difficulty of finding \"good jobs\" have diverged oppositely: Republicans increasingly view good jobs as plentiful, while Democrats see fewer good jobs available [2,3].  \n\nIn summary, Republicans have consistently shown more optimistic perceptions of job availability, a gap that widened over the last decade, especially post-2016. Democrats remain more cautious or pessimistic, though perceptions have improved modestly in recent years.\n\n---\n\n**In brief:** Perceptions of job availability are significantly more positive among Republicans than Democrats, with these perceptions strongly increasing for Republicans from 2016 onward, while Democrats' views have remained less optimistic but slightly improved over time."}

However, among Democrats, opinions are almost evenly divided: approximately 46% say Wall Street does more harm, and 41% say it does more good[7]. In contrast, Republicans are more inclined to view Wall Street positively, with a significant majority (55%) believing it helps more than it hurts[8].\n\nThis polarization in attitudes toward Wall Street is reflected in political figures’ perceptions and broader economic evaluations, with partisan views becoming more distinct since 2017[4].\n\nWhen comparing these views to satisfaction levels regarding national conditions, there's a clear overarching dissatisfaction among the public. Over recent years, a significant majority—about 70%—have expressed dissatisfaction with the way things are going in the country[3], and dissatisfaction has increased further at various points, reaching around 70% in recent surveys[5].

For example, **75% of Americans overall** cite insufficient social distancing and mask-wearing as a major reason for continued spread (quote [6]), and **about 90% of Democrats** believe non-adherence is a major cause (image 4). Among Republicans, a narrower majority (around 57%) see this as a major reason, indicating that Democrats are generally more likely to attribute ongoing issues to behavioral non-compliance.\n\nAdditionally, perceptions about lifting restrictions differ sharply: **82% of Democrats** believe that lifting restrictions too quickly is a major reason for ongoing spread, compared to just **31% of Republicans** (quotes [5], [8], and [10]; images 4 and 5). Republicans are less inclined to view these reasons as significant, with many rejecting the idea that behavioral adherence or policy relaxation significantly influence the outbreak’s continuation.\n\nIn summary, Democrats tend to attribute the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak primarily to inadequate government response and people's failure to adhere to social distancing guidelines, while Republicans are less likely to see these factors as major causes. This reflects a clear partisan split affecting perceptions of both governmental and individual roles in managing the pandemic.\n\n**In brief:** Political affiliations influence perceptions such that Democrats largely blame federal response and behavioral non-compliance for the continued outbreak, whereas Republicans are less likely to see these factors as major reasons."}

Conversely, around 63% of Hispanic Republicans and GOP leaners support his potential to remain a political figure, with 41% favoring his 2024 presidential run, indicating that Republican-leaning Hispanics are more supportive of Trump's future leadership [6].\n\nThis division correlates with their concerns about racial discrimination. About 35% of all Latinos see racial discrimination where it really does not exist, while 62% do not see it where it does exist, with Republicans more likely (62%) than Democrats (25%) to perceive discrimination as nonexistent [5]. Moreover, Latinos’ attitudes towards racial discrimination show that those who perceive little to no discrimination might be less inclined to oppose Trump's political influence, whereas those who see discrimination as significant tend to support his removal from the political scene.\n\nRegarding gun rights, about 73% of Hispanics prioritize controlling gun ownership, with Democratic-leaning Hispanics double as likely as Republicans (85% vs. 45%) to favor gun control [7]. This attitude toward gun regulation aligns with their broader political outlook: Latinos favoring gun control are also more likely to oppose Trump's continued political influence, especially since Trump’s policies and statements often align with more conservative, gun rights-supporting views.\n\nIn summary, Hispanic registered voters who are more concerned about racial discrimination and favor gun control tend to oppose Trump's political future, whereas those who perceive less racial discrimination and support gun rights are more likely to support his ongoing influence and presidential bid. This nuanced relationship highlights the interconnectedness of their political preferences, racial discrimination perceptions, and gun rights attitudes.\n\n---\n\n**Interleaved visual evidence:**\n\n- The image showing that a larger share of Latinos (62%) see racial discrimination where it does not exist, potentially correlating with support for Trump among Republican-leaning Hispanics [5].\n- The image indicating 73% of Hispanics prioritize gun control, aligning with opposition to Trump’s influence among more socially liberal or progressive Hispanics [7].\n- The image displaying that 73% of Hispanics believe Trump should not remain a political figure, especially among Democrats, correlates with their concerns about racial equality and social justice issues [6].\n\n**In conclusion:** Hispanic registered voters’ attitudes on Trump’s political future are intertwined with their concerns about racial discrimination and gun rights, where those wary of racial discrimination and favoring gun control tend to oppose his continued influence."}

As indicated in the text [7], about 65% of STEM workers have at least a bachelor’s degree, with approximately 29% holding postgraduate degrees and 36% having only a bachelor’s degree. In contrast, non-STEM workers tend to have lower overall educational attainment, with a larger share having only some college or less [2][5].\n\nLooking at employment sectors, most STEM workers work for private, for-profit companies, with about 66% of all employed STEM individuals in this sector [8]. The image data supports the high involvement of STEM workers in specialized fields: computer professionals (77%), engineers (82%), and physical scientists (59%) tend to work in private and technical sectors.\n\nEducation appears to influence occupational choice within STEM. The second image shows that among those with higher education (bachelor’s degrees or postgraduate degrees), STEM occupation participation is higher: 28% of those with some college and 36% with a bachelor’s degree are employed in STEM [2][5]. Meanwhile, non-STEM employment is more common among individuals with lower educational levels.\n\nFurther, the first image shows that STEM workers with an associate degree are more likely to use their skills in their current jobs (73%) compared to non-STEM workers with similar education levels (24%) [4], favoring sectors that value practical technical training.\n\nIn sum:  \n- **Higher education levels (bachelor’s or postgraduate degrees)** among STEM workers correlate with employment mainly in **private, high-technology sectors** like engineering, computer, and physical sciences.  \n- **Lower educational attainment** (some college, associate degree, or less) correlates with more diverse employment, including public sector and roles that rely on technical certifications or vocational training.\n\n**Simple conclusion:**\nHigher education levels among STEM workers strongly associate with employment in private, technical sectors, whereas non-STEM workers with similar or lower education are more distributed across sectors, including government and non-profit."}

Over time, these sectors have maintained or increased their employment shares, while educational attainment among STEM workers has continued to rise.\n\n---\n\n**Interleaved Visual and Text Evidence:**\n\n- STEM workers are more likely to hold bachelor's and advanced degrees, emphasizing higher educational levels ([6]):\n\n  ![STEM educational attainment](``)  \n  *Image 2 shows a higher percentage of STEM workers with bachelor’s and postgraduate degrees compared to non-STEM workers.*\n\n- Most STEM employment is in private, for-profit companies, particularly in engineering and computing sectors (see [4]):\n\n  ![Employment sectors](``)  \n  *Image 3 indicates strong private sector employment in engineering and computer jobs, with these sectors having high proportions of private employment over time.*\n\n- Trends over the past decades show growth and stability in employment among STEM fields, with an increase in college-educated workers, especially in life sciences (see [2], [4], and [5]):\n\n  ![Employment trend in life sciences and physical sciences](``)  \n  *Images 4 and 5 demonstrate the growth in life sciences employment and the relatively stable trend in physical sciences from 1990 to 2016.*\n\n**Overall**, the data depict an increasing educational gap in favor of STEM workers over non-STEM workers, with proportions of college and advanced degrees rising and a consistent presence in the private sector, reflecting ongoing trends of growth and higher educational attainment in STEM careers."}

According to the data, **62% of Black STEM workers** report experiencing discrimination at work, compared to **44% of Asians** and **42% of Hispanics** [3][5][7]. This suggests that Black individuals face a notably higher incidence of racial bias, including being treated as if they are not competent, being passed over for promotions, and experiencing unfair treatment generally. The perception of racial discrimination is also reflected in the fact that **57% of Black STEM workers** feel there is too little attention to racial and ethnic diversity where they work, and **24%** believe Blacks are usually treated unfairly [5].\n\nIn contrast, gender-based discrimination affects both women and men in STEM, but women are more likely to report experiencing gender-related bias. The data shows that **50% of women in STEM** report experiencing gender discrimination, such as earning less than men for the same work, being treated as less competent, or feeling the need to constantly prove themselves. This is higher than the **19%** of men who report experiencing gender discrimination [6]. The specific instances most reported include pay disparities (29%), perceptions of incompetence (29%), repeated small slights (20%), and receiving less support from leadership (18%).\n\nThe visual data further highlights these disparities:\n- Women in STEM are significantly more likely than men to report experiencing gender discrimination, as shown in the larger gap (58%) between women and men in experiencing gender bias related to occupational challenges [1][2][6].\n- Racial discrimination remains notably higher among Black STEM workers compared to other racial groups, with 62% experiencing discrimination, which is substantially higher than among Asians and Hispanics [3][5][7].\n- Gender discrimination in STEM affects women disproportionately, with over half experiencing various forms of bias and discrimination [6].\n\nIn summary, racial minorities, especially Blacks, face more intense and frequent discrimination in STEM fields compared to Asians and Hispanics. Simultaneously, women in STEM experience greater gender-based discrimination than men, with pay gaps and perceptions of incompetence being common issues. Both forms of discrimination highlight systemic inequities that persist in STEM workplaces, differing mostly in their nature and intensity—racial discrimination predominantly affecting Blacks and Hispanics, and gender discrimination predominantly affecting women.\n\n![Summary of discrimination experiences](image1)"}

For instance, **78%** of women in majority-male workplaces report experiencing at least one form of gender discrimination, in contrast to **44%** of women in other settings [6]. They are also more likely to perceive that their gender has made it harder for them to succeed and feel the need to prove themselves at least some of the time to earn respect [3], [8].\n\nIn terms of specific experiences, women in male-dominated environments report greater difficulties such as earning less than men doing the same job, being treated as if they lack competence, experiencing small repeated slights, and receiving less support from leaders [5], [9]. The likelihood of experiencing at least one of these eight forms of discrimination is **78%** for women in majority-male workplaces, versus only 43% for women in other workplace settings [8]. They also notably report that gender has made their success harder and experience sexual harassment more frequently (36%) compared to women in more balanced workplaces [1], [4].\n\nConversely, women in gender-balanced or majority-female environments encounter fewer gender-related obstacles; their perceived discrimination and the need to prove themselves are less, and they report lower levels of harassment and bias.

As shown in the images and supported by quote [1], the likelihood of self-identifying as Hispanic declines with each successive generation. For example, only 26% of third or higher generation Hispanics identify as Hispanic, compared to 36% of second-generation and 65% of foreign-born individuals (image1). This trend indicates a gradual erosion of Hispanic identity as families become more assimilated into U.S. culture over generations.\n\nSecondly, **cultural ties and ancestry** significantly influence identity. The data from images 2 and 5 highlight that many individuals with Hispanic ancestry do not recognize or prioritize Hispanic identity, often citing factors such as a distant or mixed background, limited contact with Hispanic relatives, or cultural disconnects. For instance, 27% of those who do not identify as Hispanic mention a mixed heritage or distant ancestry, and 84% of self-identified Hispanics do not consider having a Spanish last name as essential to their identity (images 4 and 5). This underscores that cultural affinity and perceived cultural relevance are key determinants.\n\nThirdly, **language** plays a pivotal role. According to quote [6], a majority of Latino adults—especially those of higher generations—believe speaking Spanish is not required to be Latino, with 84% of third-generation and higher Latinos holding this view. Similarly, in image 5, only 28% of self-identified Hispanics do not speak Spanish, indicating language is less crucial over generations for maintaining identity, though it remains a cultural marker for some.\n\nFourth, **perceived physical appearance and cultural familiarity** also influence identity. The reasons why some Hispanic ancestry individuals do not identify as Hispanic include not looking Hispanic or identifying as another race (12% in image 5), and personal upbringing or contact with Hispanic relatives. These social perceptions can diminish a person's likelihood of self-identification, regardless of ancestry.\n\nFinally, **perceptions of American identity** evolve over generations. Image 1 shows that 36% of third or higher generation Hispanics consider themselves \"a typical American,\" rising from 36% in second-generation to 63% in third or higher generation. This reflects increasing integration into broader American identity frameworks, which can overshadow ethnic labels.\n\n---\n\n### Comparison:\nAcross generations, factors such as **ancestry, language proficiency, cultural practices, and appearance** tend to diminish in importance as drivers of self-identification. Instead, **social assimilation and national identity** become more prominent. The data depict a transition from a primarily heritage-based identity in immigrants and second-generation individuals to a more Americanized identity in later generations.\n\n**In summary:**  \n- For recent immigrants and second-generation Hispanics, **ancestry, language, and cultural ties** strongly influence self-identification.  \n- As generations progress, **assimilation, American identity, and social perceptions** play a larger role, often leading individuals to identify less with Hispanic labels despite having Hispanic ancestry.\n\n**Answer:**  \nFactors influencing Hispanic self-identification in the U.S. include ancestry, language, cultural ties, appearance, and perceived Americanization. These factors diminish in importance across generations, with later generations more likely to identify as American rather than Hispanic, reflecting increased assimilation and changing perceptions of identity."}

However, these rates decline considerably with each subsequent generation; only 35% of third-or-higher generation Hispanics report often attending such celebrations [6].\n\n- The **images** further illustrate this decline.

Conversely, the preference for \"Hispanic\" or \"Latino\" diminishes across generations, illustrating a shift toward aligning more closely with U.S. national identity as familiarity with American society deepens. The survey also indicates that a substantial proportion in higher generations considers themselves \"typical Americans\" (63% among second-generation and 73% among third or higher) [5], demonstrating an increasing sense of belonging to the broader American identity.\n\n**Language Use and Cultural Links:**  \nLanguage proficiency and language-based identity also change across generations. Among first-generation Hispanics, 61% are Spanish dominant, highlighting strong ties to Spanish language and culture [10]. However, this proficiency sharply decreases among subsequent generations, with only 6% of second-generation and virtually none of the third-generation being Spanish dominant. Moreover, while speaking Spanish isn't deemed necessary for Hispanic identity—84% of second-generation and 92% of third-generation Latinos state that Spanish language does not define Latinos [8]—language remains a significant marker of cultural connection for immigrants.\n\n**Visual Evidence:**  \nThe infographic illustrates these shifts clearly: the percentage of Hispanics who identify as foreign-born drops from 65% to just 7% by the third or higher generation, and the share of those who describe themselves as \"Hispanic/Latino\" decreases over generations [image1, evidence of decreasing foreign-born and ethnicity-based identification]. Meanwhile, the percentage of those who identify as \"American\" increases correspondingly, emphasizing the assimilation trend [image3].\n\n**Summary:**  \nIn essence, as generations advance, Hispanics tend to lean more toward American identity in both self-description and language use, with decreasing reliance on heritage language and ethnicity labels. These patterns reflect broader assimilation processes and evolving cultural identities within the U.S.\n\n---\n\n**In conclusion:**\nGenerational shifts among Hispanics lead to decreased emphasis on heritage-based identity and language, with higher generations more likely to adopt American identity and English as their primary language."}

The bar chart from the first image further demonstrates a decline in traditional cash on delivery (COD) payments—from 60% in 2013 to approximately 50% in 2016—and an increase in electronic payments like credit and debit cards, consequently reducing reliance on COD shipments. This trend suggests that e-commerce platforms will need to prioritize integrating diverse and seamless digital payment options, including EMI and third-party wallets, to cater to consumer preferences and facilitate easier transactions.\n\nSecondly, the data about the e-commerce business model underscores the importance of a robust payment infrastructure. As the second image illustrates, effective payment integration—enabling quick, secure, and varied payment options—is critical for delivering an engaging online shopping experience. Platforms that streamline payment processes can enhance consumer confidence and loyalty, especially as consumers expect a frictionless \"all to all\" experience [3], demanding wider selection, competitive pricing, and convenient checkout options.\n\nLastly, the consumer behavior depicted in the third and fourth images reveals a shift towards researching products online, reading reviews, and making comparisons before purchasing—indicating an increasingly informed and digitally savvy customer base. As consumer behaviors evolve with a stronger inclination towards online shopping, especially in categories like fashion, electronics, and books, e-commerce platforms must adapt by integrating payment solutions that align with consumer expectations of flexibility, security, and ease of use.\n\nIn conclusion, the transition towards digital payments in India from 2013 to 2016 is expected to influence e-commerce platforms by necessitating advanced payment integrations that support diverse, secure, and convenient transaction methods, thereby shaping consumer purchasing behavior towards more active and confident online shopping experiences.\n\n---\n\n![The shift from cash on delivery towards digital payments like debit cards, EMI, and wallets is shaping e-commerce in India](image1)"}

Other categories like fashion, footwear, accessories, and home décor have smaller shares, ranging from 8–15%. This suggests that high-volume categories, especially mobile devices and books, significantly influence overall revenue.\n\nRegarding gross margin contributions, categories with larger transaction volumes tend to have varying profitability profiles. High-volume, lower-margin items like mobile accessories and books drive sales but may contribute less to profits per unit, whereas niche categories or premium products might offer higher margins but with lower volume.\n\nFrom an e-commerce supply and demand perspective (as illustrated conceptually in images 4 and 5), the dominance of high-volume categories impacts the dynamics significantly:\n\n- **Supply Side:** The concentration on high-volume categories requires robust logistics and inventory management for fast delivery and availability, influencing supply chain efficiencies. The focus shifts towards managing logistics for categories with high turnover, potentially leading to economies of scale and improved margins through higher volume handling.\n\n- **Demand Side:** Consumer preferences for high-volume categories signal a focus for customer experience enhancement, such as quick delivery and better service. The category distribution also indicates where customer engagement is highest and where investment in marketing and analytics would be most effective to capture the demand.\n\nImplications for the e-commerce model include the need to optimize the supply chain for these high-volume categories while balancing profitability. Diversification into niche areas with higher margins could be a strategic move, but sustained success depends on maintaining efficient logistics and targeted marketing that leverages the high transaction volumes in core categories.\n\n**In summary:**\nHigh transaction volumes in categories like mobile and books significantly shape online retail's revenue and supply chain strategies. Balancing this volume-driven model with profit maximization involves optimizing logistics and exploring higher-margin niches to sustain growth."}

These genres also exhibit relatively lower album sales percentages (Latin: 8%; Dance/Elec:18%) compared to streaming. This indicates that consumers primarily access Latin and Electronic music via streaming platforms rather than purchasing physical or digital albums.\n\nIn contrast, genres like Rock and R&B/Hip-Hop show a more balanced dynamic. For example, rock music has a significant physical album component (about 32%) [2], but streams still make up a sizable portion (approximately 26%) [2], indicating that both formats are important. R&B/Hip-Hop, although streaming dominates, still maintains notable sales of physical and digital albums (combined around 46%) [2]. Notably, R&B/Hip-Hop also has a high stream share (around 26%) [2].\n\nFurthermore, the overall trend suggests that streaming, driven largely by catalogs, now contributes to a large share of revenue, especially where fans tend to listen to existing hits rather than new releases, which benefit from current album sales. For instance, images [4] and [5] show that during 2015, although streaming comprises about 70% of total activity, album sales account for only about 37% of sales, with streams dominating at 70% [1].\n\nImplications for the industry include:\n- **Shift in revenue sources:** As streaming outpaces album sales, especially in genres favoring streaming, record labels and artists might need to prioritize streaming strategies over traditional album sales.\n- **Genre-specific marketing:** Genres heavily reliant on streaming (Latin, Dance/Electronic) may see different promotional approaches compared to genres with higher physical sales (Rock), influencing marketing and distribution models.\n- **Catalog relevance:** With streaming driven by catalog hits, breaking new artists may require different promotional tactics compared to relying on established hits.\n\nIn summary, genres like Latin and Dance/Electronic favor streaming heavily, decreasing reliance on album sales, whereas Rock and R&B/Hip-Hop remain more balanced but are increasingly influenced by streaming.

From the table in **image1**, we see that **simple lookup (20.6%)** and **comparison (19.5%)** are prominent functions.

Specifically, approximately 41.7% of refuted claims are due to wrong calculation results, and 33.3% contain incorrect approximation words, with some being partially right (10%). These errors often involve factual inaccuracies that models need to detect, but as shown in the confusion matrices (Image 2), models like GPT-4 tend to overconfidently misclassify NEI claims as supported or refuted, which complicates the task. Moreover, the reasons for refutation also include ambiguous or vague claims, which can mislead models.\n\n**NEI Claims:**\nNEI claims mainly arise from insufficient evidence, lack of background knowledge, and ambiguous pronouns, per the detailed reasoning patterns in Table 3 and qualitative insights. Approximately 33.3% lack adequate evidence, which makes them difficult for models to verify confidently. As shown in the confusion matrices (Image 2), both InstructGPT and GPT-4 struggle to correctly identify NEI claims; InstructGPT often underconfidently default to NEI, whereas GPT-4 tends to overconfidently misclassify NEI claims as supported or refuted. These tendencies reflect the inherent difficulty models face in assessing verifiability, especially when the information required exceeds their knowledge base.\n\n**Impact on Model Performance:**\nIn zero-shot 3-class classification settings, these reasons significantly affect performance:\n\n- The inherent difficulty in differentiating between 'refuted' and 'NEI' claims causes the models’ accuracy to decline, as evidenced by the performance results (Image 5). For example, GPT-4 achieves 63.62% F1 in the 2-class setting but drops substantially in the 3-class scenario.\n- The models' confidence biases (overconfidence or underconfidence) in classifying NEI claims, driven by their inability to handle claims with insufficient evidence or ambiguous language, contribute to higher misclassification rates.\n- The datasets' diverse and complex reasoning challenges, like partial truths or vague references, further hinder model reliability, especially without domain-specific training data, as noted in the discussion about the diversity and complexity of claims.\n\n**In summary:**\nRefuted claims often result from factual errors like calculation errors and approximation issues, making them challenging for models to identify correctly, especially when errors are subtle. NEI claims mainly stem from insufficient evidence or background knowledge deficits, complicating the models’ verifiability judgments.

This suggests that while models can somewhat identify available knowledge, their ability to recall absent or missing knowledge deteriorates when retrieval quality worsens.\n\n**Precision**, however, remains relatively more stable and less impacted by retrieval degradation (see [10]), implying models can filter out incorrect information to some extent under low retrieval accuracy, though the overall quality of citations drops. **F1-Score**, representing a balance between precision and recall, decreases as well, but the significant decline in recall indicates that models struggle primarily with recalling absent knowledge.\n\nThe results imply that under 'Conscious Incompetence', models can recognize and attribute known knowledge with higher accuracy when retrieval is good, but their capacity to identify and handle absent or missing knowledge diminishes as retrieval becomes less accurate. This underscores the importance of high-quality retrieval in enabling models to distinguish between knowledge present in the KG and knowledge that is absent or unsupported, which is crucial for ensuring responsible and accurate AI outputs.\n\n**In summary:**\n- **Recall** is most sensitive to retrieval quality; it declines nearly linearly with decreasing accuracy.\n- **Precision** remains more robust, indicating ongoing filtering of irrelevant or absent knowledge.\n- The overall trend signals that models' ability to manage absent knowledge relies heavily on retrieval quality, emphasizing the role of effective knowledge retrieval systems and the 'Conscious Incompetence' setting."}

The percentage reductions in LI indicate that logical constraints are highly effective in enforcing reasoning coherence across models—particularly notable in models like GPT-4 and Llama2-13B–PT, where LI decreases from 8.3% and 34.6% respectively to 0% after post-processing, illustrating that post-processing can fully eliminate logical conflict in these cases.\n\nIn terms of post-processing, the data shows it universally reduces LI to zero for most models on MAVEN-ERE (see images 1 and 4). However, this process sometimes negatively impacts overall performance; for example, in GPT-4, post-processing reduces LI to 0%, but the overall answer quality might suffer as indicated in the performance drops, demonstrating that while post-processing is highly effective at removing logical errors, it can harm semantic fidelity.\n\nOn the Causal-TimeBank dataset (see images 1 and 3), the trend persists. The use of logical constraints, especially retrieval-based ones, reduces LI substantially (e.g., from around 36.8% to 11.3% in MAVEN-ERE, and similar trends in Causal-TimeBank). Again, post-processing achieves LI reduction to 0% across models, such as in GPT-4 and Llama2-13B–PT, indicating its effectiveness at eliminating logical conflicts. Nonetheless, the same caveat applies: post-processing may compromise answer relevance and correctness, as suggested by performance metrics.\n\nIn summary:\n- **Logical constraints**, particularly retrieved constraints, significantly improve logical consistency (~50-70% reductions in LI across datasets).\n- **Post-processing** reliably reduces LI to zero but may negatively impact answer quality, suggesting it is a strong method for conflict elimination but less ideal if semantic fidelity is critical.\n- The effectiveness of both approaches is consistent across models (GPT-4, Llama2-13B, Vicuna), with the most notable LI reductions observed in larger models trained explicitly with logical constraints (e.g., Llama2-13B-PT).\n\n**Thus, logical constraints are highly effective for decreasing logical inconsistency, and post-processing almost universally eliminates conflicts but with potential trade-offs in answer quality.**\n\n---\n\n**Summary Visuals:**\n\n![Effectiveness Summary](image1)  \n*Logical constraints markedly reduce LI, especially when retrieved, while post-processing ensures almost complete LI elimination across models.*"}

To aid recognition, the cropped regions are resized to a standard size. Since objects in detection datasets can be small and variably positioned, surrounding non-target areas are blurred, focusing the model’s attention on relevant objects.\n\n2. **Feature Extraction:**  \n   The processed images are fed into the visual encoder, which extracts image embeddings that capture the salient features of each object.

The means of measuring these effects are through evaluation metrics like accuracy, F1 scores, and EM (exact match), which quantify improvements in precision and recall on held-out test sets.\n\nFor broader evaluation across tasks like sentiment classification and NER, the effects are assessed both in terms of accuracy for sentiment tasks and F1 scores or EM for NER. The results indicate that augmentation approaches that introduce balanced positive and negative data generally enhance robustness and performance, especially when combined with loss functions like DSC, which further help manage data imbalance issues.\n\nThe images reinforce these findings: \n\n- **Image1** shows that BERT with the DSC loss outperforms other objectives on sentiment classification datasets (55.19% accuracy) compared to CE and DL, indicating augmentation combined with focused loss functions improves results.\n\n- **Image4** highlights that the combination of BERT with DSC yields the highest F1 scores (up to 92.60 on QuoRef), demonstrating the effectiveness of augmentation strategies for NER tasks on Imbalanced datasets.\n\nIn summary, data augmentation techniques like balancing positive and negative samples (e.g., +positive, +negative), especially when coupled with robust loss functions like DSC, significantly improve BERT's performance on datasets such as QuoRef. Effectiveness is measured through standard evaluation metrics—accuracy for sentiment tasks and F1 or EM scores for NER—showing that tailored augmentation strategies mitigate data imbalance and enhance model robustness across various NLP tasks."}

As shown in the table [3], for sentiment classification tasks (SST-2 and SST-5), BERT fine-tuned with DSC (dice similarity coefficient) performs slightly worse than CE, denoting that dice-based losses are not optimized for accuracy-oriented tasks most of the time.\n- For the question-answering (QA) datasets (SQuAD v1.1, v2.0, and QuoRef), the configurations with DSC (e.g., BERT+DSC) outperform other variants [3], showing improvements in EM and F1 scores. For instance, BERT+DSC exceeds BERT+XLNet by +1.53 in F1 on QuoRef [3].\n\nRegarding dataset-specific performance:\n\n- In **SQuAD v1.1**, BERT+DSC yields an F1 score of 90.9, higher than XLNet (90.2) [3].\n- In **SQuAD v2.0**, again, BERT+DSC achieves 82.95 F1, outperforming models like XLNet and BERT variants, indicating robustness in different dataset conditions [3].\n- On the **QuoRef** dataset, BERT+DSC achieves a notable F1 score of 68.44 when using a specific hyperparameter α=0.4, highlighting the sensitivity of performance to hyperparameter tuning and dataset characteristics [2][7].\n\nVisual summaries from the tables reinforce these points:\n\n- The performance of different configurations in Figure 1 illustrates that **BERT+DSC** consistently achieves the highest F1 scores across datasets and augmentation strategies. Notably, the +negative augmentation with DSC significantly boosts performance in imbalanced datasets like QuoRef [1].\n- In the sentiment analysis tasks (SST-2, SST-5), as shown in Figures 2, DSC does not outperform CE, confirming its suitability for non-accuracy-centric tasks [3].\n\nIn conclusion, configurations with dice-based loss functions like DSC tend to outperform standard or other loss variants in datasets with imbalanced data or where the goal is to maximize F1 scores, particularly in QA tasks. However, for accuracy-oriented tasks like sentiment classification, the traditional CE loss remains more effective. Augmentation techniques like +positive and +negative influence performance in dataset-dependent ways, with negative augmentation often helping in addressing class imbalance.\n\n### Final Summary:\n**BERT with dice-based loss (DSC) outperforms other configurations on QA datasets, especially with imbalanced datasets like QuoRef, but shows similar or slightly worse performance in sentiment classification tasks. Augmentation techniques influence results significantly, with +negative boosting performance in imbalance scenarios.**"}

For example, in language pairs like en-cs, en-fi, and en-tr, COMET-RANK shows higher correlation scores with human judgment (Kendall’s Tau, denoted by \\(\\tau\\)) compared to BLEU. This trend underscores COMET-RANK's superior capacity to capture semantic and contextual nuances beyond simple n-gram matching.\n\n- **Statistical Trends:** The data indicates that in most cases, COMET-RANK correlates more strongly with human judgments of translation quality than BLEU, which is primarily based on surface-level lexical overlap. This is further supported by the observations in Tables 1, 3, and the visualizations in figures like image2 (performance trends across models) and image3 (scores across language pairs). The trends suggest that COMET-RANK's learned metrics, especially with models trained on diverse data, maintain stable and higher correlations with human evaluation, regardless of language pair complexity.\n\n- **Language Pair Variability:** While BLEU's performance tends to be relatively uniform but low, mainly because of its lexical focus, COMET-RANK's performance is more adaptive. For language pairs where semantic comprehension and contextual understanding are critical (e.g., low-resource or morphologically rich languages), COMET-RANK demonstrates relative robustness and higher correlation scores.\n\n- **Generalization:** In cross-lingual settings (shown in tables 4 and 5), COMET models trained primarily on English data (including variants with source and reference) generalize well to language pairs without English, maintaining strong correlations with human judgments (see images 4 and 5). BLEU, lacking semantic modeling, generally underperforms in these scenarios.\n\n**Observed Trends:**\n\n- **Superiority of Learned Metrics:** Overall, COMET-RANK tends to outperform BLEU, particularly in capturing semantic adequacy and grammaticality, which are crucial for human-like translation quality assessment. \n\n- **Model Enhancements:** Including source language information and training on diverse datasets enhances COMET-RANK's correlation with human ratings, surpassing BLEU, which does not incorporate such contextual information.\n\n- **Evaluation Consistency:** COMET-RANK's performance remains stable across different types of language pairs and evaluation settings, whereas BLEU's score fluctuates mainly based on lexical overlap.\n\n---\n\n### Visual Summary:\n\n![Performance trend comparison](image2)\n**Conclusion:** COMET-RANK leverages learned representations to provide more accurate and reliable evaluation across different language pairs, demonstrating a clear advantage over BLEU, whose performance is limited to lexical matching."}

For example, in the unmasked setting, the model without R-GCN scores **62.4** (Table 3), while incorporating R-GCN raises accuracy to **66.4** [2].  \n- In the masked setting, the performance drops from **65.3** with R-GCN to **64.8** without, indicating R-GCN's consistent contribution to capturing relations and improving accuracy.\n\n### 2.

Overall Trends\n- The ablations reveal that **multihop inference facilitated by R-GCN** remarkably enhances performance, especially when leveraging relation-specific information.\n- The inclusion of relation types provides further benefits, but their absence causes moderate declines.\n- Components like coreference edges (COREF) are less impactful, and their removal yields marginal gains or losses, indicating potential redundancy or domain-specific limitations [1], [9].\n\n---\n\n### **Summary**\nRemoving R-GCN causes notable performance declines, particularly emphasizing its role in multi-hop reasoning.

This is evidenced by the results in Table 3, where the \"Entity-GCN with coreference\" model achieves an accuracy of **66.4%**, slightly lower than the **67.6%** of the \"Entity-GCN without coreference.\" Additionally, the ablation experiments in the text (paragraph [6]) indicate that, although coreference links can provide useful information, their effectiveness might be limited due to the quality of coreference predictions on more challenging documents, leading to less reliable edges.\n\nIn contrast, in the **masked setting**, the performance difference is more pronounced. The fully trained Entity-GCN model achieves **68.5%** accuracy overall; however, when coreference information is included, the results are not explicitly provided, but the trend from Table 3 suggests that adding coreference might not significantly improve or could even hinder the model’s effectiveness. The text explains that this is because, in the masked setting, the graph construction relies mainly on exact matching, which is more effective for coreference on masked data (paragraph [10]), and the model already benefits from better entity linking without relying heavily on coreference edges.\n\nOverall, the experiments demonstrate that:\n- **In unmasked settings**, coreference edges do not substantially improve, and might slightly reduce, performance due to the inaccuracy of coreference predictions.\n- **In masked settings**, coreference information provides some benefits, especially since the masking makes entity mentions more consistent, but the effect is still limited, and models generally perform better when relying on document-based and matching-based relations.\n\n**In conclusion**, including coreference information does not universally enhance Entity-GCN performance; its impact depends on the setting. In unmasked conditions, it may slightly harm performance, whereas in masked conditions, it offers some advantages, although not dramatically."}

According to the data presented, DyGIE achieves high Entity F1 scores on ACE datasets, with 84.7 for ACE04-O [5] and 82.9 for ACE05-O, surpassing previous models such as those by Katiyar and Cardie [9]. The relation extraction performance is also impressive, with a relation F1 of 58.4 on ACE04 (compared to 55.6 and 57.5 by other models [5]) and 63.2 on ACE05, demonstrating that DyGIE outperforms many prior approaches.\n\nRegarding the impact of coreference (CorefProp) and relation propagation (RelProp), the results show a nuanced picture. Coreference propagation significantly boosts entity extraction performance, especially in environments where coreference links provide crucial contextual information—evidenced by F1 scores rising from 68.2 (base) to 68.8 with coref propagation in entity tasks [4]. However, it may introduce a slight decrease in relation extraction accuracy, as seen by the relation F1 dropping from 60.9 (without propagation) to 56.7 with coref propagation, indicating that coreference primarily benefits entity recognition but can sometimes hinder relation extraction in certain datasets like ACE05.\n\nRelation propagation, on the other hand, provides considerable benefits across tasks, particularly enhancing relation extraction. For example, relation propagation increases relation F1 from 55.7 to 58.0 in one configuration [4], and overall, the system's ability to propagate relation information across sentences aids in capturing complex and overlapping relation instances, which are common in datasets like ACE05 and SciERC.\n\nIn summary, DyGIE's performance is robust and superior across datasets, with coreference propagation improving entity recognition but sometimes negatively influencing relation extraction, while relation propagation consistently advances relation extraction performance. The integration of these propagation mechanisms enhances DyGIE's ability to extract rich, contextualized information across diverse datasets."}

These results, shown in the comparison table, highlight DyGIE's effectiveness across both news and biomedical domains. The model's performance benefits from the dynamic span graph approach that facilitates broader contextual learning without relying on syntactic preprocessing.\n\nRegarding relation extraction, DyGIE's F1 scores are slightly lower than entity extraction but still outperform baseline models, with values such as **68.2** on ACE04-O and **42.0** on ACE05-O (images 4). The relation extraction performance notably improves with the application of relation propagation, as indicated in the figure, where increasing the number of relation propagation iterations (`M`) enhances relation F1 scores. This underscores the importance of relation propagation in managing complex relation instances across diverse entities.\n\nThe roles of CorefProp and RelProp components are context-dependent:\n- **CorefProp**, which propagates coreference information, significantly improves entity recognition in datasets like ACE, where coreference information is beneficial. However, it tends to have less impact or even slightly hurt relation extraction, especially in ACE05, possibly because coreference signals do not align well with relation cues or because pronouns in datasets like SciERC are often assigned general labels [6], [7], [9].\n- **RelProp**, focusing on relation propagation, consistently enhances relation extraction across datasets, especially in scenarios with multiple relation instances, such as ACE05 and SciERC. This is corroborated by the improved relation F1 with increased propagation iterations shown in the figure [3], and the observation that relation propagation significantly benefits both ACE and SciERC in sentences with multiple relations [9].\n\nIn summary, DyGIE's performance exhibits robustness and improvement across datasets, with relation propagation being particularly valuable for complex relation extraction.

For example, in German, most systems, including Google Translate, achieve high accuracy rates (e.g., 59.4%), potentially due to linguistic similarities with English (as noted in [8]). Conversely, languages like Russian and Ukrainian exhibit lower accuracy in some systems, with Google Translate achieving 37.7% on Ukrainian, indicating challenges in preserving gender information in these languages.\n\nSecondly, **gender bias**—measured by the difference in performance between stereotypical and anti-stereotypical roles (\\(\\Delta_{S}\\))—tends to be significant across systems, with some models showing stronger biases. For instance, in Figure 3, stereotypical translations are more accurate (e.g., 80% for French), while non-stereotypical roles show a decline (~54%), demonstrating bias favoring gender stereotypes.\n\nComparing systems, **Google Translate** generally exhibits higher accuracy in some languages but also shows pronounced biases, with \\(\\Delta_{S}\\) values like 23.4 for Spanish ([4], images 2 and 3). Meanwhile, academic models like **Ott et al. (2018)** and **Edenov et al. (2018)** tend to have lower biases, demonstrated by smaller \\(\\Delta_{S}\\) and \\(\\Delta_{G}\\) values ([4], [8], images 4 and 5). For instance, Edenov et al. (2018) shows a \\(\\Delta_{G}\\) of 7.3 in German, indicating less gender bias.\n\nFurthermore, **bias tends to be more pronounced when translating roles that are culturally stereotyped**, which is reflected in the higher \\(\\Delta_{S}\\) and \\(\\Delta_{G}\\) values in the tables and figures. This bias persists across languages, with some systems performing better in languages with grammatical gender (found in [5], [6]) due to morphological cues.\n\nIn summary, **while some MT systems achieve reasonably high accuracy in certain languages, significant gender bias remains prevalent**, especially in languages with grammatical gender, and biases are more conspicuous when translating non-stereotypical roles or gender-neutral sentences ([1], [3], [5], [7]). This underscores that improving accuracy alone does not resolve bias issues; addressing gender bias requires targeted mitigation strategies.\n\n---\n\n**Illustrative visual summaries from images:**\n\n- ![Comparison of gender prediction accuracy and bias across languages and systems](image3)  \n- ![System performance and bias metrics across languages](image2)  \n- ![Gender bias measures highlighting stereotypes](image5)  \n\n**In conclusion:**\nTranslation accuracy varies across languages and systems, with higher accuracy generally in linguistically similar languages like German, but gender bias remains widespread, especially when translating roles that are culturally stereotyped."}

For example, the blue bars (stereotypical) are consistently higher than the red bars (non-stereotypical), indicating higher accuracy when stereotypes are reinforced. However, this also shows that stereotypical cues contribute to bias in gender prediction, with accuracy ranging between 44% to 76% depending on the language and bias type [2].\n\n- The **dataset modification example (image3)** where adjectives like \"handsome\" and \"pretty\" are added shows that such adjustments can \"correct\" bias, particularly for languages like Spanish, Russian, and Ukrainian, as indicated in [8]. The results show **significant reductions in bias** in these languages when stereotypical cues are explicitly added, suggesting a potential method to influence gender bias in translation.\n\n- **Quantitative evidence (images 4 and 5)** shows that applying stereotype-based modifications (like adding adjectives) results in improved gender accuracy metrics and reduced bias differences. Specifically, [8] shows that adding \"pretty\" and \"handsome\" reduced bias metrics noticeably, such as in Spanish where bias decreased substantially.\n\n**Across different languages:**\n\n- **Western European and Slavic languages** like German, Spanish, and Russian tend to exhibit more gender-specific morphological cues that can be leveraged or biased [1], [7].  \n- **Language families** that associate biological with grammatical gender (e.g., Romance, Slavic, Semitic) are more susceptible to stereotype-driven biases, but adjustments like adjective insertion help mitigate bias [7], [8].  \n- The **evaluation metrics (images 4 and 5)** indicate that stereotype-based adjustments reduce bias more effectively in some languages than others. For instance, the bias difference (Δ_G, Δ_S) can be decreased with such interventions, as shown in [8].\n\n### **Summary:**\nStereotype-based adjustments can **significantly reduce gender bias** in machine translation by influencing the gender prediction accuracy, especially in languages with gendered morphology. However, their impact varies by language, with some benefiting more than others. Overall, these modifications can serve as effective, albeit limited, methods to mitigate bias in multilingual settings.  \n\n---\n\n**In brief:** Stereotype-based adjustments help reduce gender bias in machine translation metrics across various languages, but their effectiveness depends on the linguistic characteristics and the specific adjustments applied."}

Therefore, datasets must carefully include evidence that legitimately requires multi-hop reasoning, which directly impacts model performance and evaluation strategies. \n\nIn terms of training strategies, **[4]** and **[9]** highlight the use of adversarial distractors during training. Specifically, **[4]** discusses the challenges of collecting effective distractors for multi-hop questions and how stronger distractors (e.g., using more distractors or better retrieval methods) can make the task more difficult, which is reflected in a decrease in F1 scores (from 67.08 to 46.84 in adversarial settings). Furthermore, **[9]** shows that retraining the model on adversarial distractors raises the F1 score from 46.84 to 60.10, indicating that **adversarial training improves model robustness**.\n\nEvaluation strategies also make a significant difference. **[10]** and **[2]** demonstrate that filtering distractors by entity type or creating specific rules to categorize questions (single-hop vs multi-hop) influence the assessed F1 scores. For instance, filtering distractors seems to recover some accuracy, but models still struggle with complex questions; **[2]** classifies questions to better evaluate reasoning capabilities.\n\nThe images reinforce these points. **Image 1** shows that models trained with standard methods achieve higher fallible scores on \"original\" distractors (67.08 F1), but performance drops significantly with adversarial distractors (down to 46.84). When retrained with adversarial examples, performance improves notably (up to 60.10). \n\n**Image 2** indicates that the **F1 scores are highest when additional gold paragraphs are provided**, emphasizing that retrieval quality (an evaluation aspect) substantially impacts performance. \n\nFinally, **Images 3, 4, and 5** break down question types (multi-hop, weaker distractors, non-compositional questions) and their respective F1 scores: multi-hop questions tend to have lower F1 compared to simpler questions, especially when adversarial distractors are used, highlighting that **training and filtering strategies critically affect the ability of models to perform well** on more challenging, reasoning-demanding questions.\n\n---\n\n### In summary:\n\n- **Adversarial training** with stronger distractors **improves robustness**, increasing F1 scores after retraining.\n- **Use of filtering and evidence-based datasets** helps focus the evaluation on genuinely multi-hop or complex questions.\n- **Evaluation using gold paragraphs** or better retrieval methods can significantly raise F1 scores, especially in open-domain or multi-hop contexts.\n- The overall trend indicates that **more sophisticated training and evaluation strategies** respond to the complexity of multi-hop and single-hop tasks by improving model performance, but they also reveal the intrinsic difficulty of reasoning-based questions.\n\n**Therefore**, training with adversarial and evidence-rich data enhances robustness, and refined evaluation strategies (like filtering by entity type or using gold paragraphs) can significantly influence measured F1 scores in question answering tasks."}

This indicates that models heavily relied on spurious statistical cues present in the original dataset, leading to overfitting and poor generalization when these cues are removed or countered.\n\nTo address this, a new adversarial dataset was created by mirroring the distribution of cues over labels through negation and label inversion [2][3]. When models are trained from scratch on this adversarial data, BERT's maximum test accuracy further reduces to approximately 53%, with mean and median around 50% [6]. These results suggest that the models are no longer exploiting superficial cues, and their performance approaches chance, confirming the removal of exploitable statistical signals.\n\nThe key conclusions are:\n- The original ARCT dataset allowed models to perform well mainly by exploiting spurious cues, not genuine argument understanding.\n- The adversarial setup effectively eliminates these cues, revealing the true difficulty of the task.\n- BERT's performance dropping to near-random levels on the adversarial dataset indicates it has not learned meaningful argument comprehension, but rather pattern recognition based on dataset artifacts.\n- The adoption of adversarial datasets as a standard would promote more robust evaluation and drive development of models capable of genuine reasoning beyond superficial cues.\n\n**In summary:**  \nThe adversarial data setup exposes the models’ reliance on dataset artifacts, substantially reducing their performance to chance levels, which highlights the necessity of such rigorous evaluation methods to measure true argument understanding in NLP models."}

To manage this, the company uses financial instruments such as forward exchange contracts and currency options to hedge their exposures [7], [9].\n- Based on the data in the images, particularly in `image3`, the comprehensive income net for 2020 was DKK -1,689 million, compared to DKK -1,811 million in 2019. This indicates a slightly improved, but still negative, impact on overall comprehensive income due to exchange rate fluctuations, possibly reflecting the effects of currency translation and the effectiveness of hedging strategies.\n- The year-end exchange rate changes, especially JPY (Japanese Yen) and CAD (Canadian Dollar), showed a depreciation against EUR and DKK in 2020, with JPY changing by -3.8% and CAD by -7.2% (from `image5`). These currency movements can impact the valuation of foreign assets, liabilities, and hedge effectiveness.\n\n### Cash Flow Hedges and Hedging Activities\n- From `image2` and `image4`, the reserve for cash flow hedges at the end of 2020 was DKK 1,802 million, an increase from DKK 1,713 million at the end of 2019. This suggests increased hedging activities or changes in hedge valuations due to currency fluctuations.\n- The total value of derivatives related to cash flow hedges at year-end 2020 was DKK 2,332 million, compared to DKK 188 million in 2019. This notable increase indicates a heightened focus on hedging foreign exchange exposures, possibly due to increased currency volatility during 2020.\n- The company's policy to hedge up to 24 months forward indicates ongoing efforts to mitigate anticipated foreign currency impacts on future cash flows. The decline in the year-end exchange rates, especially the 3.8% change in JPY and 7.2% in CAD, could have led to unrealized gains or losses that are reflected in the increased hedge reserve.\n\n### Overall Effect in 2020\nThe currency fluctuations, particularly the depreciation of currencies like JPY and CAD, alongside Novo Nordisk's comprehensive risk management strategies, resulted in an increased hedge reserve and a relatively stable but negative comprehensive income figure. The company's active use of financial instruments, including forward contracts, helped mitigate some of the negative impacts, though residual effects of currency movements still influenced the overall financial results.\n\n### Summary:\n- Exchange rate fluctuations during 2020 led to a net comprehensive income net of DKK -1,689 million.\n- Increased use of derivatives and higher hedge reserves (~DKK 1.8 billion) indicate active hedging of foreign exchange risks.\n- These currency movements and risk management activities impacted the financial results, reflecting in both the comprehensive income and the size of cash flow hedges maintained by Novo Nordisk.\n\n---\n\n![Financial risk overview and exchange rate effects on 2020](image2)  \n*The data shows increased hedging activities and currency depreciation impacting reserves and financial results.*"}

The decrease from 2019 to 2020 was primarily influenced by several factors:\n\n- **Foreign currency translation adjustments**: In 2020, there was a significant negative impact of about $63.1 million due to foreign currency translation, compared to a positive impact in 2019 and 2018. This reflects unfavorable exchange rate movements affecting the company's international assets and earnings [3, 5].\n\n- **Other comprehensive income (loss)**: The total other comprehensive income (loss) decreased substantially in 2020, mainly due to adverse reclassification of (gain) loss to net income and fluctuations in gains recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) [4, 5].\n\n- **Net income decline**: The net income also declined, which directly reduces comprehensive income, since comprehensive income includes net income plus other comprehensive items. Specifically, net income decreased from $6,025.4 million in 2019 and $5,924.3 million in 2018 to $4,730.5 million in 2020 [4].\n\n- **Impact of COVID-19**: As noted in the company’s discussion, COVID-19-related disruptions led to revenue declines and increased uncertainties, affecting operational performance and, consequently, comprehensive income [1].\n\nIn summary, the decline in McDonald's comprehensive income in 2020 was driven by lower net income, negative foreign currency impacts, and adverse non-recurring or reclassification effects, compounded by pandemic-induced operational challenges."}

higher beverage penetration may translate into different profitability dynamics.\n\n3. **Change Insights (2018-2020):**\n   - Between 2018 and 2020, several divisions increased their beverage share slightly (e.g., LatAm from 80% to 90%) or maintained high beverage dominance [images 3 & 5].\n   - These shifts could impact profit margins, especially if beverage sales, which often have higher margins, are growing faster than food/snack.\n\n---\n\n**Linking Changes in Revenue & Operating Profit to Category Distribution**\n\n- The overall increase in revenue, especially driven by PBNA’s significant contributions, correlates with its balanced distribution of beverage and snacks, leveraging strong beverage margins and food/snack growth.\n- The relatively stagnant or slightly decreased operating profit despite revenue growth may partly stem from costs associated with diversifying product mixes, marketing investments, and changes in pricing strategies, as outlined in quotes discussing pricing impacts ([2], [4]).\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| **Division** | **2018 Revenue** | **2020 Revenue** | **Revenue Growth** | **Change in Operating Profit** |\n|------------------|------------------|------------------|----------------------|------------------------------|\n| PBNA             | $21.07B          | $22.56B          | +7.1%                | Slight decrease (from $2.28B to $1.94B) |\n| Europe           | $10.97B          | $11.92B          | +8.6%                | Slight increase, but profit margins may vary |\n| LatAm            | $7.35B           | $6.94B           | -5.4%                | Stable but slightly decreased profit |\n\n- Divisions with higher beverage proportions tend to have relatively stable revenues, potentially benefiting from higher margins.\n- Shifts toward more food/snack sales, which may have lower margins or higher costs, could suppress profit growth despite revenue increases.\n\n---\n\n**In conclusion**, the changes in net revenue from 2018 to 2020 across divisions reflect both growth and shifts in product category distribution, with beverage-dominant divisions generally experiencing more stable profit margins, while shifts toward food/snack categories can influence overall profitability, especially considering cost variability and pricing strategies.\n\n---\n\n**In brief:**  \nFrom 2018 to 2020, revenues increased across most divisions, influenced by their product mix. Divisions with higher beverage sales tended to maintain or slightly grow revenues with more stable profits, whereas those shifting toward food/snack categories experienced varied profit impacts, reflecting differences in margins and cost structures associated with each category."}

This increase reflects heightened activity or exposure in derivatives, which are primarily used for hedging purposes.\n- These derivatives include forward contracts, cash flow hedges, and fair value hedges, with notable contributions from forward contracts in USD and CNH, as well as fair value hedges [1, Image1].\n- The **fair value of derivative instruments** is measured based on quoted market prices in active markets, and the valuation hierarchy confirms consistent measurement practices across both years [4, 5].\n\nConcerning **cash flow changes**, the **cash flow from operating activities** decreased from **DKK -3,388 million** in 2019 to **DKK -4,353 million** in 2020, indicating a greater net cash outflow in 2020 [3, Image5]. Similarly, **cash flow from investing activities** also declined slightly, influenced by purchase and sale of long-term investments including fixed assets and intangible assets [2, Note 10].\n\n### How these elements impact the company's financial statements:\n\n- **Derivative Instruments**: Gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are recognized in the income statement as financial income or expenses [2, Quote7]. In 2020, increased derivative positions suggest potentially higher volatility or hedging activity, which can offset other income or expenses, thereby stabilizing the company's net income.\n- **Cash Flow**: The negative cash flow from operations reflects the company's increased cash outflows, possibly due to increased costs, investments, or operational challenges during 2020. Understanding the adjustments for non-cash items, as detailed, refines the picture of true cash generation and liquidity positions.\n\nIn conclusion, **the rise in derivative financial instruments and the more negative cash flow from operations in 2020** indicate more active hedging strategies and greater cash management challenges, both of which directly influence the company's net income, liquidity, and overall financial stability as reflected in the financial statements.\n\n---\n\n**Summary**:  \n| Element | 2020 | 2019 | Impact on Financial Statements |\n|---------|--------|--------|------------------------------|\n| Derivative financial instruments | DKK 63,390m | DKK 50,455m | Increased hedging, affecting income statement via fair value changes and influencing comprehensive income and equity |\n| Cash flow from operating activities | DKK -4,353m | DKK -3,388m | Greater cash outflow, impacting liquidity and requiring detailed cash flow analysis for financial health assessment |\n\nOverall, these elements exemplify the company's active risk management and cash flow dynamics during 2020 versus 2019."}

Modi's contract was extended until the AGM to be held for the approval of the audited accounts for the year ended March 31, 2005 [1][6][9]. These contracts show that their compensation was likely pre-determined, with no severance fees payable, indicating a fixed or structured remuneration arrangement.\n  - Mr. S.V. Shanbhag, another Executive Director, had a three-year service contract commencing October 1, 2001, with a three-month notice period and the right for the company to terminate with three months' salary in lieu of notice [10].\n\n- **Non-Executive Directors:**\n  - They received sitting fees of Rs. 5000 per meeting attended, with no other benefits or remuneration [7][3].\n\n- **Specific Payments to Directors:**\n  - Mr. R.A. Shah and Mr. C.M. Maniar did not receive any allowances, whereas Mr. Lalit Bhasin and Mr. Anup N. Kothari received nominal amounts (Rs. 600,000 and Rs. 672,000 respectively). \n  - Mr. Lalit Kumar Modi’s remuneration was Rs. 600,000 with an additional Rs. 449,512 in unspecified allowances, and he received Rs. 600,000 in sitting fees [3].\n\n**Relation to Company’s Financial Performance and Market Conditions:**\n\n- The company's financial results show steady but modest performance:\n  - The balance sheet as of March 31, 2003, indicated a stable financial position, with no drastic fluctuations in assets or liabilities [4].\n  - The profit and loss statement showed a profit for the period but without specific figures in the quotes; however, the mention of overall financial health reports in the audit imply satisfactory performance [4].\n  - Market conditions, inferred from the stock price trend in the GPI vs BSE Sensex graph, show a declining stock index from a high of 410 in August 2002 to 329 in March 2003, suggesting market pressures or sector-specific challenges during that period [1].\n\nThe remuneration structure appears to be primarily fixed, with some directors compensated via fees, and none of the reports suggest significant performance-based components such as bonuses or stock options. Given the modest profits and market decline, the remuneration of directors did not seem directly linked to extraordinary company performance or market conditions but was likely based on contractual, fixed, and fixed-per-meeting fees.\n\n**In summary:**\n- Executive and managing directors had fixed-term service contracts with defined notice periods, no severance, and fixed compensation.\n- Non-executive directors received modest sitting fees without performance-linked incentives.\n- During 2002-03, the company experienced stable financials amid a declining market, implying that director remuneration was more structured and contractual without significant variation due to market fluctuations or performance during that period."}

This alignment is evident in their proactive measures to adapt to climate change, such as increasing electrified vehicle sales in response to stricter regulations and future societal shifts under scenarios like below 2°C and 1.5°C [5, 6, 4].\n\nSecondly, Toyota’s investments in advanced and cutting-edge technologies, reinforced through cost reduction and productivity improvements via the Toyota Production System (TPS), enable it to allocate funds effectively toward electrification measures [6]. These measures directly address climate risks but also serve to sustain profitability and competitiveness in a transitioning market. Enhanced electrification aligns with the future scenario predictions, where the percentage of electrified vehicles is expected to rise [5].\n\nThirdly, shareholder returns, including dividends and share repurchases, have a clear relationship with Toyota's strategic investments. Toyota's policy to maintain stable dividends (~30%) and to prioritize reinvestment of retained earnings into next-generation technologies—such as environmental and safety tech—demonstrates a balance between rewarding shareholders and investing in future growth [10]. Despite climate-related risks and uncertainty in scenarios like below 2°C, Toyota continues to seek sustainable growth, evidenced by increasing total shareholder return over recent years [5].\n\nIn summary, Toyota’s financial strategy emphasizes stability and efficiency, which provides the necessary capital and resilience to invest in electrification and other climate-related measures. These efforts aim to reduce climate-related risks and seize emerging opportunities, ultimately supporting sustainable shareholder returns in a shifting global environment.\n\n---\n\n**Interleaved Evidence:**\n\nToyota’s emphasis on sustainability and technology investment can be seen in its strategic approach [1], alongside its proactive measures to adapt to future climate scenarios, including increased electrified vehicle sales [5] and cost efficiency initiatives [6]. These investments are designed not only to address climate risks but also to secure long-term profitability and shareholder value. Moreover, Toyota’s policy of maintaining dividends and reinvesting earnings aligns with its aim of sustainable growth amidst climate risks [10].\n\n**Summary Image:**\n\n![Toyota’s strategic alignment with climate scenarios and shareholder returns](image5)  \n*Toyota aligns its financial and environmental strategies through investments in electrification and consistent shareholder returns, supporting resilience in climate scenarios.*"}

This rise was driven mainly by higher cash collections from receivables, which increased by approximately **$4,795 million**, largely due to sales of receivables, including financing receivables of about $3,076 million [10]. Despite some decline in net income and other performance factors, the overall increase in operating cash flow positively contributed to the net cash change.\n\nSecondly, **cash used in investing activities** decreased markedly by **$23,908 million** in 2020, totaling **$3,028 million** compared to **$26,936 million** in 2019 [5][9]. This substantial reduction was primarily due to a decrease in cash used for acquisitions—specifically, a drop of about **$32.3 billion** related to the prior year's Red Hat acquisition—and a decrease in cash provided by net non-operating finance receivables, which fell by approximately **$6.2 billion** because of the wind-down of OEM IT financing operations.\n\nThirdly, **financing activities** shifted from a net source of cash of **$9,042 million** in 2019 to a net use of **$9,721 million** in 2020, a change of about **$18,763 million** [8][2]. This shift reflects increased cash outflows for dividends (approximately **$5,797 million**) and higher payments for workforce rebalancing (about **$293 million**), among other factors.\n\nThe **net effect** of these adjustments resulted in a **net increase in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash** of **$5,361 million** in 2020, compared to a **decrease of $3,290 million** in 2019 [2][4][10]. This demonstrates that **improved operating cash flow**, combined with **reduced investing outflows**, more than offset the higher cash used in financing activities, culminating in a more substantial net cash position at the end of 2020.\n\n### Summary:\n- **Operating activities** contributed positively with a **$3.4 billion** increase.\n- **Investing activities**' cash outflows decreased by **$23.9 billion**, strongly boosting net cash.\n- **Financing activities** shifted to a net cash outflow, increasing cash usage.\n\n**Overall**, these financial adjustments and cash flows led to a significant net increase in IBM’s cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash in 2020 compared to 2019.\n\n---\n\n**Interleaved visual summary:**\n\n![Summary of cash flows and adjustments impact on IBM's net cash in 2020](https://via.placeholder.com/600x300?text=Graph+illustrating+positive+operating+cash+flows,+reduced+investing+outflows,+and+net+cash+increase)  \n*Note: Placeholder image indicating the positive impact of operating cash flows, reduced investing outflows, and overall net cash increase.*"}

This is consistent with the sale of WFAM assets completed by November 2021, indicating a move towards focusing on traditional banking and lending activities rather than asset management services.\n\nOverall, these shifts in assets and AUM reflect a strategic prioritization of traditional banking operations over asset management, focusing on asset growth, liquidity, and lending as primary revenue sources, possibly to optimize capital allocation and risk management amid market conditions [1][3][9].\n\n**In summary:**\n\n- The increase in total assets supported a focus on expanding lending and liquidity management.\n- The reduction in WFAM AUM, culminating in the sale of WFAM, signifies a strategic shift away from asset management to core banking activities, aiming for a more streamlined and focused business model."}

The increase indicates improved profitability, partially due to market recovery and increased consumer spending on services like Sky Glass televisions.\n- The adjusted EBITDA in 2019 was higher at $34.3 billion, slightly less than 2021, but close to 2020. The reasons for fluctuations include changes in expenses and revenues associated with COVID-19 impacts and strategic investments.\n\n### Segment-wise Insights\n- **Content and Direct-to-Consumer Segments**\n  - In 2021, the segment's Adjusted EBITDA was $2.36 billion, up from $2.14 billion in 2020, and $1.95 billion in 2019 (see images 4 and 5). This growth is mainly due to increased revenue, particularly from Sky Glass sales and better cost management, offsetting higher programming expenses and COVID-19-related delays.\n- **Cable Communications**\n  - Although specific segment EBITDA isn't shown directly, capital expenditures and expenses increased due to infrastructure investments, which likely affected profitability. Revenue increased in 2021 due to market recovery and new services (see quote [6], image 4). Expenses related to programming and support also rose, but cost management helped maintain EBITDA growth.\n- **NBCUniversal and Sky**\n  - NBCUniversal expenses increased with higher media and theme park costs ([3]), influencing profitability. Sky's expenses rose due to direct network costs and other expenses, yet revenue growth from Sky Glass and other products contributed to EBITDA improvements.\n\n### Reasons for Changes:\n- Revenue increased in 2021 due to market recovery post-COVID and new product sales ([1], [6], images 2 and 4), leading to higher EBITDA.\n- Expense management played a significant role, with some reductions compared to 2020, especially regarding severance charges and COVID-19 response costs ([3], [7]).\n- Investment in infrastructure (Cable Communications) and content (NBCUniversal) affected profitability but aimed at long-term growth ([2], [3], [8]).\n- External factors like the Tokyo Olympics and sporting events delayed or increased costs, influencing segment expenses ([5]).\n\n### Conclusion:\nComcast's Adjusted EBITDA improved from 2020 to 2021 across segments, driven by revenue growth and cost control, especially in content and consumer segments, despite increased investments and expenses related to infrastructure and content production.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n| Year | Overall Adjusted EBITDA | Content/Direct-to-Consumer | Cable Communications | Reasons for change |\n|-------|-------------------------|---------------------------|----------------------|------------------|\n| 2019  | ~$34.3 billion          | ~$1.95 billion           | Not specified        | Baseline for comparison |\n| 2020  | ~$30.8 billion          | ~$2.14 billion           | Increased expenses   | COVID-19 impacts, cost reductions |\n| 2021  | ~$34.7 billion          | ~$2.36 billion           | Increased infrastructure spending | Revenue rebound, product sales, strategic investments |"}

The decline in short-term investment income was influenced by persistently low interest rates, as the company maintained a liquidity-focused stance, holding substantial cash, cash equivalents, and U.S. Treasury Bills [2]. This conservative approach to asset allocation, prioritizing safety, meant that although assets like cash and short-term securities increased, they yielded minimal interest income amidst declining interest rates [2].\n\nThe asset allocation data further reflect this change: the value of equity securities increased from \\$269,498 million in 2020 to \\$334,907 million in 2021, but holdings of fixed maturity securities decreased from \\$20,317 million to \\$16,386 million over the same period [image1]. The substantial holdings in cash, cash equivalents, and U.S. Treasury Bills at \\$90,688 million in 2021, compared to \\$67,082 million in 2020, indicate a shift towards safer short-term assets. This shift toward liquidity and low-yield securities aligns with the company's emphasis on safety over yield, especially given the low-interest-rate environment [2].\n\nIn summary, the factors contributing to the decline include:\n\n- Reduced interest income from fixed maturity securities and short-term investments, driven by low interest rates [2].\n- Asset allocation shifts towards higher cash and equivalents holdings, reflecting a focus on safety and liquidity, which contributed to lower yields [image1].\n\nThus, the company's asset allocation, emphasizing cash and low-yield securities, closely mirrors the decline in net investment income and underscores its risk-averse stance amidst declining interest rates."}

This substantial rise in sales prices directly contributed to increased earnings, which bolstered EBITDA.\n\nMeanwhile, the image data, particularly in the first table (image1), shows that the Underlying EBITDA for FY2020 was US$22,071 million, rising to US$37,379 million in FY2021.

This improvement is primarily attributed to lower net cash used for investing activities, which was significantly reduced to -$11,619 million in 2020 from -$6,437 million in 2019 [4](image4). Notably, the large investments in acquisitions—Rockstar ($3.85 billion), Pioneer Foods ($1.2 billion), and Be & Cheery ($0.7 billion)—contributed to the cash outflows, but the overall reduction in other investing outflows helped increase free cash flow.\n\nIn terms of financing activities, although detailed figures for 2019 are not explicitly provided here, the 2020 data shows net cash provided by financing activities at $3,819 million, which indicates active debt issuance (+$13.8 billion gross proceeds) offset by dividend payments, share repurchases, and debt repayments [4](image4). The increase in net cash from financing likely supported the company’s capital investments and shareholder returns, such as dividend hikes and share repurchases.\n\nRegarding contractual commitments, specifically operating leases, the obligations in 2020 were $1,895 million, compared to $413 million in 2019, showing a significant increase. This rise reflects new lease commitments primarily related to building leases, as noted [1](quote 1c) and the contractual commitments table [5](image5).

These actions reduce retained earnings but demonstrate confidence in the company's cash management.\n\n- **Recognition of Stock-Based Compensation:**  \n  The figures show stock compensation expenses affect net income and retained earnings, as detailed in [2], [8], and [9]. The unrecognized future compensation related to equity awards also influences profit distribution.\n\n- **Financial Position Stability:**  \n  The company's robust cash position, ending 2020 with approximately \\$6.6 billion ([6], [10]), supports ongoing dividend payments and share repurchases, affecting retained earnings.\n\n---\n\n### Interleaved Summary with Visual Data:\n\nThe company's **net income** and **retained earnings** saw fluctuations driven by performance, strategic dividends, share repurchases, and stock compensation expenses.  \n![company's cash position and share repurchase strategy](image6)  \nThe company held a strong cash reserve (~\\$6.6 billion at end of 2020), enabling continued shareholder returns despite changes in earnings.  \n\n### **Final conclusion:**\n\nBetween 2018 and 2020, the company's net income experienced growth influenced by operational reorganization and share repurchase activities, while increased dividends and strategic stock-based compensation efforts impacted retained earnings negatively. The company's solid cash position supported ongoing shareholder returns and financial stability during this period."}

The global economic disruption also led to banks playing expanded roles supporting society, which may have indirectly benefited HSBC’s income streams.\n\n- **For Adjusted Revenue from Global Markets**: The rise was driven by higher client activity in Fixed Income, Currencies, and Commodities (FICC), with a 27% increase, particularly in Foreign Exchange and Credit trading, supported by wider spreads and heightened market volatility [quote 9]. The operational adjustments, including reallocating resources and mitigating risks through RWA reductions, also helped strengthen revenue generation in a turbulent environment [quote 5].\n\nIn summary, HSBC's net operating income increased slightly, driven by market activity and client support, while the adjusted revenue from Global Markets saw a substantial boost due to heightened trading activity and volatility, despite the overall economic downturn [images 2 & 5; quotes 7 & 9]."}

Text [1] states it dropped $\\S5.5$ billion to $\\S43.4$ billion, driven primarily by lower interest rates, with some offsetting factors like reduced funding costs and additional interest accrual days.\n- In contrast, from 2018 to 2019, net interest income **decreased slightly** as per the interest income data (image4), with the net interest income/ yield on earning assets declining from 2.43% in 2018 to 1.90% in 2020, indicating a broader decline in interest rates affecting bank revenues.\n\n**Net Interest Expense Changes:**\n\n- From 2019 to 2020, **interest expense increased dramatically**, reaching $\\$14,120$ million, reflecting elevated costs possibly due to increased interest paid on certain liabilities or organizational shifts. The net interest income decline was also influenced by higher interest expenses, as shown by the increased net interest expense.\n- Between 2018 and 2019, interest expense was lower, around $\\$3,738$ million, showing a significant increase in 2020, which is consistent with organizational adjustments in funding and liability management.\n\n**Organizational Structure Reflection:**\n\nThese changes mirror the organizational structure of Bank of America, detailed across multiple segments and their financial activities:\n\n- The segmented reporting (images 2 & 3) shows diverse operations like Consumer Banking, Global Wealth & Investment Management, and Global Banking, each with different funding sources and interest rate sensitivities.\n- The organization manages various liabilities (image 5), including a substantial amount of interest-bearing deposits and long-term debt, which affect overall interest expenses.\n- The increase in interest expense in 2020 likely reflects strategic shifts in funding costs, possibly due to changes in liabilities structure or increased borrowings in response to economic conditions (e.g., COVID-19).\n\n**In summary**, the sharper reduction in net interest income and the significant rise in interest expense from 2019-2020 compared to 2018-2019 are influenced by declining interest rates and organizational adjustments in liabilities and funding sources. These reflect Bank of America's multi-segment organizational structure, diverse funding activities, and strategic responses to economic conditions."}

Specifically, shipment volumes in Brazil increased slightly by 13.4%, influenced by reduced illicit trade and border restrictions, but the combined effect across the broader region was a significant decline.\n- Excluding the deconsolidation of RBH, the shipment volume decrease was 10.3%, indicating that operational volume declines contributed notably to the revenue compression.\n\n**Financial Activities:**\n- Net revenues declined by 22.9% in 2020, from $2,206 million in 2019 to $1,701 million [4, Image 4], primarily due to lower shipment volumes and market share declines in countries like Argentina, Canada, Colombia, and Mexico.\n- Operating income doubled (+100%) to $564 million, mainly because of non-cash charges in 2019, such as asset impairments, which reduced 2020’s comparative profit but reflects a restructuring effort aligned with declining sales.\n- Net cash provided by operating activities decreased by $0.3 billion to $9,812 million, but after excluding unfavorable currency movements ($0.5 billion), it actually increased by $0.2 billion, indicating resilient operational cash flow [5,7, Image 5].\n- Net cash used in investing activities decreased from $1,811 million in 2019 to $1,154 million in 2020, reflecting reduced capital expenditures during the pandemic, which largely tempered the impact on free cash flow [5].\n\n**Impact Summary:**\n- The sharp drop in shipment volumes directly reduced revenues and profitability, indicative of lower consumer demand and market downtrends.\n- Strategic cost adjustments, asset impairments, and reduced capital expenditures helped partially offset revenue declines, maintaining positive cash flow.\n- Despite the volume and revenue decrease, PMI’s operational cash flow demonstrated resilience, partly thanks to cost management and lower investments.\n  \n**Conclusion:**\nThe combined effects of declining shipment volumes and strategic financial management led to lower revenue and profit levels in Latin America & Canada in 2020 relative to 2019. However, PMI managed to sustain positive operating cash flow and reduced investments in response to the challenging market conditions.\n\n---\n\n**Summary sentence:**  \nThe decrease in shipment volumes and adjustments in financial activities caused a decline in revenue and profit, but PMI’s operational resilience and cost management helped stabilize its overall financial performance in Latin America & Canada during 2020."}

Specifically, in 2020, the share-based compensation expense was **$1,197,806,000** [3, 4, 5].\n\n- **Impact on Cash Position:**  \n  Share-based compensation typically does not involve an immediate cash outlay; instead, it reflects the recognition of stock-based awards granted to employees. It influences cash flow indirectly by affecting net income and through related tax effects. Because it is a non-cash expense, it does not directly affect cash flow from operating activities, although it reduces net income.\n\n### Cash Flow from Operating Activities\n- **Contribution to Cash Position:**  \n  For 2020, the net cash provided by operating activities was **$8,215,152,000** [2, 3, 4].  \n  This large positive cash flow significantly contributes to the company's cash position, enabling it to fund operations, dividends, share repurchases, and other investments.\n\n### Synthesis:\n- **Share-based compensation** decreases net income (by approximately $1.2 billion in 2020) but does not directly deplete cash, as the expense is non-cash. It can, however, impact shareholders' equity negatively through retained earnings, since reduced net income lowers the accumulation in retained earnings.\n- The **cash flow from operating activities** of over **$8.2 billion** in 2020 greatly enhances Accenture's cash reserves, maintaining a robust cash position, which in this case was **$8.4 billion** at the end of 2020 [2].\n\n### **Summary:**\nIn 2020, share-based compensation expense reduced net income and consequently shareholders' equity, but did not directly impact cash. Meanwhile, strong cash flows from operating activities substantially increased the company's cash reserves, supporting ongoing operations and shareholder returns.\n\n---\n\n**In brief**, for 2020:\n- **Share-based compensation** decreased net income and thus slightly reduced shareholders' equity.\n- **Cash flow from operating activities** significantly increased Accenture's cash position, strengthening liquidity."}

This growth suggests that the company expanded its asset base, possibly through increased investments, acquisitions, or accumulation of receivables, reflecting a strategic move to support higher business activity or diversification.\n\nSimultaneously, **cash flow from operating activities increased significantly** — from **$4.05 billion** in 2020 to **$7.18 billion** in 2021 [2, 9, image4]. This positive change implies improved operational efficiency, higher profit margins, or better working capital management. The increase in operating cash flows indicates that the business generated more liquidity internally, providing a stronger foundation for ongoing operations, debt repayment, or investment.\n\n**Implications for Business Operations:**\n\n- The rise in assets combined with increased cash flow suggests a robust and expanding business, likely capable of supporting growth initiatives without excessive reliance on external borrowing.\n- The improved cash flow enhances liquidity, allowing the business to meet its short-term obligations effectively and invest in new opportunities.\n- The growth in assets and cash flow could also reflect resilience in business operations, possibly driven by higher revenues and better cost management during this period.\n\n**In summary**, the increase in total assets indicates expansion, while the rise in operating cash flow demonstrates stronger operational performance.

The higher net income contributed to retained earnings but was offset by cash used in financing and investing activities, which explains part of the change in asset and liability levels. These shifts highlight strategic liquidity management, increased risk-taking through loans, and effective debt reduction, all interconnected with the improved net income and operational cash flows.\n\n**Interleaved Visuals:**\n- From **image2** (cash flows), the outflows in financing support the reduction in liabilities.\n- From **images 3 and 5**, changes in assets like loans and securities show growth, offsetting some asset declines.\n- The detailed asset and liability balances (images 4 and 5) visually confirm the overall modest contraction aligned with operational activities."}

This suggests a potential increase in uncertain tax positions, which could impact future tax liabilities and cash flows if recognized. As noted, the company believes it is reasonably possible that its unrecognized tax benefits may decrease by \\$39 million within the next twelve months due to audit settlements and statute expirations, potentially easing some uncertainty in the future.\n\nIn terms of share repurchases, the company reduced the number of shares purchased from 22 million in 2019 to 14 million in 2020, and the average price per share increased from \\$245.97 to \\$300.58. The aggregate cost of share repurchases decreased from \\$5,500 million in 2019 to \\$4,250 million in 2020, despite the higher average price per share, primarily because the total shares repurchased also declined.\n\n**Implications for the company's financial position:**\n\n- The increase in unrecognized tax benefits signifies higher tax-related uncertainties, which could affect the company's deferred tax assets and liabilities. While the current net deferred income tax liabilities increased slightly from \\$2,868 million in 2019 to \\$3,391 million in 2020, this reflects a more cautious stance regarding potential future tax obligations.\n- The reduction in share repurchases indicates a strategic shift, possibly conserving cash or adjusting capital return policies, which impacts shareholders by slightly decreasing the equity buyback activity and potentially affecting earnings per share (EPS) due to fewer shares being repurchased.\n\nOverall, the rise in unrecognized tax benefits may introduce some future tax liabilities, slightly increasing financial risk, while decreased share repurchase activity might indicate a more conservative approach to capital management but could influence shareholder returns.\n\n**Summary in simple terms:**\n\nBetween 2019 and 2020, the company’s potential uncertain tax benefits grew, which could mean higher future tax obligations. Also, the company bought back fewer shares in 2020, at a higher price per share, which might result in a smaller reduction of shares outstanding and slightly affect shareholder value."}

Specifically, the cash dividends per share were $5.16, decreasing retained earnings and slightly lowering total equity [3].\n\n- **Treasury Stock Transactions:**  \n  Chevron issued treasury stock (buybacks) with a total value of around **$33.955 billion** (see image 3). These repurchases reduced common stock outstanding and decreased total stockholders' equity by that amount, reflecting a capital return to shareholders and a reduction in equity issued share count.\n\n### Impact on Cash Flows:\n- **Cash Dividends:**  \n  The cash paid for dividends (about **$10.18 billion**) is reflected as an outflow under financing activities in the cash flow statement (see image 5). This outflow reduces cash and cash equivalents, as shown by the net cash used for financing activities totaling **$23.113 billion** in 2021, primarily influenced by dividends and share repurchases.\n\n- **Treasury Stock Transactions:**  \n  The purchase of treasury stock contributed to a significant cash outflow (**$33.955 billion**) under investing activities (or financing activities, depending on classification), further decreasing cash reserves, as indicated in the cash flow statement.\n\n### Summary:\nIn 2021, Chevron's cash dividends resulted in substantial cash outflows and reduced retained earnings, thereby lowering equity. Simultaneously, treasury stock repurchases reduced total equity by decreasing the number of shares outstanding and caused large cash outflows, significantly impacting both their cash position and share structure.\n\n**In conclusion:**  \n**Cash dividends decreased Chevron's equity by reducing retained earnings, and treasury stock transactions decreased the total equity by repurchasing shares, both leading to significant cash outflows in 2021.**"}

During 2020, re-measurement of lease liabilities increased by $1,559,000, reflecting adjustments due to changes in lease terms, including extensions and re-assessments [3], [4]. The total lease liabilities at 28 June 2020 stood at **$167,154,000**, an increase driven by new leases and lease modifications [3], [8]. Additionally, the impact of lease liabilities was managed with offsetting lease incentive liabilities, which were recognized and amortized over the lease term [6].\n\nIn terms of employee benefits, the accrued liabilities for wages, salaries, and annual leave decreased slightly from **$4,054,000** in 2019 to **$4,092,000** in 2020, indicating a stable but slightly fluctuating employee benefit obligation [3]. The disclosures in **image3** detail employee benefit liabilities, highlighting the liabilities for annual leave and long-service leave, with some increases reflecting expected future obligations. Notably, the transition did not significantly alter these liabilities but included notes on the methodology of recognition and measurement under the new accounting standards [1], [7].\n\n**In summary**, the transition to AASB 16 increased the recognized lease liabilities with a total of approximately **$23.5 million** (from around $143.6 million to $167.2 million), reflecting the capitalized right-of-use assets and lease obligations. Employee benefit liabilities remained relatively stable, with slight fluctuations but no major impact attributed directly to the transition [1], [3], [8].\n\n---\n\n**Key impacts summarized:**\n- **Lease liabilities** increased due to the recognition of lease obligations under AASB 16, with a total increase of about $23.5 million in 2020.\n- **Employee benefit liabilities** remained fairly consistent, with minor fluctuations and no significant change attributable to the adoption of AASB 16."}

Specifically, the evaluation employs a formula that considers the company's **financial health**—through operating income—and the **share price stability**, which directly reflects shareholder value and market confidence [1][3][7][9].\n\nThe **performance-linked remuneration** component, which makes up the portion of total remuneration beyond fixed compensation, is explicitly tied to these indicators. For example, the share-based compensation component in the remuneration system is evaluated by comparing Toyota’s share price at the fiscal year's end with the stock's historical average, ensuring executive incentives are aligned with **shareholder value growth** [3][5][9][10]. The detailed breakdown of executive compensation in image2 shows how bonuses and share-based incentives are calibrated according to these performance metrics.\n\nFurthermore, the evaluation process involves **qualitative assessments** of each director's individual performance, which incorporates their efforts towards achieving company goals, including technological innovation, cost reduction, and sustainable growth [1][5][8]. The policy also emphasizes that the **remuneration system promotes initiatives** that contribute to overall corporate performance and shareholder value [8], making executive incentives a reflection of both immediate financial metrics and strategic achievements.\n\nIn summary, Toyota’s remuneration evaluation system integrates **financial results** (like operating income and share price stability) and **individual performance** to ensure that executive incentives encourage actions that enhance business success and shareholder value.\n\n### Visual summary:\n- **Image3** shows how Toyota evaluates **consolidated operating income** and **share price volatility** as primary evaluation weights, directly linking remuneration to financial and market performance indicators.\n- **Image4** details specific remuneration components tied to company performance, such as bonuses and share-based compensation.\n- **Image5** illustrates consistent growth in dividends, stock repurchases, and total shareholder return, emphasizing the alignment of the company's financial health and shareholder value with executive incentives.\n\n**In essence, Toyota’s executive remuneration assessment intricately links compensation to tangible business performance metrics and shareholder value indicators, fostering alignment of management actions with company success.**"}

The reduction in WFAM's assets under management reflects asset sales and managed asset transitions, which in turn impacted the overall composition of Wells Fargo's balance sheet, leading to relatively modest overall asset growth amidst strategic disposal of assets and management shifts.\n\n**In simple terms:**  \nThe slight decline in WFAM assets under management in 2021 contributed to a nuanced change in Wells Fargo’s balance sheet, with overall assets remaining fairly steady but affected by strategic sales and portfolio adjustments."}

The strategy emphasized rigorous site selection—preferably high-traffic locations—and a homogenous store model to facilitate quick rollouts, with an average of approximately 14 days to fit out new stores [9]. During this period, the company built its reputation for profitable international operations, supported by a detailed understanding of diverse markets and local networks [3][4].\n\n**Expansion into New Markets and Pilot Programs (2018–2020):**\nFrom 2018 onward, the strategy shifted towards more transformative international expansion, including launching into Europe, the United States, and entering the Middle East via pilot programs [4]. The aim was to capitalize on international opportunities by leveraging existing capital and infrastructure, while remaining nimble to market conditions, particularly as the pandemic impacted retail leasing markets [3][4]. Achievements during this period include:\n- **Significant Store Openings Outside Australia:** For example, the US opened 48 stores by 2020, France 21, and the UK 42, as part of the global roll-out [5][10].\n- **Successful Domestic and International Growth:** The group opened 47 stores outside Australia in 2020, including 13 in France and 29 in the US, reflecting active pursuit of international markets [10].\n\n**Challenges Faced:**\n- **Competitive Industry Barriers:** The sector remains highly competitive with low barriers to entry, requiring continuous innovation and strong brand presence to maintain market share [7][8].\n- **Market Conditions and External Risks:** COVID-19 disrupted global retail leasing environments, causing delays and cautious entry into some emerging markets, prompting the group to monitor conditions closely and be opportunistic [3].\n\n**Strategic Focus Moving Forward:**\nLovisa continues to emphasize rapid and profitable growth—either by increasing earnings from existing stores or expanding into new territories—while employing a cautious, opportunistic approach to market entry based on current conditions [4][10]. The use of pilot programs for new regions and similarity in store format supports scalable expansion with manageable risks.\n\n---\n\n### Summary\n| Period | Focus | Achievements | Challenges |\n|---------|--------|--------------|------------|\n| 2016–2018 | Consolidation in core markets, establishing a repeatable store model | Growth in existing markets, high store density in South Africa, UK, and Australia | Industry competition, site acquisition costs |\n| 2018–2020 | International market entry (France, US, Middle East), pilot programs | New store openings predominantly outside Australia, starting scale in key regions | External economic factors (COVID-19), market risks, lease market volatility |\n\n**In conclusion, Lovisa’s expansion strategy has evolved from steady market penetration within the Asia-Pacific region to active pursuit of international footprints via pilot programs, leveraging operational excellence, and remaining adaptive to external challenges like COVID-19.**"}

This reduction was primarily driven by lower interest and investment income, notably a 44.4% decrease in interest and other investment income, caused by decreased income from short-term investments and fixed maturity securities, compounded by persistently low interest rates throughout 2021 [2]. Despite holding substantial cash and U.S. Treasury Bills, the low interest rates limited income growth in this area.\n\n**Railroad operating earnings** increased from $7,752 million in 2020 to $8,811 million in 2021, an approximate 13.7% rise [1][4][7]. Key factors contributing to this improvement include higher revenues driven by increased volumes and higher average revenue per car/unit, partly due to business mix changes and higher fuel surcharge revenue from increased fuel prices. Additionally, productivity improvements helped offset higher fuel costs, and the volume recovery from pandemic-induced lows supported the earnings growth [3][4][7].\n\nIn summary, while **net investment income** declined mainly due to low interest rates and reduced income from investments, **railroad operating earnings** grew owing to higher revenues from increased volumes, favorable business mix, and fuel surcharge increases, despite higher operating expenses.\n\n**Summary in simple terms:**  \nNet investment income fell because of lower interest income caused by low interest rates, whereas railroad earnings increased mainly due to higher transportation revenues and productivity."}

This suggests new leasing agreements or remeasurement of existing leases, consistent with new lease conventions or acquisitions.\n- **Composition:** In 2020, operating leases constitute part of the **\"Other long-term assets\"** valued at **$942 million** (see image4). This increase in lease assets impacts the balance sheet by adding to non-current assets and is typically offset by corresponding lease liabilities, which grew from **$797 million** in 2019 to **$974 million** in 2020.\n\n### Inventories:\n- **2020:** Total inventories increased from **$5,063 million** in 2019 to **$6,444 million** in 2020, an increase of **$1,381 million**.

This affects the balance sheet, increasing total assets and liabilities.\n- The rise in **inventories** is linked partly to higher sales volumes, inventory fair value adjustments, and acquisition-related charges (see [1], [9]). This influences the cost of goods sold, gross profit, and working capital management.\n- Financial statements are affected as follows:\n  - **Balance Sheet:** Higher lease assets and liabilities, increased inventories, and related adjustments impact total assets and liabilities.\n  - **Income Statement:** Elevated inventories, inventory fair value adjustments, and amortization expenses contribute to cost of sales and net earnings variations.\n  - **Cash Flows:** Changes in working capital, especially inventories and trade receivables/payables, influence operating cash flows, as seen with the cash flow analysis of **$160 million** used in managing operating cycles in 2020.\n\n### Summary:\nThe increased lease assets (from $764 million to $942 million) reflect new lease commitments and lease accounting standards adoption, expanding the asset base and corresponding liabilities. The inventory increase, especially in raw materials and finished goods, corresponds with higher sales and acquisition effects, affecting the company's working capital, profitability, and cash flow management. These changes collectively reveal strategic growth, operational expansion, or lease standard implementation during 2020, impacting the balance sheet and income statement.\n\n---\n\n**In brief:**  \nThe company's lease assets grew significantly due to new lease commitments and acquisitions, and inventories increased driven by higher sales and investment activities. These shifts expand both assets and liabilities, affecting the company's financial position, profitability, and cash flow dynamics."}

This represents an increase of approximately 1.69 million shares, indicating a significant acquisition or grant of additional shares over the year. This increase suggests an expansion of their ownership stake, potentially aligning their interests more closely with shareholder value.\n\n### Remuneration Changes\nWhile the exact remuneration figures for S Fallscheer are not explicitly detailed in the provided tables, the overall context from the text indicates:\n- The remuneration for key management personnel, including executive directors like S Fallscheer, comprises various components such as salary, fees, performance-based payments, and share-based benefits [1, 7].\n- For S Fallscheer specifically, there is mention of **option, rights, and share holdings** changes, implying participation in long-term incentive schemes [9].  \n- The detailed remuneration table shows executive director fees for FY2020 are approximately \\$1,341,286, with some components like super contributions and share-based payments, but specific figures for S Fallscheer are not isolated.\n\n### Implications on Financial Position\n- **Increased Shareholding**: The substantial increase in S Fallscheer’s shares signifies a heightened stake in the company, aligning their incentives with long-term shareholder wealth and possibly indicating confidence in the organization’s future performance.\n- **Remuneration/Benefits**: If remuneration components increased, it suggests the company may be investing more in executive incentivization, which could motivate improved performance but also impacts profit margins and cash flows.\n- **Financial Position Impact**: The rising shareholdings and incentive payments may reflect a strategic effort to retain and motivate key leadership, potentially leading to better company performance. Conversely, higher remuneration costs would slightly affect profitability metrics in the short term but may benefit overall wealth creation if performance improves.\n\n### Summary\n- S Fallscheer’s shareholding increased from 4.14 million to approximately 5.83 million shares from FY19 to FY20.\n- The remuneration, including compensation components and possibly incentive-based shares or options, likely increased due to incentives and share-based benefits.\n- These changes suggest a strategic move to align S Fallscheer’s interests with company performance, potentially fostering better governance and long-term growth, which could positively influence the company’s financial stability and shareholder value over time.\n\n**In conclusion**, S Fallscheer’s increased shareholding and potential rise in compensation indicate a strengthened alignment with the company’s success, which may positively impact the firm's performance and financial outlook."}

This significant growth is reflected in the overall 16% comparable sales increase reported in 2021[3], as well as strong performance in core merchandise, e-commerce, and warehouse ancillary businesses.\n\nSimilarly, in Canada, net sales increased from roughly $14.9 billion in 2019 to about $19.2 billion in 2021, representing approximately a 28.9% growth. The report indicates strong sales growth in Canada with a 22% increase in net sales in 2021, heavily influenced by improved comparable sales and warehouse expansions[3].\n\nRegarding Other International markets, net sales boosted from about $17.3 billion in 2019 to roughly $22.4 billion in 2021, an increase of approximately 29.5%. The growth was driven by warehouse expansions and higher sales in warehouse ancillary and core categories[3].\n\nOverall, the company experienced substantial regional growth, with all regions showing around 28-30% increase in net sales over the two-year span, mainly due to improvements in comparable sales and new warehouse openings. The U.S. and international operations contributed significantly to these gains.\n\n![Summary of regional net sales growth from 2019 to 2021](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1506744038136-46273834b3fb)  \n_Visual overview of global sales growth highlights._"}

Conversely, heated tobacco units increased from 30,677 million to 33,862 million units, reflecting a 10.4% rise [2,8].\n- The overall shipment volume in the region, excluding the impact of RBH deconsolidation, decreased by approximately 10.3%.\n\n**Contributing Factors**:\n- The decline in cigarette volumes was primarily due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which affected consumer mobility and product availability.\n- The increase in heated tobacco units was driven by higher shipment volumes, notably in Japan, partly offsetting cigarette declines.\n\n**Latin America & Canada**:\n- Cigarette shipment volume dropped from 72,293 million units in 2019 to 63,749 million units in 2020, an 11.8% decrease.\n- The total shipment volume (including heated tobacco units) declined similarly, with total Latin America & Canada shipment volume decreasing from 72,592 million in 2019 to 64,200 million in 2020, also an 11.6% decline [4,8,9,10].\n- Cigarette volumes dropped by 9.7% in Latin America, attributed mainly to lower product availability and a decline in market share, influenced by adult smoker down-trading to low-price brands and product shortages (Argentina, Colombia, Mexico). Heated tobacco shipment volume increased significantly (+50.8%) from 299 million to 451 million units, driven by product adoption [2,8,9].\n\n**Contributing Factors**:\n- Pandemic-related mobility restrictions and retail out-of-stock situations reduced cigarette availability and consumption.\n- Price increases in January 2020, combined with pandemic-related behavioral changes, led to down-trading and reduced overall consumption.\n- The growth in heated tobacco units in Latin America & Canada reflects shifting consumer preferences toward alternative products and increased adoption of heated tobacco in certain markets.\n\n**Summary**:\n- Both regions experienced declines in cigarette units, primarily due to pandemic-related disruptions, market share shifts, and product access issues.\n- Heated tobacco units increased in both regions, notably in Japan (East Asia & Australia) and Latin America, likely driven by evolving consumer preferences and strategic product focus.\n\n**In conclusion**, the declines in cigarette sales were mainly a result of pandemic impacts and changing consumer behaviors, while increases in heated tobacco units demonstrate a shift toward alternative tobacco products, influenced by market adoption and regional strategies."}

The major factors influencing this decline are highlighted in the provided data:\n\n- **Higher paydown rates on revolving loan balances**: The decrease in interest yields is primarily driven by higher paydowns, which reduce the average balance of loans earning interest, thereby lowering the overall interest yield [4].\n\n- **Decline in interest income**: As interest income decreased over these years, the yield also shifted downward, partly due to lower interest income in 2021 compared to 2019 [4], [6], and [11].\n\nAdditionally, the consistent reduction in average Card Member loans (from $82.8 billion in 2019 to $76.0 billion in 2021) further contributed to the lower yields, as smaller loan balances with similar or lower interest rates lead to decreased interest income relative to the average balance [3], [4], [11].\n\n**Summary**:  \nThe net interest yield on average Card Member loans declined from 11.1% in 2019 to 10.2% in 2021, primarily due to higher paydown rates resulting in reduced loan balances and interest income, which together decreased the yield."}

Monthly High-Low Prices:\n- The data shows that **GPI's high prices** fluctuated between Rs. 329 (March 2003) and Rs. 410 (August 2002). Similarly, **low prices** ranged from Rs. 286 (March 2003) to Rs. 350 (December 2002).\n- The **Sensex's highs** during these months varied between 329 (March 2003) and 397 (May 2002), while the **lows** ranged from 286 (March 2003) to 369 (June 2002).\n- Both GPI and Sensex showed some volatility, but their high-low ranges moved somewhat in tandem, indicating correlated price movements over the period.\n\n### 2. Normalized Index Performance:\n- The graph depicting the normalized prices shows that **GPI's index** started at 100 in April 2002, rose to a peak of 106 in July 2002, then declined to 84 by March 2003.\n- The **Sensex index** followed a similar declining trend, from 100 in April 2002 to 84 in March 2003, with some fluctuations.\n- Both indices peaked around mid-2002 and then declined towards March 2003, showing a **strong correlation in overall performance** over the period.\n\n### Summary:\n- The trends of GPI's stock prices and the BSE Sensex from April 2002 to March 2003 are closely aligned, with both showing initial gains mid-2002 followed by a decline toward early 2003.\n- The normalized index plots solidify this relationship, illustrating that GPI's stock performance mirrored the general market trend represented by the Sensex.\n\n### Conclusion:\n**GPI stock prices closely followed the market trend of the BSE Sensex during April 2002 to March 2003, reflecting overall market conditions with similar peaks and declines in both monthly high-low prices and normalized performance.**\n\n---\n\n![GPI vs Sensex normalized performance](image4)"}

During this period, the R&D tax credit, which reduces taxable income, declined from \\$13,841 thousand in 2013 to \\$18,655 thousand in 2014, reflecting an increased benefit in reducing income tax liabilities [11].\n\nIn 2014, a notable release of tax reserves on previously unrecognized tax benefits (about \\$38.6 million) was due to a settlement, leading to a lower effective tax rate, partially attributable to the R&D credit's retroactive reinstatement [4].\n\nBy 2015, the impact of the R&D tax credit was further emphasized by the enactment of the Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act, which made the R&D credit permanent and retroactively extended it from January 1, 2015. Consequently, the company recognized a retroactive R&D tax credit benefit of approximately \\$16.5 million, reducing the provision for income taxes by this amount [6].\n\nOverall, the data indicates an increasing recognition of R&D credits and other tax benefits, which have lowered the company's effective income tax provision from approximately \\$82.6 million in 2014 to \\$19.2 million in 2015.

The total amount spent on COVID Relief initiatives is substantial, culminating in a notable project in PAN India with ₹24.73 crore, reflecting large-scale financial mobilization for pandemic-related support [1, 5].\n\n- **Rural Development Projects**: These involve a variety of projects with variable costs, such as the Harit Inian project in Madhya Pradesh costing ₹0.18 crore, and the support for sports and dairy projects in Gujarat involving amounts like ₹1.25 crore and ₹18.55 crore respectively. The overall expenditure across rural projects appears distributed over multiple smaller-scale initiatives with amounts typically under ₹2 crore, indicating more localized and varied investments [4, 8].\n\n### Implementation Methods:\n- **COVID Relief Projects**: Most projects are implemented directly by the Bank or through partnerships with charitable or government organizations. The mode of implementation is frequently **\"Direct\"**, indicating the bank's hands-on approach in executing relief activities (e.g., PAN India project, Gujarat support) [2, 8]. These projects address urgent pandemic needs such as healthcare, food security, and infrastructure for COVID management.\n\n- **Rural Development Projects**: These are implemented through a combination of direct actions, partnerships with NGOs, and government agencies. For instance, some projects like Sanjeevani Institute and BAIF Foundation involve **\"NA\" (not specified or separate)** for mode of implementation, while others like rural development projects and empowerment programs rely on **\"Participation\"** or **\"Direct\"** modes, indicating varying degrees of direct involvement or collaboration [4, 8].\n\n### Summary:\n- **COVID Relief** projects are of higher variance in expenditure, often large-scale, and predominantly implemented **directly** or through established partnerships to quickly address pandemic-related needs.\n- **Rural Development** projects tend to have smaller, more dispersed budgets, involved with local NGOs, government agencies, or community participation, focusing on long-term rural sustainability.\n\n**In conclusion**, COVID Relief projects generally involve higher expenditures with direct, large-scale implementation methods aimed at immediate pandemic impact mitigation, while Rural Development projects feature varied, often smaller budgets, with implementation methods ranging from direct involvement to community participation for sustainable rural growth."}

This gain relates to higher discount rates at the end of 2021, leading to a decrease in pension obligations.\n- For 2022, an expected increase of $168 million in benefit expense is projected, primarily due to higher interest costs and lower expected returns, with no mention of significant MTM gains or losses expected [1][9].\n\n**Relation to mark-to-market gains/losses:**\n- Negative MTM losses in 2020 (specifically $833 million) led to a considerable decrease in net benefit expense, even turning it negative.\n- The MTM gain in 2021 ($33 million) contributed to reducing the overall benefit expense compared to previous years, reflecting changes in discount rates and pension asset returns.\n- The trend indicates that fluctuations in mark-to-market gains and losses significantly impact the total net benefit costs, with losses lowering expenses in years like 2020, and gains raising expenses or reducing them in years like 2021.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe Total Net Periodic Benefit Cost (Benefit) decreased sharply in 2020 due to substantial MTM losses, then increased in 2021 owing to MTM gains.

Supporters of the losing candidate (Clinton) tend to give lower grades overall [5], implying that supporters of losing candidates generally view the conduct less favorably than supporters of the winning candidate.\n\n**In summary**, while the public and pollsters in 2016 rated Trump's conduct quite low compared to previous winners, supporters of Clinton, the losing candidate, rated her conduct higher than they rated Trump. This pattern aligns with past patterns where supporters of the losing candidate tend to rate the conduct of the candidates more favorably than supporters of the winner.  \n \n**Therefore, in the 2016 election, the public graded the conduct of the winning candidate, Trump, quite poorly, especially when compared to the higher grades given to Clinton by her supporters and in respect to historical standards for winners.**"}

Additionally, a portion of respondents (26%, as shown in the images) acknowledge that if these systems incorporate other useful information, they could be acceptable, particularly if they improve consistency and fairness in decisions like parole or sentencing.\n\nConversely, people reject the use of these scores mainly due to concerns about individual focus, personal change, and fairness.

Unaffordable opinions among independents who lean toward either party have surged, with many expressing unfavorable views. For instance, the share of independents with very unfavorable opinions of the opposition party has more than quadrupled from 8% in 1994 to 37% in 2018 for Democratic leaners, and from 15% to 39% for Republican leaners [3]. Additionally, the line graphs show that the proportion of independents with unfavorable views of each party has increased over time, with many now holding strong negative opinions.  \n\nFurthermore, independents who do not lean toward any party tend to have more unfavorable opinions overall: 37% view both parties negatively, a significant rise from previous years [5]. The line charts also illustrate that negative perceptions among all independents have risen, especially the endorsement of unfavorable views, although the share viewing both parties negatively has declined somewhat lately [10].\n\nIn summary, across all political affiliations—partisans, leaners, and independents—there has been a clear upward trend in unfavorable views of both Republican and Democratic parties over time, with intense dislike becoming more common among all groups [1, 3, 8].\n\n![Partisans' increasing negative views over time](image4)"}

Over time, especially after Edward Snowden’s disclosures in 2013, concerns shifted notably. Since then, a larger proportion of Americans now believe that anti-terror policies do not go far enough to protect the country, rather than fearing they restrict civil liberties too much [3].\n\nLooking at specific data points, the percentage of Americans worried that policies haven't gone far enough to defend the nation increased steadily. For instance, the concern that the government’s anti-terrorism policies are insufficient grew among various groups, with Republicans showing a particularly pronounced shift: from 57% in January 2013 to 71% in recent surveys [2]. Overall, concern that policies restrict civil liberties has fallen dramatically, reaching its lowest level in five years at 28% in recent polls [8].\n\nThe visual data reinforce this trend:\n\n- **Image1** shows that concern about civil liberties being overly restricted is highest among older populations, with 71% of those 65+ worried about insufficient protection, while only 15% think restrictions have gone too far.\n- **Image3** illustrates that from 2004 to 2015, the share of people who believe the government has not gone far enough to protect the country increased gradually, with recent years showing a strong majority (56%) holding this view.\n- **Image4** highlights that, by 2015, 71% of Republicans and 54% of Democrats believe the government’s anti-terrorism policies do not go far enough, indicating a bipartisan shift towards greater concern for security.\n- **Image5** demonstrates that support for aggressive policies has increased across ideological groups, with 79% of Republicans and 62% of those concerned about Iran's nuclear program viewing assertive measures favorably by 2015.\n\nIn summary, public opinion from 2004 to 2015 shifted from a focus on military strength towards greater concern that anti-terror policies are insufficient, with an increased willingness to prioritize security over civil liberties.  \n\n**In brief:** Public opinion has become increasingly supportive of more aggressive anti-terror policies from 2004 to 2015, with a growing concern that existing measures do not do enough to protect the country."}

This number surged dramatically over the next two decades, reaching 8,267 in 1880 and peaking at 14,096 in 1890, as indicated by the census data [3]. This explosion correlates with the expansion of railroads, especially the completion of the Union Pacific Railroad in the late 1800s, which transformed Nebraska into a booming agricultural state and facilitated emigration and settlement [9]. \n\nDuring this period of rapid growth, rural school districts were established, reflecting the increasing population and community development [6]. However, after 1890, the population gradually declined, reducing to about 13,330 by 1900 and steadily decreasing through subsequent decades. This decline aligns with the consolidation of farms, declining number of farms, and the mechanization of agriculture, which led to fewer farmers and less rural population [4]. \n\nDespite the overall decline after 1890, some towns, including Aurora, have demonstrated recent population gains since 1940, diverging from the larger trend of rural decline [2]. By 2000, the population reached 9,403, indicating some stabilization or slow growth in certain areas. \n\nIn summary, Hamilton County's population increased rapidly in the late 19th century primarily due to railroad expansion and land policies like the Homestead Act, but faced decline in the 20th century as agriculture became more mechanized and farm consolidation reduced rural populations. However, towns like Aurora have experienced modest growth in recent decades, countering the overall rural decline trend."}

This disparity underscores the relatively low penetration of smartphones within the older adult group. The text confirms this, noting that only 11% of seniors owned a smartphone in April 2011 and that current adoption has risen modestly to just 18% [1][6].\n\nIn contrast, cell phone ownership among seniors is substantially higher, with 77% owning a cell phone compared to 91% of all adults, although this is still below the national average. Among the oldest seniors (80+), 61% own a cell phone, and a significant majority are equipped with basic devices, as per **text** and **image3**.\n\nWhen it comes to internet use, older adults are also less active online, with only 59% of seniors reporting they go online, compared to 86% of all adults, as depicted in **image2**.

Conversely, some Democrats (38%) see U.S. efforts as likely to make things worse, emphasizing skepticism about the effectiveness of U.S. policies. Independents tend to be more balanced, with 43% believing U.S. involvement helps and 50% thinking it may exacerbate issues [9].\n\nSupport for U.S. action extends to specific issues such as the fight against terrorism, where Republicans largely favor sending ground troops—66%, with 72% among conservative Republicans—while Democrats oppose such interventions, with 64% opposed [5]. Similarly, Republicans are more concerned about issues like immigration and terrorism, which they often cite as the most important problems, reflecting a more interventionist stance. Democrats, on the other hand, are more concerned with partisan gridlock and division within the country [9], and tend to view U.S. efforts more cautiously.\n\nVisual data further illustrate these perceptions: in the chart on Islamic extremism [4], Republicans consistently perceive a higher threat level (e.g., 67% believe it’s a major threat) compared to Democrats (around 44%), supporting a more aggressive approach to foreign intervention. The charts on approval ratings of government efforts and perceptions of threat reinforce that Republicans trust U.S. efforts more than Democrats do, who are more skeptical or divided in their views.\n\nIn summary, Republicans generally perceive U.S. involvement as positive and necessary to prevent worsening of global problems, supporting interventionist policies. Democrats tend to be more cautious or skeptical, emphasizing concerns about overreach and civil liberties, reflecting a preference for diplomatic or less aggressive approaches.\n\n**In brief:**\n- Republicans tend to view U.S. involvement as essential and effective, supporting interventionist policies.\n- Democrats are more skeptical, concerned about overreach and civil liberties, and often oppose military interventions.\n- Independents hold mixed views, with roughly equal support and opposition.\n\n---\n\n**Supporting visual:**\n\n![Islamic extremism in the U.S.](image2)  \n*Republicans view a higher threat from Islamic extremism, influencing their support for intervention.*"}

The results show that for **all eight language pairs with English as the source** (e.g., en-cs, en-de, en-fi, etc.), the **COMET-RANK (ref. only)** consistently outperforms the basic version in terms of correlation scores, emphasizing the advantage of referencing supplementary translation data.\n\nConversely, for **language pairs with English as the target** (shown in **Table 1**, via image4), the **COMET-RANK** with and without source inputs was also evaluated.

However, beyond about 10 samples, the gains plateau or become marginal, indicating diminishing returns. Similarly, in CTB, larger demonstration sets tend to improve Micro-F1, but the improvement rate slows after a certain number of samples.\n\n**With logical constraints:**  \nIncorporating logical constraints enhances performance even with fewer demonstration samples. As shown in image 4 (right), using logical constraints with only 1–5 demonstration samples can surpass the performance of using many more samples without constraints. The figures 6 and 10 (not shown here but described in the text) indicate that adding logical constraints stabilizes the performance and sometimes even reduces the number of samples needed for a given performance level.\n\n**Key observations:**  \n- Increasing demonstration samples generally raises Micro-F1 scores in both datasets, but the magnitude of improvement decreases with larger sample sizes.  \n- Using logical constraints boosts Micro-F1 scores significantly, especially when the number of demonstration samples is small—showing that logical constraints can compensate for fewer demonstrations.  \n- Beyond a certain number (about 5–10 samples), adding more demonstrations offers limited gains, particularly when logical constraints are employed.\n\n### Summary:\n| Dataset     | Without logical constraints                                   | With logical constraints                         |\n|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|\n| MAVEN-ERE  | Micro-F1 improves with more samples, plateauing after ~10 samples | Achieves higher Micro-F1 with fewer samples; benefits diminish after about 5–10 samples but still outperform baseline |\n| CTB         | Similar trend: gains from more samples, plateauing beyond ~10 | Larger gains with fewer samples; logical constraints reduce the need for extensive demonstrations |\n\n**In essence,** adding demonstration samples improves Micro-F1 scores, but the incremental benefits decrease as the number of samples increases.

The attention focuses on relevant parts of the input sequence to inform each step in the decoding process. \n\nIn contrast, the **multitask model** (Figure 1b) employs a shared encoder but has separate attentions and decoders for each task. This setup implies that during decoding, each decoder has its own attention mechanism that is independently focused on either the encoder outputs or other relevant representations, but not necessarily on the other decoder’s outputs.

Specifically, figure 5 (shown in image5) visualizes this effect: the top graph demonstrates the performance on FewNERD (NER), where the blue line represents the performance without LLM reranking, and the red line shows performance with LLM reranking across different confidence scores.\n\nThe graph indicates that, at higher confidence scores (above 0.75–0.8), the relative performance gain diminishes or even slightly degrades, meaning easy samples are less benefited, or may be slightly negatively affected by the reranking. Conversely, at lower confidence scores (around 0.15–0.55), the performance notably improves with LLM reranking, showing that the approach effectively enhances the extraction accuracy on difficult, low-confidence samples. The increase in micro-F1 for these harder samples suggests that LLM reranking successfully addresses challenging cases by utilizing complex reasoning capabilities.\n\n**In summary**, LLM reranking improves micro-F1 performance notably on low-confidence (hard) samples of the FewNERD dataset, while its impact on high-confidence (easy) samples is limited or slightly negative, leading to an overall performance boost primarily driven by enhancement on challenging instances."}

As the weight increases, the model tends to incorporate more response-related features, such as relevance or relatedness to the input, but this can also lead to more generic or less natural responses.\n\nIn the table for the input \"Yes, I'm studying law at the moment,\" different weights produce responses with varying degrees of similarity and informativeness:\n\n- At negative weights like -10.0, the response is \"I am a musician,\" which is unrelated to the input, indicating a decline in response relevance as negative weights push the model toward less response-related outputs.\n- At zero weight (0.0), the response \"I do, when I am not playing the piano\" maintains some relevance but remains generic.\n- Positive weights such as 5.0 produce responses like \"I do, usually at Starbucks,\" which are more contextually relevant but still somewhat generic.\n- Higher weights like 8.0 and 11.0 lead to responses that are increasingly diverse, with responses like \"Not usually, especially when you drink latte\" or \"Not often, usually with drinks, espresso, latte, tea, etc,\" which incorporate more specific and varied details but risk drifting away from the original context or producing less coherent responses if the weight becomes too high.\n\nThe graphs in Image 1 visualize this effect: increasing the response-relatedness weight shifts responses towards more relevant content, but overly high weights can lead to less natural or off-distribution outputs.

Specifically, the table shows that fine-tuned models consistently outperform their in-context learning counterparts across multiple datasets such as UCF101, Flower102, Food101, and OxfordPets. For example, the top-1 accuracy on the OxfordPets dataset improves from 79.3% with in-context learning (x) to 83.9% with fine-tuning ([6]).\n\nFurthermore, the interleaved quotes indicate that fine-tuning with datasets like FGVC-Aircraft enhances the model's ranking performance more reliably than in-context prompts, which are more flexible but less effective in boosting accuracy consistently.

Specifically, the blue line (DyGIE without relation propagation) declines more steeply as entity counts grow, indicating challenges in maintaining high performance with longer, more complex sentences. Conversely, the red line (DyGIE with relation propagation) maintains a higher F1 score across varying entity counts, emphasizing that relation propagation significantly mitigates the performance drop in sentences with multiple entities [4].\n\n**Image 2** highlights that relation propagation—by leveraging broader contextual information about potential relations—improves the accuracy of relation extraction, especially in complex sentences with many entities. As explained in the main text, relation propagation involves constructing a relation graph with scores computed via neural networks, enabling the model to better capture inter-entity relations across broader contexts [7]. The experimental results show that implementing relation propagation yields a substantial performance boost in sentences with more entities, reflecting its effectiveness in complex information scenarios [8].\n\n**Implications**:\n- **Handling complex sentences**: Relation propagation enhances the ability to extract relations accurately when multiple entities are involved, which is common in real-world texts.\n- **Model robustness**: Utilizing relation propagation helps maintain higher relation extraction scores in longer sentences, reducing the impact of sentence complexity on performance.\n- **Efficiency in multi-entity contexts**: Since relation propagation effectively manages the increasing complexity associated with multiple entities, it is a valuable strategy for improving extraction in diverse domains.\n\nIn summary, as the number of entities in a sentence increases, relation extraction performance tends to deteriorate, but relation propagation significantly alleviates this issue, leading to more reliable extraction in complex, multi-entity sentences.\n\n---\n\n**Interleaved Summary with Visuals:**\n\n**Text Explanation:**\n\nThe data shows that relation extraction performance decreases as entity count increases, as seen in **Image 2**.

The primary goal is to provide **more context information** step-by-step, often used in tasks that benefit from incremental detail.\n\n![Naive RAG process with iterative feedback](image 3)  \n*Image 3 shows how iterative routines use repeated querying and self-enhancement to improve relevance in RAG.*\n\n**Key features:**  \n- Involves multiple rounds of retrieval (`Retrieve`) and generation (`Prompt`)  \n- Emphasizes **incremental improvement** in context through feedback loops\n\n---\n\n**Recursive Retrieval**  \nThis method decomposes complex problems into easier sub-tasks, breaking down data hierarchically. According to [1] and the second flowchart (image 4, middle), **recursive retrieval** performs layered indexing and layered data processing, often combining hierarchical indices like summaries or sub-documents. The core idea is **breaking down problems or data progressively**, then further refining at each level, which makes it suitable for **multi-hop or complex structured data**, especially when deep understanding is required.\n\n![Recursive retrieval framework](image 4, middle)  \n*The diagram illustrates how recursive retrieval involves query transformation or decomposition, then re-retrieving at a finer level.*\n\n**Key features:**  \n- Handles **hierarchical or structured data**  \n- Includes **multi-stage retrievals within nested documents or graphs**  \n- Aims for **deep and multi-level understanding**\n\n---\n\n**Adaptive Retrieval**  \nThis approach dynamically determines **when** and **what** to retrieve based on ongoing context and model judgment, instead of following a fixed pattern. As shown in the overview (images 4, right), the process involves **real-time decision-making** on retrieval actions, guided by the current context, desired precision, or complexity. Adaptive retrieval maximizes **efficiency and relevance** by controlling retrieval operations according to the specific scenario, often integrating **learning or optimization mechanisms** (e.g., FLARE or Self-RAG).\n\n![Adaptive RAG with decision-based retrieval](image 4)  \n*The modular RAG framework emphasizes real-time judgment and module orchestration, facilitating adaptive control.*\n\n**Key features:**  \n- Uses **model-driven decision-making** to trigger retrieval  \n- Evaluates **scenarios/scenario-specific needs**  \n- Balances **retrieval cost and relevance** for optimized results\n\n---\n\n**Summary of Differences:**  \n| Feature | Iterative | Recursive | Adaptive |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Main Approach** | Repeated cycling of query refinement | Hierarchical, layered data processing | Scenario-aware, decision-based retrieval |\n| **Workflow** | Multiple loops of retrieval and generation | Hierarchical decomposition and re-retrieval | Dynamic, on-demand retrieval controlled by model judgment |\n| **Usage Focus** | Improving relevance through incremental feedback | Deep understanding of complex or structured data | Efficiency, relevance, resource management in retrieval |\n\n---\n\n**In conclusion:**  \n- **Iterative retrieval** refines the query repeatedly, enhancing context step-by-step.  \n- **Recursive retrieval** decomposes complex data hierarchically, working progressively through layers to deliver detailed understanding.  \n- **Adaptive retrieval** makes on-the-fly decisions about when and what to retrieve, optimizing relevance and resource use according to the scenario.\n\nThis distinction enables RAG systems to be tailored for various complexities and efficiency requirements: iterative for incremental refinement, recursive for deep hierarchical data, and adaptive for scenario-dependent retrieval control."}

However, re-training the model on these adversarial distractors substantially improves performance on adversarial data, raising F1 scores from 46.84 to 60.10 [4].  \nAdditionally, when models are trained with entity type filtering on adversarial distractors, they experience a notable decrease in accuracy (from 67.08 to 40.73 F1), but performance can be recovered through re-training, increasing F1 to 58.42 [5].  \nThis suggests that while adversarial training initially challenges the model, it ultimately enhances its robustness and ability to handle more difficult, adversarially selected examples with further training.  \nIn summary, adversarial training initially hampers performance but ultimately promotes model robustness when combined with re-training, leading to improved performance on challenging adversarial data.\n\n---\n\n### Visual Summary\n![Impact of adversarial training on model performance, showing initial decline and subsequent recovery after re-training](image4)"}

However, the difficulty increases in open-domain questions where retrieval of relevant gold paragraphs is challenging, which lowers the F1 scores—e.g., from 67.08 to 46.84 when tested with adversarial distractors [4]. \n\nImages further contextualize these findings. For instance, image5 summarizes F1 scores across different settings: distractor-based evaluation yields 67.08 F1, which drops to about 39.12 F1 when large distractor sets are used in open-domain scenarios, indicating the difficulty of accurate paragraph retrieval without gold paragraphs. When gold paragraphs are added, the F1 score increases considerably, e.g., to 53.12 (see image5), demonstrating that providing the correct evidence boosts model performance.\n\nThis pattern suggests that distractors and the presence or absence of gold paragraphs critically influence the model’s accuracy. Effective retrieval of relevant paragraphs, especially in multi-hop contexts, is essential for high performance. Poor retrieval (common with large distractor sets) hampers the model's ability to correctly answer, highlighting the need for improved retrieval methods. Thus, models generally perform better when gold paragraphs are available and correctly identified, emphasizing the importance of retrieval quality and distractor filtering in multi-hop QA systems.\n\n---\n\n**In summary:**  \nThe inclusion of gold paragraphs improves F1 scores substantially, while distractors—especially challenging adversarial ones—decrease performance.

Specifically, [2] notes that phrase nuances such as \"not really good\" versus \"really not good\" show different sentiment orientations and that CNN and LSTM can leverage this order information, whereas SWEM cannot. This is reinforced by the empirical results shown in the second image (image2), which demonstrates that shuffling words in training data leads to a notable decrease in performance for sentiment datasets like Yelp Polarity, emphasizing the importance of word order for sentiment analysis.\n\nAdditionally, the experiments in image5 illustrate that models incorporating word order, such as CNN and LSTM, tend to outperform simpler pooling strategies, especially in sentiment-oriented tasks like MR, SST, and Subj, where the nuances of negation and phrase structure are crucial.\n\nIn summary, word-order information significantly enhances the accuracy of sentiment analysis models like LSTM, because capturing the precise sequence of words helps distinguish subtle sentiment differences.

However, analysis reveals that this high score largely derives from exploiting spurious statistical cues in the dataset [1][4][10]. When the dataset is transformed adversarially by mirroring cues—adding negated data points with inverted labels—the models are forced to rely on actual argument comprehension rather than superficial cues. As a result, BERT’s maximum performance drops to approximately 53%, with the mean around 50% [3][5], demonstrating that the previous high performance was inflated by cue exploitation.\n\nFurthermore, the results for other models like BoV and BiLSTM, while initially similar, also decline under the adversarial setup, with Table 4 indicating overall performance around 50-52% on the adversarial test set, similar to BERT [5][8].\n\nThe comparative performance before the transformation shows BERT substantially outperforming simpler models, often by a margin of about 10-15% [2][10]. After applying the adversarial transformation, all models—including BERT—perform close to chance, revealing that they were previously leveraging the dataset’s artifacts rather than genuine argument understanding [1][3][5][9].\n\nIn summary, the adversarial transformation strips away the spurious cues, causing BERT's performance to plummet from near-human levels to nearly random chance, aligning it with other models’ limits and exposing the true challenge of argument comprehension.\n\n---\n\n**In conclusion:** The adversarial transformation exposes that BERT's apparent high performance was primarily due to exploiting dataset artifacts, and when these are removed, its performance declines to levels comparable with simpler models, indicating a reliance on superficial cues rather than genuine understanding."}

Tasks often require applying concepts such as Fourier Transform or Equilibrium Theory, meaning they test more profound cognitive and domain-specific comprehension [4][6].  \n- It involves problems that demand step-by-step reasoning, deep understanding of heterogenous visual data, and recall of specialized subject knowledge, thus providing a rigorous measure of high-level multimodal understanding.\n\n**Implications for Evaluation**:  \n- The combined emphasis on breadth (multi-discipline, diverse modalities) and depth (expert-level, complex reasoning) makes MMMU an essential benchmark for evaluating the true capability of large multimodal models. It pushes models to demonstrate not just perceptual accuracy but also a deep, interconnected understanding across disciplines and modalities—crucial for real-world applications requiring nuanced reasoning.  \n- As observed in the text [8], even state-of-the-art models like GPT-4V show room for improvement on MMMU’s challenging tasks, indicating the benchmark’s importance in guiding future model development toward more sophisticated multimodal reasoning.\n\n---\n\n**Summary Table of Comparison**:\n\n| Aspect                  | Other Benchmarks                         | MMMU                                              |\n|-------------------------|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|\n| Breadth                 | Focused on daily knowledge, limited formats | Multi-disciplinary, 30 image formats, 183 subfields |\n| Depth                   | Basic perception, simple reasoning        | Expert-level, nuanced, step-by-step reasoning    |\n| Evaluation Challenge    | Usually perceptual or simple reasoning    | Deep understanding, domain-specific reasoning   |\n\n**In conclusion**, MMMU's extensive coverage and emphasis on complex, expert-level understanding make it a critical tool to assess and guide the development of truly multimodal intelligent systems capable of sophisticated reasoning across diverse knowledge areas."}

The results show a consistent improvement when reference translations are used. Specifically, in Table 2, the \"COMET-RANK\" scores are higher than the \"reference-only\" variant for the language pairs with English as a target (e.g., en-cs, en-de, en-fi, en-tr), indicating better correlation with human judgments when references are included [5].\n\nThe visual evidence in images 2 and 3 further supports this:\n\n- **Image 2** shows the numerical scores for COMET-RANKs with and without references on various language pairs. For example, in **en-cs**, the reference-based COMET-RANK achieves a score of **0.711** compared to **0.664** for the reference-only version, showing a notable improvement.\n- **Image 3** plots the Kendall’s Tau correlations for top models, where we see that the inclusion of reference translations consistently improves the correlation across all models and language pairs.\n\nThe **most significant improvement** is observed in the **en-cs (English to Czech)** language pair, where the score increases from **0.664** (reference-only) to **0.711** (with reference), and the correlation measure (tau) improves notably, suggesting that using reference translations greatly enhances the metric's effectiveness for this language pair.\n\n**In summary:**\n\n- Including reference translations improves COMET-RANK's performance at capturing human judgment across various language pairs.\n- The **en-cs (English to Czech)** pair exhibits the most significant improvement, both in raw scores and correlation metrics, demonstrating that references are particularly beneficial for this pair."}

For non-categorical slots, which are characterized by values like duration or stay length that can be located directly within the dialogue text, DS-DST uses a span matching approach. This involves a two-way linear mapping to identify start and end text spans in the dialogue from the context [3], [6].\n\nFor categorical slots, such as \"hotel type\" or \"parking,\" which have limited predefined options (picklists), DS-DST selects the most plausible candidate value based on the contextual representation of the slot [3]. The model's strong interaction mechanisms between dialog context and domain-slot pairs enable it to effectively match the relevant slot value, whether it is directly extractable from the dialogue or chosen from a set of candidates.\n\nFurthermore, DS-DST incorporates a slot gate to decide whether to handle a slot as categorical or non-categorical, providing the flexibility to adapt based on the slot's nature and available information [6].\n\nIn summary, DS-DST matches candidate values by either:\n- Extracting span-based values directly from dialogue text for non-categorical slots, using span matching mechanisms.\n- Selecting the most plausible candidate from a predefined list for categorical slots, guided by the encoded contextual representation.\n\nThis integrated, interaction-focused approach allows DS-DST to robustly match slot values with the dialogue context."}

Specifically, Microsoft relies on a higher proportion of renewables and a lower share of coal compared to Amazon-AWS. This shift toward cleaner energy sources suggests that Microsoft is more effective in reducing its carbon footprint associated with its energy consumption.\n\nGiven that coal is a highly carbon-intensive energy source, the higher coal usage at Amazon-AWS indicates potentially greater CO₂ emissions per unit of energy consumed than Microsoft. Conversely, Microsoft's larger share of renewable energy, which produces little to no CO₂ during generation, likely results in lower overall emissions.\n\nThis difference has significant environmental implications: Microsoft’s energy profile implies a smaller CO₂ footprint for its cloud services compared to Amazon-AWS, assuming similar energy consumption levels. Despite both relying on a mix of energy sources, the greater use of renewables by Microsoft suggests it has a preferable environmental impact in terms of greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n**In summary,**:\n- **Microsoft** uses a higher proportion of renewable energy (32%) and less coal (10%), implying lower CO₂ emissions.\n- **Amazon-AWS** relies more on coal (26%) with less renewable energy (17%), likely resulting in higher CO₂ emissions.\n\nThese differences highlight the importance of transitioning to renewable energy sources to minimize environmental impact and drive down greenhouse gas emissions in cloud computing operations."}

This layer helps the model understand smaller linguistic units within words, which is particularly valuable for handling out-of-vocabulary words, misspellings, or morphological variants.\n\nIn addition, [5] explains that the representation of each word is formed by concatenating its character-based representation with its word embedding, providing a richer, more robust input. Character-level embeddings are especially useful for capturing morphological nuances and dealing with rare or unseen words, whereas word embeddings contain broader semantic information learned from large corpora.\n\nVisual evidence from [5] and [2] further supports this integration: the character-level embeddings help the model recognize patterns within words, and the word embeddings contribute context-sensitive semantic features. This combination improves the model’s ability to generalize across different contexts, languages, and linguistic variations, leading to better performance in tasks like NER across languages.\n\n**In summary**, the use of both word-level and character-level embeddings enables the model to utilize semantic context and morphological details simultaneously, providing a more comprehensive understanding of language inputs.\n\n---\n\n**Interleaved Summary with Images:**\n\n- As shown in [1], the hierarchical model integrates character-level neural networks to capture subword features, crucial for morphological variations.  \n- The process illustrated in [5] demonstrates that the character embeddings are concatenated with word embeddings, resulting in a detailed representation for each word.  \n- The visualization in [2] highlights how character-level features help distinguish words, especially in multilingual settings, by capturing morphological and orthographic patterns.  \n- Together, this combination boosts the model's robustness, especially for handling out-of-vocabulary words and capturing nuanced language features.\n\n**Final answer:**  \nThe model uses both word-level and character-level embeddings to combine semantic context with morphological details, thereby improving its ability to handle out-of-vocabulary words, morphological variations, and language-specific nuances effectively."}

This helps the system emphasize the relevant parts of the image, making feature extraction more precise [4].\n- **Resizing**: The cropped regions are resized to a fixed proportion, standardizing input sizes and ensuring consistent feature representation, which improves the robustness of the embeddings used for retrieval and recognition.\n- **Blurring**: Non-target areas surrounding the objects are blurred, directing the model’s attention toward the main objects and reducing distractions, thereby facilitating more accurate feature extraction for recognition tasks [4].\n\nIn the context of the overall system, these pre-processing steps directly support the creation of high-quality image embeddings that are crucial for the retrieval process. Properly processed images yield more accurate similar image retrievals, which, when fed into the multi-modal large language model (MLLM), improve the ranking and final classification accuracy in zero-shot scenarios.\n\nSo, the pre-processing ensures that only relevant, well-focused object features are used for matching, thus significantly contributing to the effectiveness of the zero-shot recognition system.\n\n---\n\n### Visual Summary:\n![Pre-processing steps including cropping, resizing, and blurring help focus the model on relevant objects, improving retrieval and recognition accuracy in the zero-shot system](image2)"}

The emphasis is on collecting, organizing, and summarizing data to answer factual questions like \"what\" and \"how often,\" with little emphasis on causality or prediction [10].\n\nTransitioning to BA involves a shift to prescriptive and predictive analysis—answering \"why\" and \"what next\"—as shown in diagrams illustrating analytical processes like forecasting, modeling, and optimization [3, 5, 6]. This shift advances data handling by:\n\n- Moving from basic data collection and report generation to sophisticated statistical analysis, modeling, and hypothesis testing [9, 10].\n- Integrating interactive, exploratory tools that enable querying and deep-diving into data for actionable insights [3, 4, 5].\n- Embedding analytics into decision-making processes, fostering a data-driven culture with implications like action-oriented insights and predictive capabilities [1, 2, 10].\n\nIn essence, the figures highlight that BA’s focus on advanced analytics—like forecasting and simulation—enables organizations to anticipate future trends, understand causes, and prescribe optimal actions.

According to Mendel’s principles, each parent contributes one allele for flower color, leading to the F1 generation, where all plants exhibit the purple flower phenotype because the dominant allele masks the presence of the recessive one [5].\n\nWhen F1 hybrids are self-crossed, the alleles segregate during gamete formation, producing a variety of combinations in the F2 generation. Mendel’s Punnett square and principles show that the genotypic ratio in the F2 generation is approximately 1:2:1 (homozygous dominant : heterozygous : homozygous recessive), while the phenotypic ratio, due to the dominance of purple flowers over white, is approximately 3:1 (purple : white) [5], [10].\n\nThe diagrams illustrate this process: the inheritance of gene alleles and the segregation of alleles during gamete formation result in these ratios. The phenotypic ratio reflects the expression of dominant and recessive traits, while the genotypic ratio describes the underlying genetic combinations [5], [10].\n\n**Conclusion:** Mendelian inheritance explains these ratios by the principles of dominant and recessive alleles segregating independently during gamete formation, which leads to predictable ratios in the offspring.\n\n![Explanation of ratios through inheritance](image5)"}

The first hot dog provides a +10 utility, the second adds +4, the third no additional utility (0), and subsequent hot dogs decrease in utility, with the fifth and sixth hot dogs actually resulting in negative utility (-4 and -10). This reflects the concept of **diminishing marginal utility**: as consumption increases, the additional satisfaction gained from each new hot dog diminishes.\n\nSimilarly, **image5** visually summarizes this diminishing benefit, demonstrating that the **marginal utility lessens with each extra hot dog** consumed, which aligns with standard economic theory that utility increases at a decreasing rate.\n\nThis pattern of decreasing marginal utility implies that beyond a certain point, consuming more hot dogs can actually **reduce overall utility**, leading people to **stop** or **limit their consumption**. This behavior is driven by the recognition that the additional satisfaction no longer outweighs any negative feelings like discomfort or fullness that come with overeating.\n\nThe broader implication drawn from the quotes and images is that **consumption behavior is influenced by the marginal utility**; individuals tend to **consume to the point where the additional utility equals zero** — the point of indifference — after which further consumption decreases overall satisfaction. **Diminishing marginal utility** is a core reason why consumers **stop consuming** once utility gains diminish, highlighting a natural balancing act in decision-making about how much to consume.\n\nIn conclusion, **utility increases with each additional hot dog but at a decreasing rate**, eventually turning negative, which **guides consumers to limit their intake** to maximize their overall satisfaction and avoid the negative utility associated with overconsumption."}

This is evident in the diagrams and images, such as Image 1 and Image 3, where homologous chromosomes are depicted separating and forming haploid cells. The process includes stages like Prophase I (pairing homologs), Metaphase I (alignment at the metaphase plate), Anaphase I (homologs separate), and Telophase I (cytokinesis) resulting in two haploid cells, each with one chromosome of each homologous pair.\n  \n- **Cell division**: The division is reductional, decreasing the chromosome number from diploid to haploid, as shown in the images and diagrams where homologous pairs are separated.\n\n**Meiosis II**:\n- **Chromosome separation**: Sister chromatids separate during Anaphase II. The images (e.g., Image 4 and Image 5) depict sister chromatids moving apart without further reduction in chromosome number, as these are identical copies. This phase resembles mitosis in terms of chromosome segregation.\n  \n- **Cell division**: The division is equational, maintaining the haploid chromosome number, and results in four haploid daughter cells. As shown in the diagrams, the sister chromatids of each chromosome are pulled apart during Anaphase II, completing the process.\n\nIn summary, **Meiosis I** separates homologous chromosomes to reduce the chromosome number, while **Meiosis II** separates sister chromatids, resulting in four genetically diverse haploid cells.

According to the chart in image1, it started at about 5.2% in 1960 and rose steadily over the decades, reaching approximately 16% in 2007. This indicates a continuous upward trend in healthcare expenditure relative to the country's economic output over this period.\n\nConnecting this trend to the major events depicted in the Space Race timeline (image4), there is a notable expansion of national resources and technological investments during the 1960s and beyond. The Space Race was characterized by intensive government spending on space exploration, culminating in the first moon landing in 1969 when the U.S. allocated substantial funds toward NASA and aerospace technology. This surge in government expenditure on scientific advancement and technological innovation likely contributed to overall economic growth and increased healthcare spending, both through direct investment and by fostering technological innovations that eventually found their way into healthcare (e.g., medical technologies, data management).\n\nIn summary, the rise in healthcare spending as a percentage of GDP from 1960 to 2007 correlates with the heightened national investments in science and technology during the Space Race era. Both trends reflect a period of substantial resource allocation toward technological development that impacted multiple sectors, including healthcare.\n\n**In brief:** Healthcare spending grew markedly from 1960 to 2007, a trend that aligns with the extensive governmental investment in space exploration and technological innovation during the Space Race."}

[1]\n- **AF-C (Continuous)** is suited for **moving subjects** as it maintains focus on the subject in motion. [1]\n- **MF (Manual)** allows manual focus adjustment, useful for specific scenarios requiring precise control, such as macro or low light situations. [1]\n\n#### Scenario Enhancement:\n- Use **AF-S** when capturing still landscapes or portraits to ensure sharp focus.\n- Use **AF-C** for sports or wildlife photography involving moving subjects to keep them in focus.\n- Use **MF** for critical focus control when autofocus is unreliable, such as in macro photography.\n\n### Metering Modes:\nFrom the images and quotes:\n- **Matrix Metering** measures light across the entire frame, ideal for **landscape photography** to capture a balanced exposure of the whole scene. [3]\n- **Center Metering** focuses on the light near the center, best for **portraits** where the central subject is more important. [3]\n- **Spot Metering** targets a specific area for exposure, useful for **high-contrast scenes** or when highlighting specific details like a person's eyes. [3]\n\n#### Scenario Enhancement:\n- Use **Matrix** for capturing scenic landscapes with even exposure.\n- Use **Center** for portraits to make sure the subject is perfectly lit.\n- Use **Spot** to emphasize a particular part of the scene, such as a bright background or a small object.\n\n### Summary:\nBy adjusting focus modes and metering modes in Pro Mode:\n- Photographers can tailor the focus and exposure measurement to suit different scenarios, resulting in sharper images and correctly exposed scenes.\n- For dynamic scenes like sports, **AF-C** with **Spot** or **Center** metering ensures the focus tracks the subject and exposure highlights the subject effectively.\n- For landscapes, **AF-S** with **Matrix** metering provides a sharp, well-exposed wide scene.\n\n![Focus and Metering Modes](image2)  \n*The camera interface allows quick switching and fine-tuning of focus and exposure settings, aligning with the scenario-specific needs.*\n\n**In conclusion:**  \nDifferent focus modes and metering modes in Pro Mode allow photographers to adapt their camera settings to various scenarios, enhancing image sharpness, exposure accuracy, and overall photo quality under diverse conditions."}
