According to the text and image quotes:\n\n- **Republican Voters**: In 2008, Republican voters were more open to working with the Democratic Party, with 59% favoring cooperation with Obama. However, by 2016, this sentiment had reversed, with a partisan divide larger than in 2008. Republican voters now overwhelmingly prefer a conservative direction, with 60% wanting the GOP to move in a more conservative direction compared to 36% who favor moderation (image1 and text [9]). This shift is evident in the increasing dissatisfaction with the party's leadership, as shown in image2, where a higher percentage of Republican voters gave the party a failing grade in 2016 compared to previous elections.\n\n- **Democratic Voters**: Conversely, Democratic voters have become more divided over the party's future direction. In 2008, a majority favored a moderate stance, but by 2016, 49% wanted the party to move more liberal, up from 38% in 2012 (text [4] and [11]). This shift is highlighted in image3, which shows a significant increase in the percentage of Democratic voters giving the party a failing grade, indicating growing dissatisfaction with the party's direction.\n\n- **Overall Sentiment**: The text and images also show that both parties received lower grades in 2016 compared to past campaigns, with both parties receiving failing grades from a higher percentage of their own voters (text [2]). This reflects a broader disillusionment with the political process and party leadership.\n\nIn summary, Republican voters have become more conservative and less willing to cooperate with the Democratic Party, while Democratic voters have become more liberal and internally divided, indicating a polarization that has intensified over the eight-year period.\n\n![Partisan divide increased in 2016 compared to 2008](image1)  \n![Republican voters increasingly favor conservative direction](image2)  \n![Democratic voters increasingly favor liberal direction](image3)  \n\n**Answer**: Republican voters have become more conservative and less willing to cooperate with the Democratic Party, while Democratic voters have become more liberal and internally divided, indicating a polarization that has intensified from 2008 to 2016."}

According to the text quotes, about two-thirds of Republicans (68%) believe Islam is more likely to encourage violence, a figure that has remained relatively stable since 2014 but is the highest since 2002. In contrast, Democrats have seen a decline in this belief, from 42% in September 2014 to 30% currently, indicating a narrowing partisan divide on this issue [1].

Additionally, **discrimination in recruitment, hiring, and promotions** is cited as a major reason by 72% of black STEM workers, compared to only 27% of whites and 28% of Asians. \n\nThe survey also highlights that **lack of encouragement to pursue STEM subjects from an early age** is another major factor, with 39% of women and 33% of blacks and Hispanics citing this as a reason. Furthermore, **lack of role models** in STEM fields is noted, with 24% of women and 27% of blacks and Hispanics indicating this as a barrier. \n\nThe data further shows that **perceived lack of ability to succeed** in STEM fields is another reason, with 33% of women and 18% of blacks and Hispanics believing this to be a significant factor. The Pew Research Center's findings underscore a range of challenges, from educational access and encouragement to discrimination and role models, contributing to the underrepresentation of these groups in STEM jobs.\n\n![Major reasons for underrepresentation in STEM jobs](image5)\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe major reasons for the underrepresentation of women, blacks, and Hispanics in STEM jobs include limited access to quality education, discrimination in recruitment and hiring, lack of encouragement from an early age, lack of role models, and perceived lack of ability to succeed in these fields. These factors collectively contribute to the persistent disparities observed in STEM workforce demographics."}

According to the text quotes, Europe has seen a continuous improvement in funding for early-stage companies, which aligns with the data in image4 and image6. Image4 shows that in Europe, the median investment for Seed stage increased from around €2M in 2004 to €10M in 2009, while the U.S. saw a more modest increase from $16.1M to $38.8M. For the First stage, Europe's median investment rose from €2M to €6M, whereas the U.S. increased from $5.5M to $30.4M. The Second stage in Europe saw a rise from €4M to €8M, and the U.S. from $44M to $100M. The Later stage in Europe also saw growth, from €2M to €10M, while the U.S. increased from $79M to $100M.

They express a high level of confidence in Trump's ability to handle these issues, with 70% having a great deal of confidence in his economic management and 58% in his approach to health care. This suggests that Trump voters are more focused on tangible policy changes and are confident in his ability to implement them. The image quotes show that 58% of Trump voters are willing to give him a chance to see how he governs, indicating a willingness to support his policies if they align with their expectations.\n\n- **Clinton Voters**: Clinton voters are more divided, with health care (12%) and unifying the country (8%) as the top priorities. They are less confident in Trump's ability to address these issues, with only 47% expressing a great deal of confidence in his foreign policy and 58% in his approach to illegal immigration. The image quotes reveal that 39% of Clinton voters cannot see themselves giving Trump a chance due to his personal qualities, highlighting skepticism about his leadership style and policies.\n\nThe data in image1 shows that 58% of Trump voters are willing to give him a chance to see how he governs, compared to 39% of Clinton voters.

This uncertainty among Clinton voters may contribute to their skepticism about his leadership.\n\nIn summary, Trump voters are more confident and focused on specific policy changes, while Clinton voters are more skeptical and concerned about his leadership style and goals. This divergence in priorities and confidence levels suggests that Trump voters are more aligned with his policies, whereas Clinton voters are more critical and uncertain about his ability to lead effectively.\n\n![Confidence in Trump's leadership](image1) ![Trump voters' confidence vs. Clinton voters](image4)"}

Overall, 73% of all voters say they are surprised that Trump won the election, including 87% of Clinton voters. A somewhat smaller 60% majority of Trump voters express surprise at the outcome, though 40% say they are not surprised he won.\n- **[10]** For Clinton voters, “shocked” is the most frequent response, followed by “disappointed” and “disgusted.” Other Clinton voters noted their surprise or disbelief about Trump’s victory.\n- **[8]** Voters pessimistic on how Trump will impact race relations. Nearly half of voters (46%) say Trump’s election will lead to worse race relations, while only about half as many (25%) expect race relations to improve; 26% say his election won’t make a difference. Among Clinton voters, 84% expect race relations to worsen under Trump. Among Trump supporters, half expect improvement, while 38% say his election won’t make a difference.\n- **[9]** Voters express a mix of emotional reactions to the election of Donald Trump. On the positive side, 51% say that Trump’s election makes them feel hopeful; somewhat fewer say it makes them feel proud (36%). Many voters say they feel ‘uneasy’ about the election of Trump.\n- **[7]** When voters are asked to summarize their feelings about Trump’s victory in a word, the unexpected nature of the result is reflected. Among Trump supporters, “happy” is mentioned most often, while many point to their surprise or shock at the election.\n- **[5]** The press had the right amount of influence on the election, while 13% say it had too little influence. About six-in-ten Trump voters (62%) say the press had too much influence, as do 50% of Clinton voters.\n- **[6]** Half of voters say they are happy Donald Trump was elected president, while about as many (48%) say that they are unhappy. Reactions are similar to 2012 (when 52% said they were happy Obama was reelected), but they are less positive than after Obama’s first presidential campaign in 2008, when 58% said they were happy he was elected.\n- **[4"}

Republicans are notably more critical of China's actions, with a higher percentage believing that the Chinese government's initial handling of the coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan contributed to the global spread of the virus. According to the data, 73% of Republicans think China's early handling of the pandemic contributed a great deal to its spread, compared to 38% of Democrats. This partisan divide is evident in the percentage of those who think China has done a bad job in its response, with 82% of Republicans having a very unfavorable view, compared to 54% of Democrats. Older Americans, too, are more critical, with 73% of those aged 50 and older finding fault in China's response.\n\nOver time, these negative perceptions have intensified. The chart in image2 shows that the percentage of Americans who believe the Chinese government's initial handling of the Wuhan outbreak is to blame for the global spread of the virus has increased.

According to the text and image quotes, roughly six-in-ten Germans aged 18 to 29 believe that U.S. military bases do not contribute to German national security, while 61% of those aged 65 and older see them as important [10]. This generational divide highlights a potential shift in attitudes as younger Germans may prioritize different security concerns or have differing views on international alliances. \n\nIn the U.S., political affiliations play a crucial role in determining the importance of foreign policy partners, including the perception of the U.S. military presence in Germany. The text and image quotes indicate that Republicans and Republican-leaning independents view the U.S. military bases in Germany as much more important to U.S. security than Germans do, with 85% of Americans believing these bases are important, and nearly six-in-ten seeing them as very important [8]. In contrast, Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents are more likely to see Germany as a top foreign policy partner, with both sides ranking Germany fifth on the list of most or second-most important foreign policy partners [9]. \n\nThe partisan divide in the U.S. is further illustrated by the data in image1, which shows that Republicans are more inclined to view Israel as a key partner than Democrats, while Democrats emphasize Canada and Mexico. However, both parties agree on Germany's importance, albeit with Republicans showing a slight preference.

For instance, 58% of those aged 50 and older favor this, compared to 39% of those under 50 ([7]). This trend is consistent across various demographic groups, with older individuals expressing more concern about China-related issues ([5]).\n- **Political Affiliation**: Republicans are significantly more likely to support limiting Chinese students compared to Democrats.

According to the text and images provided:\n\n- **Financial Optimism**: Latinos have become increasingly optimistic about their personal finances and the future of their children's financial prospects. In 2008, only 31% of Latinos expected their family finances to improve, but this figure rose to 81% by 2015. This optimism is evident in the general public as well, but Latinos outpaced the general population in their optimism, growing by 14 percentage points compared to a 6-point increase for the general public ([1], [2], [4], [11]). The text also highlights that 72% of Latino adults expect their children to be better off financially than they are, a view shared by 70% of U.S.-born and 75% of immigrant adults ([3], [11]).\n\n- **Unemployment Trends**: The unemployment rate for Latinos has improved since the Great Recession, declining from 12.8% in 2010 to 6.4% in 2015, though it remains higher than the 5% low achieved in 2006 and is still above the 4.8% rate for non-Hispanic workers in 2015 ([6], [7]). However, the text notes that the unemployment rate for Latinos remains higher than that of non-Hispanic workers in 2015 ([6]).\n\n- **Economic Indicators**: Despite the rise in optimism, economic indicators like median household income and net worth have stagnated or declined. Median household income for Hispanics was $42,491 in 2014, unchanged since the Great Recession, and the poverty rate was 23.6%, slightly below the peak of 26.5% in 2010 but still above pre-recession levels ([5]).

However, it remains above its low of 5% in the fourth quarter of 2006 and is higher than that for non-Hispanic workers in the fourth quarter of 2015 [8]. This indicates that while there has been improvement, Hispanics still face higher unemployment rates compared to non-Hispanic workers.\n- **Non-Hispanic Population:** The unemployment rate for non-Hispanic workers has also improved since the Great Recession, but the data does not specify the exact figures. The focus is on the fact that the Hispanic unemployment rate remains higher than that of non-Hispanic workers [8].\n\n**Economic Perceptions:**\n- **Hispanic Population:** Despite higher unemployment rates, Hispanics remain optimistic about their economic conditions.

In contrast, the general U.S. poverty rate was also above pre-recession levels, but the gap between Hispanics and the general population remained significant.\n\n**Wealth:** Image5 indicates that Hispanic households had the largest percentage decline in net worth through 2009, with a net worth of $13,700 in 2013, compared to $23,600 for all households. Unlike white households, Hispanic net worth continued to fall post-recession, underscoring a persistent wealth disparity.\n\n**Optimism:** Despite these challenges, Hispanics remained more optimistic about economic conditions than the general public, with 35% rating current conditions as good or excellent in 2015, compared to 25% for whites, as noted in image11.\n\nIn summary, while Hispanics showed some improvement in unemployment and optimism, they faced persistent challenges in income, poverty, and wealth compared to all U.S. households.\n\n![Hispanic vs. non-Hispanic unemployment rates](image4)  \n![Hispanic vs. general public income and poverty rates](image5)  \n![Hispanic vs"}

According to the text and images provided, Latino adults reported a substantial increase in positive views of their personal finances, with 40% rating their financial situation as \"excellent\" or \"good\" in 2015, up from 23% in 2008. This improvement was consistent across most Latino demographic subgroups, including U.S.-born and foreign-born Latinos, as well as across different age groups and educational levels. For instance, ratings of personal finances rose by 17 percentage points among U.S.-born Hispanics and by 18 points among those born in another country. Positive views of economic well-being also increased by double digits among Latino men and women, and among those with less than a high school education, high school graduates, and those who had attended college. \n\nThe data also show that perceptions of family income relative to the cost of living were relatively stable for Latinos, with about half (53%) saying their family income was not keeping up with the cost of living in 2015, similar to the views of whites and blacks. However, there was a notable increase in positive perceptions of economic well-being among Latinos compared to the U.S. population as a whole, where the share of those with a positive view of their finances remained flat during the same period. \n\n**Image1** illustrates that in 2015, 53% of Latinos felt their family income was not keeping up with the cost of living, compared to 49% of whites and 51% of blacks. **Image2** highlights that a majority of Latinos (72%) felt better off financially in 2015, compared to 51% of the general population. **Image3** shows that Latino perceptions of their financial situation were more positive in 2015 than in 2008, with an increase of 14 percentage points, compared to a 6-point increase for the general population. \n\nOverall, the data indicate that while perceptions of family income relative to the cost of living remained relatively unchanged, Latino groups experienced a significant improvement in their personal financial outlook over this period.\n\n![Latino perceptions of family income relative to cost of living in 2015 compared to 2014](image1)  \n![Latino financial well-being in 2015]("}

Workers with higher levels of education, particularly those with college degrees, tend to view these technologies more positively. For instance, they are more likely to find that technologies like word processing or spreadsheet software, smartphones, and email or social media have made their work more interesting and provided opportunities for career advancement. This is evident in the data, where 64% of college graduates find technology more interesting compared to 38% of those with high school diplomas or less ([2][5][10][12]). College graduates are also more likely to see increased career advancement opportunities due to technology, with 53% reporting this compared to 32% of those with lower educational attainment ([2][7]).\n\nThe differences in perception are substantial across various technologies. For example, 90% of college graduates view word processing or spreadsheet software positively, compared to 45% of those with high school diplomas or less ([12]). Similarly, 76% of college graduates find smartphones beneficial, while only 54% of those with lower education levels do so ([12]). These disparities suggest that higher education equips individuals with the skills and understanding to leverage technology effectively, leading to more positive outcomes in their careers.\n\nRegarding the future of driverless car technology, the public anticipates widespread adoption. A majority of Americans, 94%, are aware of efforts to develop driverless vehicles, and two-thirds expect most vehicles to be driverless within the next half-century, with 9% predicting this will happen within the next 10 years ([8]). This indicates a high level of awareness and optimism about the future integration of driverless cars into daily life.\n\n![image1](image1) illustrates the timeline for the anticipated adoption of driverless cars, with the majority expecting it within 50 to 100 years.

Workers with higher educational attainment tend to have more positive views of these technologies, while those with lower education levels often view them more negatively. This trend is evident in several aspects:\n\n1. **Impact on Career**: Workers with college degrees are more likely to see positive impacts from technologies such as word processing or spreadsheet software (90% vs. 45%), smartphones (76% vs. 54%), and email or social media (72% vs. 58%). This is illustrated in **image5**, which shows a significant gap in positive perceptions between college graduates and those with high school diplomas or less. In contrast, the impact of industrial robots is perceived more negatively by those with lower education levels (19% vs. 7%).\n\n2. **Career Advancement**: College graduates are more likely to believe that technology has increased their opportunities for career advancement (53% vs. 46%), as shown in **image1**. **Image3** further highlights this with 46% of college graduates seeing increased opportunities compared to 13% of those with high school diplomas or less.\n\n3. **Career Interest**: **Image8** indicates that college graduates find their work more interesting (53%) than those with high school diplomas or less (12%). This suggests that higher education levels are associated with a more positive perception of job satisfaction.\n\n4. **Adoption of Driverless Cars**: A substantial majority of Americans (94%) are aware of the development of driverless vehicles, with two-thirds expecting most vehicles to be driverless within the next half-century. **Image4** shows that 56% expect this within 10 to less than 50 years, indicating a high level of anticipation for the widespread adoption of driverless cars.\n\nIn summary, higher education levels are associated with more positive perceptions of workforce technologies and greater expectations for the adoption of driverless cars, while lower education levels are more skeptical and have less optimistic views.\n\n![College graduates have more positive views on technology impact]()\n\n![Driverless cars expected to be widespread in 10-50 years]()\n\n![Mixed views on technology impact by education level]()\n\n![Perception of work interest by education level]()"}

However, they are also more likely to feel lonely, with 15% of those aged 18 to 29 frequently feeling this way, compared to just 4% of those aged 50 and older [6]. In contrast, older adults experience a more balanced mix of emotions, with similar percentages feeling amused (30%) and angry (24%) [6]. \n\nThe types of content that users frequently see on social media vary by age group. Posts that are overly dramatic or exaggerated are seen frequently by 58% of users, and people making accusations or starting arguments without having all the facts are seen by 59% [12].

Men are more likely to encounter and perceive bullying and deceptive behaviors on social media compared to women. Specifically, 29% of men report frequently seeing bullying content, while only 19% of women do so. Conversely, women are slightly more likely to see supportive and kind behavior, with 56% reporting an equal mix of both, compared to 52% of men. When it comes to correcting misinformation, men are around twice as likely as women to see deceptive behavior (24% vs. 13%), but majorities of both genders (58% of men and 67% of women) see an equal mix of deceptive and corrective actions.\n\nThese perceptions are closely tied to the frequency of encountering dramatic or exaggerated posts. A significant majority of users, 58% and 59% respectively, frequently see posts that are overly dramatic or exaggerated. This type of content may contribute to a more polarized online environment, where users are more likely to encounter extreme or misleading information, which in turn influences their perceptions of other behaviors such as bullying and deception. The prevalence of such posts could amplify negative interactions and reinforce biases, leading to a higher likelihood of men perceiving more bullying and deception compared to women.\n\n![Men more likely to see bullying and deception](image4)  \n![Frequent dramatic posts](image2)\n\n### Conclusion:\nMen are more likely than women to encounter and perceive bullying and deceptive behaviors on social media, which correlates with the high frequency of dramatic or exaggerated posts that users frequently see. This environment may contribute to a perception of more negative interactions, influencing how users view other online behaviors."}

According to text [6], men are somewhat more likely than women to see people being bullying or deceptive on social media. Image 4 supports this, showing that 29% of men compared to 19% of women report seeing mean or bullying behavior more often.\n\n2. **Supportive Content:**\n   - Women are slightly more likely than men to see supportive content. Text [3] indicates that women are more likely to see kind or supportive behavior, with 56% of women saying they typically see an equal mix compared to 52% of men. Image 4 also reflects this, with 24% of women seeing supportive behavior more often than men's 17%.\n\n3. **Equal Mix of Behaviors:**\n   - Both men and women see an equal mix of supportive and bullying behavior, with 54% of men and 56% of women reporting this. Image 4 shows that 52% of men and 56% of women see an equal mix of both.\n\n4. **Acceptability of Data Use:**\n   - Men and women have different views on the acceptability of social media data use. Text [2] and image 3 show that men are more accepting of data use for targeted ads from political campaigns (11% vs. 7% for women). However, both groups are more accepting of data use for recommending events in their area (25% for men, 25% for women).\n\n5. **Emotional Responses:**\n   - Emotional responses vary by age and gender.

According to the text and images provided:\n\n- **Effectiveness vs. Fairness**: For most systems, there is a notable gap between perceived effectiveness and fairness. For instance, the personal finance score algorithm is viewed as effective by 54% of the public but only as fair by 32% [1, 9]. This discrepancy suggests that while the system may be seen as useful, it is not trusted to be unbiased or equitable [2, 4, 8]. The video job interview analysis and automated resume screening also show a similar pattern, with effectiveness ratings slightly higher than fairness ratings [8, 9].\n\n- **Public Trust**: The text highlights that a majority of Americans find these systems unacceptable, with 68% deeming the personal finance score algorithm unacceptable [2]. This lack of acceptance is partly due to concerns about fairness, human element removal, and inability to capture nuance [7]. The data in image2 supports this, showing that the personal finance score is the least acceptable system, with 68% finding it unacceptable [2].\n\n- **Demographic Variations**: Image3 reveals that racial and ethnic minorities are more likely to find the personal finance score fair compared to whites, but they express more concern about parole scoring algorithms [10]. This indicates that trust in these systems may vary based on the context and the group affected.\n\n- **Bias Concerns**: Image4 shows that a significant portion of the public believes these systems will always reflect human bias, with 58% agreeing [6]. This skepticism is reflected in the low fairness ratings, as people worry about bias and unfairness [7].\n\n- **Contextual Trust**: Image8 illustrates that while the personal finance score is seen as effective, it is not perceived as fair, indicating a lack of trust in its fairness. This context dependence is noted in the text, where similar systems can be viewed differently based on their application [6, 8].\n\nThese differences imply that while some systems may be seen as useful tools, their perceived lack of fairness and the presence of bias concerns lead to low public trust. This suggests that for these systems to gain acceptance, addressing fairness and transparency issues is crucial.\n\n![Public acceptance of automated systems](image2)  \n![Perceptions of fairness and effectiveness](image8)\n\nThe public's skepticism about fairness and effectiveness, particularly for the personal finance"}

According to the text quotes, **64% of Republicans** are very or somewhat confident in Trump's ability to make good appointments to the federal courts, while only **12% of Democrats** share this confidence. This stark contrast highlights a partisan divide in perceptions of Trump's judicial appointments.\n\n![image3](image3) illustrates this disparity, showing that Republicans are much more confident in Trump's judicial appointments than Democrats. The image breaks down the confidence levels into \"Very,\" \"Somewhat,\" and \"Not at all\" categories, with Republicans having a much higher percentage in the \"Very\" and \"Somewhat\" categories compared to Democrats.\n\nThis confidence in judicial appointments is part of a broader pattern of partisan differences in confidence in Trump's handling of various tasks. For instance, Republicans are also more confident in Trump's ability to negotiate favorable trade agreements with other countries, with **67%** being very or somewhat confident, compared to only **16%** of Democrats.

According to the text and image quotes:\n\n- **Photo Identification Requirement**: Black and Hispanic Democrats are more supportive of requiring government-issued photo identification to vote compared to White Democrats. For instance, 72% of Hispanic Democrats and 65% of Black Democrats favor this requirement, compared to 54% of White Democrats [7]. This trend is consistent with the data in image1, which shows that Black and Hispanic adults are more supportive of this policy than White adults.\n\n- **Early or Absentee Voting**: Black adults are more likely than White, Hispanic, and Asian adults to favor 'no excuse' early or absentee voting [10]. Image8 illustrates this with Black adults having a higher support rate (85%) for early or absentee voting compared to White adults (35%).\n\n- **Automatic Voter Registration**: White Republicans are less supportive than Hispanic Republicans of policies like automatic voter registration. For example, 51% of Hispanic Republicans favor automatic registration, compared to 35% of White Republicans [2]. Image1 also highlights this disparity, showing higher support among Hispanic adults for automatic voter registration.\n\n- **Felony Voting**: Black adults are more supportive of allowing people convicted of felonies to vote after serving their sentences, with 85% in favor, compared to about 70% of White, Hispanic, and Asian adults [8]. Image3 supports this, showing higher support among Black adults for this policy.\n\n- **Election Day Holiday**: White adults are less likely to support making Election Day a national holiday compared to Black, Hispanic, and Asian adults [11]. Image1 shows that Black and Hispanic adults have higher support for this policy.\n\nThe data in image2 and image3 further illustrate these trends, showing that Black and Hispanic adults generally have higher support for policies like automatic voter registration and allowing felons to vote, while White adults tend to have lower support. Image4 provides a broader view, showing consistent patterns across different voting policies where Black and Hispanic adults are more supportive of easier voting policies compared to White adults.\n\nIn summary, racial and ethnic differences play a crucial role in shaping attitudes toward voting policies, with Black and Hispanic adults often showing greater support for policies aimed at expanding voting access, while White adults tend to be more conservative in their views.\n\n![Support for voting policies by race and ethnicity](image1)  \n![Support for voting policies by race and ethnicity](image"}

Men and women in STEM jobs have similar views on the importance of higher pay and opportunities for promotion, but there are notable differences in other aspects. According to text quote [11], men and women in STEM jobs generally value having the flexibility to balance work and family needs, but men place a higher emphasis on higher pay and opportunities for promotion. Women, on the other hand, are more inclined to consider jobs that focus on helping others as important, with 59% of women valuing this compared to 31% of men (text quote [11]).\n\nImage 4 provides a visual representation of these perceptions, showing that 71% of respondents believe STEM jobs offer higher pay, and 58% think they attract more of the brightest and most qualified young people. However, when it comes to balancing work and family needs, only 18% believe STEM jobs have more flexibility, while 52% say it is about the same as other sectors, and 28% believe there is less flexibility (text quote [7]). This aligns with the findings in image 5, which shows that men and women in STEM jobs value having flexibility to balance work and family needs, with 71% of men and 76% of women agreeing, but men value having opportunities for promotion more than women (text quote [11]).\n\nImage 5 further highlights these differences, indicating that men in STEM jobs value having opportunities for promotion more than women (57% vs. 46%), and having a high-paying job (59% vs. 48%). Conversely, women in STEM jobs value having a job that others respect and value more than men (50% vs. 43%), and making a meaningful contribution to society more than men (60% vs. 51%). This suggests that while both men and women recognize the financial and professional benefits of STEM jobs, women place a greater emphasis on social impact and work-life balance.\n\nIn summary, while both men and women see STEM jobs as offering higher pay and attracting top talent, women are more likely to prioritize job characteristics that align with helping others and achieving a better work-life balance, whereas men tend to focus on career advancement and financial rewards.\n\n![Men and women in STEM jobs value about the same having flexibility to balance work/family needs ("}

According to the text and images, these factors vary across generations:\n\n- **Generational Differences:** As seen in image2, the percentage of self-identified Hispanics decreases with each generation. For example, 70% of foreign-born Hispanics identify as Hispanic, compared to 26% of third or higher generation Hispanics. This trend is further emphasized in image7, where the percentage of self-identified Hispanics who consider themselves typical Americans increases from 70% in the foreign-born group to 26% in the third or higher generation group.\n\n- **Cultural and Linguistic Factors:** Image1 shows that a significant portion of self-identified Hispanics do not speak Spanish or have a Spanish last name. For instance, 92% of third or higher generation Hispanics do not speak Spanish, and 92% do not have a Spanish last name. This suggests that as generations distance themselves from their immigrant roots, cultural ties weaken, affecting self-identification.\n\n- **Personal Identity and Appearance:** Image3 lists reasons for not identifying as Hispanic, such as mixed backgrounds, lack of contact"}

According to the text and image quotes:\n\n- **Attending Cultural Celebrations:**\n  - **Self-Identified Hispanics:** Among self-identified Hispanics, the likelihood of attending cultural celebrations declines across generations. Foreign-born Hispanics have the highest participation at 85%, followed by second-generation at 68%, and third or higher generations at 26% [image2]. This suggests that those with more recent immigrant backgrounds are more likely to engage in cultural activities.\n  - **Non-Hispanics with Hispanic Ancestry:** Among non-Hispanics with Hispanic ancestry, only 10% report attending cultural celebrations often, with 90% saying it never happened [image2]. This indicates a significant cultural disconnection compared to self-identified Hispanics.\n\n- **Parental Pride Discussions:**\n  - **Self-Identified Hispanics:** Immigrant and second-generation self-identified Hispanics are most likely to report parents discussing pride in their country of origin (57% and 50%, respectively) [text3]. However, this drops to 33% by the third generation [text3].\n  - **Non-Hispanics with Hispanic Ancestry:** Among non-Hispanics, only 9% report such discussions, with 60% saying it never happened [text6]. This highlights a lack of cultural reinforcement from parents.\n\n- **Language and Cultural Encouragement:**\n  - **Self-Identified Hispanics:** The text notes that language use, particularly Spanish, fades quickly across generations [text7]. This is supported by image4, which shows a decline in Spanish speakers from 85% in the foreign-born to 26% in the third or higher generation.\n  - **Non-Hispanics with Hispanic Ancestry:** Non-Hispanics with Hispanic ancestry show a similar decline in language use, with only 10% speaking Spanish often [image4].\n\n- **Implications:**\n  - The text and images together suggest that the distance from immigrant roots and the fading of cultural practices contribute to a weakening of Hispanic identity across generations.

This suggests that Non-GCC countries may face economic challenges that disproportionately affect their youth, such as higher inflation or less subsidized living costs. In contrast, GCC countries might have more stable economies or subsidized living costs, reducing the urgency of this issue.\n\n#### Conclusion:\nThe higher concern about rising costs of living in Non-GCC countries compared to GCC countries highlights economic disparities and priorities. Non-GCC countries may need to address inflation and cost-of-living issues more urgently, whereas GCC countries might focus on other challenges like civil unrest or lack of democracy, as shown in image6.\n\n![GCC vs Non-GCC Concerns](image1) ![Unemployment Concerns](image2)\n\nThe levels of concern about rising costs of living are higher in Non-GCC countries (55%) compared to GCC countries (39%), while unemployment is equally concerning in both regions (38% each).

According to the data, Mountain View's ridership grew from 3,670 in 2012 to 4,274 in 2014, a 16% increase, while Palo Alto's ridership surged from 4,461 to 6,156, a 38% increase. This growth is substantial and indicates a strong demand for transit services in these areas.\n\nThe current capacity issues on trains, as depicted in image2, show that trains are often overcrowded, with many trains operating at over 100% of their seated capacity during peak hours. This overcrowding is a direct result of the high ridership growth, as seen in the text quote [4]. The text quote [10] emphasizes the need to double Caltrain ridership from 60,000 to 120,000 daily trips by the next decade, which underscores the pressure on existing infrastructure.\n\nImage6 provides a detailed breakdown of train loadings, showing that many trains are operating at high percentages of their capacity, with some exceeding 150% during peak seasons. This data aligns with the text quote [3], which mentions the challenges of frequent service leading to stress at intersections and the need for more frequent service. The text quote [8] also points out the underlying trends driving rider ship growth, including the rapid growth in Mountain View and Palo Alto, which are key areas contributing to the increased demand.\n\nThe text quote [6] discusses strategies to accommodate more people with less cars, traffic, and parking demand, suggesting that the current capacity issues are a significant challenge that needs to be addressed to meet the growing demand. The text quote [7] mentions funding sources like bridge tolls and State Cap and Trade funds, indicating that financial resources are being directed towards infrastructure improvements to support this growth.\n\nIn summary, the increase in weekday ridership growth in Mountain View and Palo Alto is directly related to the current capacity issues on trains, as the growing demand exceeds the current infrastructure's ability to handle it, leading to overcrowding and operational challenges.\n\n![Capacity Issues](image2) ![Train Loadings](image6)\n\nThe increase in weekday ridership growth in Mountain View and Palo Alto, driven by rapid population and job growth, has led to overcrow"}

According to text quote [12], the transportation sector is a major contributor to CO2 emissions, accounting for 30% in industrialized nations and 20% globally. This underscores the importance of vehicle standards and usage patterns in determining environmental impact.\n\n**Image Response:**\n\n- **image1** shows that the USA has the largest bubble, indicating the highest CO2 emissions from energy use, including transportation. This is consistent with its high per capita consumption and motor vehicle ownership.\n- **image3** illustrates that the USA has a high percentage share in global motor vehicle demand, reflecting its extensive use of vehicles.\n- **image4** maps CO2 emissions globally, with the USA having a significant presence, indicating high emissions levels.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe USA, with high motor vehicle ownership and significant CO2 emissions per capita, contributes substantially to global emissions.

According to the text quotes, European VC has achieved higher exit multiples globally, with a median multiple of cash invested of 7.2 compared to 4.5 in the USA [4, 6, 9, 10]. This indicates that European venture-backed companies have generated higher returns on investment relative to the amount of capital invested. Additionally, the median exit valuation for Europe is $173M, with 57.26% of exits having a multiple of cash invested of 5 or more, compared to $236M in the USA with 47.27% [4, 10]. \n\nThe image quotes further illustrate this comparison. Image 4 shows that European exits have a higher median multiple of cash invested (7.2) than the USA (4.5), and a higher percentage of exits with multiples of cash invested of 5 or more (57.26% vs. 47.27%) [4]. Image 8 also highlights that European exits have a higher percentage of exits with multiples greater than 10x (59%) compared to the USA (36%) [8]. \n\nIn summary, despite lower average exit values, European VC has managed to achieve higher capital efficiency and better performance in terms of exit multiples and the proportion of successful exits, making it a more attractive investment environment in recent years.\n\n![Higher exit multiples in Europe](image4)  \n![Higher percentage of exits with multiples in Europe](image8)"}

This is evident from the evidence provided in the text and images:\n\n- **Text Evidence**:\n  - [2] Label coverage & diversity. Most active querying strategies have selection bias towards specific classes, thus the class coverage in their selections might be poor (see Table 2), particularly at low budgets. By simply enforcing label diversity to these querying strategies can significantly improve the performance (see Table 1), which suggests that the label diversity is one of the causes that existing active querying strategies perform poorer than random selection.\n  - [3] Table 7: Diversity is a significant add-on to most querying strategies. AUC scores of different querying strategies are compared on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-10-LT. In the low budget regime (e.g., 10% and 20% of the entire dataset), active querying strategies benefit from enforcing the label diversity of the selected data. The cells are highlighted in blue when adding diversity performs no worse than the original querying strategies. Some results are missing (marked as “-”) because the querying strategy fails to sample at least one data point for each class.\n  - [5] Our proposed active querying strategy is capable of covering the majority of classes in most low budget scenarios by integrating K-means clustering and contrastive features, including the tail classes (e.g., femur-left, basophil). Compared to the existing active querying criteria, we achieve the best class coverage of selected query among at all budgets presented in Table 2.\n\n- **Image Evidence**:\n  - **Image 3** shows a bar chart comparing different querying strategies across various datasets (OrganAMNIST, BloodMNIST, etc.). The Random strategy consistently has the lowest performance across all classes, indicating poor label diversity.\n  - **Image 4** presents a table comparing AUC scores across different datasets and sampling ratios. The Random strategy often has lower AUC scores, especially in low budget scenarios, which correlates with poorer label diversity.\n\nThe Random strategy lacks the ability to select data from minority classes effectively, leading to poor label diversity. This is further supported by the consistent underperformance of Random in both the bar charts and AUC score tables across different datasets.\n\n![Random strategy yields the worst label diversity]()\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe **Random** querying strategy generally yields the worst label diversity across all datasets, as it fails to effectively sample minority classes and results in poor class coverage"}

The process involves several key steps:\n\n1. **User Input Encoding**: The user's utterance is first encoded using a bidirectional LSTM (Bi-LSTM) utterance encoder. This encoder converts the user's natural language input into a continuous vector representation. The user utterance vector is generated by concatenating the last forward and backward LSTM states, as described in [2].\n\n2. **Dialogue State Tracking**: The encoded user utterance is combined with the encoding of the previous system action to serve as input to a dialogue-level LSTM. This LSTM maintains a continuous representation of the dialogue state, as mentioned in [3]. The dialogue state tracker updates its estimation of the user's goals, represented by a list of slot-value pairs, and maintains a probability distribution over candidate values for each goal slot type, as stated in [10].\n\n3. **Policy Network**: The dialogue state, along with the log probabilities of candidate values from the belief tracker and other relevant inputs, is fed into the policy network. The policy network, a deep neural network, selects the next system action based on the current dialogue state and the estimated user's goal, as detailed in [12].\n\n4. **Query Command and Knowledge Base Interaction**: The system action, which is a dialogue act, is used to formulate a query command. This command is then issued to a knowledge base (KB) to retrieve requested information. The system uses a template-based natural language generator (NLG) to produce the final response, replacing delexicalized tokens with values from either the estimated user goal or the KB entities, as explained in [6].\n\n5. **Natural Language Generation**: The NLG component generates the final natural language response by combining the state tracker outputs and the retrieved KB entities, as described in [6].\n\nThe overall architecture, as shown in image1, integrates these components to form an end-to-end task-oriented dialogue model. The system components are neural networks that take continuous outputs from each other, allowing the entire system to be trained end-to-end, as noted in [4].\n\n![System Architecture](image1)\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe system generates a response by encoding the user's input, tracking the dialogue state, selecting an appropriate system action using a policy network, querying a knowledge base, and finally generating a natural language response using an NLG template.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion**: The system generates a response by encoding the user's"}

It stands out from existing datasets in several key ways, as highlighted in the text and visual evidence provided.\n\n#### Text Evidence:\n- **Categories and Entities**: The SnapNTell dataset encompasses a diverse range of 22 categories, totaling 7,568 unique entities. This is a significant increase compared to other datasets like ViQuAE and Encyclopedic VQA, which have fewer categories and entities ([5], [10]). The dataset includes fine-grained entities, such as specific landmarks, paintings, sculptures, and various animals, which are represented by 10 illustrative images each ([5], [10]).\n- **Knowledge-Intensive Responses**: Unlike traditional VQA datasets that often use simplistic yes/no questions, SnapNTell emphasizes knowledge-intensive responses. The questions require detailed, entity-specific knowledge, as shown in the example where the answer provides information about the Mendenhall Glacier's current status ([1], [4]).\n- **Anonymity**: The dataset is highly anonymous, meaning questions do not directly reference the entity names, which adds complexity to the task ([9], [10]).\n\n#### Image Evidence:\n- **Comparison with Other Datasets**: Image 1 visually compares SnapNTell with other VQA datasets like VQA v2, GQA, and OK-VQA. The SnapNTell example includes a detailed answer about a glacier, demonstrating the depth of knowledge required ([1], [4]).\n- **Dataset Features**: Image 5 provides a summary of the SnapNTell dataset, showing 22 categories and 7,568 unique entities, with 10 images per entity, highlighting its extensive coverage and granularity ([5], [10]).\n- **Performance Metrics**: Image 3 and Image 4 show performance metrics where SnapNTell outperforms other methods, indicating its effectiveness in evaluating models' ability to handle complex, entity-specific queries ([3], [4]).\n\n#### Answer Construction:\nThe SnapNTell dataset significantly advances VQA by offering a wide array of fine-grained categories and entities, requiring models to provide detailed, knowledge-intensive responses.

According to the results in **Table 1** [7], the model \"CLSTM+WLSTM+CRF\" achieves an F1-value of **91.35** for NER, which is the highest among the listed models. This model combines the strengths of both LSTM and CRF, leveraging LSTM for capturing long-range dependencies and CRF for structured prediction, which is particularly effective for sequence labeling tasks like NER.\n\nThe features contributing to this high performance include:\n- **WLSTM (Word-Level LSTM)**: Captures global features from the word sequence, which helps in understanding the context and improving the model's ability to identify entities.\n- **CRF (Conditional Random Fields)**: Provides structured prediction by considering the context of neighboring labels, which is crucial for resolving ambiguity in sequence labeling tasks.\n\nAdditionally, the use of **character-level features** (as seen in models like \"Nochar+WCNN+CRF\" and \"CLSTM+WCNN+CRF\") also contributes to performance, but the combination of WLSTM and CRF in the model \"CLSTM+WLSTM+CRF\" yields the best results.\n\n![image3](image3) shows the comparison of different models on NER, chunking, and POS tasks, where \"CLSTM+WLSTM+CRF\" outperforms others in NER with an F1-value of 91.35.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe model \"CLSTM+WLSTM+CRF\" achieves the highest F1-value for NER, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining LSTM and CRF with character-level features.\n\n---\n\n**References:**\n- [7] Table 1 shows the results of six CRF-based models with different character sequence and word sequence representations on three benchmarks.

According to the text quotes, GPT2-XL and GPT-J were tested on four datasets: SST-2, TREC, AGNews, and EmoC. The text anchor method, which utilizes label words as anchors, showed improved performance over other methods in terms of label loyalty and word loyalty, as seen in **image2**. For instance, on the SST-2 dataset, the GPT2-XL model achieved a label loyalty of 100.00 and word loyalty of 100.00, while the GPT-J model had label loyalty of 100.00 and word loyalty of 100.00, indicating perfect performance in these metrics. However, the accuracy was lower, with GPT2-XL achieving 51.90% and GPT-J achieving 56.82%.\n\nThe confusion matrices in **image5** and **image8** provide insights into the classification accuracies and errors. The confusion matrices show the similarity between different categories, with values close to 1 indicating high similarity. For example, in **image5**, the confusion between 'Abbreviation' and 'Entity' is 0.9, suggesting that these categories are often confused by the model. Similarly, in **image8**, the confusion between 'Entity' and 'Person' is 0.95, indicating a high likelihood of misclassification between these categories. This suggests that the models struggle with distinguishing between categories that have similar label anchors, which aligns with the hypothesis that label words serve as anchors in in-context learning.\n\n**Image2** highlights that the anchor re-weighting method significantly improves performance, achieving the highest accuracy of 89.06% for GPT-J on the SST-2 dataset. This method reduces confusion by better utilizing label words, as evidenced by the improved performance metrics. The confusion matrices in **image5** and **image8** further support this by showing reduced confusion between similar categories when using the anchor re-weighting method.\n\nIn summary, while both models perform well on certain datasets, the GPT-J model generally shows better performance across the board, especially with the anchor re-weighting method.

The left graph indicates that performance improves with more demonstrations but plateaus after 5, while the right graph shows that logical constraints reduce inconsistency, especially in MAVEN-ERE.\n\n#### Answer Construction:\nThe use of logical constraints and demonstration samples significantly impacts the performance of models on the MAVEN-ERE and Causal-TimeBank datasets. According to the text and image evidence, increasing the number of demonstrations initially leads to noticeable performance improvements, but these gains diminish after a certain point (typically around 5 demonstrations). Incorporating logical constraints, however, provides stable and sometimes superior performance, even with fewer demonstrations. For instance, the performance of models with 5 demonstrations and logical constraints on MAVEN-ERE (25.7%) outperforms those with 10 demonstrations without constraints (24.5%). This suggests that logical constraints are more effective than additional demonstrations in improving model performance, especially for the MAVEN-ERE dataset. Image1 visually supports this by showing that logical constraints reduce inconsistency, particularly in MAVEN-ERE, while the performance improvement from more demonstrations is limited.\n\n![Logical Constraints and Demonstration Impact](image1)\n\n#### Conclusion:\nThe use of logical constraints enhances model performance on the MAVEN-ERE"}

For instance, Llama2-13B with logical constraints achieves a Micro-F1 of 19.5%, which is higher than its post-processing counterpart (12.0%) and without logical constraints (17.0%). Similarly, Vicuna-13B shows a significant improvement from 15.2% (post-processing) to 15.7% (logical constraints).\n- **Causal-TimeBank Dataset:** The improvement is also evident. Llama2-13B with logical constraints scores 10.0%, surpassing its post-processing score of 9.5%. Vicuna-13B shows a similar trend, with logical constraints improving from 11.0% to 15.7%.\n\n**Post-Processing:**\n- **MAVEN-ERE Dataset:** Post-processing alone does not yield significant improvements. For example, Llama2-13B with post-processing has a Micro-F1 of 12.0%, which is lower than its logical constraints score of 19.5%.\n- **Causal-TimeBank Dataset:** Post-processing also does not show substantial gains, as seen with Llama2-13B, where it results in a Micro-F1 of 9.5%, lower than the logical constraints score of 10.0%.\n\n**Graphical Evidence:**\n- **Figure 6 (image6):** This graph shows that incorporating logical constraints leads to a more stable improvement in performance across different numbers of demonstrations. The performance with logical constraints is consistently higher than with post-processing, indicating that logical constraints are more effective in reducing logical inconsistency.\n- **Figure 2 (image1):** The table in image1 confirms that logical constraints directly improve performance on both MAVEN-ERE and Causal-TimeBank datasets, while post-processing does not significantly alter the results.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nLogical constraints are more effective than post-processing in reducing logical inconsistency across different LLM models on the MAVEN-ERE and Causal-TimeBank datasets.

The `image1` shows that the collapsed tree approach consistently outperforms tree traversal, with higher F1 scores across various context lengths. This is because the collapsed tree method evaluates nodes collectively across all layers, allowing it to retrieve information at the correct level of granularity for a given question. In contrast, tree traversal searches layer-by-layer, maintaining a constant ratio of higher-order thematic information to granular details, which may not align with the question's detail level.\n\nRAPTOR's performance with various models is compared in metrics like ROUGE, BLEU, and METEOR in Table 3 (`image3`) and Table 4 (`image5`).

The performance is consistently higher when RAPTOR is integrated with advanced language models such as GPT-3, GPT-4, and UnifiedQA. For instance, in the QASPER dataset, RAPTOR achieves F-1 scores of 53.1%, 55.7%, and 36.6% with GPT-3, GPT-4, and UnifiedQA, respectively, outperforming BM25 and DPR by significant margins. This is evident from Table 3 [6], which shows RAPTOR's F-1 scores are at least 1.8%, 5.3%, and 10.2% higher than BM25 and DPR across these models.\n\nWhen paired with UnifiedQA, RAPTOR not only surpasses retrieval methods like BM25 and DPR but also sets a new state-of-the-art in the METEOR metric on the Narrative QA dataset, as shown in Table 6 [10]. The performance improvement is attributed to RAPTOR's hierarchical tree structure, which allows it to synthesize information across various sections of the retrieval corpora, providing a more comprehensive context for query responses.\n\nThe impact of context length on the tree traversal and collapsed tree methods is illustrated in image4 [4]. The graph shows that the collapsed tree method generally outperforms tree traversal as the context length increases, with F1 scores peaking at around 2000 tokens. This suggests that the collapsed tree approach is more effective in leveraging the hierarchical structure to retrieve relevant information, especially as the context length increases.\n\nIn summary, RAPTOR's performance is significantly enhanced by its multi-layered structure, which allows it to capture a range of information from general themes to specific details. This is particularly beneficial for tasks requiring synthesizing information within NLP papers, as seen in the QASPER dataset.

As outlined in the text and illustrated in **image5**, the system employs a two-step pre-processing approach for object detection datasets:\n\n1. **Cropping and Blurring**: The system first crops the image regions based on proposal bounding box coordinates. This step isolates the objects of interest from the rest of the image, which is crucial because objects in detection datasets often vary in size and position. The cropped regions are then resized to a fixed proportion to ensure uniformity in input size. Additionally, the system applies blurring to the non-target areas surrounding the objects. This blurring technique directs the model's focus toward the relevant objects, making it easier to identify them within the image.\n\n2. **Image-to-Text Retrieval**: Unlike classification tasks, where CLIP's image-to-image retrieval is used, the detection task leverages CLIP's image-to-text capabilities. This approach is more effective for detecting objects that are smaller and more variably positioned within the image. By converting the cropped regions into text descriptions, the system can better handle the diversity of object sizes and positions.\n\nThe ranking process, as depicted in **image4**, involves retrieving the top-k class names from the multimodal retriever and using the MLLM to rank these candidates. The MLLM assesses the contextual appropriateness of each class name with the input image, ensuring that the final prediction is both accurate and contextually relevant. This method significantly improves the model's performance on object detection tasks by narrowing down the possibilities and enhancing the model's focus on the most relevant objects.\n\n**Evidence Selection**:\n- Text [5]: Describes the pre-processing steps for object detection datasets, including cropping, blurring, and the use of image-to-text retrieval.\n- Image [5]: Illustrates the ranking process and the use of MLLM to refine the retrieved results.\n\n**Conclusion**:\nThe multimodal retriever system processes detection datasets by cropping and blurring regions of interest, converting them into text for retrieval, and then using the MLLM to rank the retrieved class names, thereby improving the model's ability to detect objects accurately.\n\n![{Multimodal retriever and ranking process for object detection}](image5)"}

Specifically, SPECTER achieves the highest average performance of 80.0 across all metrics, outperforming SciBERT (79.9) and other baselines like Doc2vec, Fasttext-sum, SIF, ELMo, Citeomatic, and SGC. This is particularly notable in tasks such as citation prediction, where SPECTER scores 96.2, significantly higher than SciBERT's 92.5, and in user activity prediction, where it scores 91.5 compared to SciBERT's 84.1.\n\n**Image1** provides a comprehensive comparison of various models on different tasks, showing that SPECTER consistently outperforms others. For instance, in the \"Citation prediction\" task, SPECTER achieves the highest MAP and nDCG scores, indicating its effectiveness in predicting citations. In the \"User activity prediction\" task, SPECTER also leads with MAP and nDCG scores, demonstrating its robustness in predicting user interactions.\n\n**Image5** highlights the impact of including additional metadata such as venue and author on SPECTER's performance. Adding venues slightly improves performance, especially in the \"Citation prediction\" task, where the inclusion of venues results in an average score of 84.5, compared to 84.2 without venues. However, adding authors negatively affects performance, with an average score of 67.3, which is lower than the 80.0 average without any additional metadata. This suggests that while venues can provide useful context, authors may introduce noise due to their sparsity and potential suboptimal tokenization, as discussed in the text quotes.\n\nThe ablation study in **image5** further supports these findings, showing that removing the abstract and relying solely on the title decreases performance, indicating the importance of comprehensive input data. The inclusion of hard negatives in the training objective, as shown in **image5**, also significantly boosts performance, underscoring the importance of effective negative sampling strategies.\n\nIn summary, SPECTER's performance is enhanced by leveraging citation-based training and inter-document context, while additional metadata like venues can be beneficial, and authors can introduce challenges due to their sparse nature and tokenization issues.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe SPECTER model outperforms other models across various document-level tasks"}

According to the text and image quotes:\n\n- **Joint Accuracy**: DS-Picklist generally outperforms DS-DST in joint accuracy, especially in the MultiWOZ 2.0 setting, as it leverages a full ontology and treats all slots as categorical. However, DS-DST performs more robustly in the cleaner MultiWOZ 2.1 setting, demonstrating its effectiveness in noisy environments. The text [2] and [6] highlight these differences, noting that DS-Picklist achieves state-of-the-art results in noisy settings, while DS-DST is more robust in cleaner settings.\n\n- **Slot Accuracy**: The slot-level accuracy varies significantly across different slot types. For slots like `hotel-type`, `attraction-type`, `attraction-name`, `hotel-internet`, and `hotel-parking`, DS-DST shows significant improvements over DS-Span, as these slots often have values that are not easily extracted from dialog context and are better handled by categorical approaches. Image2 provides a detailed comparison, showing DS-DST's higher accuracy for these slots. The text [3] and [4] explain that these slots benefit from direct prediction from candidate-value lists, which DS-DST handles effectively.\n\n- **Error Analysis**: Image5 shows that DS-DST and DS-Picklist reduce errors for slots like `attraction-type`, `hotel-internet`, and `hotel-parking`, which are challenging for span-based methods. This is because these slots have values that are not well-represented in dialog context, making them better suited for categorical prediction. The text [7] supports this by noting that span-based methods struggle with these slots due to their unique expressions.\n\n- **Model Design**: The text [2] and [4] describe DS-DST as a dual-strategy model that jointly handles categorical and non-categorical slots, while DS-Picklist assumes a full ontology and treats all slots as categorical. This dual approach in DS-DST allows it to adapt better to different slot types and contexts, as illustrated in the error analysis and slot accuracy improvements in image2.\n\n- **Comparison with BERT Models**: Image6 and the text [9] show that DS-DST outperforms BERT-based models by enforcing strong interactions between dialog context and domain-slot pairs, which is crucial for handling diverse slot types effectively.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nDS-Picklist exc"}

This is highlighted in **image2** (Table 2a), where SciIE achieves an F1 score of 68.1, significantly higher than other models.\n  \n- **Relation Extraction**: SciIE shows a substantial 13.1% relative improvement over E2E Rel and 7.4% over E2E Rel with ELMo. The results are shown in **image2** (Table 2b), where SciIE achieves an F1 score of 68.1, outperforming other models.\n  \n- **Coreference Resolution**: SciIE improves by 4.5% relative over E2E Coref, as noted in **image2** (Table 2c), achieving an F1 score of 48.2.\n\nThe multitask learning approach of SciIE is crucial for its performance.

According to the results in **image2**, the SciIE model achieves higher F1 scores for all three tasks: entity recognition (68.1 vs. 65.7), relation extraction (39.5 vs. 37.9), and coreference resolution (58.0 vs. 55.3). This improvement is attributed to the shared span representations and cross-sentence information propagation, as described in **text quote [7]**. \n\nIn **image10**, the precision-recall curves further illustrate the benefits of coreference inclusion. The system with coreference links (blue line) consistently shows higher precision and recall compared to the system without coreference links (red line), confirming the importance of coreference in enhancing the quality of the knowledge graph. The precision remains high (above 84% for both systems), but the inclusion of coreference significantly boosts recall, as noted in **text quote [10]**.\n\n### Evidence Selection and Construction\n\n- **Text Quote [7]**: \"We develop a unified framework (called SciIE) to identify and classify scientific entities, relations, and coreference resolution across sentences. SciIE is a multi-task learning setup that extends previous span-based models for coreference resolution (Lee et al., 2017) and semantic role labeling (He et al., 2018). All three tasks of entity recognition, relation extraction, and coreference resolution are treated as multinomial classification problems with shared span representations.\"\n- **Image Quote [10]**: \"Figure 8 shows precision/recall curves for both systems. Since it is not feasible to compute the actual recall of the systems, we compute the pseudo-recall (Zhang et al., 2015) based on the output of both systems.

For both problems, we stacked task-specific architectures from recent work on top of our pretrained two tower models. We evaluate two ways of stacking: (1) ELMo-style, where the pretrained models are not fine-tuned but are linearly combined at different depths, and (2) with fine-tuning, where we set different learning rates for the task-specific architectures.\n\n- **Image Quotes:**\n  -"}

The effect is more pronounced when the baseline BLEU score is moderate, typically between 3-4, indicating that pre-training is most beneficial when there is enough data to capture basic language characteristics but not so much that the system cannot improve further. The role of training set size and language similarity is crucial:\n\n- **Training Set Size**: Pre-training is more effective when the baseline system is moderately effective, suggesting that a balance is needed between data quantity and quality. As seen in image2, pre-training consistently improves BLEU scores across varying training set sizes, with the largest gains observed when the baseline is not too poor but not overly strong either.\n  \n- **Language Similarity**: Pre-training is more effective for language pairs that are more similar, as hypothesized in the paper. This is evident in image1, where languages like Spanish (Es) and Portuguese (Pt) from the West-Iberian family show a significant BLEU score increase (+7.0), compared to Russian (Ru) and Hebrew (He) from different families, which show smaller gains (+6.2 and +8.9 respectively). Image1 also shows that languages with no common family, like Hebrew and Portuguese, see the largest gains (+8.9), aligning with the hypothesis that similar languages benefit more from pre-training.\n\n**Conclusion**: Pre-training boosts translation accuracy, especially for low-resource languages and when the source and target languages are similar.

According to the study, aligning word embeddings helps to increase BLEU scores for all three tasks, as shown in **image4**. This improvement is intuitive because a single encoder is used for both source languages, simplifying the learning process when embeddings are in a similar vector space. In contrast, when embeddings are not aligned, as seen in **image1**, the performance varies, with some pairs showing gains and others showing losses, which are generally insignificant.

The graph shows that the F-measure for pre-trained embeddings (red bars) is consistently higher than for standard embeddings (blue bars) across different frequency ranges, particularly for words with frequencies between 5-999 and 1000+ in the training corpus.

This suggests that the R-GCN component is essential for multi-hop reasoning and capturing dependencies between mentions, which is particularly important in the unmasked setting where the model has access to more context.\n\n**Relation Types Impact**: Text quote [7] highlights that the model makes better use of DOC-BASED connections than MATCH or COREF connections. DOC-BASED connections are more critical because they capture information about mentions appearing closely in the same document. The removal of these connections leads to a performance drop, as seen in the ablation study where DOC-BASED connections are removed (62.9 accuracy in unmasked and 65.8 in masked settings). The impact is less pronounced for MATCH and COREF connections, but their removal still affects performance, especially in the masked setting where the model struggles more with coreference links (Table 4).\n\n**Specific Relation Types (MATCH, COREF)**: The ablation study in text quote [7] shows that removing MATCH and COREF connections results in a performance drop. MATCH connections capture easy coreference cases, while COREF connections rely on an out-of-domain coreference system, which may not always be reliable. The performance degradation is more noticeable in the masked setting, where the model's ability to recover coreference links is hindered (Table 4).\n\n**Unmasked vs. Masked Conditions**: The text quote [3] notes that the model is more effective in recovering coreference links on the masked version due to reliance on exact matching. This suggests that the masked setting is easier for the model, as it does not have to rely as heavily on the coreference system.

According to the text quotes, the DyGIE model includes the coreference propagation layer on datasets that have coreference annotations available, while it does not include this layer on datasets without such annotations. This is evident from the following evidence:\n\n- **Text Quote [4]**: \"We include the coreference graph propagation layer on the data sets that have coreference annotations available.\"\n- **Text Quote [11]**: \"Since relation annotations are not available for these datasets, we include the coreference propagation layer in our models but not the relation layer.\"\n\nThe performance of the DyGIE model is notably better when coreference annotations are present. For instance, in the ACE04-O and ACE05-O datasets, which have coreference annotations, DyGIE achieves state-of-the-art results with an improvement of 11.6% and 11.3% respectively, as shown in **Text Quote [9]**: \"DyGIE improves 11.6% on the state of the art for ACE04-O and 11.3% for ACE05-O.\" This improvement is attributed to the coreference layer, which helps in disambiguating entity classes for pronominal mentions, as discussed in **Text Quote [3]**.\n\nThe results are further supported by the performance tables in the images:\n\n- **Image 5** shows that DyGIE outperforms other systems on the ACE04-O and ACE05-O datasets, with significant improvements in Entity F1 scores when coreference annotations are available.\n- **Image 6** confirms that coreference annotations are present in the ACE04-O and ACE05-O datasets, but not in the GENIA dataset, which aligns with the performance differences observed.\n\nIn contrast, in datasets without coreference annotations, such as GENIA, the performance improvement is modest, as seen in **Text Quote [9]**: \"DyGIE also advances the state of the art on GENIA, albeit by a more modest 1.5%.\"\n\nThe coreference layer enhances the model's ability to handle pronoun disambiguation, which is crucial for entity recognition tasks, as highlighted in **Text Quote [3]**. The model's performance is thus optimized when coreference annotations are available, demonstrating the importance of these annotations in improving entity recognition accuracy.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe presence of"}

According to the text quotes and the provided images, the optimal performance for both CorefProp and RelProp is achieved at two iterations. For CorefProp, as shown in **image1**, the F1 score for entity extraction peaks at the second iteration (N=2), indicating that two iterations are sufficient for optimal performance. Similarly, **image6** shows that for relation extraction, the F1 score also reaches its maximum at two iterations (M=2). This suggests that increasing the number of iterations beyond two does not yield further improvements and may even lead to a decline in performance.\n\nIn contrast, **image5** illustrates the effect of the number of entities in a sentence on the F1 score for relation extraction. Here, the F1 score for DyGIE peaks when the number of entities is between 6-11, after which it starts to decline. This indicates that the complexity of the sentence, measured by the number of entities, has a more pronounced effect on relation extraction performance compared to the number of iterations in CorefProp and RelProp. The model's performance is optimized for sentences with a moderate number of entities, and both too few or too many entities can negatively impact the relation extraction F1 score.\n\n**Image7** supports this by showing that DyGIE achieves the highest F1 scores for both entity and relation extraction when the number of entities is between 6-11, similar to the trend observed in **image5**. This suggests that the model is most effective in handling sentences with a balanced number of entities, which aligns with the findings in **image5**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe number of iterations in CorefProp and RelProp is optimized at two iterations for both entity and relation extraction tasks, as shown in **image1** and **image6**. However, the number of entities in a sentence has a more significant impact on relation extraction performance, with the highest F1 scores achieved when the number of entities is between 6-11, as depicted in **image5** and **image7**. This indicates that while the number of iterations is crucial for iterative refinement, the complexity of the sentence structure also plays a critical role in determining the model's performance in relation extraction. \n\n![Effect of Iterations on F1 Scores](image1) ![Effect of Entities on Relation F1 Score](image5)"}

This is shown in `image3`, where the F1 scores for entity extraction remain relatively stable across iterations, indicating that additional iterations do not significantly improve performance. \n\n- **RelProp (Relation Propagation)**: As depicted in `image2`, relation propagation significantly improves F1 scores for relation extraction in sentences with more entities. The performance peaks at around 6-11 entities, after which it declines. This suggests that relation propagation is particularly beneficial in contexts with multiple entities, where broader context can enhance relation extraction accuracy.\n\n- **Combined Effect**: The combination of both propagations, as seen in `image4`, shows that DyGIE achieves substantial improvements in both entity and relation extraction tasks. The table highlights that DyGIE outperforms state-of-the-art systems on various datasets, with notable improvements in relation extraction, especially in sentences with multiple entities.\n\n- **Specific Datasets**: For instance, in the ACE05 dataset, DyGIE achieves a 7.0% relative improvement in entity recognition and a 13.7% relative improvement in relation extraction over the state of the art, as shown in `image10`.

As edit distance increases, novelty rises, but accuracy decreases, indicating that more novel tuples are less accurate.\n\n**Image7:**\n- **Training Data Impact:** Image7 shows that with 10% training data, the model achieves the best performance (BLEU-2: 12.72, N/T o: 9.54), suggesting that a moderate amount of data is optimal for balancing quality and novelty.\n\n#### Answer Construction\n\nThe performance of different COMET decoding methods, particularly greedy decoding, closely approaches human validation, achieving an average score of 89.60, which is 10% higher than the top baseline. This indicates that greedy decoding balances quality and novelty effectively. Variations in training data percentages reveal that 10% of the data yields the best performance (BLEU-2: 12."}

This is possibly due to the iterative latent interactions in the **BiDAF** architecture: we hypothesize that these are of increased importance for our task, where information is distributed across documents.\n  - [8] To investigate if the neural RC models can draw upon information requiring multi-step inference we designed an experiment where we discard all documents that do not contain candidate mentions, in- cluding the first documents traversed. Table 7 shows the results: we can observe that performance drops across the board for **BiDAF**. There is a significant drop of **3.3%/6.2%** on **MedHop**, and **10.0%/2.1%** on **WikiHop**, demonstrating that **BiDAF**, is able to leverage cross-document information.\n  - [9] Both neural RC models are able to largely retain or even improve their strong performance when an- swers are masked: they are able to leverage the textual context of the candidate expressions. To under- stand differences in model behavior between **WikiHop** and **MedHop**, it is worth noting that drug mentions in **MedHop** are normalized to a unique single-word identifier, and performance drops under masking. In contrast, for the open-domain setting of **WikiHop**, a reduction of the answer vocabulary to 100 random single-token mask expressions clearly helps the model in selecting a candidate span, compared to the multi-token candidate expressions in the unmasked setting.\n  - [10] Table 6: Test accuracy comparison when only using documents leading to the correct answer (gold chain).

The **RetNRef++** model shows improvements in word statistics compared to the **Seq2Seq** model, making its responses more engaging and closer to human utterances. Specifically, **RetNRef++** doubles the use of rare words (frequency less than 100) and shows gains for words with frequency less than 1000, though it still lags behind human statistics [8]. This indicates that **RetNRef++** generates more varied and engaging sentences, which is crucial for human-like conversational abilities.\n\nIn terms of performance metrics, **RetNRef++** outperforms both the **RetNRef** and **Memory Network** models in human evaluations [1, 6]. It achieves a win rate of approximately 54% against the Memory Network model and 53.7% against the **Seq2Seq** model [6].

According to the text quotes and the relevant images:\n\n- **Effective Tax Rate**: The effective tax rate increased from 18.3% in 2019 to 22.5% in 2020 [3, 4, 5, 12]. This increase was primarily due to higher earnings and lower net discrete tax benefits [3, 4, 5, 12]. The text [3, 4, 5] explains that in 2020, net discrete tax benefits were $122 million, mainly related to the conversion of employee share-based awards. In contrast, the effective tax rate for 2019 included net discrete tax benefits of $475 million [8, 10], which were primarily associated with the remeasurement of reserves and related interest due to new information from tax examinations and the conversion of employee share-based awards.\n\n- **Net Discrete Tax Provisions**: The net discrete tax provisions (benefits) decreased from $475 million in 2019 to a net provision of $122 million in 2020 [8, 10]. This shift indicates a reduction in tax benefits, contributing to the higher effective tax rate.\n\n- **Compensation Expenses**: The total recognized compensation expense increased from $1,878 million in 2019 to $2,119 million in 2020 [1, 7, 11, 17]. The increase in compensation expenses was driven by several factors, including higher discretionary incentive compensation, formulaic payouts to Wealth Management representatives, and incremental compensation from the E*TRADE acquisition [1]. These increases were partially offset by lower compensation associated with carried interest [1].\n\n- **Relationship**: The changes in the effective tax rate and net discrete tax provisions directly affected the net income, which in turn influenced the compensation expenses. Higher earnings and lower tax benefits led to a higher effective tax rate, which could have impacted the net income available for compensation. The timing differences in recognizing gains and losses from investments and deferred compensation expenses also played a role in the reported ratios, such as the Expense efficiency ratio [9].\n\nThe provided tables and charts support these findings:\n- **Image1** shows the total recognized compensation expense for"}

This was largely due to the financing of the acquisition of Varian, which included €10 billion in borrowings and an additional €850 million provided by the Siemens Group. These inflows were partly offset by repayments of matured loans totaling €730 million and €300 million.\n- **Cash Outflows:** The cash outflows from financing activities increased to €12,814 million in 2021, from €249 million in 2020.

The unit cost calculation is detailed in **image1**, showing a revenue of US$9,470 million and an underlying EBITDA of US$6,483 million. The cost per pound was US$1.00, reflecting a 1% decrease from the previous year. The financial performance was also influenced by a one-off gain from optimisation of power contracts and a shift towards renewable energy, as noted in **text quote [2]**.\n\n**WAIO** had a revenue of US$34,337 million and an underlying EBITDA of US$26,270 million in FY2021, as shown in **image6**. The cost per tonne was US$14.82, slightly higher than the previous year. The increase in revenue and EBITDA was attributed to higher average realised prices and production volumes, with gross costs rising to US$8,067 million. However, the impact of commodity price changes, including fluctuations in copper, iron ore, and energy prices, affected their financial performance, as detailed in **image5**.\n\nCommodity price changes had significant impacts on both entities. For Escondida, fluctuations in copper prices and by-product credits influenced unit costs, while WAIO's performance was affected by changes in iron ore and energy prices, as highlighted in **image5**.

According to the text and image quotes, the total actuarial gains and losses for fiscal year 2021 were -22 million euros, while for fiscal year 2020, they were 67 million euros. The decline in the pension plans' funded status due to adverse developments in plan assets or the defined benefit obligation is considered a significant risk, as mentioned in text [2]. The funded status can be affected by changes in actuarial assumptions, primarily the discount rate, as well as movements in financial markets. \n\nImage 1 provides a detailed breakdown of the actuarial gains and losses, showing that changes in financial assumptions contributed to a decrease of 26 million euros in 2021 compared to an increase of 72 million euros in 2020. This indicates a shift from positive to negative impact due to financial assumptions. Additionally, the discount rate changes, as shown in image 6, had a substantial effect, with a decrease in the discount rate leading to a significant increase in the defined benefit obligation. The text [8] also notes that remeasurements are recognized in other comprehensive income, which includes actuarial gains and losses as well as the difference between the return on plan assets and the interest income on plan assets.\n\nThe decline in the funded status and the negative impact of changes in financial assumptions and discount rates resulted in a net decrease in actuarial gains and losses from 67 million euros in 2020 to -22 million euros in 2021. This reflects a more challenging financial environment and increased risk management efforts, as Siemens Healthineers implemented an investment strategy aligned with the defined benefit obligation and used derivatives to reduce risks.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe changes in financial assumptions and discount rates led to a significant reduction in total actuarial gains and losses from 67 million euros in 2020 to -22 million euros in 2021, highlighting increased financial challenges and risk management adjustments.\n\n![Total actuarial gains and losses](image1)"}

According to the text and image quotes:\n\n- **Loans**: The total loans increased from $887,637 million to $895,394 million, a modest increase of $7,757 million. This is detailed in **image4**, which shows the total loans growing from $887,637 million in 2020 to $895,394 million in 2021. The increase was driven by a rise in the commercial loan portfolio, particularly in commercial and industrial loans, as noted in **text quote [8]**. The commercial loans increased due to higher originations and loan draws, partially offset by paydowns and PPP loan forgiveness.\n\n- **Deposits**: Total deposits grew from $1,404,381 million to $1,482,479 million, an increase of $78,098 million, as shown in **image3**. The growth in deposits is attributed to the low interest rate environment and the transfer of $17.8 billion of first lien mortgage loans to loans held for sale, as mentioned in **text quote [8]**.\n\n- **Credit Risk Management**: The decrease in the Allowance for Credit Losses (ACL) by $5.9 billion, or 30%, from December 31, 2020, to December 31, 2021, indicates improved credit quality and economic conditions, as stated in **text quote [2]**.

GBM's adjusted revenue increased by $0.4 billion, largely due to strong performance in Global Markets, which more than offset the impacts of lower global interest rates and adverse movements in credit and funding valuation adjustments. This performance was achieved despite a decrease in risk-weighted assets (RWAs) and no increase in trading value at risk (VaR) [1]. The Corporate Centre's net operating income improved by $392 million, a 60% increase from 2019, driven by a reduction in operating expenses and a significant share of profit in associates and joint ventures [3]. The adjusted results for the Corporate Centre showed a net operating income of $(262) million, a substantial improvement from $(654) million in 2019 [4].\n\n![Management view of adjusted revenue](image1) illustrates the revenue changes across different segments, showing a notable increase in Global Markets revenue, particularly in Foreign Exchange and Rates, which contributed to the overall growth. The Corporate Centre's performance was bolstered by strategic actions, including the allocation of revenue and expenses related to Markets Treasury and HSBC Holdings' debt, enhancing the reflection of global business activities [9].\n\n![Adjusted results](image2) highlights the net operating income and profit before tax, with GBM performing particularly well, while Asia remained the most profitable region.

According to the text and image quotes, the increase in sales prices for iron ore, copper, nickel, oil, natural gas, and thermal coal contributed to higher revenue and improved profitability. Specifically, the text from image7 states that \"Higher average realised prices for iron ore, copper, nickel, oil, natural gas and thermal coal\" were a key factor in the increase in Underlying EBITDA from US$22,071 million in FY2020 to US$37,379 million in FY2021. This is reflected in the bar chart in image2, which shows a substantial increase in Underlying EBITDA for FY2021 compared to previous years.\n\nOn the other hand, operating cash costs also played a role. The text from image7 mentions that \"Increased royalties reflect higher realised prices for iron ore and higher third party concentrate purchase costs reflect higher nickel prices,\" which partially offset the benefits from higher sales prices. Additionally, the text highlights that \"Lower controllable cash costs\" contributed to the improvement in Underlying EBITDA, as seen in the detailed breakdown of changes in operating cash costs in image7.\n\nThe table in image8 further supports this, showing that the Underlying EBITDA increased by US$15,308 million, with a significant portion attributed to higher sales prices and lower operating costs. The Underlying Return on Capital Employed (ROCE) also improved from 16.9% in FY2020 to 32.5% in FY2021, indicating more efficient use of capital and better profitability.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe increase in sales prices for commodities and the reduction in operating cash costs were the primary drivers of the significant rise in BHP's Underlying EBITDA from FY2020 to FY2021.\n\n![Impact on Underlying EBITDA](image2)"}

The company reported a net cash provided by operating activities of $10.6 billion in 2020, a $1 billion increase from the previous year, primarily due to lower net cash tax payments and pension contributions. This improvement in operating cash flow contributed to a free cash flow of $6.428 billion, a 15% increase from $5.587 billion in 2019. The free cash flow was primarily used for acquisitions, debt repayments, dividends, and share repurchases, as outlined in the text [3] and [5].\n\nIn terms of contractual commitments, PepsiCo's total contractual commitments for 2020 amounted to $66.321 billion, as shown in image2. This includes long-term debt obligations, operating leases, and other long-term liabilities, which were $40,330 million, $1,895 million, and $1,277 million respectively. The commitments for 2021 were $3,448 million, indicating a significant portion of the total commitments were due in the near term.

According to the text and image quotes:\n\n- **Net Operating Income**: The net operating income decreased from $15,056 million in 2019 to $15,303 million in 2020, a slight increase of $247 million or 1.6%. However, this figure is misleading as it does not account for the substantial increase in expected credit losses and other credit impairment charges (ECL) and the reduction in revenue. The adjusted results show a more significant decline in net operating income, with a $434 million increase or 3% compared to the previous year, indicating that the actual performance was negatively affected by these factors.\n\n- **Profit Before Tax**: The profit before tax fell by $342 million or 7% from $5,172 million in 2019 to $4,830 million in 2020. This decline was driven by higher expected credit losses and other credit impairment charges, which increased by $1,056 million or 200% from $34 million in 2019 to $1,209 million in 2020. The text also highlights that the fall in reported revenue and the increase in ECL were partly offset by lower operating expenses.\n\n- **Image Evidence**: \n  - **Image1** shows a slight increase in the return on average tangible equity (RoTE) from 5.8% in 2018 to 5.2% in 2019, and then to 4.8% in 2020, indicating a slight deterioration in efficiency.\n  - **Image2** provides a detailed breakdown of the financial performance, showing the significant increase in expected credit losses and other credit impairment charges, which directly impacted the profit before tax.\n\n- **Contributing Factors**: The Covid-19 outbreak led to a reduction in global interest rates, increased volatility, and elevated market volatility, all of which contributed to the deterioration in financial performance.

This substantial increase is primarily due to the company's strategic focus on expanding its cloud services and enhancing its platform offerings, which aligns with the growing demand for cloud-based solutions. The cost of revenues for this category also rose from $2,033 million in 2019 to $2,257 million in 2020, a 12% increase. The increase in costs is attributed to higher service delivery costs, including efforts to expand data center capacity, which supports the company's shift towards cloud services.\n\n![Salesforce Platform and Other Revenue and Cost of Revenues Growth](image2) shows the detailed breakdown of revenue and cost of revenues for the 'Salesforce Platform and Other' category, highlighting the significant growth in both metrics. This growth in revenue outpaced the increase in costs, leading to a higher gross margin for this segment. The shift towards cloud services, which generally have lower service delivery costs compared to perpetual software licenses, contributed to a better gross margin in 2020. This positive trend in the 'Salesforce Platform and Other' category likely enhanced the overall financial performance by improving profitability and supporting the company's strategic goals of digital transformation and customer expansion.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe 'Salesforce Platform and Other' category saw a 57% increase in revenue and a 12% increase in cost of revenues from 2019 to 2020.

The gross profit increased from Rs. 7995.12 lac to Rs. 8873.49 lac, indicating a robust growth in profitability. Despite higher depreciation and taxation provisions, the profit after tax for the year was Rs. 3790.61 lac, up from Rs. 4779.55 lac in 2001-2002. This suggests effective cost management and operational efficiency. The company also achieved a higher sales turnover, with sales volume rising by 19.64% and sales turnover increasing by 14%. The introduction of new brands and focus on innovative products, such as Piper and Tipper, contributed to this growth.\n\nHowever, the company faces challenges in taxation, as highlighted by the image1, which shows a discriminatory tax burden on cigarettes. Cigarettes suffer a tax burden 21 times greater than bidis and 17 times greater than chewing tobacco. This tax disparity could be a significant factor in the consumption shift from cigarettes to cheaper non-cigarette products, as shown in image6, where consumption of cigarettes decreased from 320 Mn Kgs in 1981-82 to an estimated 388 Mn Kgs in 2001-02. This shift could impact the company's revenue streams and market share.\n\nThe potential for tobacco export earnings, as depicted in image3, is substantial. India holds only 0.7% of the global tobacco trade, with a potential to increase export earnings sevenfold with just a 5% share. The current export earnings are Rs. 930 Cr, but the potential is Rs. 7000 Cr. This indicates a significant untapped market opportunity for the company to diversify its revenue and reduce dependency on domestic sales.\n\n#### Image Analysis:\n- **Image1**: Illustrates the discriminatory taxation on cigarettes, which is 680 Rs./Kg, compared to 30 Rs./Kg for bidis and 40 Rs./Kg for chewing tobacco.

The decrease was primarily driven by lower interest rates, partially offset by reduced deposit and funding costs, the deployment of excess deposits into securities, and an additional day of interest accrual. This reflects the broader economic environment where interest rates were lower, impacting revenue from loans and investments.\n- **2018 to 2019:** Increased by $1,667 million. The increase was due to higher interest rates and favorable market conditions, which boosted net interest income.\n\n**Net Interest Expense (NIE):**\n- **2019 to 2020:** Decreased by $4,452 million. This decrease was partly due to lower interest rates and reduced costs associated with deposits and funding.\n- **2018 to 2019:** Increased by $2,693 million. The increase was driven by higher interest rates and costs associated with funding.\n\nThese changes reflect the organizational structure of Bank of America, which is divided into four main business segments: Consumer Banking, Global Wealth & Investment Management, Global Banking, and Global Markets, with remaining operations recorded in All Other. The structure allows for targeted management of each segment's activities, products, and risks, as illustrated in **image1**.

This decline was exacerbated by the prevailing low interest rates throughout 2021, which reduced interest income. [4] In response, the business increased its holdings in cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bills, which rose from $67,082 million in 2020 to $90,688 million in 2021, as shown in image3. This shift indicates a strategic move towards safer, short-term assets to maintain liquidity, despite the lower yields.

A hypothetical immediate 100 basis point decrease in market interest rates, which are assumed to remain at or above zero percent, would have a smaller but still detrimental impact on our annual net interest income. This measure first projects net interest income over the following twelve-month time horizon considering forecasted business growth and anticipated future market interest rates. The detrimental impact from rate changes is then measured by instantaneously increasing or decreasing the anticipated future interest rates by 100 basis points. Our estimated repricing risk assumes that our interest-rate sensitive assets and liabilities that reprice within the twelve-month horizon generally reprice by the same magnitude as benchmark rate changes. It is further assumed that, within our interest-rate sensitive liabilities, certain deposits reprice at lower magnitudes than benchmark rate movements, and the magnitude of this repricing in turn depends on, among other factors, the direction of rate movements. These assumptions are consistent with historical deposit repricing experience in the industry and within our own portfolio.

The company's effective tax rate has fluctuated, with a significant decrease from 41% in 2019 to 12% in 2021. This reduction is largely attributed to various tax benefits, including excess tax benefits from share-based awards, which were substantial in 2021 at $265 million, compared to $83 million in 2020 and $27 million in 2019. Additionally, the company recognized significant deferred tax benefits from the derecognition of deferred tax assets on distributed intellectual property in 2018, amounting to $2.5 billion in 2019.

For instance, the company had unused federal net operating loss carryforwards and state tax credits that could be carried forward indefinitely, as mentioned in the text. These credits, along with the strategic use of tax incentives and the resolution of tax positions, have contributed to the overall reduction in the effective tax rate.\n\nFurthermore, the company's remaining performance obligations, primarily related to unearned revenues, have been substantial, with $1.1 billion recognized as of September 26, 2021.

For lease liabilities, the adoption of AASB 16 required the recognition of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities, which are presented on the balance sheet. This change is reflected in the increase in lease liabilities from the initial recognition on 1 July 2019 to the adjusted balance at the same date, as shown in **image1**. The Group recognized a liability of $143,621,000 on the initial application of AASB 16, which increased to $167,154,000 by the end of 2020, indicating the re-measurement of lease liabilities due to changes in lease terms and new leases for stores, as noted in **image1** and **text quote [7]**.\n\nFor employee benefit liabilities, the transition to AASB 16 also affected the accounting for long-term service benefits. The obligation for these benefits is calculated using expected future wage increases and is discounted using high-quality Australian corporate bond rates, as explained in **text quote [10]**. The total employee benefit liabilities decreased slightly from $4,054,000 in 2019 to $4,092,000 in 2020, as shown in **image3**. This slight increase is due to the inclusion of future benefit obligations that employees have earned, adjusted for expected settlement dates and wage increases.\n\nThe adoption of AASB 16 also led to the capitalization of site restoration costs as part of the lease right-of-use asset, which was previously capitalized as part of leasehold improvements, as detailed in **text quote [3]**.

[5]\n\n3. **Shareholder Value:** Toyota deems the benefit of its shareholders an important element of its management policy and continues to work to improve its corporate structure and enhance its corporate value in order to realize sustainable growth. [9]\n\n4. **Performance-Linked Remuneration:** Performance-based remuneration is set based on consolidated operating income, the volatility of the share price of Toyota, and individual performance, taking into account each member’s job responsibilities and the remuneration standard of his/her home country. [2]\n\n5. **Evaluation Method:** Consolidated operating income is evaluated by comparing the degree of attainment of consolidated operating income in the current fiscal year with a reference value. Volatility of Toyota's share price is comparatively evaluated up to the end of the current fiscal year using the share price of Toyota and the Nikkei stock average at the end of the previous fiscal year as reference values.

[image5]\n\n**Answer Construction:**\n\nToyota's executive remuneration evaluation is intricately linked to its business performance and shareholder value indicators. The Annual Total Remuneration is determined by consolidated operating income, share price volatility, and individual performance evaluations, reflecting both company performance and shareholder interests. [1] Consolidated operating income is evaluated by comparing the current fiscal year's results against a reference value, while share price volatility is assessed against historical data. [5] These metrics ensure that executive compensation aligns with corporate performance and shareholder value, as Toyota prioritizes enhancing corporate value and sustainable growth. [9] Performance-linked remuneration, a significant portion of the total, is directly tied to these indicators, ensuring that"}

The total revenue decreased by $6.0 billion, primarily due to a decline in nonconforming applications, while net income dropped by $6.5 billion, mainly due to lower revenue, higher provisions for credit losses, and higher expenses. Net interest income decreased by $3.5 billion, and noninterest income decreased by $1.9 billion, driven by lower service charges and lower card income due to decreased client activity. In contrast, the Global Wealth & Investment Management (GWIM) segment, which includes Merrill Lynch Global Wealth Management (MLGWM) and Bank of America Private Bank, saw a decrease in revenue of $15.3 billion, primarily due to lower interest rates, but benefited from higher market valuations and positive AUM flows.

The MSME sector that encompasses a wide range of industries had been under considerable stress for a prolonged period before the incidence of COVID-19. This made them particularly vulnerable to the lockdown and its aftermath. The NBFC sector, a major provider of funding to the MSMEs had also been going through a period of stress, particularly in its access to finances both from banks and the market. Thus, the stimulus package focused on the survival of both MSMEs and NBFCs through the COVID-19 crisis and also their revival. The critical element of the stimulus was its attempt to facilitate the flow of credit to both MSMEs directly and to NBFCs. The Government aimed to do this by reducing the risk taken by banks and other institutions in lending to them by providing explicit guarantees either on the entire loan or a fraction. The guarantees delivered were through Special Purpose Vehicles (SPVs) in which the Government had initially taken an equity stake. Thus, for instance, the targeted credit flow of ₹ 300 billion in the form of collateral free loans to the smaller MSMEs was backed by a 100 per cent Government of India guarantee given through National Credit Guarantee Trustee Company (NCGTC).

This change reflects a higher expected return on plan assets, which can reduce the present value of future benefit obligations.

This growth is evident in the provided table for 2020, where the total recognized compensation expense is $2,119 million, up from $1,878 million in 2019 and $1,126 million in 2018.\n\n![Trend in total recognized compensation expense](image1)\n\nThe expenses are distributed across three main business segments: Institutional Securities, Wealth Management, and Investment Management. In 2020, Institutional Securities had the highest compensation expense at $851 million, followed by Wealth Management at $1,000 million, and Investment Management at $268 million. This distribution indicates that Wealth Management and Institutional Securities are the primary drivers of compensation expenses, with significant contributions from both discretionary incentive compensation and deferred compensation plans linked to investment performance.\n![Distribution of compensation expenses](image1)\n\nThe increase in compensation expenses is primarily due to higher discretionary incentive compensation and the formulaic payout to Wealth Management representatives, driven by higher revenues and investment performance.

Savings generated from the Company's restructuring program are difficult to estimate, given the nature of the activities, the timing of the execution and the degree of reinvestment. In fiscal 2022, the Company incurred before tax restructuring costs within the range of our historical annual ongoing level of $250 to $500 million.\n- **[5]** Restructuring costs incurred consist primarily of costs to separate employees, asset-related costs to exit facilities and other costs. Employee separation costs relate to severance packages that are primarily voluntary and the amounts calculated are based on salary levels and past service periods. Asset-related costs consist of both asset write-downs and accelerated depreciation. Asset write-downs relate to the establishment of a new fair value basis for assets held-for-sale or for disposal. These assets are written down to the lower of their current carrying basis or amounts expected to be realized upon disposal, less minor disposal costs. Charges for accelerated depreciation relate to long-lived assets that will be taken out of service prior to the end of their normal service period. These assets relate primarily to manufacturing consolidations and technology standardization. The asset-related charges will not have a significant impact on future depreciation charges. Other restructuring-type charges primarily include asset removal and termination of contracts related to supply chain and overhead optimization.\n- **[8]** The Company has historically had an ongoing level of restructuring activities. Such activities have resulted in ongoing annual restructuring related charges of approximately $250–$500 million before tax. Beginning in 2012, the Company had a strategic productivity and cost savings initiative that resulted in incremental restructuring charges through fiscal 2020. The adjustment to Core earnings includes only the restructuring costs above the normal recurring level of restructuring costs.

The report outlines several key drivers and their effects on BHP's financial performance:\n\n1. **Volatility in Commodity Prices**: Commodity prices are subject to volatility due to global economic and geopolitical factors, industrial activity, supply and demand dynamics, technological changes, product substitution, tariffs, and exchange rate fluctuations. For example, a $1 per tonne decline in iron ore prices and a $1 per barrel decline in oil prices would impact FY2021 profit after taxation by $163 million and $24 million, respectively [4].\n\n2. **Coal**: Underlying EBITDA for Coal decreased by $1.3 billion to $288 million in FY2021, primarily due to lower prices and volumes. Controllable cash costs increased by $102 million due to maintenance costs and increased stripping volumes, partially offset by cost reduction initiatives [2]. Queensland Coal's unit costs are expected to be between $80 and $90 per tonne in FY2022, influenced by higher diesel prices, but mine plan optimizations and efficiency improvements are expected to mitigate these increases [3].\n\n3. **Nickel**: The nickel price benefitted from positive investor sentiment and strong demand, with a brief correction in March due to a major producer's announcement. Prices rebounded due to supply disruptions and falling London Metal Exchange stocks. Underlying EBITDA for Nickel West increased by $296 million to $259 million in FY2021, driven by higher prices and volumes, and lower maintenance costs after major shutdowns [9].\n\n4. **Market Price Fluctuations**: Fluctuations in commodity prices directly affect BHP's financial performance. For instance, a $1 per tonne decline in nickel prices would have a minimal impact on profit after taxation, as shown in the financial impact table [5, 10]. However, the report emphasizes that sustained low prices or long-term volatility could adversely affect financial performance due to the inability to offset costs through price increases [4].\n\n5. **Revenue and Production**: Revenue increased by $17.9 billion in FY2021, partly due to higher average realized prices for iron ore, copper, nickel, oil, natural gas, and thermal coal, despite lower prices for metallurgical coal and LNG [7].

Previously, the division was organized into four business areas: Centralised and Point of Care Solutions, Molecular Diagnostics, Tissue Diagnostics, and Diabetes Care. In 2021, this structure was replaced with a new customer area-based organization, which includes Core Lab, Molecular Lab, Point of Care, Pathology Lab, and Diabetes Care. This change aimed to better align the division with customer needs and market demands, as detailed in the Finance Report, page 27 [1].\n\nThe restructuring is reflected in the composition of the Corporate Executive Committee, which oversees the operations of the Pharmaceuticals and Diagnostics divisions. The CEO of Roche Group, Dr. Severin Schwan, and the CEO of Roche Diagnostics, Dr. Thomas Schinecker, are key executives responsible for leading these divisions. Dr. Schwan has been in charge since 2008, while Dr. Schinecker took over in 2019, as shown in the Corporate Executive Committee composition as of 31.12.2021 [5].\n\nAdditionally, the division's strong sales performance in 2021, particularly in COVID-19 tests, contributed significantly to its overall growth, with sales reaching $17.8 billion, up 29% from the previous year [9].

The largest contributor to complaints was operations, which remained consistent at 25%, reflecting ongoing challenges in these areas.\n\n![CMB Complaint Categories Comparison](image5)\n\nThe reduction in complaints overall in CMB was attributed to improved processes and enhanced digital solutions, despite the increase in complaints linked to Covid-19 indirectly. The focus on staff training and recording complaints helped improve complaint handling expertise, ensuring fair outcomes for customers.\n\n### Evidence:\n- **Text Quote [5]**: \"In 2020, we continued to focus on staff training in each of our global businesses and emphasise the importance of recording complaints. This is intended to improve our complaint handling expertise and help ensure our customers are provided with fair outcomes.\"\n- **Text Quote [6]**: \"During the year, 73% of complaints were resolved on the same or next working day, a decline from 77% in 2019, and 80% were resolved within five working days, compared with 83% in 2019.\"\n- **Text Quote [7]**: \"In our private bank in 2020, we received 572 complaints, an 8% increase on 2019. Administration and servicing issues remained the largest contributor of complaint categories, at 79% in total.\"\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe most common complaint categories for CMB in 2020 were operations and account opening, with slight increases from the previous year, while the overall complaint resolution rates were impacted by staffing challenges due to the Covid-19 pandemic."}

Specifically, equity underwriting revenues rose on higher volumes in secondary block share trades, initial public offerings (IPOs), and follow-on offerings, while fixed income underwriting revenues increased due to elevated volumes in investment grade and non-investment grade bond issuances. However, this growth was partially offset by lower event-driven investment grade loan activity. \n\nAccording to the text, equity underwriting revenues increased on higher volumes, primarily in secondary block share trades, initial public offerings, and follow-on offerings [6].

This increase suggests that the company is either granting more stock options or increasing the value of existing options, which could be part of its strategy to attract and retain talent or align employee interests with shareholder interests.\n\n- **Related Tax Benefits**: The tax benefits from stock-based compensation also increased, from $196 million in 2020 to $231 million in 2022. This indicates that the company is effectively utilizing tax advantages associated with stock-based compensation, which can reduce taxable income and improve net income.\n\n- **Net Stock-Based Compensation Expense**: The net expense, after accounting for tax benefits, rose from $1,308 million in 2020 to $1,925 million in 2022. This net increase further underscores the company's commitment to stock-based compensation as a key component of its financial strategy.\n\nThe changes in these figures might indicate that the company is expanding its stock-based compensation plans, possibly to support growth initiatives, employee retention, or aligning executive compensation with long-term performance.

This reduction in income directly impacts the net interest yield.\n2. **Interest Rate Changes:** Text [7] highlights the potential impact of interest rate changes on net interest yield. Although the text does not specify actual rate changes, the decline in yield suggests that the rates earned on loans may have been lower than the rates paid on borrowings.\n3. **Lower Revolving Loan Balances:** The decrease in average revolving loan balances, as seen in image2, contributed to the lower interest income, which in turn affected the net interest yield.\n\n**Image2** illustrates the net interest income and yield for the years 2019 to 2021.

According to the text quotes, the aggregate allowance for loans and lending commitments increased in 2020, reflecting the provision for credit losses within the Institutional Securities business segment, which was principally resulting from the continued economic impact of COVID-19. The provision was primarily the result of actual and forecasted changes in asset quality trends, as well as risks related to uncertainty in the outlook for the sectors in focus due to COVID-19. Charge-offs in 2020 were primarily related to certain Commercial real estate and Corporate loans in the Institutional Securities business segment. The base scenario used in the ACL models as of December 31, 2020 assumed a continued recovery through 2021, supported by fiscal stimulus and monetary policy measures. \n\nThe increase in the ACL was also influenced by the adoption of the Current Expected Credit Loss (CECL) standard, which required a more forward-looking approach to estimating credit losses. This adoption resulted in an increase in the allowance for credit losses of $131 million, with a corresponding reduction in Retained earnings of $100 million, net of tax, as noted in quote [5]. The ACL for loans and lending commitments held for investment increased by $762 million in 2020 compared to the prior year, as seen in image5, which shows a net provision of $762 million for the year.\n\nThe text also highlights that the base scenario for the ACL models used a combination of industry consensus economic forecasts, forward rates, and internally developed and validated models, with U.S. GDP being the most sensitive model input. This indicates that the economic outlook and the firm's internal assessments of credit risk were critical in determining the increased provision for credit losses.\n\n**Conclusion:** The ACL increased by $1,130 million from 2019 to 2020, driven by the COVID-19 pandemic's economic impact, the adoption of CECL, and the firm's proactive credit risk management.\n\n![Increase in ACL due to COVID-19 and CECL adoption](image5)\n\n![Impact of COVID-19 on ACL provision](image11)"}

According to the consolidated income statement for the year ended 30 June 2021, the Underlying EBITDA increased from US$22,071 million in 2020 to US$37,379 million in 2021, reflecting a substantial improvement in profitability. This increase was primarily driven by higher average realized prices for iron ore, copper, nickel, oil, natural gas, and thermal coal, which more than offset lower average realized prices for metallurgical coal and LNG. Additionally, record volumes were achieved at WAIO, contributing to the increase in Underlying EBITDA. However, this was partially offset by the expected lower grades at Escondida and Spence, natural field decline at Petroleum, and adverse weather events. The increase in prices had a net positive effect, with higher average realized prices for iron ore, copper, nickel, oil, natural gas, and thermal coal contributing US$16,965 million to the Underlying EBITDA, while higher nickel prices and increased royalties added US$370 million. These factors were partially offset by lower royalties for petroleum and metallurgical coal, resulting in a net positive impact of US$16,095 million from price impacts. The change in volumes also contributed positively, with record volumes at WAIO and strong performance across the supply chain adding US$312 million to the Underlying EBITDA, despite lower volumes due to adverse weather impacts in the Gulf of Mexico and higher strip ratios at BMA.

According to the data provided in image4, GSM technology holds an 89% market share, while CDMA holds only 11%. This indicates that GSM is the dominant technology in Indonesia's telecommunications sector.\n\n![Market Share Distribution](image4)\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **GSM Market Share**: Image4 shows a pie chart where GSM occupies 89% of the market, indicating its overwhelming dominance over CDMA.\n- **CDMA Market Share**: CDMA, represented in the same image, has a much smaller share, accounting for 11% of the market.\n\nThis dominance of GSM is further supported by the text in quote [5], which mentions that there are six GSM/WCDMA & CDMA operators, but GSM operators like Telkomsel, XL, and Indosat are the major players. CDMA operators are expected to phase out by 2016, highlighting the transition towards GSM.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nGSM technology holds a significant 89% market share in Indonesia, while CDMA has a much smaller share of 11%. This reflects the shift towards GSM as the primary technology in the country's telecommunications landscape."}

By comparison, just 17% of self-identified non-Hispanics say the same, showing that non-Hispanics with Hispanic ancestry are more dispersed across the country than their Hispanic counterparts.\"\n\n- **Image Quote [image1]**: The bar chart illustrates that among self-identified Hispanics, the perception of having neighbors who are Hispanic is highest among the foreign born (61%) and the second generation (51%), while it drops to 24% among the third or higher generation. This suggests that as generations increase, the proportion of self-identified Hispanics who perceive their neighbors as Hispanic decreases.\n\n- **Image Quote [image4]**: The chart further supports this trend, showing that 39% of self-identified Hispanics feel that all or most of their neighbors are Hispanic, compared to 17% of self-identified non-Hispanics with Hispanic ancestry. This indicates a higher concentration of Hispanic identity in neighborhoods among earlier generations.\n\n- **Image Quote [image7]**: The data also shows that among self-identified Hispanics, 64% of the foreign born and 55% of the second generation feel that all or most of their neighbors are Hispanic, compared to 37% of the third or higher generation.

According to text quote [1], there are notable differences in early midterm vote preferences based on educational attainment. Individuals with postgraduate degrees favor the Democratic candidate over the Republican candidate by a substantial margin (62% to 30%), while those with a four-year college degree prefer the Democrat by a smaller margin (53% to 40%). Preferences are more divided among voters without a college degree. This trend is further supported by image1, which shows that approval ratings for congressional candidates vary widely across different educational groups. For instance, image1 indicates that 68% of postgraduates strongly or not strongly approve of the Democratic candidate, compared to 53% of college graduates and 49% of those with some college experience or a high school degree or less. This suggests that higher educational attainment is associated with stronger support for the Democratic Party.\n\nAdditionally, image4 provides insight into attentiveness to campaign news, showing that blacks are more likely than whites or Hispanics to follow campaign news very closely. This could imply that educational differences in political engagement and awareness might also play a role in shaping vote preferences. Image8 reinforces this by showing that black voters, who tend to have lower educational attainment, are more likely to support the Democratic candidate (85% to 37%), compared to white voters (55% to 39%).\n\nIn summary, educational levels are a critical factor in determining congressional vote preferences, with higher education generally correlating with stronger Democratic support.\n\n![Disapprove](image1)  \n![Attentiveness](image4)\n\n### Conclusion\n\nEducational levels significantly influence congressional vote preferences, with higher education generally correlating with stronger support for the Democratic Party."}

According to the census data in image2, the population surged from 130 in 1870 to a peak of 14,096 in 1890. This rapid growth was driven by the influx of settlers, as mentioned in text quote [1], who were attracted by the Homestead Act and the Transcontinental Railroad Act. These acts, highlighted in text quote [5], transformed the landscape and facilitated westward expansion, leading to a booming agricultural state. The population continued to grow through the early 20th century, reaching 13,330 in 1900, as shown in image2.\n\nHowever, the population began to decline after the peak, with numbers stabilizing around 9,000 by 2000. This decline can be attributed to several factors. The consolidation of farms, as noted in text quote [6], reduced the number of farms and the average size of farms increased, leading to fewer people living in rural areas. The consolidation trend is further supported by the data in image8, which shows a decrease in the number of farms from 1,597 in 1880 to 1,453 in 1950. Additionally, the shift in transportation patterns and the decline of rural school districts, as mentioned in text quote [11], contributed to the depopulation of rural areas.\n\nThe image3 map of Hamilton County highlights the geographical distribution of towns and the impact of railroads, as discussed in text quote [10], on town development. The presence of railroads influenced the growth and decline of towns, with some areas becoming less viable as transportation patterns changed. The image4 and image5 show rural churches and cemeteries, which were once focal points of the community but now stand as remnants of the past, reflecting the demographic shifts.\n\nIn summary, the population of Hamilton County increased dramatically in the late 19th century due to agricultural expansion and settlement policies, but subsequent changes in farming practices, transportation, and economic factors led to a decline in population by the early 21st century.\n\n![Population Trends in Hamilton County from 1870 to 2000](image2)  \n![Farm Consolidation in Hamilton County](image8)  \n![Geographical Distribution"}

According to image3, EU VC funds are represented in the bottom quartile (23%) and Q3 (17%), while US funds are more evenly distributed across quartiles, with a higher percentage in the top quartile (35%). This indicates that a significant portion of EU funds are in the lower performance brackets compared to their US counterparts. The text quote [7] highlights that a higher share of European VC funds achieve top US quartile performance, suggesting that when performance data is available, EU funds perform competitively. However, the lack of transparency and reporting in Europe, as noted in quote [10], means many top-performing EU funds are not visible in the Thomson Venture database, leading to a skewed perception of their performance.

Initially, a majority of Americans believed the U.S. was the world's leading economy, but recent data shows a significant drop. In March 2020, 59% of Americans held this view, which is an unprecedented high in Pew Research Center's surveys. However, by July 2020, this figure had decreased to 52%, marking a 7 percentage point decline over four months. This shift is particularly pronounced among Democrats, who have become less likely to see the U.S. as the leading global economy. In March 2020, 54% of Democrats believed the U.S. was the top economy, but this dropped to 44% by July 2020, as noted in text [6]. \n\nThe differences in perceptions between political affiliations are also evident. Republicans and Republican-leaning independents have consistently been more likely to see the U.S. as the leading economy, with 38% holding this view in 2020, compared to 19% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents, as shown in image1. This partisan divide is further highlighted by the increase in confidence among Republicans, who have seen a rise from 17% in 2012 to 38% in 2020, while Democrats have seen a slight decline from 11% to 19% over the same period.\n\nThe economic confidence decline is linked to broader economic challenges, including the U.S. unemployment rate and the prediction of a shrinking GDP in 2020, as mentioned in text [7]. Additionally, the perception of China's economic dominance has increased, with 32% of Americans seeing China as the leading economy, compared to 52% for the U.S., as noted in text [8]. This shift in perception is associated with a decrease in support for tough economic measures against China, with a greater emphasis on building a strong relationship, as seen in image6.\n\nIn summary, the decline in Americans' perception of the U.S. as the world's leading economic power is significant, with a notable partisan divide, where Republicans remain more confident in the U.S.'s economic status compared to Democrats. The economic challenges and changing global economic landscape have contributed to these shifts in perception.\n\n![Decline in confidence in U.S. as leading economy"}

According to the text, in 1880, there were 1,597 farms in Hamilton County, Nebraska. By 1950, this number had decreased to 1,453 farms. This decline is part of a broader pattern observed across the country, where the number of farms has steadily decreased while the size of farms has increased. The text highlights that in 1900, there were 2,049 farms in Hamilton County, and by 1950, this number had dropped to 1,453, with the average farm size increasing from 179.7 acres in 1920 to 577 acres by 2002. This consolidation trend is attributed to mechanization, which allowed for larger-scale farming operations and reduced the need for smaller, less efficient farms.\n\n![Number of Farms Decline](image8)\n\nThe image shows a table detailing the number of farms in Hamilton County from 1880 to 1950, illustrating the steady decrease over the decades.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe number of farms in the U.S. decreased from 1,597 in 1880 to 1,453 in 1950, a trend driven by agricultural mechanization and consolidation.\n\n![Number of Farms Decline](image8)"}

By contrast, only about two-in-ten Republicans (19%) or Democrats (18%) hold this opinion. Among those with at least a college degree, 31% say \"high ethical standards\" does not describe either party, 43% say it describes one and not the other, and 17% think it describes both.

Initially, a substantial majority of Republicans believed the government was doing very or fairly well in combating terrorism. However, this perception has declined sharply, particularly since the Snowden disclosures in 2013. According to text [4], the percentage of Republicans who believe the government has not gone far enough to protect the country has increased from 57% in January 2013 to 71% in December 2015, a rise of 14 points. This indicates a growing concern among Republicans that current anti-terrorism policies are insufficient.\n\nImage [1] visually supports this trend, showing a marked increase in the percentage of Republicans who think the government has not gone far enough to protect the country, peaking at 56% in December 2015. This is a stark contrast to earlier years, where the sentiment was more balanced. The data in image [1] also highlights that the percentage of Republicans who believe the government has gone too far in restricting civil liberties has remained relatively stable, suggesting that while there is a growing concern about the adequacy of anti-terrorism measures, there is less agreement on the extent of civil liberties restrictions.\n\nText [10] further emphasizes this shift, noting that in January 2014, 59% of Republicans felt the government was doing very or fairly well, but by December 2015, this figure had plummeted to just 18%. This dramatic decline underscores a significant erosion of confidence in the government's anti-terrorism efforts among Republicans.\n\n### Conclusion:\nRepublicans' views on government efforts to reduce the terrorist threat have become increasingly critical, with a substantial increase in the belief that current policies are not sufficient, as depicted in both the text and the image data.\n\n![Republicans' views on government efforts to reduce the terrorist threat have become increasingly critical, with a substantial increase in the belief that current policies are not sufficient](image1)"}

According to the data, foreign-born Hispanics are most likely to say they have Hispanic friends, with 59% reporting this. This likelihood decreases with each subsequent generation: 49% among second-generation Hispanics and 35% among third or higher generation Hispanics. This trend is illustrated in **image1**, which shows a clear decline in the percentage of self-identified Hispanics with Hispanic friends as the generation increases. The data suggests that as individuals become more assimilated into American culture, they are less likely to maintain friendships with people from their ancestral country.\n\nThe decline in the likelihood of having Hispanic friends is also reflected in the composition of social networks, as shown in **image6**, which indicates that 77% of immigrant Latinos have all or most Hispanic friends, compared to 55% of second-generation Latinos and 37% of third or higher generation Latinos. This pattern highlights the role of generational assimilation in shaping social connections.\n\n### Evidence:\n- **Text Quote [6]**: \"Most (77%) immigrant Latinos say all or most of their friends are Latinos.

For CTB, the improvement is less pronounced, and the performance stabilizes at around 20 demonstration samples.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- **With Logical Constraints**: Incorporating logical constraints into the demonstrations consistently improves Micro-F1 performance. The left graph in image1 illustrates that MAVEN-ERE benefits more from logical constraints, with a noticeable jump in performance from 1 to 5 demonstration samples. However, further increases in the number of demonstrations yield diminishing returns, indicating that beyond a certain point, additional demonstrations do not significantly enhance performance.\n- **Without Logical Constraints**: The performance improvement is less pronounced, as shown by the right graph in image1. The performance of CTB with logical constraints is more stable, suggesting that logical constraints play a crucial role in optimizing performance.\n\n**Conclusion**:\nThe number of demonstration samples positively affects Micro-F1 performance, with logical constraints providing a more substantial boost.

It consists of a recurrent encoder, attention mechanism, and a recurrent decoder. The decoder receives information from the encoder but does not receive any additional information from another task's decoder. This setup is straightforward, focusing solely on the task it is trained for.\n\n**Multitask Model (Figure 1b):**\n- The multitask model, as shown in [12], shares the encoder between two tasks but uses separate decoders for each task. The key difference lies in the attention mechanism. The multitask model's decoder receives information from the encoder and also incorporates attention from the other task's decoder. This is illustrated in [9], where the second task's decoder receives information from the first task's decoder, allowing it to leverage higher-level intermediate representations.\n\n**Attention Mechanism:**\n- In the multitask model, the second task's decoder has access to the output states of the first task's decoder, as highlighted in [6]. This is crucial for the multitask model to utilize transitivity and invertibility, as explained in [4] and [8]. The attention matrices in Figure 2 (image5) visually demonstrate this: the translation decoder in the multitask model receives more context from the transcription decoder, indicated by higher attention weights in $\\mathbf{A}^{12}$ compared to the single-task model.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe multitask model differs from the single-task model by allowing the second task's decoder to receive information from the first task's decoder, enhancing its ability to utilize transitivity and invertibility, which improves performance in low-resource settings.\n\n![Figure 1b differs from Figure 1a by allowing the second task's decoder to receive information from the first task's decoder, enhancing its ability to utilize transitivity and invertibility.](image1)\n\nThe multitask model's decoder receives additional context from the first task's decoder, improving performance through transitivity and invertibility."}

The main components and their functions are as follows:\n\n1. **Multimodal Retriever**:\n   - **Function**: The multimodal retriever is responsible for querying a large multimodal external memory or database to find information relevant to the input query or context. It encodes and stores a large volume of image and text embeddings for quick and accurate retrieval.\n   - **Mechanism**: As depicted in **image1(a)**, the retriever uses an image encoder to process input images and an index system based on the HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World) algorithm to efficiently store and retrieve embeddings. This ensures fast and accurate retrieval of relevant category labels and image embeddings.\n\n2. **Retrieving & Ranking**:\n   - **Function**: After retrieving the top-k class names most similar to the input image, the MLLMs rank these candidates to make the final prediction.\n   - **Mechanism**: The retrieved categories are integrated with the image embeddings and sent to the MLLMs through a ranking prompt, as shown in **image1(b)**. The MLLMs combine internal knowledge with retrieved information to rank the candidates, enhancing few-shot and zero-shot perception capabilities.\n   - **Prompt Design**: The prompt guides the MLLMs to rank the retrieved results, as illustrated in **image6**, where the MLLM sorts candidate categories based on similarity to the input image.\n\n3. **Memory Integration**:\n   - **Function**: The retrieved results are stored in a memory bank, which is used to augment the MLLMs' knowledge base.\n   - **Mechanism**: The memory bank, shown in **image1(a)**, stores embeddings and labels, allowing the system to leverage historical data for better predictions. This integration is crucial for handling a wide variety of images and categories with high precision.\n\n4. **Pre-processing for Detection Datasets**:\n   - **Function**: Special pre-processing steps like cropping, blurring, and resizing are applied to focus the MLLMs on relevant objects in object detection tasks.\n   - **Mechanism**: As shown in **image3(a)**, bounding boxes are used to crop and resize image regions, and blurring is applied to non-target areas to direct the MLLMs' focus, as detailed in **"}

The table shows how different weights influence the NIDF (Normalized Inverse Document Frequency) and the resulting responses.\n\n### Analysis of the Weighted Decoding Response Table (image1)\n\n- **Weight -5.0**: The response is \"Oh........\" with a high NIDF of 0.6%. This indicates that the model is generating a very rare response, likely due to the negative weight pushing it towards extreme specificity.\n- **Weight 0.0**: The response is \"That sounds like a lot of fun!\" with a moderate NIDF of 17.1%. This suggests a more generic response, as the weight is neutral.\n- **Weight 3.0**: The response is \"That sounds like a lot of fun! How long have you been studying?\" with a slightly higher NIDF of 18.3%. The addition of a question shows a slight increase in specificity.\n- **Weight 7.0**: The response is \"I majored in practicing my spiritual full time philosophy test\" with a much higher NIDF of 38.5%.

Image2 depicts the 'Generate-then-Rank' and 'Feedback-Guided Decoding' strategies, where outputs are generated first and then refined using external feedback. This strategy is particularly effective in tasks like summarization and code generation, where factual accuracy and reasoning consistency are paramount. The use of external tools and knowledge sources ensures that the model can correct errors and improve output quality iteratively, making the process more robust and reliable.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe 'Post-hoc Correction with External Feedback' strategy enhances output refinement by incorporating external knowledge and feedback, leading to more accurate and consistent results."}

The process starts by selecting the top-k most relevant root nodes based on their cosine similarity to the query embedding. It then considers the children of these nodes at the next layer, again selecting the top-k nodes, and continues this process until reaching the leaf nodes. This method allows for a controlled and stepwise focus on specificity and breadth, starting broad and progressively narrowing down to finer details (as described in [8] and [9]).\n\n- **Collapsed Tree Retrieval** (image3) simplifies the retrieval process by flattening the multi-layered tree into a single layer. All nodes are considered simultaneously, which means the algorithm evaluates nodes across all layers at once to find the most relevant ones. This approach is depicted in [10] and allows for a simultaneous search, potentially retrieving information at the correct level of granularity for a given question without the need to traverse layers sequentially.\n\nThe key difference lies in the sequential vs. simultaneous search strategy, with Tree Traversal offering a more granular, stepwise approach and Collapsed Tree providing a broader, simultaneous search (as illustrated in image3).\n\n![Tree Traversal Retrieval](image3)  \n![Collapsed Tree Retrieval](image3)\n\n### Conclusion\n\nTree Traversal Retrieval explores the tree layer-by-layer, while Collapsed Tree Retrieval evaluates all nodes simultaneously, offering different levels of specificity and flexibility in information retrieval."}

The final user representation is the last hidden state of the GRU network. This approach leverages the long-term user representation to guide the short-term model, potentially capturing more stable user preferences over time.\n\n- **LSTUR-con (Figure 3b)**: This method concatenates the long-term and short-term user representations to form a unified user vector. The final user representation is the concatenation of both representations, which combines both long-term and short-term interests into a single vector. This approach aims to retain all information from both representations, potentially providing a more comprehensive user profile.\n\n![LSTUR-ini and LSTUR-con methods](image1)\n\nThese methods are compared in terms of performance, with LSTUR-con generally outperforming LSTUR-ini, as shown in the performance metrics in Table 1 and Figure 8.\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **LSTUR-ini**: By initializing the GRU with the long-term representation, the model starts with a stable user profile, which might help in capturing consistent user interests. However, it may not fully utilize recent browsing data.\n  \n- **LSTUR-con**: Concatenating both representations allows the model to leverage both long-term stability and short-term dynamics, potentially improving recommendation accuracy by combining diverse user interests.\n\n![LSTUR-ini and LSTUR-con performance comparison](image1)\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe key difference lies in the integration approach: LSTUR-ini uses the long-term representation to initialize the short-term model, while LSTUR-con combines both representations into a unified vector, leading to potentially better performance in capturing user interests."}

It uses techniques like chain-of-thought (IRCoT) to guide the retrieval process and iteratively improve the query based on the retrieved results. This method is particularly useful in complex search scenarios where the user's needs are not immediately clear or where the information sought is highly specialized.\n\n- **Recursive Retrieval** (Section [4]): This technique is used for hierarchical data processing, such as summarizing sections of a document or lengthy PDFs before performing a retrieval. It involves a secondary retrieval within the document to refine the search, embodying the recursive nature of the process. This is beneficial for graph-structured data sources where interconnected information needs to be extracted.\n\n- **Adaptive Retrieval** (Section [12]): Adaptive retrieval methods, exemplified by Flare and Self-RAG, allow the system to determine the optimal moments and content for retrieval.

These segments are independently encoded using a pretrained cross-lingual encoder and a pooling layer on top. Finally, using the embeddings from these segments, the model computes the triplet margin loss to optimize the embedding space, minimizing the distance between the \"better\" hypothesis and the \"anchors\" (source and reference).

It states that when repetition control is introduced, the question-asking rate is reduced. Specifically, at z=10, which should produce 100% questions, the actual rate is only 79.67%.\n- **Image Quote image1**: This image shows the conditional training response with different z values.

This reduction is due to the weighted decoding feature that discourages the use of bigrams that have appeared in previous utterances, which are common in many questions. To mitigate this, an extra setting (z=10 boost) was introduced, which allows the model to produce necessary question-asking bigrams without using the weighted decoding feature during beam search, but still uses it to rerank candidates after beam search.

Each domain has a specific set of slots that it focuses on, and the distribution of these slots is detailed in the table provided in image1.\n\n**Text Evidence:**\n- The dataset information is summarized in Table 1, which lists the slots for each domain. For example, the hotel domain includes slots like price, type, parking, stay, day, people, area, stars, internet, and name. The restaurant domain includes food, price, area, name, type, price range, stars, and name. The attraction domain includes area, name, and type, while the taxi domain includes destination, departure, arrive by, leave by, and day. The train domain includes leave at, people, arrive by, and day.\n\n**Image Evidence:**\n- Image1 provides a visual representation of the slots across different domains. It shows that the hotel domain has a wide range of slots, including both numerical and categorical data, such as price, type, and area. The restaurant domain focuses on food-related slots like food, price, and area. The attraction domain mainly deals with area and name, while the taxi domain includes slots related to travel times and destinations. The train domain includes slots related to departure and arrival times.\n\n**Analysis:**\n- The distribution of slots is not uniform across domains. The hotel domain has the most slots, indicating a broader range of tracking requirements. The restaurant domain also has a significant number of slots, focusing on dining-related information. The attraction and taxi domains have fewer slots, but they are specialized, with the attraction focusing on location and the taxi on travel logistics. The train domain, while having fewer slots, covers essential travel information.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe MultiWOZ dataset is designed to provide a comprehensive view of dialogue state tracking across multiple domains, with a varied distribution of slots that reflect real-world conversational needs. This diversity helps in developing models that can handle complex, multi-domain interactions.\n\n![Data Distribution in MultiWOZ](image1)\n\nThe MultiWOZ dataset is distributed across different slots with a focus on various domains, where the hotel domain has the most slots, followed by the restaurant, attraction, taxi, and train domains, each with specialized slot sets."}

It consists of three layers: the first layer is a word embedding layer, the second layer is a convolutional neural network (CNN), and the third layer is an attention network. The CNN layer captures local context information from the news titles, which is crucial for understanding semantic meaning. The attention network highlights important words to create informative representations.\n\n2. **Topic Encoder**: This module learns news representations from the topic and subtopic categories. It leverages the informative nature of topics and subtopics to reveal the general and detailed topics of the news, reflecting user preferences. For example, if a user frequently browses news with the \"Sports\" topic, the model can infer their interest in sports-related content.\n\n![{The two sub-modules within the news encoder are the Title Encoder and the Topic Encoder.}](image1)\n\nThe text [1] and [4] describe the architecture of the news encoder, while image1 visually illustrates these components.

(6) for randomly masking long-term user representation in model training. We vary the value of \\( p \\) from 0.0 to 0.9 with a step of 0.1 for both LSTUR-ini and LSTUR-con.

The performance is measured using AUC, MRR, and nDCG@5 and nDCG@10. According to the results summarized in Fig. 8 (Image8), the performance of both methods improves as \\( p \\) increases from 0. When \\( p \\) is too small, the model tends to overfit on LTUR, and when \\( p \\) is too large, the performance declines. A moderate value of \\( p \\) (e.g., 0.5) is optimal for both methods.\n\nImage8 provides a visual representation of this relationship. For both LSTUR-ini and LSTUR-con, the AUC (and other metrics) initially increase as \\( p \\) increases, reaching a peak at around \\( p = 0.5 \\), and then start to decline as \\( p \\) continues to increase.

According to the text quotes, the COMET-RANK model, which uses both reference and source translations, outperforms the COMET-RANK model that uses only the reference translation in seven out of eight language pairs. This indicates that the reference translations provide crucial information that improves the model's ability to correlate with human judgments. The text also highlights that the source translations, while not included in the concatenated input, contribute to the model's performance when used in combination with the reference translations, as seen in the improvement of segment-level performance in some language pairs.\n\nThe most significant improvement is observed in the `en-zh` language pair, where the COMET-RANK metric achieves a Kendall Tau score of 0.445, which is notably higher than the score of 0.378 when using only the reference translation.

This is achieved through the following steps:\n\n1. **BERT Encoding**: The model uses a pre-trained BERT model to encode both the dialogue context and the domain-slot pairs. This encoding process is crucial as it provides contextualized representations that are conditioned on the domain-slot information.\n\n2. **Slot Gate Mechanism**: The model includes a slot gate to handle special types of values. For non-categorical slots, a two-way linear mapping is used to find text spans within the dialogue context. For categorical slots, the model selects the most plausible values from the picklists based on the contextual representation.\n\n3. **Cosine Similarity Matching**: The relevance score between the aggregated representation and a reference candidate is calculated using cosine similarity, as mentioned in the text [1]. This score helps in determining the best match between the candidate values and the dialogue context.\n\n4. **Direct Interactions**: Unlike previous approaches that separately encode dialog context and domain-slot pairs, DS-DST enables direct interactions between them, which is a key factor in its effectiveness, as highlighted in the text [6].\n\nThe architecture of the DS-DST model is illustrated in image8, showing how BERT encodes the dialogue context and domain-slot pairs, and how the cosine similarity matching is used to find the best candidate values.\n\n![{Direct interactions between dialog context and domain-slot pairs for DST}](image8)\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe DS-DST model determines the matching between candidate values and the dialogue context by leveraging BERT's contextualized representations, a slot gate mechanism, and cosine similarity matching, ensuring strong interactions between the domain-slot pairs and the dialogue context.

These mechanisms include:\n\n1. **Base Excision Repair (BER)**: This pathway is used for single-strand point mutations affecting one or a few bases of one DNA strand. It involves the recognition of the damaged base by a glycosylase enzyme, followed by its removal and the addition of a new normal base by a polymerase enzyme. The process is completed by ligase to restore the DNA backbone.\n\n2. **Nucleotide Excision Repair (NER)**: This is a critical repair system for removing bulky DNA lesions such as UV-induced pyrimidine dimers and other adducts. It involves the excision of the damaged segment and the synthesis of a new DNA strand to replace it.\n\n3. **Mismatch Repair (MMR)**: This mechanism corrects mismatched or unpaired bases resulting from errors during DNA replication. It involves the identification of the mutated strand, removal of the mismatched sequence, and the addition of the correct bases.\n\n4. **Direct Reversal Repair**: This mechanism directly repairs certain types of damage, such as UV-induced pyrimidine dimers, without the need for incision or synthesis of new DNA strands. It uses enzymes like DNA photolyase for light-dependent repair.\n\n5. **Recombination Repair**: This pathway is primarily used to repair double-strand breaks, which are the most severe DNA lesions. It involves homologous recombination repair (HR) and non-homologous end-joining repair (NHEJ). HR uses undamaged homologous DNA as a template, while NHEJ directly ligates the ends, which can lead to genetic information loss.\n\nThese mechanisms work collaboratively to ensure the integrity of the genetic material, as described in the text [4], [5], [6], [7], and [12].\n\n![DNA Repair Mechanisms](image1)\n\n### Conclusion:\nFigure 11 demonstrates the key DNA repair mechanisms: Base Excision Repair, Nucleotide Excision Repair, Mismatch Repair, Direct Reversal Repair, and Recombination Repair."}

CodeBERT learns general-purpose representations that support downstream NL-PL applications such as natural language code search, code documentation generation, etc. We develop CodeBERT with Transformer-based neural architecture, and train it with a hybrid objective function that incorporates the pre-training task of replaced token detection, which is to detect plausible alternatives sampled from generators. This enables us to utilize both “bimodal” data of NL-PL pairs and “unimodal” data, where the former provides input tokens for model training while the latter helps to learn better generators. We evaluate CodeBERT on two NL-PL applications by fine-tuning model parameters. Results show that CodeBERT achieves state-of-the-art performance on both natural language code search and code documentation generation. Furthermore, to investigate what type of knowledge is learned in CodeBERT, we construct a dataset for NL-PL probing, and evaluate in a zero-shot setting where parameters of pre-trained models are fixed.

We conduct experiments on the dataset of CodeNN (Iyer et al., 2016), which consists of 66,015 pairs of questions and answers automatically collected from StackOverflow. We evaluate models using smoothed BLEU-4 score and use the same evaluation scripts as Iyer et al. (2016).\n- [8] Figure 6 and Figure 7 show the outputs with different models for the code documentation generation task. As we can see, CodeBERT performs better than all baselines.\n- [9] Although the pre-training objective of CodeBERT does not include generation-based objectives (Lewis et al., 2019), we would like to investigate to what extent does CodeBERT perform on generation tasks. Specifically, we study code-to-NL generation, and report results for the documentation generation task on CodeSearchNet Corpus in six programming languages.

(2016), and use bi-directional LSTMs for both the character level and word level neural networks. Specifically, given an input sequence of words \\((w_{1},w_{2},...,w_{n})\\), and each word’s corresponding character sequence, the model first produces a representation for each word, \\(x_{i}\\), by concatenating its character representation with its word embedding.\"\n- **Text Quote [12]**: \"The hierarchical CRF model consists of three components: a character-level neural network, either an RNN or a CNN, that allows the model to capture subword information, such as morphological variations and capitalization patterns; a word-level neural network, usually an RNN, that consumes word representations and produces context sensitive hidden representations for each word; and a linear-chain CRF layer that models the dependency between labels and performs inference.\"\n\n### Answer Construction:\nThe model uses both word-level and character-level embeddings to leverage the strengths of each type of representation. Word embeddings capture semantic meaning and context, which are crucial for understanding the meaning of words in a sentence. However, they may not always capture morphological variations or capitalization patterns, which are important for identifying named entities. Character-level embeddings, on the other hand, are sensitive to these details and can help the model recognize words, especially in languages with complex morphology or when dealing with out-of-vocabulary words. By concatenating character-level and word-level embeddings, the model can benefit from both the semantic richness of word embeddings and the morphological precision of character embeddings. This dual approach enhances the model's ability to accurately identify and classify named entities, as demonstrated in the experiments with Spanish, Dutch, and German data.\n\n![Model Architecture](image3) shows how the model integrates both character-level and word-level embeddings, with a character-level Bi-LSTM capturing subword information and a word-level Bi-LSTM providing context-sensitive representations. This combination allows the model to handle variations in word forms and improve NER performance.\n\n### Quote Citation:\n- [6]: The architecture uses bi-directional LSTMs for both character and word levels, concatenating character representations"}

The process involves several key steps:\n\n1. **Bounding Box Annotation**: The image is divided into multiple regions using bounding boxes (e.g., `bbox1`, `bbox2`, `bbox3`). This step isolates potential objects of interest, ensuring that the model focuses on specific areas rather than the entire image.\n\n2. **Region Extraction**: Each bounding box is then processed individually by the image encoder. This allows the model to analyze each region separately, which is particularly important for object detection tasks where objects vary in size and position.\n\n3. **Blurring Non-Target Areas**: The regions outside the bounding boxes are blurred. This technique directs the model's attention to the relevant objects, reducing visual noise and distractions, thereby improving the model's focus on the objects of interest.\n\n4. **Embedding and Retrieval**: The extracted and processed regions are converted into embeddings and stored in a memory index. During inference, these embeddings are used to retrieve relevant categories from the memory bank.\n\nBy employing these pre-processing steps, the system effectively handles images with multiple objects, each at different scales and positions, which is common in object detection datasets. This approach ensures that the model can accurately identify and classify objects, even when they are not the dominant feature in the image.\n\n![Pre-processing Step Contribution](image8)\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe pre-processing step, as shown in **image8**, contributes to the zero-shot recognition system by isolating and focusing on specific regions of interest, reducing visual noise, and improving the model's ability to detect and classify objects accurately."}

According to the text quotes and the provided tables, the following observations can be made:\n\n1. **Abstract Removal**: Removing the abstract from the input text results in a substantial decrease in performance. This is evident from the comparison in Table 1, where the performance drops from 84.2 to 82.2 for classification (CLS), 88.4 to 72.2 for user activity prediction (USR), and 91.5 to 73.6 for citation prediction (CITE). This suggests that the abstract provides crucial information for document-level relatedness.\n\n2. **Adding Authors**: Adding authors as an input, along with the title and abstract, surprisingly hurts performance. This is shown in Table 1, where performance decreases from 84.2 to 82.7 for classification, 88.4 to 72.3 for user activity prediction, and 91.5 to 71.0 for citation prediction. The text quotes suggest that this might be due to the sparsity of author names in the corpus and suboptimal tokenization using Wordpieces, leading to noisy correlations.\n\n3. **Adding Venues**: Adding venues slightly decreases performance, except on document classification. This is noted in the text quotes, where it is mentioned that venues have high correlation, which makes sense for document classification tasks.\n\n4. **Hard Negatives**: The use of hard negative distractors in the citation-based fine-tuning objective is critical. Without hard negatives, performance on all tasks decreases, as shown in Table 1, where performance drops from 84.2 to 82.4 for classification, 88.4 to 85.8 for user activity prediction, and 91.5 to 89.8 for citation prediction.\n\n5. **Baseline Comparison**: The SPECTER model outperforms SciBERT when fine-tuned on task-specific signals, as shown in Table 3. This indicates that the citation-based pretraining objective is more effective for document-level tasks.\n\n6. **Ablation Study**: The ablation study in Table 2 confirms that the inclusion of the abstract is beneficial, while adding authors and venues can be detrimental. The performance is highest when the abstract is included, as seen in the average performance of 80.0 for SPECTER.\n\nThe visual evidence from image"}

Random on the leftmost denotes the class distribution of randomly queried samples, which can also reflect the approximate class distribution of the entire dataset. As seen, even with a relatively larger initial query budget (691 images, 2% of Organ AM NIST, and 2,391 images, 20% of BloodMNIST), most active querying strategies are biased towards certain classes. For example in Organ AM NIST, VAAL prefers selecting data in the femur-right and platelet class, but largely ignores data in the lung, liver and monocyte classes. On the contrary, our querying strategy not only selects more data from minority classes (e.g., femur-left and basophil) while retaining the class distribution of major classes.\"\n- **Image Quote [image1]:** The dataset map shows the distribution of confidence versus variability for PathMNIST, with two maps: one by ground truth and one by pseudo-labels.\n\n**Answer Construction:**\nFrom the text quote, we understand that the dataset map by pseudo-labels is used to evaluate the querying strategy's performance.

This modification is made because ground truths are unknown in the active learning setting but pseudo-labels are readily accessible from Criterion #1.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe dataset map by pseudo-labels has a larger confidence variance compared to the map by ground truth.\n\n```markdown\n![PathMNIST dataset map by ground truth and pseudo-labels](image1)\n\nThe dataset"}

This is highlighted in **image2**, which shows the detailed statistics of the MMMU dataset, including its distribution across disciplines, subjects, and subfields. The dataset covers **30 diverse image types**, including diagrams, tables, charts, chemical structures, photos, paintings, geometric shapes, music sheets, medical images, and more, as depicted in **image1**. This diversity in image types is a unique feature not seen in other benchmarks.\n   - In contrast, other benchmarks like VQA, GQA, and VisWiz, as shown in **image6**, have smaller sizes and fewer image types. For instance, VQA and GQA have over 1 million questions but focus on a limited set of image types, while VisWiz has 32K questions with a mix of image and text.\n\n2. **Reasoning Depth**:\n   - The MMMU benchmark is designed to test **expert-level reasoning** and requires models to integrate both textual and visual information, as emphasized in **image4**. It demands domain-specific knowledge and complex reasoning, going beyond basic visual perception. This is a significant challenge compared to benchmarks like VQA, GQA, and TextVQA, which focus on more straightforward visual question answering.\n   - **Image6** visually represents the depth and breadth of reasoning required in MMMU, placing it higher on the depth axis compared to other benchmarks. MMMU's interleaved text-image inputs necessitate advanced multimodal analysis and domain-specific knowledge, unlike the simpler formats of other benchmarks.\n\n3. **Breadth and Complexity**:\n   - The MMMU benchmark spans **six common disciplines** (Art & Design, Business, Science, Health & Medicine, Humanities & Social Sciences, and Tech & Engineering), covering **183 subfields**, as detailed in **image2**. This breadth is unmatched by other benchmarks, which often focus on daily knowledge and common sense.\n   - The complexity of MMMU is further highlighted by its requirement for **college-level knowledge** and the need to handle intricate visual inputs, as noted in **text quote [4]**. This complexity is a stark contrast to benchmarks like ScienceQA and OKVQA, which have smaller scopes"}

According to the text, head word supervision is particularly effective for ultra-fine labels, while crowdsourced data has the most substantial overall impact. Image [image4] illustrates that removing each source of supervision (crowdsourced, head word, and entity linking) individually results in a drop in performance. For instance, when head word supervision is excluded, the MaF1 score for Ultra-Fine drops from 75.0 to 64.2, indicating a notable decrease in precision and recall. This suggests that head word supervision is crucial for accurately predicting ultra-fine labels, aligning with the text's assertion that it is especially helpful"}

This alignment is crucial for the proper segregation of chromosomes during the subsequent division.\n\n2. **Spindle Attachment**: The spindle fibers attach to the kinetochores of the centromeres of each homologous chromosome. This attachment is essential for the movement of chromosomes during anaphase I.\n\n3. **Tetrad Formation**: Homologous chromosomes form tetrads, which are pairs of homologous chromosomes joined at the centromere. This is a visual representation of the pairing of homologous chromosomes, as described in quote [1].\n\n4. **Crossing Over**: Non-sister chromatids exchange genetic material through crossing over, which increases genetic diversity. This process is facilitated by the close proximity of homologous chromosomes during metaphase I.\n\n5. **Preparation for Separation**: The cell prepares for the separation of homologous chromosomes, which will occur during anaphase I. This separation reduces the chromosome number by half, as mentioned in quote [5].\n\n![Anaphase II](image1) illustrates the alignment of chromosomes at the metaphase plate, showing the homologous pairs ready for separation. The image highlights the structural arrangement of chromosomes during this critical phase of meiosis.\n\n![Metaphase I](image6) provides a detailed view of the metaphase plate, where homologous chromosomes are attached to spindle fibers and aligned, emphasizing the importance of this stage in ensuring genetic diversity and proper chromosome distribution.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nMetaphase I of meiosis is characterized by the alignment of homologous chromosomes at the metaphase plate, attachment of spindle fibers to kinetochores, and the formation of tetrads. These processes set the stage for the separation of homologous chromosomes during anaphase I, leading to the reduction of chromosome number by half.\n\n![Anaphase II](image1) ![Metaphase I](image6)"}

This is a critical step as it signals the end of mitosis.\n- **Nucleoli and Nuclear Envelope**: The nucleoli, which are sites of ribosome assembly, reappear, and the nuclear envelope reforms around the chromosomes, as depicted in image2. This process restores the cell's nuclear structure, preparing it for the next phase of cytokinesis.\n\n**Cytokinesis**:\n- **Plasma Membrane and Cell Wall Formation**: In prokaryotic cells, cytokinesis involves the formation of a cell plate from vesicles containing cell wall material, which grows outward to divide the cell, as described in quote [10] and illustrated in image4. In eukaryotic cells, the plasma membrane invaginates to form a cleavage furrow, which eventually pinches the cell into two daughter cells, as shown in image6. This process ensures that each daughter cell receives a complete set of organelles and cytoplasm.\n- **Cleavage Furrow**: The cleavage furrow, as seen in image6, is a key feature during cytokinesis in eukaryotic cells, where the contracting ring of microfilaments (depicted in image6) helps to constrict the cell and separate it into two cells.\n\n**Image Analysis**:\n- **Image2** shows the reformation of the nuclear envelope and the nucleoli, indicating the end of telophase.\n- **Image6** illustrates the cleavage furrow and the contracting ring of microfilaments during cytokinesis, highlighting the process of cell division in eukaryotic cells.\n\n### Conclusion\nDuring telophase, chromosomes decondense and the nuclear envelope reforms, while during cytokinesis, the cell is divided by the formation of a cleavage furrow in eukaryotic cells or a cell plate in prokaryotic cells, ensuring the distribution of cellular contents into two daughter cells.\n\n![Cellular structures during telophase and cytokinesis](image2) ![Cleavage furrow during cytokinesis](image6)"}

Mendel's experiments with pea plants demonstrated that traits are inherited as discrete units, now known as genes, which are located on chromosomes. Each parent contributes one allele for each trait to their offspring.\n\nIn the example of pea plant flower color, Mendel used true-breeding plants (P generation) with contrasting traits: purple flowers (PP) and white flowers (pp). The F1 generation, resulting from the cross, all had purple flowers (Pp), indicating that the purple allele (P) is dominant over the white allele (p). When these F1 plants are self-pollinated, the F2 generation exhibits a 3:1 phenotypic ratio of purple to white flowers.

All the countries reviewed are parties to the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees and its 1967 Protocol, except for India and Saudi Arabia. In all the other surveyed jurisdictions, these issues are governed by national laws and executive regulations issued by authorities in charge of resolving migration-related issues.

In some countries (Argentina, Mexico, Russia, South Africa, and Turkey), a time limit for the period when an application can be submitted is in place. Canada and Mexico each accept asylum applications from outside of the country. Canada processes such applications as a part of its visa application process, while Mexico allows submitting a petition from outside of the country for political asylum only. Brazil, as a party to the Convention on Diplomatic Asylum of the Organization of American States, allows applicants to request diplomatic asylum in Brazilian embassies abroad. Australia and Canada allow humanitarian protection and refugee status requests from abroad when protection is sought through a resettlement program administered by the United Nations, another designated referral agency, or by private sponsorship.

The word is composed of various shapes and patterns that adhere to several Gestalt principles:\n\n1. **Similarity (Similaridade):** The letters are grouped based on their visual similarity in shape and color, creating a cohesive unit. For example, the black and white striped patterns are grouped together, and the red vertical line is a distinct element that stands out.\n   \n2. **Closure (Fechamento):** The word \"GESTALT\" is designed with incomplete shapes, but our perception fills in the gaps to see the complete letters. The dashed lines and open spaces are perceived as whole shapes rather than fragmented parts.\n   \n3. **Continuity (Continuidade):** The arrangement of the letters follows a continuous flow, guiding the viewer's eye smoothly from one letter to the next. The horizontal and vertical lines create a sense of continuity.\n   \n4. **Proximity (Proximidade):** Elements that are visually close together are perceived as belonging to the same group. The letters are arranged in a way that maintains proximity, enhancing the overall unity of the word.\n   \n5. **Unidade (Unity):** The overall design creates a unified whole, despite the use of different"}

The closure principle states that we tend to perceive objects as whole when they are not complete, filling in the gaps to see them as complete shapes. In the provided image, circles are arranged in a grid pattern with some missing parts, and our perception fills in the gaps to see them as complete circles.\n\n![Closure](image1)\n\nThis visual demonstrates how the mind completes incomplete shapes, aligning with the Gestalt principle of closure. The arrangement of circles in a grid pattern, with some parts missing, allows the viewer to perceive the shapes as whole, even though they are not fully drawn. This is a classic example of how the brain seeks simplicity and completeness in visual perception.\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Text Quote [9]**: \"Closure. We tend to perceive objects such as shapes, letters, pictures, etc., as being whole when they are not complete.

According to the text quotes, the ECU is a generic term for any embedded system that controls one or more electrical systems or subsystems in a motor vehicle ([2]). It is responsible for controlling the opening of injectors ([3]), adjusting fuel injection based on parameters like throttle position and engine temperature ([4]), managing ignition timing ([5]), and controlling idle speed ([6]). The ECU monitors engine operating conditions and reports this information to the Engine Control Module (ECM) ([9]), which is essentially the same as the ECU. It uses data from multiple sensors, such as the Engine Temp Sensor, Intake Air Temp Sensor, Mass Air Flow Sensor, Throttle Position Sensor, and others, to regulate the opening and closing of injector valves ([7]). \n\nIn the diagrams, the ECU is shown as the central component that receives input from various sensors and sends control signals to the fuel injectors ([image1]). It processes this information to determine the precise amount of fuel to inject, ensuring efficient combustion and optimal engine performance. The ECU also adjusts the ignition timing to enhance power and economy ([5]). The block diagram in [image2] illustrates the ECU's role in the fuel supply and air supply systems, highlighting its control over subsystems like the cold start system and fuel metering system. \n\nThe ECU's role is further emphasized by its ability to read values from multidimensional maps calculated by sensor devices, allowing it to make real-time adjustments to fuel, ignition timing, and other parameters necessary for the engine's operation ([11]). This integration of data and control ensures that the engine operates efficiently under different conditions, from cold starts to full load operations.\n\n![Engine Control Unit (ECU) as the central component in engine management system](image1)\n\n![Subsystem control by ECU](image2)\n\nThe ECU's role in the engine management system is to monitor, process, and control various engine parameters to ensure efficient and optimal performance, as depicted in the diagrams and described in the text."}
{"q_id": 1957, "model": "InternVL3-8B", "in_tok": 13333, "out_tok": 303, "total_tok": 13636, "response": "### Answer\n\nThe three steps of binary fission of a prokaryotic cell are:\n\n1. **Duplication of chromosome and separation of copies**: As shown in image1, the prokaryotic chromosome duplicates, and the copies begin to separate from each other. This process ensures that each new cell will have a complete set of genetic material. The image illustrates the duplication and separation of the circular chromosome, which is a key step in binary fission.\n\n2. **Cell elongation and movement of copies**: Image8 depicts the cell elongating and the chromosomal copies moving further apart. This elongation is crucial for positioning the duplicated chromosomes at opposite ends of the cell, preparing for the final division.\n\n3. **Division into two daughter cells**: The final step involves the cell membrane growing inward at the midpoint, as illustrated in image8, to divide the cell into two daughter cells, each containing one set of the duplicated chromosomes. This results in two identical cells, each with a complete copy of the genetic material.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe three steps of binary fission in prokaryotic cells are the duplication of the chromosome, cell elongation and movement of copies, and the division into two daughter cells. These steps ensure the accurate replication and distribution of genetic material, leading to the formation of two genetically identical cells.\n\n![Duplication and separation of copies](image1)  \n![Cell elongation and movement of copies](image8)  \n![Division into two daughter cells](image8)"}

In standard consumption economics, as illustrated by the hot dog consumption chart in image1, the utility from each additional hot dog decreases. Initially, the first hot dog provides a high utility of +6, but as more hot dogs are consumed, the utility drops to +2, 0, -2, and eventually becomes negative. This reflects the principle of diminishing marginal utility, where each additional unit of a good provides less satisfaction than the previous one.\n\nIn competitive contexts, as shown in image1, the utility can change dramatically. For example, Joey Chestnut's consumption of hot dogs in the 2007 championship is depicted in the chart. Initially, each hot dog provides a positive utility, but as he approaches the point where he ties with Kobayashi, the utility from each additional hot dog increases significantly, reaching +5000 and +10000. This illustrates how competitive pressure can override diminishing marginal utility, leading to higher utility from continued consumption.\n\nIn competitive environments, the focus on winning or achieving a goal can enhance the enjoyment and utility derived from an activity, as seen in image7, where practice makes the game more fun and likely to win. This contrasts with standard consumption, where diminishing marginal utility typically leads to a decrease in enjoyment with continued consumption.\n\n### Evidence Selection and Citation\n\n- **Text Quote [2]**: \"Variety is important because diminishing marginal utility changes preferences. When enjoyment drops we should switch to another choice.\"\n- **Image Quote image1**: The chart shows diminishing marginal utility in standard consumption, with utility decreasing as more hot dogs are consumed. However, in competitive contexts, utility can increase, as seen in the point where Joey Chestnut ties with Kobayashi.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn standard consumption, diminishing marginal utility leads to a decrease in enjoyment with each additional unit. In competitive contexts, however, the utility can increase, as illustrated by Joey Chestnut's consumption in the 2007 championship, where the utility from each additional hot dog becomes significantly higher as he approaches the competitive threshold. This highlights the importance of context in understanding how preferences and enjoyment are influenced by consumption patterns."}

On-campus supermarkets, such as those located in the Wudaokou area, are open from 9:00am to 9:00pm every day. This extended operating time provides students with more flexibility to shop during their free time, as they can visit the supermarket without worrying about closing times. For example, the Lotus Supermarket and BHG Supermarket in the Wudaokou area are open until 9:00pm, allowing students to shop late into the evening. \n\nIn contrast, off-campus supermarkets, like the Tmall campus stores and Zhaolananyuan Supermarket, have different operating hours. The Tmall campus stores are open from 8:30am to 11:30pm, which is also quite flexible, but the Zhaolananyuan Supermarket operates from 8:30am to 8:00pm. This shorter closing time might require students to plan their shopping trips earlier in the day or ensure they complete their shopping before the supermarket closes.\n\nThe differences in opening hours can affect students' schedules by providing more options for evening shopping on campus, which can be convenient for those who prefer to shop after classes or during their free time. However, off-campus supermarkets might be more suitable for students who need to shop earlier in the day or prefer the convenience of longer hours.\n\n![Supermarket Hours Comparison](image4) ![Supermarket Hours Comparison](image8)\n\n### Conclusion\n\nOn-campus supermarkets generally offer longer operating hours, which can be more convenient for students who need to shop in the evening. Off-campus supermarkets, while also open for extended periods, may have shorter closing times, potentially limiting shopping options for those who prefer to shop later in the day. This can influence students' decisions based on their personal schedules and preferences."}

It is divided into three sub-phases:\n  - **G1 Phase (Gap 1)**: The cell grows and performs its normal functions. It also checks for DNA damage and prepares for DNA replication.\n  - **S Phase (Synthesis)**: DNA replication occurs, and each chromosome is duplicated, resulting in sister chromatids. This is where chromosomes duplicate, as mentioned in [1] and [2].\n  - **G2 Phase (Gap 2)**: The cell continues to grow and prepares for mitosis by producing proteins and organelles necessary for cell division.\n\n- **Mitotic Phase (M Phase)**: This is the phase where the cell divides its contents into two daughter cells. It includes:\n  - **Mitosis**: The division of the nucleus, where chromosomes align and separate into the two daughter cells. This is depicted in [4] and [6], where chromosomes duplicate during the S phase and the cell elongates as the chromosomal copies separate.\n  - **Cytokinesis**: The division of the cytoplasm, which follows mitosis, ensuring that each daughter cell receives a complete set of organelles and cytoplasmic components.\n\nThe cell cycle is crucial for growth, development, and repair in multicellular organisms, as illustrated in [11] and [12].\n\n![Interphase](image1) shows the stages of interphase, highlighting the G1, S, and G2 phases. ![Centromere](image2) illustrates the centromere and sister chromatids, which are key components during chromosome separation. ![Spindle Microtubules](image6) depicts the formation of the mitotic spindle, essential for chromosome segregation.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe main stages of the cell cycle are **Interphase** (G1, S, G2) and **Mitotic Phase** (Mitosis, Cytokinesis). Interphase prepares the cell for division, while the Mitotic Phase ensures the accurate distribution of genetic material and cellular components to daughter cells."}
