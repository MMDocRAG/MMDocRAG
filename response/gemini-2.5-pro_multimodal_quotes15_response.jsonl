At that time, more people were concerned that government policies had gone too far in restricting civil liberties (47%) than that they did not go far enough to protect the country (35%) [2]. Today, within the Democratic party, liberal Democrats are more divided: 41% say policies have gone too far in restricting civil liberties, and an equal 41% worry more that policies haven't gone far enough to protect the country. In contrast, conservative and moderate Democrats (67%) align more with Republicans in prioritizing security [7].\n\nOverall, opinions among different age groups show younger adults are divided while older adults prioritize security, and across political affiliations, there's a growing consensus, particularly among Republicans, that anti-terrorism policies have not gone far enough, marking a significant shift since 2013."}

Specifically, \"45% of those with a postgraduate degree believe U.S. influence will decline, compared to 21% of those with a high school diploma or less\" [10]. This trend is also evident in the chart (image1), where those with postgraduate (45%) and college grad (37%) degrees are more likely to say U.S. influence will be less compared to those with some college (26%) or HS or less (21%) education [8].\n\n**China's Influence:**\nRegarding China's future influence, half of Americans believe it will decline after the coronavirus outbreak [6].

This sentiment is further emphasized by the finding that about three-quarters of Republicans want the U.S. to deal with its own problems and let other countries manage as best they can [10].\n![Republicans' views on U.S. global engagement show 76% believe the U.S. should deal with its own problems, with 22% of conservatives and 24% of moderate/liberal Republicans agreeing.](image1)\nHistorically, the partisan gap on this issue was more modest, but by 2020, 62% of Republicans thought the U.S. does too much in helping address global challenges [1].\n![A line graph shows that in 2020, 62% of Republicans felt the U.S. does \"Too much\" in helping solve world problems, a significant increase from previous years.](image4)\n\nConversely, Democrats are more inclined to support U.S. involvement in global problem-solving.

The survey data shows that 37% rated Trump's response as excellent or good, while 63% rated it as only fair or poor (with 48% specifically saying poor).\n*   Positive evaluations for state government officials fell from 70% to 56%, and for local government officials from 69% to 60% [5].\n    *   Image4 shows 56% rating state elected officials as excellent or good.\n    *   Image4 shows 60% rating local elected officials as excellent or good.\nIn contrast, local hospitals and medical centers maintained overwhelmingly positive views, with 88% rating their response as excellent or good, a figure unchanged over the preceding months [5].\n\nWhen it comes to the reasons for the continued outbreak, most Americans expressed concern that states have been too quick to lift COVID-19 restrictions [8].\n![69% of U.S. adults say coronavirus outbreak restrictions in some places have been lifted too quickly, while 30% say they have not been lifted quickly enough.](image2)\nThree-quarters of Americans (75%) say a major reason the outbreak has continued is that too few people are abiding by guidelines about social distancing and mask-wearing. A smaller majority (58%) cites the lifting of restrictions too quickly in some places as a major reason [8].\n![Bar chart showing U.S. adults' views on reasons the coronavirus outbreak has continued, with 75% citing not enough people social distancing and mask-wearing as a major reason.](image1)\nOther major reasons identified include an inadequate response from the federal government (53%) and not enough timely testing (49%). Democrats are more likely than Republicans to say these factors are major reasons, with significant partisan differences on whether the federal government response is inadequate (82% of Democrats vs. 21% of Republicans) and whether lifting restrictions too quickly is a major cause (82% of Democrats vs. 31% of Republicans) [9].\n\nAmericans view public health officials more favorably than elected officials like Donald Trump or state leaders in handling COVID-19, though confidence has declined, and they primarily attribute the ongoing outbreak to insufficient public adherence to safety measures and the premature easing of restrictions."}

Republicans are also more likely to disapprove (19% vs. 8% for Democrats) or say they are not sure (42% vs. 32% for Democrats) [8].\n\nWhen it comes to voting methods, particularly no-excuse absentee or early voting, there are significant partisan divides.\n```json\n![Overall, 63% believe any voter should have the option to vote early or absentee, while 36% think a documented reason should be required.](image4)\n```\nImage4 shows that while a majority of Democrats/Lean Democrats (84%) believe any voter should have the option to vote early or absentee, a majority of Republicans/Lean Republicans (62%) think a voter should only be allowed to do so if they have a documented reason [9].\n\nThis difference is further nuanced by how Republicans voted in the 2020 election. Republicans who voted early or absentee in November 2020 are more likely to favor no-excuse absentee or early voting compared to those who voted in person [2, 10].\n```json\n![Among Republicans/Lean Republicans, 52% of those who voted absentee support no-excuse early/absentee voting, compared to 35% who voted in person before Election Day and 22% who voted in person on Election Day.](image3)\n```\nSpecifically, 52% of Republicans who voted absentee or by mail favor no-excuse absentee or early voting, while only about a third (35%) of early, in-person GOP voters and 22% of those who voted in person on Election Day share this view [7]. This contrasts with Democrats, among whom there are only slight differences in these views based on how they voted [7]. There was also a notable difference in how Republicans and Democrats voted in the 2020 presidential election, with 58% of Democratic voters casting ballots absentee or by mail, compared to 34% of Republican voters [4].\n\nIdeology within the Republican party also plays a role. Conservative Republicans are substantially more likely (70%) to say voters should be required to provide documented reasons for voting absentee or early, compared to 30% who say it shouldn't be necessary. Among moderate and liberal Republicans, opinion is more evenly divided (49% for documented reasons, 51% against) [9].\n\nDemocrats generally support no-excuse early and absentee voting and independent redistricting commissions more strongly than Republicans, whose views on voting methods are notably influenced by their own recent voting experiences and ideological leanings."}

The future party affiliation of Latino registered voters remains uncertain, partly because a 2021 study found that substantial shares of Latino voters have \"soft ties\" to the political parties [10]. This suggests that while recent years have not seen major shifts in party allegiance, there is potential for change.\n\nLatino voters' views on party differences are currently split, and despite a significant portion not seeing major distinctions, their overall party affiliations have remained largely stable in recent years, though soft party ties indicate potential for future realignment."}

A major challenge is gender discrimination. Women in STEM jobs are much more likely than men to report experiencing discrimination at work due to their gender [3]. About half of women in STEM jobs (48%) believe gender discrimination in recruitment, hiring, and promotions is a major reason for the underrepresentation of women in these fields, a view shared by a smaller percentage of men in STEM (29%) [10].\n\n![39% cite discrimination in recruitment, hiring, and promotion as a major reason more women are not in STEM jobs.](image3)\n\nThis perception of discrimination is a significant barrier.

Following this, 41% of U.S. adults say a major reason is that blacks and Hispanics are \"not encouraged to pursue STEM from early age\" (see image1, [6]). Discrimination is also a key factor, with 31% of U.S. adults citing \"face discrimination in recruitment, hiring, promotion\" (see image1).

Germany has a moderate motor vehicle population and a smaller, yet substantial, CO2 emissions bubble. China, while having a lower motor vehicle population per 1,000 people, still has a large CO2 emissions bubble, reflecting its large overall population and industrial activity, though its *per capita* motorization is much lower than the USA or Germany.\n\nThe transportation sector is a major contributor to CO2 emissions [3]. Globally, transportation accounts for about 20.0% of CO2 emissions, and in industrialized OECD economies, this figure rises to 30.0% [4].\n![Pie chart showing transport accounts for 24% of emissions.](image4)\nThis highlights the environmental impact of high motor vehicle ownership and usage. Furthermore, emissions from vehicles are not just limited to CO2; they also include harmful substances like benzene, a known human carcinogen linked to increased leukemia [1], and other combustion products that are probable or known human carcinogens [8]. Traffic pollution has been estimated to cause significant annual deaths [10].\n\nGiven its high per capita energy consumption and high motor vehicle ownership, the USA likely has a substantial per capita environmental impact from transportation. Germany, while having lower figures than the USA, still maintains a significant impact due to its industrialized nature and motorization levels. China's impact is characterized by lower per capita motor vehicle ownership but significant total CO2 emissions due to its large population and growing economy, with potential for increasing environmental impact as motorization rises.\n\nThe USA has higher CO2 emissions per capita and motor vehicle ownership than Germany and China, implying a greater individual environmental impact from transportation, while China's large total emissions reflect its overall scale."}

Proportionally, Europe is producing higher exit multiples.

These lower entry valuations and higher capital efficiency help to offset the smaller exit values [1].\n\nRegarding specific exit routes like IPOs, European performance is also competitive. It has been observed that \"European VC-backed IPO performance matches or exceeds US performance, both pre- as well as post-IPO\" [6].\n![The Europe IPO Index Value has shown periods of outperformance compared to the U.S. IPO Index Value.](image1)\nThe Europe IPO Index Value, as shown in the graph, can outperform the U.S. IPO Index Value, indicating strong market reception for European VC-backed companies going public.\n\nIn summary, European venture capital delivers higher investment multiples and greater capital efficiency compared to the USA, despite having lower average exit values."}

This increased access to digital payment methods facilitated more online transactions.\n\nThe growth in e-commerce also correlates strongly with the age distribution of online buyers, who are predominantly young.\n`![This graphic presents the age distribution of online buyers, showing 35% in the 18-35 yrs category, 55% in the 26-35 yrs category, 8% in the 36-45 yrs category, and 2% in the 45+ yrs category.](image5)`\nThe data indicates that 55% of online buyers are aged 26-35 years, and another 35% are in the 18-35 years age group. This concentration shows that the vast majority of e-commerce consumers are younger than 36, and their tech-savviness and willingness to adopt online shopping and digital payments have been crucial to the sector's expansion.\n\nThe primary factors driving eCommerce growth from 2014 to 2018 were infrastructure development, increased smartphone and digital payment penetration, competitive pricing, and convenience, with this growth being strongly correlated with high adoption rates among younger demographics, particularly those aged 18-35."}

ISRO is the primary implementing body under DOS, alongside other specialized institutions and a commercial arm [3].\n![The organizational chart shows the Prime Minister overseeing the Space Commission, which directs the Department of Space, under which ISRO and other institutions like PRL, NARL, NE-SAC, SCL, IIST, and Antrix operate.](image2)\n\nSeveral key centers play distinct and significant roles:\n\n**Antrix Corporation Limited**, Bengaluru, is the commercial and marketing arm of ISRO. Established in 1992, it is a wholly owned Government of India Company responsible for promoting and commercially exploiting space products, providing technical consultancy services, and transferring technologies developed by ISRO [2, 3]. Antrix offers a wide array of space products and services to international customers, including hardware, software, spacecraft, remote sensing data, transponder leases, launch services via PSLV, mission support, consultancy, and training [4]. Its objective also includes fostering space-related industrial capabilities within India [2].\n\nThe **National Atmospheric Research Laboratory (NARL)**, located at Gadanki near Tirupati, is an autonomous society supported by DOS dedicated to atmospheric research. Its vision is to develop the capability to predict Earth's atmospheric behavior through observations and modeling [9]. NARL focuses on technology development, observations, data management, and modeling [9]. Its research activities are diverse, encompassing Radar Application and Development, Ionospheric and Space Research, Atmospheric Structure and Dynamics, Cloud and Convective Systems, Aerosols, Radiation and Trace Gases, and Weather and Climate Research [8].\n![The image displays the MST Radar antenna array at NARL, Gadanki, used for atmospheric research.](image3)\n\nThe **Semi-Conductor Laboratory (SCL)** in Chandigarh, an autonomous body under DOS, is crucial for establishing a strong microelectronics base in India and advancing capabilities in the VLSI (Very Large Scale Integration) domain [10]. SCL's activities are centered on the Design, Development, Fabrication, Assembly, Testing, and Reliability Assurance of CMOS and MEMS (Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems) Devices [10].\n![The image shows the interior of SCL's clean room facilities, with personnel in protective gear operating advanced fabrication equipment.](image5)\n\nThe **Indian Institute of Space Science and Technology (IIST)**, established in Thiruvananthapuram in 2007, is Asia’s first Space University. Its primary objective is to provide high-quality education in space science and technology to meet the human resource demands of the Indian Space Programme [5, 7]. IIST offers undergraduate degrees in Space Technology (Avionics and Aerospace Engineering) and an Integrated Masters Programme in Applied Sciences, with a strong emphasis on research across various departments [5].\n\nThe **North Eastern-Space Applications Centre (NE-SAC)** in Shillong is a joint initiative of DOS and the North Eastern Council (NEC). It aims to provide developmental support to the North Eastern Region (NER) by leveraging space science and technology [6]. NE-SAC's mandate includes developing high-technology infrastructure to enable NE states to utilize space technology for their development, and it has undertaken numerous application projects and research in areas like earth observation, satellite communications, and disaster management [6].\n\nThe budget allocation across different program areas gives an insight into the priorities of the Indian Space Programme.\n![The bar chart shows budget allocations for BE 2015-2016, RE 2015-2016, and BE 2016-2017 across Space Technology, Space Applications, INSAT Operational, Space Sciences, and Direction & Administration and Other Programmes, with Space Technology receiving the highest share.](image1)\nAs seen in the budget allocations for 2015-2017, \"Space Technology\" consistently receives the largest share of funding, indicating its high importance. This category would encompass the core development and technological advancements pursued by ISRO and specialized labs like SCL. \"Space Applications\" and \"INSAT Operational\" also receive significant funding, reflecting the emphasis on utilizing space assets for societal benefits and maintaining operational satellite systems, with centers like NE-SAC directly contributing to applications. \"Space Sciences,\" supported by institutions like NARL and IIST, and \"Direction & Administration and Other Programmes\" receive comparatively smaller but essential portions of the budget. Other activities include Hi-Rel Board Fabrication, Component Screening for ISRO units, and indigenisation of electronics boards for the Indian Air Force [1]. The geographical distribution of these centers across India facilitates a wide-ranging impact and specialized research.\n![The map of India highlights the locations of various DOS/ISRO centers, laboratories, and facilities across the country.](image4)\n\nThe various centers under the Indian Space Programme fulfill specialized roles in research, education, technological development, regional applications, and commercialization, with budget allocations reflecting the strategic importance of areas like space technology development and applications."}

Its primary vision is “Developing capability to predict the behaviour of the earth’s atmosphere through observations and modeling” [4]. To achieve this, NARL focuses on technology development, observations, data archival, dissemination, assimilation, and modeling [4]. NARL's research activities are extensive, covering areas such as Radar Application and Development, Ionospheric and Space Research, Atmospheric Structure and Dynamics, Cloud and Convective Systems, Aerosols, Radiation and Trace Gases, Weather and Climate Research, and Computers and Data Management. It also undertakes specific projects like the LIDAR project and Advanced Space-borne Instrument Development [10].\nThese observational and research activities are supported by facilities like the one depicted below, likely used for atmospheric data collection.\n![NARL's extensive antenna array for atmospheric research and observation.](image5)\n\nThe Semi-Conductor Laboratory (SCL) in Chandigarh plays a vital role in establishing a robust microelectronics base in India, with a focus on enhancing capabilities in the VLSI (Very Large Scale Integration) domain [8]. SCL's activities encompass the Design, Development, Fabrication, Assembly, Testing, and Reliability Assurance of CMOS (Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor) and MEMS (Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems) Devices [8]. A significant achievement for SCL is the upgradation of its Wafer Fabrication Lab, with an 8\" CMOS Wafer Fabrication Line now operational for production. This facility has successfully processed multiple production lots with in-house designed ASICs (Application-Specific Integrated Circuits), IPs (Intellectual Properties), and Test Chips, including complex ASICs like the Vikram Processor for Launch Vehicles [9].\nThe advanced facilities enabling these semiconductor developments are evident in SCL's specialized laboratories.\n![SCL's advanced cleanroom facilities for semiconductor fabrication.](image4)\n\nIn summary, NARL primarily functions as an atmospheric research center focused on understanding and predicting atmospheric behavior using observational and modeling techniques supported by facilities like antenna arrays, while SCL focuses on microelectronics development and fabrication, particularly CMOS and MEMS devices, supported by advanced wafer fabrication laboratories."}

This is followed by televisions at 49% and traditional radios at 45%. Computers (10%) and dedicated internet access (5%) are less prevalent.\n![Household technology ownership shows mobile phones (86%) are most common, followed by television (49%) and radio (45%).](image2)\nDemographically, within households, radio ownership is slightly higher in urban areas (46.1%) compared to rural areas (45.3%), while mobile phone penetration is notably higher in urban (92.5%) than rural (84.3%) areas. Males (50.1%) are more likely to have a radio in the household than females (40.2%) [image2].\n\nWhen considering technology access outside the household, the landscape changes significantly. The question \"WHICH OF THESE HAVE REGULAR ACCESS TO (AT LEAST ONCE A WEEK) IN YOUR COMMUNITY OUTSIDE OF YOUR HOUSEHOLD?\" [4] reveals that a majority (68%) do not use computers, internet, mobile phones, or television outside their homes. For those who do, mobile phones are the most accessed technology outside the home at 20%, followed by television (11%), and computer and internet (both at 4%).\n![A majority (68%) of people do not use listed technologies outside their home; mobile phones are the most used outside (20%) by those who do.](image1)\n\nThese patterns of technology access influence radio listening habits. While traditional radios are still the most common device for listening to the radio overall (76%), mobile phones are also a significant device for this purpose (40%).\n![Traditional radios are the primary device for listening to radio (76%), with mobile phones also used by 40% of listeners.](image3)\nThere's a notable demographic difference here: in rural areas, 77% listen on a traditional radio versus 39% on mobile. However, in urban areas, mobile phones (70%) are preferred over traditional radios (49%) for listening to radio content [image3]. This aligns with the higher mobile phone penetration in urban households [image2] and suggests a shift in how urban populations consume radio. Males (75% radio, 43% mobile) and females (77% radio, 36% mobile) both predominantly use traditional radios, but males use mobiles for radio more than females [image3].\n\nRegarding the frequency of listening, 46% of people reported never listening to the radio in the past six months, while 27% listen every day.\n![Nearly half (46%) of respondents never listened to the radio in the past six months, while 27% listened daily.](image4)\nUrban dwellers (40.7% never) are slightly less likely to never listen to the radio compared to rural dwellers (46.2% never). Males (31.3% everyday, 37.1% never) tend to listen more frequently and are less likely to never listen compared to females (20% everyday, 55.7% never) [image4].\n\nThe primary reason people report for not listening to the radio is that the \"PROGRAM IN RADIO ARE NOT INTERESTING\" [3], a sentiment shared by 79% of those who don't listen [1]. Other reasons include not having a radio [5], the radio being damaged [6], not having time [7], or not going to places where the radio is played [8].\n\nTechnology usage differs significantly inside versus outside the household, with mobile phones being prevalent in homes and the most used tech outside by a smaller margin, influencing radio consumption especially in urban areas where mobiles are preferred for listening."}

Several factors contributed to this pressure on ARPU. One significant factor was the shift in user behavior, with people increasingly using data-based services like IM (Instant Messaging) and VoIP (Voice over IP), which led to less usage of traditional SMS and voice calls [1, 9]. This shift directly impacted the revenue generated from these services.\nThe ARPU trends for voice, SMS, and data reflect these changes. Voice ARPU was expected to flatten, while SMS ARPU was projected to continue decreasing as smartphone adoption grew [7]. Data ARPU was anticipated to fall in the short term before picking up later as data consumption increased [7].\n![The graph shows Voice ARPU slightly declining, SMS ARPU declining, and Mobile Data ARPU slightly dipping around 2014 before trending upwards.](image1)\nAdditionally, the market experienced massive price wars, some initiated by the government, which also contributed to the initial reduction in ARPU [3]. While data ARPU was expected to eventually compensate for declining voice and SMS ARPU, this recovery was projected for around 2015 as users enrolled in bigger data plans [7].\n\nTelkomsel's subscriber base increased from 132.7 million in 2013 to 139.3 million in late 2014, while its ARPU was likely under pressure due to industry-wide price wars and a shift in consumer behavior towards data services over traditional voice and SMS."}

Voice ARPU and SMS ARPU were on a declining trend.\n`![Line graph illustrating general ARPU trends for voice (decreasing), SMS (decreasing), and mobile data (slight dip then increasing) from 2013 to 2017.](image2)`\nThis decline was due to decreasing usage of traditional voice calls and SMS as people increasingly adopted data-based communication methods like Instant Messaging (IM) and Voice over IP (VoIP) [2, 4].

The overall ARPU was expected to continue a declining trend until 2015, after which increased data usage and bigger data plans were anticipated to compensate for the fall in voice and SMS ARPU [2].\n\nThe primary influences on these ARPU trends were the increasing adoption of smartphones, leading to a greater reliance on mobile data, and a corresponding decrease in the use of traditional voice and SMS services [4]. While data usage was growing, the data ARPU in the 2013-2014 timeframe had not yet fully compensated for the decline in revenues from voice and SMS [2].\n\nBetween 2013 and 2014, Telkomsel and XL experienced growth in smartphone users, while overall ARPU likely trended downwards due to declining voice and SMS revenues, with data ARPU yet to significantly offset this decline."}

This flow indicates the intensity of information aggregation onto label words [5].\n`S_pq` is defined as the mean significance of information flow from label words to the target position [9]. A high `S_pq` demonstrates strong information extraction from label words for final decision-making [5].\n\nThe relationship between `S_wp` and `S_pq` changes depending on the depth of the model layers. A proposed hypothesis states that \"In shallow layers, label words gather information from demonstration examples to form semantic representations for deeper layers, while in deep layers, the model extracts the information from label words to form the final prediction\" [1]. This dynamic is illustrated below:\n![In shallow layers, information aggregates towards label words from the text, while in deep layers, information for label prediction is extracted from these label words.](image4)\n\nEmpirical results support this hypothesis. In shallow layers, `S_wp` (the information flow from the text part to label words) is high, while `S_pq` (the significance of the information flow from label words to targeted positions) is low [8]. This indicates that in the initial stages, the model focuses on collecting information into the label words.\n\nHowever, this dominance shifts in deeper layers. \"In deep layers, `S_pq`, the importance of information flow from label words to the targeted position becomes the dominant one\" [8], [6].

This is evident with an average 6.0% improvement in the gold evidence setting and a 4.5% improvement in the open-book setting across four datasets. The benefit is especially pronounced for more complex reasoning tasks, such as a 14.9% improvement in the gold evidence setting and a 6.7% improvement in the open-book setting for 4-hop claims [1].\n\nIn terms of evidence retrieval, ProgramFC's use of reasoning programs enhances the ability to find relevant information from a knowledge source [4]. ProgramFC employs an iterative, step-by-step BM25 retriever, which is compared against a one-step BM25 retriever used in baselines.\n```markdown\n![Comparison of retrieval recall (@10) between One-step Retrieval and ProgramFC on HOVER (2-hop, 3-hop, 4-hop) and FEVEROUS-S datasets, demonstrating ProgramFC's superior performance.](image2)\n```\nThe recall of gold paragraphs (recall@10) shows that ProgramFC outperforms one-step retrieval across all datasets evaluated. A significant improvement is observed on HOVER 4-hop claims, where ProgramFC achieves a 37.1% higher recall [6]. This improved retrieval is attributed to the iterative process guided by the reasoning program, which can uncover information not present in the original claim but revealed during intermediate reasoning steps [6].\n\nProgramFC consistently outperforms FLAN-T5 in F1 scores, especially with smaller models and on more complex multi-hop claims, and also exhibits significantly better retrieval recall than one-step retrieval methods."}

When compared with FLAN-T5 across various language model sizes (small, base, large, XL, and XXL), program-guided reasoning is especially effective for smaller models [1]. While end-to-end FLAN-T5 performance drops significantly with smaller model sizes, ProgramFC's decline is less pronounced. This is because the reasoning programs help alleviate the demands on the sub-task solvers. For instance, ProgramFC using FLAN-T5-small (80M parameters) can achieve performance comparable to the much larger FLAN-T5-XXL (11B parameters) model for 4-hop claims [1].\n\n![Figure 4 compares ProgramFC and FLAN-T5 performance across different model sizes (80M to 11B parameters) and HOVER datasets (2-hop, 3-hop, 4-hop), showing ProgramFC's advantage with smaller models.](image3)\n\nThis figure illustrates that ProgramFC (green line) generally outperforms FLAN-T5 (blue line) across 2-hop, 3-hop, and 4-hop HOVER datasets, especially when using smaller model sizes (e.g., 80M, 250M) [1].\n\nWhen compared against other models on benchmarks like HOVER and FEVEROUS, ProgramFC demonstrates competitive results, particularly as the complexity of claims (number of reasoning hops) increases [10]. For example, while Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting outperforms ProgramFC on HOVER 2-hop and FEVEROUS, ProgramFC performs better on HOVER 3-hop and 4-hop claims [10].\n\n![Table 3 displays the Macro-F1 scores of ProgramFC compared to models like InstructGPT, Codex, and FLAN-T5 on HOVER and FEVEROUS datasets.](image5)\n\nAs seen in this table, ProgramFC achieves a Macro-F1 score of 54.27 on HOVER 2-hop, 54.18 on HOVER 3-hop (outperforming CoT's 53.66), and 52.88 on HOVER 4-hop (outperforming CoT's 51.83). On FEVEROUS, its score is 59.66, slightly below CoT's 61.05 [10]. This indicates that ProgramFC is particularly adept at complex, multi-hop reasoning tasks.\n\nRegarding error trends in ProgramFC's predictions, an analysis was conducted on 300 incorrectly predicted claims, classifying errors into syntactic, semantic, and incorrect execution categories [2].\nA key finding is that no syntax errors were found, suggesting that the Codex-based generator effectively produces executable programs through few-shot in-context learning [7].\n\n![Table 2 shows the error type proportions for ProgramFC on 2-hop, 3-hop, and 4-hop claims, indicating 0% syntax errors and increasing semantic errors with hop count.](image1)\n\nThis table shows that syntactic errors are 0% across all hop counts. Semantic errors, however, increase significantly with the complexity of the claims: 29% for 2-hop, 38% for 3-hop, and a substantial 77% for 4-hop claims [8]. Within semantic errors, \"Structure\" errors become particularly prevalent as claim complexity increases, rising from 19% in 2-hop to 57% in 4-hop claims [8]. This highlights the difficulty in generating correct step-by-step reasoning strategies for long-chain reasoning [8]. \"Incorrect execution,\" where the program is correct but its execution leads to an incorrect prediction, is more common in simpler, 2-hop claims (71%) and decreases as claim complexity and semantic errors rise (23% for 4-hop) [2].\n\nAn example of a structural error is where the model fails to correctly parse a sentence of the claim into the appropriate program instructions [8].\n![Figure 6 illustrates an example of a structural error in a ProgramFC predicted program for a complex claim.](image2)\nThis image shows an instance where the predicted program incorrectly formulates `fact_3`, indicating a structural semantic error in processing the claim about \"Emery\" and its proximity to a city near the Ohio Turnpike [8].\n\nProgramFC performs competitively, especially with smaller language models and on complex multi-hop reasoning tasks, but shows an increasing proportion of semantic errors, particularly structural ones, as claim complexity rises."}

An anchor re-weighting method has been shown to significantly improve In-Context Learning (ICL) accuracy [3]. The following table illustrates the performance of this method compared to vanilla ICL:\n```markdown\n![Accuracy scores of different In-Context Learning methods across four datasets, with Anchor Re-weighting showing the highest performance.](image1)\n```\nAs seen in the table, \"Anchor Re-weighting (1-shot per class)\" achieves substantial gains across all datasets, for instance, reaching 90.07 on SST-2 and an average of 68.64, compared to 51.90 for \"Vanilla In-Context Learning (1-shot per class)\" [3].\n\nRegarding inference speed, a demonstration compression technique was explored to accelerate ICL inference [3]. The speed-up ratios for GPT2-XL and GPT-J models across different datasets are presented below:\n```markdown\n![Table showing speed-up ratios for GPT2-XL and GPT-J models across four datasets, indicating GPT-J generally achieves higher acceleration.](image3)\n```\nThis table shows that the speed-up ratio ranges from 1.1x to 2.9x, influenced by demonstration length [2]. Notably, the acceleration effect is more pronounced in the GPT-J model compared to GPT2-XL, suggesting its potential for larger language models [5]. For example, on AGNews, GPT-J achieves a 2.9x speed-up, while GPT2-XL achieves 2.5x.\n\nFurther analysis into the models' mechanisms reveals that deep layers play a crucial role in forming final predictions.\n```markdown\n![Graphs showing correlation metrics (AUCROC_l and R_l) versus network layers for GPT2-XL and GPT-J models, highlighting the increasing importance of deeper layers for prediction.](image5)\n```\nFor both GPT2-XL and GPT-J, the AUCROC_l for deep layers approaches 0.8, and shallow layers show negligible cumulative contributions (R_l), with a significant increase in middle and deep layers. This indicates that the models extract information from label words in deep layers to make their final predictions [10].\n\nTo understand classification accuracies and errors, an analysis framework is used to diagnose ICL errors. The actual model confusion score between categories is calculated using the AUC-ROC metric, and this is compared with a predicted confusion score [1]. The hypothesis is that if key vectors for label words are similar, it can lead to label confusion [4]. The distances between these key vectors are normalized (0 indicating highest confusion) to predict category confusion.\n\nThe following heatmaps show the predicted and actual confusion for the GPT2-XL model on the TREC dataset [7].\n```markdown\n![Heatmap of predicted confusion scores between categories for the GPT2-XL model on the TREC dataset, where lighter colors indicate higher predicted confusion.](image4)\n```\n```markdown\n![Heatmap of actual confusion scores between categories for the GPT2-XL model on the TREC dataset, where lighter colors indicate higher confusion.](image2)\n```\nThe predicted confusion metric (image4) successfully identifies highly confusing category pairs. For instance, the \"Description-Entity\" pair shows high predicted confusion (value 0.34, very light color) [9]. The actual confusion heatmap (image2) confirms this, with \"Description-Entity\" also showing high actual confusion (value 0.58, one of the lightest off-diagonal colors). This high correlation between predicted and actual confusion indicates that ICL tends to make errors when categories have similar label anchors [9]. This framework can serve as an interpretation tool for understanding ICL's errors [9].\n\nIn summary, GPT2-XL and GPT-J show varied performance gains across datasets with techniques like anchor re-weighting and compression, and their classification errors, as revealed by confusion matrices, are often linked to the similarity of label anchors."}

These include the use of safety-specific data annotation and tuning, conducting red-teaming exercises to identify vulnerabilities, and employing iterative evaluations to refine the models [2]. A critical component is the fine-tuning process, which leverages human feedback. This feedback is used to train safety reward models, which in turn guide the Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) process. RLHF involves techniques such as rejection sampling and proximal policy optimization to align the model's responses with safety (and helpfulness) standards [2].

As more knowledge is removed, the recall remains stable at around 15%, indicating a limited but consistent ability of current LLMs to identify absent knowledge [5]. However, precision and F1-Score show a clear upward trend. This suggests that as more knowledge is absent from the KG, the \"[NA]\" (Not Available) mechanism allows the model to more accurately pinpoint what knowledge is missing [5].\n```markdown\n![Experiment results on Conscious Incompetence show stable recall and increasing precision and F1-Score as more knowledge is removed.](image3)\n```\nThis indicates that the \"Conscious Incompetence\" setting becomes increasingly important when the coverage of the knowledge graph is more problematic, as it helps in accurately identifying these gaps [5].\n\nIn the context of retrieval analysis, an ablation study was conducted by simulating retrieval accuracy from 100% (ground truth knowledge graphs) down to 20%, where in each step, 20% of knowledge graphs were replaced with irrelevant ones [1].\n```markdown\n![Retrieval analysis shows decreasing precision, recall, F1-Score, and correctness as retrieval accuracy drops.](image5)\n```\nThe results show that as retrieval accuracy drops, all metrics (precision, recall, F1-Score, and correctness) exhibit clear downward trends [10]. The impact of poor retrieval quality is significantly more pronounced on recall than on precision. Recall decreases almost linearly as retrieval accuracy diminishes, which is expected since knowledge cannot be cited if it's not provided [10]. The model demonstrates some ability to filter out incorrect knowledge, which explains the less noticeable impact on precision compared to recall [10]. The most significant drop in recall occurs between the ground truth (perfect retrieval) and 80% accuracy [10]. Even with perfect retrieval, recall is 57.1, and at 80% accuracy (close to the actual experimental scenario's 75.9% retrieval accuracy), recall is 42.5 [7, 10]. This highlights that when retrieval accuracy is reasonably high, citation correctness is less of a concern than recall [7]. The removal of required knowledge due to poor retrieval significantly affects citation precision and recall, demonstrating that coverage issues are a considerable challenge [2].\n\nThese changes imply that while models have a limited capacity to identify absent knowledge (as seen in \"Conscious Incompetence\"), their performance in generating accurate and comprehensive citations heavily relies on the accuracy of the retrieved knowledge; poor retrieval severely diminishes recall, although models can somewhat filter out inaccuracies, thus affecting precision to a lesser extent."}

RAPTOR with GPT-4 set a new benchmark on QASPER with a 55.7% F-1 score, surpassing previous state-of-the-art models like CoLT5 XL [8].\n```markdown\n![Table comparing F-1 Match scores on QASPER: RAPTOR + GPT-4 (55.7%) outperforms LongT5 XL (53.1%) and CoLT5 XL (53.9%).](image3)\n```\nThe QASPER dataset benefits from RAPTOR’s higher-level summary nodes, which allow it to outperform methods that only extract the most similar raw text chunks [4].\n\nOn the QuALITY dev dataset, RAPTOR paired with language models like GPT-3 and UnifiedQA 3B outperforms baselines BM25 and DPR by at least 2.0% in accuracy [2]. The general effectiveness of RAPTOR is further supported by results showing that when combined with any retriever (SBERT, BM25, DPR), it consistently outperforms the respective retriever across all datasets [6].\n```markdown\n![Table showing SBERT, BM25, and DPR achieve higher Accuracy on QuALITY and Answer F1 on QASPER when combined with RAPTOR.](image2)\n```\nThis table shows, for example, SBERT with RAPTOR achieved 56.6% accuracy on QuALITY, compared to 54.9% for SBERT without RAPTOR.\n\nThe querying structure of RAPTOR plays a crucial role in its performance. RAPTOR employs recursive clustering and summarization to create a hierarchical tree structure, enabling effective retrieval by synthesizing information across various sections of the corpora [9]. The upper nodes in this tree are hypothesized to be particularly important for handling thematic or multi-hop queries that require a broader understanding of the text [3]. RAPTOR benefits from its intermediate layers and clustering approaches, allowing it to capture a range of information from general themes to specific details [10].\n```markdown\n![Diagram illustrating RAPTOR's hierarchical tree structure with nodes at different levels, highlighting retrieved nodes for two different questions.](image4)\n```\nThis hierarchical structure allows RAPTOR to perform more effective retrieval during the query phase. The contribution of different layers is evident when examining retrieval capabilities; querying more layers, particularly up to 3 layers starting from Layer 2, yields the best performance, indicating the value of this depth in information abstraction.\n```markdown\n![Table showing that querying 3 layers starting from Layer 2 achieves the highest performance score of 73.68.](image1)\n```\nThis suggests that leveraging the full depth of the tree structure, including higher-level summary nodes, is key to RAPTOR's ability to address complex queries.\n\nRAPTOR outperforms other retrieval methods due to its hierarchical tree structure that synthesizes information at multiple abstraction levels, which is particularly effective for complex queries, leading to superior results across diverse datasets and metrics."}

To help MLLMs focus on the objects of interest, a blurring technique is applied to the non-target areas surrounding these objects [8].\n```markdown\n![Objects in an image are pre-processed by cropping based on bounding boxes and then fed to an image encoder for embedding and retrieval from memory, with an MLLM making the final prediction.](image4)\n```\nThe diagram above, specifically part (a) Pre-process, illustrates how an image with multiple objects is processed by defining bounding boxes (bbox1, bbox2, bbox3), which are then cropped into separate sub-images [8].\n\nNext, due to the often small size of these cropped sub-images, which limits CLIP's feature extraction from low-resolution images, the system conducts image-to-text retrieval instead of image-to-image retrieval. This utilizes CLIP's inherent image-text interaction capabilities to obtain the top-$k$ category information with the highest similarity from the multimodal memory [6]. The multimodal retriever is designed to query this large external memory to find information relevant to the input [3]. The overall architecture, as seen below, involves an image encoder creating embeddings that are indexed and stored in Memory M. During inference, an input image is encoded, and the system retrieves the top-K categories.\n```markdown\n![The system architecture shows (a) a multimodal retriever building a memory of image embeddings and labels, and (b) an inference process where an image is encoded, top-K categories are retrieved, and an MLLM ranks them for the final prediction.](image3)\n```\nUpon receiving an input image at the inference stage, the approach retrieves the top-$k$ class names most similar to the image [9].\n\nFinally, these retrieved top-$k$ category labels are sent to Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) along with the image embedding through a ranking prompt [5]. The MLLMs then rank these retrieved class names, using advanced linguistic and semantic analysis to assess the contextual appropriateness of each class name with the input image, leading to the final prediction [4], [5].\n```markdown\n![An example shows an input image of a Mercedes-Benz E-Class Sedan, several retrieved car models with some inaccuracies, and the MLLM correctly ranking \"Mercedes-Benz E-Class Sedan\" as the top result.](image1)\n```\nThis image provides a ranking prompt example where, for an input \"Mercedes-Benz E-Class Sedan,\" several categories are retrieved, and the MLLM ranks them to identify the correct one as \"Mercedes-Benz E-Class Sedan\" [4].\n```markdown\n![Examples show objects identified in images, a list of initially retrieved candidate terms for each object, and the final, more accurate reranked term selected by the MLLM.](image2)\n```\nThe image above further demonstrates the reranking, where initial retrieved labels for objects like \"earring\" or \"glove\" are refined to the correct single label by the MLLM [2].\n\nThe system processes objects in detection datasets by pre-processing (cropping and blurring), performing image-to-text retrieval for top-k candidates, and then using MLLMs to rank these candidates for final recognition."}

When compared to a RAG-only approach, Step-Back + RAG fixes 21.6% of errors coming from RAG, while introducing 6.3% new errors to RAG [4]. This indicates a substantial improvement in performance for TimeQA.\n\nFor the StrategyQA dataset, Step-Back + RAG also yields improvements, though the percentages differ. As detailed in the analysis (described as Figure 7 in the source material), Step-Back + RAG turns 15.4% of wrong baseline predictions into correct ones, while leading to 6.1% errors the other way around [3, 10]. Furthermore, it fixes 12.7% of errors originating from RAG, and the errors introduced to RAG by Step-Back in this context are lower, at 4.4% [3, 10].\n\nThe significance of these differences is tied to the task types and dataset characteristics.\n```markdown\n![Table detailing dataset splits and example counts for TimeQA and StrategyQA.](image5)\n```\nTimeQA is a Knowledge QA task with 5,226 test examples, while StrategyQA is a Multi-hop Reasoning task with 229 dev examples [7, image5]. The more substantial error correction rates on TimeQA (e.g., fixing 39.9% of baseline errors vs. 15.4% on StrategyQA) suggest that Step-Back + RAG is particularly effective for knowledge-intensive tasks where abstracting the question can significantly improve the retrieval and utilization of factual information [4]. The difficulty of TimeQA, where many errors stem from reasoning and information retrieval failures [6], highlights the impact of Step-Back + RAG in this domain.\n\nIn contrast, for StrategyQA, a task requiring complex multi-step reasoning, the improvement from Step-Back + RAG is more modest but notably introduces fewer new errors to the RAG component (4.4% for StrategyQA vs. 6.3% for TimeQA) [3, 4, 10]. This could imply that while abstraction aids complex reasoning, its primary benefit might be less about massive error correction and more about a steady, slightly safer enhancement. The smaller dataset size for StrategyQA might also influence the observed percentages [7, image5].\n\nStep-Back + RAG achieves higher error correction on the knowledge-intensive TimeQA dataset compared to the multi-hop reasoning StrategyQA dataset, indicating its abstraction is highly beneficial for retrieval-heavy tasks, while on StrategyQA, it offers moderate gains with a lower rate of newly introduced errors to RAG."}

For instance, it improved accuracy on TimeQA to 68.7%, considerably higher than baseline models like PaLM-2L (41.5%) and even regular RAG (57.4%) [4, 10]. Other prompting techniques like Chain of Thought (CoT) or Take a Deep Breath (TDB) showed no improvement on this specific task [4].\n```markdown\n![Table 2 shows PaLM-2L + Step-Back + RAG achieving the highest scores on TimeQA (68.7%) and TQA Hard (62.3%), and strong scores on SituatedQA (61%) compared to other methods.](image1)\n```\nThe PaLM-2L + Step-Back + RAG method achieved 68.7% on TimeQA, a notable increase from PaLM-2L's 41.5%, PaLM-2L + RAG's 57.4%, and GPT-4's 45.6% as shown in the table above [4].\n\nOn the SituatedQA benchmark, Step-Back + RAG improved performance from a baseline of 54.3% to 61%, narrowing the gap to GPT-4’s 63.2% [3]. The table above also shows PaLM-2L + Step-Back + RAG at 61% for SituatedQA, an improvement over the PaLM-2L baseline (54.3%) and PaLM-2L + RAG (59.3%) [3].\n\nFor MMLU (Massive Multitask Language Understanding) benchmarks in Physics and Chemistry, PaLM-2L with Step-Back prompting also outperformed other methods, including GPT-4.\n```markdown\n![Table showing PaLM-2L + Step-Back outperforming other methods, including GPT-4, on MMLU Physics (73.2%) and MMLU Chemistry (81.8%).](image5)\n```\nSpecifically, PaLM-2L + Step-Back achieved 73.2% in MMLU Physics (compared to GPT-4's 70.3%) and 81.8% in MMLU Chemistry (compared to GPT-4's 79.9%).\n\n**Error Analysis:**\n\nStep-Back prompting has been shown to effectively fix errors made by baseline models. An analysis revealed that Step-Back prompting can correct 39.9% of predictions where the baseline PaLM-2L was wrong, while only introducing new errors in 5.6% of cases [5]. Furthermore, when combined with RAG, Step-Back + RAG fixes 21.6% of errors originating from RAG, with a relatively low new error introduction rate of 6.3% [5].\n```markdown\n![Pie chart illustrating error analysis comparing Step-Back with a baseline model, showing cases where Step-Back corrects baseline errors (20.5% 'Baseline Wrong').](image2)\n```\nThe pie chart above from an error analysis visually represents the comparison, where 20.5% of cases are \"Baseline Wrong\" (implying Step-Back was correct), 11.9% are \"Step-Back Wrong\", 40.4% are \"Both Right\", and 27.2% are \"Both Wrong\". This indicates that Step-Back helps in a significant portion of cases where the baseline fails.\n\nHowever, the Step-Back method itself can encounter specific types of errors. These include instances where the generated step-back question is not helpful, RAG fails to retrieve relevant information despite an appropriate step-back question, or there are scoring errors by the judge model [1]. Analysis on TimeQA highlighted that Reasoning and RAG are the dominant error sources when using Step-Back [8].\n```markdown\n![Bar chart illustrating the distribution of error sources for Step-Back, with 'Reasoning Error' (0.52) and 'RAG' (0.45) being the most prominent.](image3)\n```\nThe bar chart above details these error sources, showing 'Reasoning Error' and 'RAG' as the most significant contributors to errors in the Step-Back process, followed by 'Scoring Error' and errors from the 'StepBack' question generation itself [8].\n\nStep-Back prompting generally improves task performance over baselines and other methods across different benchmarks by effectively fixing errors, though its own primary error sources are related to reasoning and retrieval augmentation."}

However, errors can still occur, primarily in the reasoning or retrieval phases rather than the abstraction step itself.\n\n**Performance in Multi-Hop Reasoning (MuSiQue, StrategyQA):**\nIn multi-hop reasoning tasks, Step-Back Prompting demonstrates considerable gains. For the MuSiQue benchmark, PaLM-2L combined with Step-Back and RAG achieved an accuracy of 42.8%, surpassing GPT-4's 38.5% [1]. On StrategyQA, this combination reached 86.4%, again outperforming GPT-4, which scored 78.3% [1].\n![Table showing PaLM-2L + Step-Back + RAG achieving 42.8% on MuSiQue and 86.4% on StrategyQA, outperforming GPT-4 and other methods including standalone RAG.](image5)\nWhile RAG alone improves performance (e.g., by ~4% in MuSiQue and ~2% in StrategyQA over the baseline PaLM-2L), Step-Back Prompting, particularly when augmented with RAG, generally yields the best results by leveraging abstraction [1]. CoT (Chain of Thought) and TDB (Take a Deep Breath) prompting show smaller improvements in MuSiQue and no significant gains in StrategyQA where baseline performance is already high [1].\n\n**Performance in Knowledge QA (TimeQA, SituatedQA, MMLU):**\nStep-Back Prompting also shows strong performance on Knowledge QA tasks [3].\nFor TimeQA, baseline GPT-4 achieved 45.6% and PaLM-2L scored 41.5%. Augmenting PaLM-2L with regular RAG improved accuracy to 57.4%. However, PaLM-2L with Step-Back + RAG achieved a notable 68.7%, demonstrating the benefit of using step-back questions for more effective retrieval [9].\n![Table comparing methods on TimeQA, showing PaLM-2L + Step-Back + RAG at 68.7%, outperforming GPT-4 (45.6%) and PaLM-2L + RAG (57.4%).](image2)\nIn the MMLU benchmark, PaLM-2L with Step-Back outperformed GPT-4.

However, this was still an improvement over PaLM-2L baseline (54.3%), PaLM-2L + RAG (59.3%), and PaLM-2L + Step-Back alone (57.5%) [image2].\n\n**Common Error Types with Step-Back Prompting:**\nDespite its effectiveness, errors can occur when using Step-Back Prompting. Analyses indicate that the abstraction step (the \"step-back\" part) itself is rarely the primary source of failure.\nFor MMLU, over 90% of errors happen during the Reasoning step, with 'Principle Error' (failure of the Abstraction step) being a minor component. The major error types are 'Reasoning Error' and 'Math Error' [4].\n![Bar chart illustrating MMLU error distribution, where Reasoning Error (0.55) and Math Error (0.25) are dominant, and Principle Error (0.09) is small.](image4)\nSimilarly, in the TimeQA task, failures of the StepBack mechanism itself are infrequent [10]. The predominant error sources are 'Reasoning Error' (more than half of the errors) and failures in RAG to retrieve the correct information (45% of errors), even when the step-back question is well-formed [6], [10].\n![Bar chart showing TimeQA error distribution, with Reasoning Error (0.52) and RAG failure (0.45) as major sources, and StepBack error being very low (0.01).](image3)\nGeneral error categories include [2]:\n*   `StepBack`: The generated step-back question is not helpful.\n*   `RAG`: Retrieval fails to find relevant information despite a good step-back question.\n*   `Scoring Error`: The evaluation model makes a mistake.\nThe performance of Step-Back Prompting is also robust against the number of few-shot exemplars used, indicating sample efficiency in learning the abstraction skill [5].\n![Line graph showing stable accuracy of Step-Back Prompting on TimeQA across varying numbers of few-shot exemplars (1 to 5).](image3)\n\nIn summary, Step-Back Prompting, especially when combined with RAG, significantly enhances QA performance across multiple benchmarks, often outperforming GPT-4, with most errors originating from subsequent reasoning or information retrieval steps rather than the initial abstraction process."}

It also slightly outperforms Citeomatic on the direct citation task and substantially outperforms it on co-citations (+2.0 nDCG) [6].\n*   **Recommendation Task**: SPECTER outperforms all other models with an nDCG of 53.9, though the differences in scores are generally smaller for this task due to the embeddings being used alongside other features in the ranking model [7].\n\nEven without task-specific fine-tuning, SPECTER outperforms a SciBERT model that has been fine-tuned on the end tasks, as well as their multitask combination [2].\n![Table 3 shows SPECTER outperforms various SciBERT fine-tuned models across different training signals.](image3)\n\nRegarding the inclusion of additional metadata:\n![Table 2 presents the ablation study results, showing performance changes when metadata fields are added or removed.](image5)\nThe ablation study reveals the following effects:\n*   **Adding Authors**: Adding authors as an input (along with title and abstract) surprisingly hurts performance. This could be due to the sparsity of author names or suboptimal tokenization of names by Wordpieces, leading to noisy correlations [3].\n*   **Adding Venues**: Adding venues slightly decreases performance overall, except on document classification, where venues are expected to have a high correlation with paper topics [3].\n\nThe fact that SPECTER performs well without requiring metadata like authors or venues makes it applicable in situations where this information is unavailable [4].\n\nIn summary, the SPECTER model generally outperforms other models across a range of tasks, and the inclusion of additional metadata like author names tends to hurt performance, while venue information has a mixed but generally slightly negative impact except for document classification."}

Accuracy-Oriented Datasets (Sentiment Classification - SST-2, SST-5):**\nHowever, for accuracy-oriented tasks like sentiment classification, dice-based losses (DL and DSC) may not be the optimal choice.\n![Table 9 displays accuracy on sentiment classification tasks (SST-2, SST-5), where BERT+CE outperforms BERT+DL and BERT+DSC.](image4)\nExperiments on SST-2 and SST-5 (Table 9, also described in text [8]) show that fine-tuning BERT Large with Cross-Entropy (BERT+CE) achieves higher accuracy (e.g., 55.57 on SST-5) compared to BERT+DL (54.63) and BERT+DSC (55.19) [3]. This indicates that \"the proposed dice loss is not accuracy-oriented, and should not be used for accuracy-oriented tasks\" [3].\n\nIn summary, BERT+DSC generally enhances F1 performance across various NLU tasks and data augmentation scenarios, especially on imbalanced datasets, but for accuracy-focused tasks, traditional cross-entropy loss might be more effective."}

For `attraction-name`, DS-Picklist is at 96.91% and DS-DST at 96.86%.\n-   There are specific slots where DS-Picklist shows a more noticeable improvement over DS-DST. Examples include:\n    -   `taxi-departure`: DS-Picklist (98.59%) vs DS-DST (98.53%) shows a smaller difference in this table, but other analyses suggest DS-Picklist handles such slots better when spans are missing.\n    -   `train-arrive by`: DS-Picklist (96.59%) vs DS-DST (95.78%).\n    -   `hotel-parking`: DS-Picklist (97.26%) vs DS-DST (97.18%).\n    -   `hotel-internet`: DS-Picklist (97.26%) vs DS-DST (97.48%) - here DS-DST is slightly better, indicating variations.\n\nAn error analysis on the MultiWOZ 2.1 validation set further clarifies the improvements [3]. For slots where ground-truth values cannot be found through span matching (which hampers DS-Span), DS-DST and DS-Picklist significantly reduce errors. DS-Picklist can further reduce error rates when the ontology is accessible, as predicted values can be found in candidate-value lists [3]. This is particularly evident for time-related slots.\n```markdown\n![Table 5 shows error analysis for top-10 slots on MultiWOZ 2.1 validation set, indicating DS-Picklist performs significantly better than DS-DST on slots like taxi-leave at and train-arrive by when ground-truth values are not found by span matching.](image5)\n```\nFor example, in cases where DS-Span fails, for `taxi-leave at`, DS-Picklist correctly predicts missing values 43.84% of the time, whereas DS-DST scores 0.00%. Similarly, for `train-arrive by`, DS-Picklist achieves 79.20% compared to DS-DST's 9.60% [3]. This indicates that for these kinds of slots, especially when the ontology is available, DS-Picklist has a distinct advantage. The ability of DS-Picklist to leverage the full ontology contributes to its improved performance over DS-DST in such scenarios [5].\n\nOverall, DS-Picklist performs slightly better than DS-DST on the MultiWOZ 2.1 dataset, with more significant advantages in specific slots, particularly time-related ones or those where candidate-value lists provided by an ontology are crucial for accurate prediction."}

Furthermore, \"DS-DST and DS-Picklist perform much better than DS-Span\" [4].

DS-DST and DS-Picklist, however, can often correctly predict these values.\n\nIt's important to note that while \"DS-Picklist is higher than DS-DST, in real scenarios, it may be nontrivial to have access to the full ontology\" [1].\n\nOverall, DS-Picklist demonstrates the highest performance in both joint and slot accuracy, followed by DS-DST, both of which are notably better than DS-Span, especially for categorical slots and when full ontology is available for DS-Picklist."}

LANI focuses on navigation tasks, while CHAI incorporates both navigation and object manipulation.\n\n**Task Performance:**\n\nThe evaluation metrics for LANI are stop distance (SD) and task completion (TC), while for CHAI, they are stop distance (SD) and manipulation accuracy (MA) [9].\n\nFor the LANI task, \"Our Approach\" achieved a stop distance (SD) of 8.43 and a task completion (TC) rate of 36.9% on the held-out test dataset.\n```markdown\n![Table 4 displays the performance metrics (SD, TC for LANI; SD, MA for CHAI) of various methods including 'Our Approach' on the held-out test dataset.](image1)\n```\nThis performance is an improvement over other methods like CHAPLOT18 [7]. However, it is still below human performance, where humans achieve an SD of 5.2 and a TC of 63% on LANI, demonstrating the inherent ambiguity and challenge of the task [5].\n\nFor the CHAI task, \"Our Approach\" achieved an SD of 3.34 and a manipulation accuracy (MA) of 39.97% (from Image1). The text notes that all models, including the authors', perform poorly on CHAI, particularly in manipulation (MA) [7]. This is a significant gap compared to human performance on CHAI, which shows an SD of 1.34 and 100% manipulation accuracy [5], underscoring that CHAI remains a largely open problem.\n\n**Linguistic Categories:**\n\nThe instructions for LANI and CHAI also exhibit differences in their linguistic makeup, reflecting their distinct task requirements. An analysis of linguistic categories in the instructions reveals these variations:\n```markdown\n![Table 2 shows the count of different linguistic categories in LANI and CHAI instructions, such as spatial relations, conjunctions, and temporal coordination.](image2)\n```\nBased on the data presented in the table (Image2):\n*   **Spatial relations between locations**: LANI instructions contain a higher count (123) compared to CHAI (52). This is consistent with LANI's focus on navigation in potentially complex environments (e.g., \"go to the right side of the rock\").\n*   **Conjunctions of two or more locations**: LANI has more instances (36) than CHAI (5), suggesting more complex path descriptions (e.g., \"fly between the mushroom and the yellow cone\").\n*   **Temporal coordination of sub-goals**: CHAI instructions have a slightly higher count (68) compared to LANI (65). This aligns with CHAI's multi-step manipulation tasks (e.g., \"go back to the kitchen and put the glass in the sink\").\n*   **Constraints on the shape of trajectory**: This category is prominent in LANI (94 instances, e.g., \"go past the house by the right side of the apple\") but absent in CHAI (0 instances).\n*   **Co-reference**: LANI instructions show more co-references (32) than CHAI (18).\n*   **Comparatives**: LANI has a few instances (2), while CHAI has none.\n\nThese linguistic differences indicate that LANI instructions often involve more detailed spatial and path descriptions, while CHAI instructions tend to focus more on sequences of actions, including manipulation. The LANI dataset is inspired by tasks where a leader directs a follower to navigate between landmarks, often requiring intricate spatial language [10]. CHAI instructions, on the other hand, are collected using scenarios that can involve a series of actions in an environment [10].\n\nIn summary, the LANI system deals with complex navigation instructions reflected in its linguistic features and is evaluated on navigation success, while the CHAI system tackles tasks involving both navigation and manipulation, with its instructions geared towards sequential actions and its performance indicating significant challenges, especially in manipulation accuracy."}

The text highlights this: \"On CHAI, CHAPLOT18 and MISRA17 both fail to learn, while our approach shows an improvement on stop distance (SD). However, all models perform poorly on CHAI, especially on manipulation (MA)\" [7]. The difficulty of CHAI manipulation is further emphasized by the observation that even with oracle goals, \"the model completely fails to learn a reasonable manipulation behavior for CHAI. This illustrates the planning complexity of this domain\" [1].\n\nHuman performance on these tasks is considerably higher, with 63% TC on LANI and 100% MA on CHAI [10], indicating a large gap to current model capabilities.\n\nInsights from this comparison include:\n1.  The proposed approach is more effective for task completion in the LANI environment than previous methods.\n2.  The manipulation aspect of the CHAI task presents a significant challenge for all current models, including the proposed one, which only shows a marginal improvement.

For instance, in one set of results, 'Our Approach' (OA) recorded an SD of 8.65 and a TC of 35.72% on LANI [image4].\n```markdown\n![Table 3 shows 'Our Approach' (OA) achieving an SD of 8.65 and TC of 35.72% on LANI, outperforming methods like STOP, RANDOMWALK, MOSTFREQUENT, MISRA17, and CHAPLOT18.](image4)\n```\nThis outperformance is further corroborated by results on the held-out test dataset, where 'Our Approach' achieved an SD of 8.43 and a TC of 36.9% on LANI [image5].\n```markdown\n![Table 4 shows 'Our Approach' on the held-out test dataset with an SD of 8.43 and TC of 36.9% for LANI, again better than other listed methods.](image5)\n```\nSpecifically, on LANI, 'Our Approach' improves task completion (TC) accuracy by 5% compared to CHAPLOT18 [3].\n\nOn the CHAI dataset, 'Our Approach' also shows improvements, particularly in Stop Distance (SD). The method achieved an SD of 2.75 on CHAI in one evaluation [image4], and an SD of 3.34 on the held-out test data [image5]. When focusing on instructions with navigation actions only on CHAI, 'Our Approach' gives a stop distance (SD) of 3.24, a 17% reduction in error compared to the STOP baseline [2]. However, performance on CHAI, especially for manipulation (MA), remains a challenge for all models, including 'Our Approach' [3].\n\nSeveral factors influence the performance of 'Our Approach'. A key aspect is its design, which involves an explicit separation of goal prediction and action generation [4].\n```markdown\n![Figure 6 shows an example of goal prediction where the model processes the instruction \"curve around big rock keeping it to your left\" and predicts a goal area.](image2)\n```\nThis separation allows for an easily interpretable goal representation without needing complex logical ontologies [4]. The method also outperforms Janner et al. (2018) in goal prediction [1].\n\nHowever, this architectural choice has potential limitations. One is cascading errors, as \"action generation relies completely on the predicted goal and is not exposed to the language otherwise\" [4]. This also means the model may struggle with instructions that include constraints on the execution trajectory itself, rather than just the final goal [4]. The significance of accurate goal prediction is highlighted by the observation that providing the model with oracle (perfect) goals significantly improves navigation performance on both tasks, though it still fails to learn reasonable manipulation behavior for CHAI, illustrating the planning complexity of that domain [10]. The inherent ambiguity and difficulty of the tasks also play a role, as evidenced by imperfect human performance [6].\n\n'Our Approach' generally outperforms other methods in SD and TC on LANI and SD on CHAI, with its performance influenced by its two-stage architecture involving explicit goal prediction, which offers interpretability but can lead to cascading errors and difficulties with trajectory constraints."}

Despite inherent ambiguities in instruction following that lead to imperfect human performance, the model's performance is still substantially lower [8].\n\nThe presence of linguistic categories such as temporal coordination and co-reference increases goal prediction error, and while the proposed approach shows progress, it still performs below human-level in instruction execution."}

This confirms the benefit of the model in enumerating spans rather than using BIO tagging. While its relation extraction F1 score (27.8) is competitive, it's slightly lower than the Best SemEval system (28.0) on this dataset, which is attributed to the absence of coreference links and less comprehensive relation types in SemEval 17 compared to SciERC [7].\n\nAn additional insight from its multitask approach, particularly the inclusion of coreference resolution, is its impact on downstream applications like knowledge graph construction.\n```![Knowledge graphs constructed with coreference links show higher precision than those without.](image5)```\nHuman evaluation of constructed knowledge graphs demonstrates that including coreference links leads to a more dense and useful graph, with higher precision compared to graphs generated without coreference [5, 4].\n\nThe SciIE model generally outperforms other models on various NLP tasks across different datasets, and its multi-task learning approach, which shares span representations, is crucial for its enhanced performance and utility in applications like knowledge graph construction."}

For instance, a pretraining architecture utilizing a bi-directional transformer model with a cloze-style objective, where the model predicts the center word based on its surrounding left and right context, has proven effective [2]. When comparing training objectives, the cloze loss demonstrates superior performance over the bilm (bidirectional language model) loss. Notably, combining cloze and bilm losses does not yield better results than using cloze loss alone [1], suggesting that the learning signals from separate left and right context prediction might not be sufficiently complementary to center word prediction [1]. This highlights that a novel cloze-driven training regime is more effective than predicting left and right tokens independently [8].\n`![Table showing cloze loss outperforming bilm loss and their combination on various GLUE tasks, with cloze achieving an average GLUE score of 80.9.](image5)`\nFurthermore, fine-tuning the pretrained models on specific downstream tasks typically provides the most substantial performance gains, often surpassing other methods like model stacking [3].\n`![Table showing performance metrics where 'CNN Large + fine-tune' achieves a test F1 score of 93.5, indicating strong performance from fine-tuning.](image1)`\n\nThe nature of the pretraining data is equally influential.\nFirstly, the volume of pretraining data is a key determinant of success: more data generally leads to improved performance, all else being equal [4]. Experimental evidence shows that pre-training benefits continue to accrue with increasing data, even up to 18 billion tokens, with indications that further data could yield even better results [7, 8].\n`![Graph showing a clear upward trend in Average GLUE score as the number of Train data tokens increases from 562M to 18B.](image4)`\nThis impact of data quantity is evident across different datasets, for example, when using Common Crawl data, increasing training tokens from 562 million to 18 billion leads to a steady rise in average GLUE scores [8].\n`![Table showing comparative GLUE benchmark results across different training datasets (ccrawl, news crawl, BWiki) and data sizes, illustrating the impact of data quantity and source on model performance.](image3)`\n\nSecondly, the structure and source of the pretraining data matter significantly. Using corpora that maintain paragraph structure is more beneficial than using individual sentences [4]. Training examples composed of multiple sentences are particularly crucial for tasks involving sentence pairs [8]. For example, Common Crawl, which features multi-sentence examples, generally yields better performance than News Crawl, which consists of individual sentences, especially on sentence-pair tasks like RTE [5]. While experiments with diverse data like BooksCorpus and Wikipedia show good performance on certain tasks, the strategy for handling example length (e.g., block cropping) did not always outperform using data as is [9].\n\nIn essence, utilizing large volumes of structurally rich pretraining data, in conjunction with effective modeling strategies like cloze-based objectives and subsequent fine-tuning, is crucial for achieving high performance on NLP tasks."}

For instance, for the GL + PT → GL task, the aligned embeddings achieved a BLEU score of 22.4, compared to 20.8 for pre-trained (unaligned) embeddings. This improvement is likely because a single encoder is used for both source languages, and alignment ensures their word embeddings are in similar vector spaces, facilitating the learning process [7].\n\nThe alignment of word embeddings has an insignificant impact on BLEU scores for bilingual systems but is generally beneficial for multilingual translation systems."}

This improvement is evident in the better translation of low-frequency words and overall grammatical structure. A study found that pre-training \"manages to improve the accuracy of translation for the entire vocabulary, but particularly for words that are of low frequency in the training corpus\" [1]. A qualitative analysis of translations from Galician to English ( ${\\mathrm{GL}}\\to{\\mathrm{EN}}$ ) further supports this, showing that \"pre-training not only helps the model to capture rarer vocabulary but also generates sentences that are more grammatically well-formed\" [7].\n\nFor example, in the GL→EN translation:\n![Table 6 illustrates how pre-training improves translation quality, capturing rarer vocabulary like 'chris' and 'patent legislation' and generating more grammatical sentences for GL->EN.](image2)\nThe 'multi:pre-align' system successfully translates a person’s name (“chris”) and multi-word phrases (“big lawyer,” “patent legislation”), which the baseline system failed to do, indicating better representation of less frequent concepts [7].\n\nThe effectiveness of pre-training is significantly influenced by the **training set size**. There appears to be a \"sweet-spot where word embeddings are most effective, where there is very little training data but not so little that the system cannot be trained at all\" [4]. The gains are often highest when the baseline system's performance is poor but has surpassed a minimum threshold, typically a BLEU score in the range of 3-4, suggesting that \"once there is enough data to capture the basic characteristics of the language, pre-training can be highly effective\" [9].\n\nThis relationship is visualized below:\n![Figure 1 & 2 show that pre-training (dashed lines) consistently improves BLEU scores over standard training (solid lines) across various training set sizes, with the largest gains observed at smaller training set sizes.](image5)\nThe top graph shows pre-trained models (dashed lines) consistently outperforming standard models across different training set sizes. The bottom graph (referenced as Figure 2 in [1]) specifically illustrates that the increase in BLEU score due to pre-training is most substantial when the training set size is small.\n\n**Language similarity** also plays a crucial role. The general hypothesis is that \"the gain from pre-training of embeddings may be larger when the source and target languages are more similar\" [10], and empirical results suggest that \"pre-trained embeddings seem to be more effective for more similar translation pairs\" [4]. This is because semantically similar words are likely to have more similar neighborhoods in the embedding space if the languages are linguistically close.\n\nIn multilingual translation settings, where a single encoder is used for multiple source languages, pre-training and alignment help put word embeddings into similar vector spaces [3]. The gains observed often correlate with language similarity. For instance, when training a multilingual model and testing on a low-resource language, the GL/PT (Galician/Portuguese) pair, which is highly similar, showed the largest gains from pre-training, while BE/RU (Belarusian/Russian), being less similar in this context, showed a small decrease before alignment [3], [6].\n\n![Table 5 demonstrates that in multilingual translation, pre-training and alignment yield significant gains, particularly for similar language pairs like GL/PT.](image3)\nAs seen in Table 5, the \"pre\" and \"align\" columns show improved BLEU scores over the standard multilingual system (\"std\") for GL+PT evaluating on GL, highlighting the benefit for similar languages [2], [3].\n\nHowever, for bilingual translation into a common target language like Portuguese, the results can be more nuanced. While more similar languages like Spanish (ES), French (FR), and Italian (IT) show good improvements when translated to Portuguese (PT) [8], [10]:\n![Table 3 shows that while pre-training generally improves BLEU scores, dissimilar language pairs like HE->PT can see larger absolute gains if their baseline is very low.](image1)\nFrom this table, we observe that Hebrew (HE), which has no common language family with Portuguese, shows the largest BLEU score increase (+8.9) with pre-training. Russian (RU), also less similar to Portuguese than the Romance languages, also sees a substantial gain (+6.2). This can be \"largely attributed to the observation that systems with larger headroom to improve tend to see larger increases; RU and HE have very low baseline BLEU scores, so it makes sense that their increases would be larger\" [8].\n\nIn summary, pre-training generally improves translation accuracy, particularly for low-frequency words and in low-resource settings with a \"sweet-spot\" at smaller training sizes; its effectiveness is often greater for more similar language pairs, though dissimilar languages with very low baselines can also see significant gains."}

The idea behind aligning embeddings is that having consistent embedding spaces across languages could help Neural Machine Translation (NMT) systems more easily learn correspondences between source and target languages [3].\n\nIn bilingual translation tasks, aligning word embeddings does not consistently lead to improvements and may even slightly degrade performance for some language pairs.\n![Table showing BLEU scores for bilingual translation with unaligned and aligned embeddings, indicating mixed results for alignment.](image4)\nThe table above (Table 4 from the context) shows that for bilingual translation into English, such as Galician (GL) to English (EN) or Portuguese (PT) to English (EN), using aligned embeddings sometimes resulted in lower BLEU scores compared to unaligned embeddings (e.g., GL → EN: 12.8 unaligned vs. 11.5 aligned). This suggests that *a priori* alignment might not always be necessary or beneficial in bilingual settings [5].\n\nHowever, in multilingual translation systems, especially those that use a shared encoder for multiple source languages, aligning word embeddings generally proves helpful.\n![Table showing BLEU scores for multilingual translation into English, where alignment consistently improves performance over pre-trained unaligned embeddings.](image3)\nAs shown in this table (Table 5) [9], which presents results for multilingual translation into English, aligning word embeddings (column \"align\") consistently increases BLEU scores for all tested language pairs compared to using pre-trained but unaligned embeddings (column \"pre\") [7]. For example, in the GL+PT to GL task, the aligned score is 22.4, while the pre-trained unaligned score is 20.8. This improvement is intuitive because a shared encoder benefits from source language embeddings being in a similar vector space, simplifying the learning process [7]. Alignment is thus considered helpful in multilingual training scenarios [5].\n\nRegarding the F-measure scores for target words based on their frequency in the training corpus, pre-training word embeddings generally improves translation accuracy for the entire vocabulary. This improvement is particularly significant for words that are of low frequency in the training data [8].\n![Graph showing F-measure scores for target words bucketed by frequency, where pre-training consistently outperforms the standard model, especially for low-frequency words.](image2)\nThe graph above (Figure 2) illustrates that pre-trained models (\"pre,\" red bars) achieve higher F-measure scores across all word frequency buckets compared to standard models (\"std,\" blue bars). The most substantial gains are observed for low-frequency words (e.g., those appearing 0-99 times in the corpus), indicating that pre-training helps the model better handle rarer vocabulary [8].\n\nIn summary, aligning word embeddings is generally beneficial for multilingual NMT systems but not consistently for bilingual ones, and pre-training significantly improves the translation of low-frequency words as measured by F-score."}

However, removing R-GCN from this setup (GloVe w/o R-GCN) results in an 8.0 point drop in accuracy on the unmasked validation set [2]. This highlights the R-GCN's role in updating mention representations based on their relations to others, even without accessing context [2].\n```markdown\n![Table 3 shows ablation study results, including 'GloVe with R-GCN' (59.2 unmasked, 11.1 masked) and 'GloVe w/o R-GCN' (51.2 unmasked, 11.6 masked).

This is a drop from the 'full (single)' model's performance of 65.1 (unmasked) and 70.4 (masked) [1]. The results suggest that WIKIPHOP genuinely requires multihop inference, as the best model is 6.1% and 8.4% more accurate than this local model (No R-GCN) in unmasked and masked settings, respectively [4].\n\nWhen all relation types are removed and nodes are fully-connected without distinguishing edge types ('No relation types'), there are only marginal improvements over the ELMo-only model ('No R-GCN') in both unmasked and masked settings [9].

In contrast, \"Entity-GCN without coreference (single model)\" scored 64.8 on unmasked development but a higher 67.6 on the unmasked test set [6]. This suggests that while coreference might offer a small benefit on development data, it can surprisingly degrade performance on test data, possibly because the coreference system is less reliable on more challenging test documents [6].\n```markdown\n![Table 2 shows that Entity-GCN with coreference (single model) achieved unmasked scores of 65.3 (Dev) and 66.4 (Test), while Entity-GCN without coreference (single model) achieved unmasked scores of 64.8 (Dev) and 67.6 (Test).](image4)\n```\n\nIn the **masked setting**, coreference information is handled differently, and an external coreference resolution system is generally not applied. This is because the masking process itself effectively resolves coreferences: \"in the masked version, an entity is always referred to via the same unique surface form (e.g., MASK1) within and across documents\" [2]. This means all mentions of the same entity are labeled with the same unique identifier, even if their original surface forms did not match [2]. Consequently, the model relies more on exact matching when constructing its graph for the masked case, which proves more effective in recovering coreference links [10]. The ablation study shown in Table 3 reflects this, as the \"No COREF\" row has a dash for the masked setting, indicating this specific ablation was not performed, likely because coreference is inherently addressed by the masking.\n```markdown\n![Table 3 shows ablation study results, where the 'No COREF' row has a dash under the 'masked' column, indicating this ablation was not performed for the masked setting.](image2)\n```\nModels evaluated on masked data, such as \"Entity-GCN without coreference (single model)\" which achieved 70.5 on the masked development set, perform well by leveraging the coreference information implicitly provided by the masking process itself, rather than an external coreference system.\n```markdown\n![Table 2 shows that the Entity-GCN without coreference (single model) achieved an accuracy of 70.5 on the masked development set.](image4)\n```\n\nIn summary, for unmasked settings, an explicit coreference system can offer a slight benefit on development data but may degrade performance on test data, while in masked settings, coreference is inherently handled by the masking process itself, making an additional external system generally unnecessary."}

This represents a performance advantage of 9.3 points for the 'full (ensemble)' model.\n\nThe performance difference is even more pronounced in the masked setting. Here, the 'full (ensemble)' model scores 71.6, whereas 'GloVe with R-GCN' scores only 11.1 [image5]. This results in a substantial gap of 60.5 points.\n\nThe superior performance of the 'full (ensemble)' model is reflected in its relation-based accuracy and precision metrics.\n![Table 2 shows performance metrics for different models, with 'overall (ensemble)' corresponding to the 'full (ensemble)' model, detailing its accuracy, P@2, and P@5 scores.](image2)\nFor instance, the 'overall (ensemble)' model, which corresponds to the 'full (ensemble)' model, shows an accuracy of 68.5, P@2 of 81.0, and P@5 of 94.1 [image2]. This indicates a strong ability to correctly identify relations and rank correct answers highly.\n\nThe use of more advanced ELMo embeddings in the 'full' model, as opposed to GloVe, contributes to this difference. Text quote [6] states that replacing ELMo with GloVe (even when R-GCN is included) still yields a competitive system but is a step down from ELMo-based models. It also notes, \"if we then remove R-GCN (GloVe w/o R-GCN in Table 3), we lose 8.0 points. That is, the R-GCN component pushes the model to perform above Coref-GRU still without accessing context, but rather by updating mention representations based on their relation to other ones\" [6]. This underscores the R-GCN's role in leveraging relational information. The 'full (ensemble)' model benefits from both superior embeddings and the ensemble approach, achieving over 2% improvement over previously published results, and the ensemble brings a further 3.6% improvement [10]. The drastic drop in performance for 'GloVe with R-GCN' in the masked setting suggests that GloVe embeddings are less effective at handling masked entities where contextual understanding and graph relations are even more critical [7].\n\nThe 'full (ensemble)' model demonstrates substantially better performance metrics than the 'GloVe with R-GCN' model in both unmasked and masked conditions, with these differences reflecting stronger relation-based accuracy and precision due to superior embeddings and ensembling."}

These evaluations were conducted on datasets specifically preprocessed for overlapping entities [10] and did not include the relation layer due to the absence of relation annotations, though the coreference propagation layer was used [4].\n```markdown\n![DyGIE achieves superior Entity F1 scores (84.7 on ACE04-O, 82.9 on ACE05-O, 76.2 on GENIA) for overlapping entity extraction compared to prior systems.](image3)\n```\nThe model's components are analyzed using the dev sets of ACE2005 and SciERC [1].\n\n**On the ACE2005 dataset:**\nDyGIE achieves an entity F1 score of 87.1 and a relation F1 score of 58.4.\n```markdown\n![On ACE2005, DyGIE (Entity F1 87.1, Relation F1 58.4) shows changes with ablation of CorefProp (Entity F1 85.7, Relation F1 60.2) and RelProp (Entity F1 86.9, Relation F1 58.0).](image1)\n```\n-   **CorefProp (`-CorefProp`)**: On ACE2005, coreference propagation is primarily beneficial for entity extraction; removing it lowers the entity F1 score from 87.1 to 85.7. However, it appears to hurt relation extraction, as removing it increases the relation F1 score from 58.4 to 60.2 [9] (see image1).\n-   **RelProp (`-RelProp`)**: Relation propagation significantly benefits both entity and relation extraction on ACE2005 [9]. Removing it reduces the entity F1 from 87.1 to 86.9 and the relation F1 from 58.4 to 58.0 (see image1). Relation propagation is particularly effective in sentences with a higher number of entities [3].\nThe number of propagation iterations also matters:\n```markdown\n![Entity F1 on ACE05 peaks at N=2 coreference iterations, and Relation F1 peaks at M=2 relation iterations.](image2)\n```\nAs shown, entity F1 on ACE05 tends to peak with N=2 iterations for coreference propagation, and relation F1 peaks with M=2 iterations for relation propagation (image2).\n\n**On the SciERC dataset:**\nDyGIE achieves an entity F1 score of 68.2 and a relation F1 score of 42.0.\n```markdown\n![On SciERC, DyGIE (Entity F1 68.2, Relation F1 42.0) performance is affected by removing CorefProp (Entity F1 68.0, Relation F1 41.2) and RelProp (Entity F1 67.5, Relation F1 40.4).](image4)\n```\n-   **CorefProp (`-CorefProp`)**: On SciERC, coreference propagation offers a small benefit for both entity and relation tasks [9]. Removing `CorefProp` results in a slight decrease in entity F1 from 68.2 to 68.0 and relation F1 from 42.0 to 41.2 (see image4). The impact of `CorefProp` on entity F1 is notably smaller on SciERC compared to ACE05 [7]. This is partly because pronouns in SciERC are uniformly assigned a \"Generic\" label, which limits the effectiveness of coreference propagation for entity extraction [6].\n-   **RelProp (`-RelProp`)**: Relation propagation significantly benefits both entity and relation extraction in the SciERC domain as well [9]. Removing `RelProp` leads to a decrease in entity F1 from 68.2 to 67.5 and relation F1 from 42.0 to 40.4 (see image4).\n\nIn summary, DyGIE's performance varies across datasets, with `RelProp` generally enhancing both entity and relation extraction, while `CorefProp`'s influence is more nuanced, benefiting entities on ACE2005 but slightly hurting relations, and having a minor positive effect on both in SciERC."}

As shown in Table 5 (from the paper, corresponding to image 1), the full DyGIE model achieves a higher Entity F1 score (87.1) compared to when the coreference propagation layer is removed (85.7 F1) [1].\n```markdown\n![Table 5 shows that DyGIE with CorefProp (Entity F1 87.1) outperforms DyGIE without CorefProp (Entity F1 85.7) on the SciERC dataset.](image1)\n```\nIt's noted, however, that the impact of `CorefProp` on entity extraction performance in the SciERC dataset might be somewhat moderated because pronouns in this dataset are uniformly assigned a \"Generic\" label [9].\n\nFor datasets like ACE05, which feature challenges such as disambiguating the entity class for pronominal mentions, coreference propagation is particularly impactful. This often requires reasoning with cross-sentence contexts. DyGIE demonstrates a significant 6.6% improvement on pronoun performance in ACE05, supporting the hypothesis that coreference propagation aids in these scenarios [10].\n\nThe datasets evaluated for overlapping entity extraction, namely ACE04-O, ACE05-O, and GENIA, have different characteristics regarding their native coreference annotations.\n```markdown\n![Statistics for overlapping entity extraction datasets indicate ACE04-O and GENIA natively include coreference annotations, while ACE05-O does not.](image4)\n```\nEven though ACE05-O may lack native coreference annotations as suggested by Image 4, the DyGIE model's coreference layer, whose parameters are trained using the OntoNotes annotations [5], is still employed for this dataset. In fact, the coreference propagation layer is included in the models for ACE2004, ACE2005, and GENIA when performing overlapping entity extraction, as relation annotations are not available for these specific dataset versions [7].\n\nThe effectiveness of the coreference layer in entity extraction tasks can also be optimized. For instance, the number of coreference propagation iterations influences performance, with studies showing that the best performance is often achieved after a specific number of iterations, such as N=2 for entity extraction [6].\n```markdown\n![Figure 3a illustrates that the Entity F1 score for entity extraction peaks when the number of coreference propagation iterations (N) is 2.](image5)\n```\n\nThe presence of coreference annotations in datasets, or the application of a model component trained for coreference resolution, generally enhances DyGIE's entity recognition performance by improving contextual understanding and disambiguation across diverse datasets."}

The score is high for sentences with 2 entities, then drops for 3 and 4-5 entities. It sees a resurgence for sentences with 6-11 entities before declining sharply for sentences with 12 or more entities. This suggests that while propagation iterations have a clear optimal point, the complexity introduced by a higher number of entities in a sentence generally makes relation extraction more challenging, though performance can vary.\n\nBoth the number of propagation iterations and the number of entities per sentence affect F1 scores, with propagation iterations having a clear optimal point at 2, while the number of entities shows a more varied impact on relation F1, generally decreasing with very high entity counts."}

Generally, Simple Word-Embedding-based Models (SWEMs) are presented as surprisingly effective, often achieving comparable or even superior performance to more complex CNN architectures, particularly while being more parameter-efficient [5, 6].\n\nWhen evaluating model complexity using subspace training, SWEM models can be more parameter-efficient. For instance, on the AG News and Yelp P. datasets, SWEM generally achieves higher accuracy than CNN at lower subspace dimensions, meaning it can reach a good solution with fewer effective parameters [3].\n```markdown\n![Graphs show SWEM achieving higher accuracy than CNN at lower subspace dimensions for AG News (left) and Yelp P. (right) datasets.](image1)\n```\nAs illustrated in the provided graphs (image1), SWEM (blue line) often surpasses CNN (red line) in accuracy when the subspace dimension `d` is small, especially for the AG News dataset. For example, to reach an 80% accuracy on AG News, SWEM requires a smaller `d_int` (intrinsic dimension) than CNN [3]. However, on the Yelp P. dataset, CNN can achieve higher accuracy when `d` is large, suggesting CNNs can better leverage a higher number of trainable parameters in some scenarios [3].\n\nIn sentence matching tasks, such as natural language inference (SNLI, MultiNLI), answer sentence selection (WikiQA), and paraphrase identification (Quora, MSRP), SWEM variants often perform very well.\n```markdown\n![Table 5 shows SWEM models, particularly SWEM-max and SWEM-concat, performing competitively or better than CNN and LSTM on sentence matching tasks like SNLI, MultiNLI, WikiQA, Quora, and MSRP.](image2)\n```\nThe table (image2) shows that on most datasets considered, SWEM demonstrates strong results compared to CNN or LSTM encoders. For example, SWEM-max achieves 83.8% accuracy on SNLI, and SWEM-concat achieves high scores on Quora and MSRP, often outperforming the CNN model listed [1].\n\nFor document classification, particularly topic categorization (e.g., Yahoo! Answer, AG News) and ontology classification (e.g., DBpedia), SWEM models also demonstrate robust performance, sometimes outperforming both LSTM and CNN models. For instance, SWEM-concat showed stronger performance on topic prediction tasks than CNNs [7].\n\nHowever, for short sentence classification tasks, the comparison is more nuanced.\n```markdown\n![Table 8 shows SWEM models having mixed performance compared to CNN on sentence classification tasks, being inferior on sentiment analysis (MR, SST-1, SST-2) but comparable on others (Subj, TREC).](image3)\n```\nOn sentiment analysis datasets (MR, SST-1, SST-2), SWEM models tend to yield inferior accuracies compared to CNNs. This suggests that for shorter texts where word order and local contextual features (n-grams) are crucial for tasks like sentiment detection, CNNs might have an advantage. Conversely, on other short text tasks like subjectivity classification (Subj) and question classification (TREC), SWEM exhibits comparable performance to CNNs, while still being more efficient in terms of parameters and training speed [10]. It's noted that SWEM is generally less effective for short sentences compared to long documents, possibly because word-order features, which SWEMs (like SWEM-avg/max) largely ignore, become more important when the overall semantic signal from embeddings alone is limited due to text brevity [10].\n\nSWEM models are highly competitive and often more parameter-efficient than CNNs, particularly in document classification and sentence matching, and at lower subspace dimensions, while CNNs may have an edge in tasks requiring fine-grained local feature extraction from short texts or when a larger number of parameters can be effectively utilized."}

Notably, the transfer of the LSTM and embedding layers is generally more beneficial than transferring the output layer, which is typically more task-specific [7]. For datasets D3 and D4, which have extremely unbalanced label distributions, the transfer of the embedding layer is particularly helpful [7]. The unbalanced nature of these datasets, especially the small number of neutral examples, is evident in their statistics.\n```markdown\n![Table shows the distribution of positive, negative, and neutral examples for training and testing sets of four datasets (D1, D2, D3, D4).](image1)\n```\nThe statistics in `image1` show that D3 (Restaurant15-Train/Test) and D4 (Restaurant16-Train/Test) have notably fewer neutral examples compared to positive and negative ones, especially D3-Train with only 50 neutral examples [2]. This characteristic makes them sensitive to learning neutral-related features [2].\n\nComparing overall methods, approaches incorporating document-level knowledge like \"Ours: PRET\", \"Ours: MULT\", and especially their combination \"Ours: PRET+MULT\", generally outperform baseline models such as LSTM and LSTM+ATT across various datasets, as indicated by accuracy and Macro-F1 scores [7].\n```markdown\n![Table 4 compares the performance (Accuracy and Macro-F1) of various methods, including LSTM, LSTM+ATT, and the proposed PRET, MULT, and PRET+MULT, across four datasets.](image4)\n```\nThe results in `image4` highlight that a large portion of the performance gain often comes from pretraining (PRET) [7].\n\nWhen varying the percentage of document-level training examples for the PRET + MULT approach, distinct trends are observed in model performance [5].\n```markdown\n![Graphs show the accuracy and Macro-F1 scores on four datasets (D1, D2, D3, D4) as the percentage of document-level training examples increases from 0.0 to 1.0.](image3)\n```\nAs illustrated in `image3`, accuracy improvements are relatively stable across all four datasets (D1, D2, D3, D4) as more document-level examples are incorporated [5]. For Macro-F1 scores, the improvements are stable for datasets D1 and D2. However, datasets D3 and D4 exhibit sharp increases in Macro-F1 scores when the percentage of document-level examples changes from 0% to 40% [5]. This significant improvement in D3 and D4 might be linked to their very small number of neutral examples, where even a small increase in correctly identified neutral instances can largely affect precision and recall [2, 5]. The pretraining on larger document-level corpora helps address the issue of insufficient training data, which can limit the model's ability to capture diverse sequential patterns [9].\n\nThe inclusion of different model components, especially transferred layers like LSTM and embeddings, enhances performance, and increasing document-level training data generally leads to stable accuracy gains and notable Macro-F1 improvements on specific datasets."}

A similar trend is observed for the single `restaurant` domain within MultiWOZ, where TRADE achieves a joint accuracy of 65.35% [5], [10].\n\nIn domain adaptation scenarios, TRADE also shows strong performance, particularly when fine-tuned on a new domain after being pre-trained on others [8]. Expanding TRADE from four domains to a new domain by fine-tuning yields better results than training a model from scratch on the new domain, even with limited data. For example, fine-tuning with only 1% of the `Train` domain data allowed TRADE to achieve 59.83% joint accuracy, outperforming a model trained from scratch on the same 1% of `Train` domain data (44.24%) [7].\n\nDifferent fine-tuning strategies were explored, including Naive fine-tuning, Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC), and a method called GEM.\n![Table 3 demonstrates that fine-tuning the TRADE model with GEM on a new domain (e.g., Hotel, Train) generally achieves better performance on the new domain and less degradation on original domains compared to Naive/EWC fine-tuning or training from scratch with 1% new domain data.](image3)\nThe results in Table 3 indicate that GEM generally outperforms Naive and EWC fine-tuning in terms of overcoming catastrophic forgetting on the original four domains [6], [8].

For example, when introducing 'hotel' and 'attraction' as new domains, fine-tuning with GEM leads to better performance on the new domain compared to naive fine-tuning. Specifically, GEM achieves $34.73\\%$ joint accuracy on the 'attraction' domain, whereas naive fine-tuning only reaches $29.39\\%$ [1].

EWC, which uses the Fisher information matrix as a regularizer [3], generally performs better than naive fine-tuning but is often outperformed by GEM, which constrains gradients to prevent loss on stored samples from source domains [8].\n\nThe similarity of slots between the source and target domains significantly affects performance.

This typically involved modifying input sentences by prepending stereotypical gender adjectives like \"handsome\" to male entities and \"pretty\" to female entities [8]. The goal was to see if these strong gender signals could \"correct\" existing profession-based gender biases by guiding the translation towards the intended gender, even when the system might otherwise default to a stereotype [8].\n\nThe findings indicate that such adjustments can indeed improve performance in certain languages. Specifically, this method led to a significant reduction in gender bias and an increase in gender prediction accuracy for translations into Spanish, Russian, and Ukrainian [8]. The performance changes based on this modification of the WinoMT corpus are detailed in Table 4 [6].\n\n`![Table 4 shows increased gender prediction accuracy for Spanish, Russian, and Ukrainian when stereotypical adjectives were added to the input.](image2)`\nAs shown in this table, adding stereotypical gender adjectives (+Adj) improved the gender prediction accuracy when compared to the original dataset:\n*   For Spanish (ES), accuracy increased from 53.1% to 63.5% (a change of +10.4).\n*   For Russian (RU), accuracy saw an improvement from 37.7% to 48.9% (a change of +11.2).\n*   For Ukrainian (UK), accuracy rose from 38.4% to 42.9% (a change of +4.5) [8], `![Table 4 shows increased gender prediction accuracy for Spanish, Russian, and Ukrainian when stereotypical adjectives were added to the input.](image2)`.\n\nAn example illustrates how this adjustment can \"fix\" a biased translation:\n`![An example shows adding 'pretty' to 'baker' (a stereotypically female adjective) corrects the Spanish translation to reflect a female baker.](image3)`\nIn the provided example, the sentence \"The janitor does not like the baker because she always messes up the kitchen\" was initially translated into Spanish giving \"baker\" a male inflection (\"el panadero\"), despite the pronoun \"she\" indicating a female baker. When the source sentence was adjusted to \"The janitor does not like the pretty baker...\", the addition of the stereotypically female adjective \"pretty\" prompted a corrected translation with the female inflection \"la panadera\" [image3].\n\nWhile these stereotype-based adjustments demonstrated a positive impact on accuracy for these specific languages and further highlighted the existence of gender bias in machine translation, it is noted that this particular method is \"impractical as a general debiasing scheme\" because it assumes prior knowledge of the entity's gender (oracle coreference resolution) [8].\n\nStereotype-based adjustments, such as adding gendered adjectives to input text, can improve gender accuracy in machine translation for specific languages like Spanish, Russian, and Ukrainian by providing stronger gender signals, although this method has practical limitations for general application."}

For instance, in an open-domain setting, a single-hop model's performance is notably lower compared to a distractor-based setting.\n`![Table shows F1 scores for different settings: Distractor (67.08), Open-domain 10 Paragraphs (38.40), Open-domain 500 Paragraphs (39.12), and + Gold Paragraph (53.12).](image2)`\nAs seen in the table, the F1 score is 67.08 in the distractor setting, but drops to 38.40 with 10 retrieved paragraphs and 39.12 with 500 paragraphs in an open-domain scenario. This decrease is largely attributed to the \"insufﬁciencies of standard TF-IDF retrieval for multi-hop questions\" [5]. Adding gold paragraphs significantly improves the F1 score to 53.12, demonstrating the critical impact of successful paragraph retrieval [5]. Even with a large number of distractors, such as 500, they may still be insufficient to challenge the model adequately [4].\n\nThe type of question also influences performance. Single-paragraph BERT, for example, struggles with multi-hop comparison questions, achieving \"near chance accuracy\" [8].\n`![Table shows question types (Multi-hop, Context-dependent, Single-hop) with example questions, percentage, and F1 scores; single-hop questions have higher F1 (70.54) than multi-hop (54.46) for a single-paragraph model.](image3)`\nThis table illustrates that single-hop comparison questions achieve a higher F1 score (70.54) compared to multi-hop (54.46) or context-dependent multi-hop questions (56.16) [2]. Furthermore, simplifying questions by reducing them to the first five tokens also degrades performance; for single-paragraph BERT, this led to a drop in F1 score from 67.08 to 52.13 [1].\n\nTraining strategies, particularly involving adversarial distractors, also affect F1 scores.\n`![Table shows F1 scores for different training (Original, Adversarial) and evaluation (Original, Adversarial, +Type) data.

However, if the model is re-trained on these adversarial distractors, its F1 score on the same adversarial test set increases to 60.10 [9], [10]. Filtering adversarial distractors by entity type further challenges the original model, dropping its F1 to 40.73. Yet, a model trained on adversarial distractors can recover a substantial part of its accuracy (58.42 F1) even with this type filtering [6], [10].\n\nIn summary, F1 scores in question answering are sensitive to evaluation settings like distractor quality and retrieval effectiveness, question complexity (single-hop vs. multi-hop), and training methodologies, including the use of adversarial data."}

This process aims to mirror the distribution of statistical cues across both labels, thereby neutralizing their predictive power [2].\n\n![Example of original vs. adversarial data point showing claim negation and warrant/alternative swap.](image3)\n*This image illustrates how an original data point (left) is transformed into an adversarial one (right) by negating the claim and swapping the warrant and alternative, while keeping the reason the same [2].*\n\nOn the original ARCT dataset, BERT models demonstrated surprisingly high performance, with a peak accuracy of 77%, which is close to the average untrained human baseline [8].\n\n![Table showing BERT's test performance on the original dataset, with max accuracy around 77%.](image5)\n*This table shows BERT's performance on the original test set, achieving a maximum accuracy of 0.770 [8].*\n\nHowever, when evaluated on the adversarial dataset, where models were trained and validated on adversarial data, BERT's performance dropped drastically.

Firstly, it strongly suggests that BERT's high performance on the original ARCT dataset was largely due to its ability to exploit spurious statistical cues rather than genuine argument comprehension [7, 8]. The adversarial dataset successfully eliminates these cues, providing a more challenging and realistic benchmark [3, 6]. Consequently, the results on the adversarial set indicate that, in the context of the original dataset's flaws, BERT had learned \"nothing about argument comprehension\" [7]. This setup therefore offers a more robust evaluation for argument comprehension models and is recommended as the standard for future work on the ARCT dataset [3, 10].\n\nThe adversarial data setup causes BERT's performance on the ARCT dataset to drop from a high of 77% to around 50-53% (random chance), indicating that BERT's initial success was due to exploiting spurious cues rather than true argument comprehension, and the adversarial set offers a more robust evaluation."}

This demonstrates COMET's capability to generate new edges and even new nodes, extending the knowledge graph [1].\n\nQualitatively, COMET can produce novel and plausible completions. For example, it generated the tuple \"mango IsA fruit,\" which was not in the training set. The only training data for \"mango\" was \"mango UsedFor salsa,\" which is less informative. A version of COMET without pre-training incorrectly inferred \"mango IsA spice\" [2].\n![Table 7 shows examples of generated commonsense knowledge tuples by COMET, including 'mango IsA fruit', which is marked as plausible.](image3)\n\nThese results, particularly the high accuracy in human evaluations (91.7% for ConceptNet) and significant novelty (59.25% novel tuples), demonstrate COMET's strong performance [3, 4].\n\nThe comparison indicates that COMET is highly effective at generating accurate and novel commonsense knowledge for the ConceptNet dataset, often approaching human-level performance."}

As seen in the table above (Image2, \"All\" attacks column), both have a sensitivity of 11.3.\n*   The \"Background\" backoff strategy shows a slightly higher sensitivity of 13.1.\n*   This is partly because word-only classifiers internally treat all out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words similarly. For these models, the \"Pass-Through\" strategy is less sensitive because OOV character combinations are rendered identical [8]. The \"Neutral\" backoff maintains low sensitivity by mapping unknown (UNK) predictions to a fixed neutral word, thereby reducing the number of unique outputs [4], [7].\n\nFor **Open Vocabulary Models (char/word+char/word-piece)**:\n*   The \"Neutral\" backoff strategy achieves the lowest sensitivity, with a value of 11.3 under \"All\" attacks (Image2). This strategy's effectiveness stems from its consistent mapping of UNK predictions to a fixed neutral word [4], [7].\n*   The \"Background\" backoff has a moderate sensitivity of 14.7.\n*   The \"Pass-Through\" backoff results in considerably higher sensitivity (30.3). This is because open vocabulary classifiers consider every unique combination of characters differently, so passing through all variations provides more attack avenues [4], [8].\n\nRegarding Word Error Rate (WER), this is a measure of the accuracy of the word recognition model itself with different backoff strategies.\n\n```markdown\n![Table showing Word Error Rates (WER) of different spell-correctors and ScRNN backoff variants under various attacks.](image5)\n```\nAs shown in the table above (Image5, \"All\" column for ScRNN (10K) w/ Backoff Variants):\n*   The \"Background\" backoff strategy achieves the lowest WER at 6.9%.

However, in practice, minimizing one can sometimes increase the other. Sensitivity is often the more dominant factor for overall robustness when the WERs of the considered variants are reasonably low [10]. For instance, while the \"Background\" model has the lowest WER, the \"Neutral\" backoff often provides superior robustness due to its consistently lower sensitivity across different model types [7].\n\nIn summary, sensitivity varies more dramatically between closed and open vocabulary models with different backoffs (especially Pass-Through) than WER, with Neutral backoff generally offering the lowest sensitivity for open vocabulary models; Background backoff provides the lowest WER but can have higher sensitivity."}

This aligns with the observation that \"QE systems are visibly in all language pairs but they can also reach high system-level correlations, up to .947 (Chinese-English) or .936 (English-German) by YiSi-1_srl\" [7].\n\nVisual representations of system-level metric performance further support the strong showing of YiSi metrics.

Textual evidence highlights that metrics like YiSi and ESIM, which often utilize word or sentence-level embeddings, achieve high performance in both system-level and segment-level evaluations [2, 3, 5]. This is attributed to their ability to capture more semantic understanding compared to n-gram based baselines [3]. The evaluation framework ensures that metrics are oriented correctly (higher scores mean better quality) and aims to promote discerning metrics by penalizing ties [1, 8, 9].\n\nFor translations **out of English (en-X)** at the segment level, as detailed in the WMT19 Metrics Task [4], the YiSi metrics show robust performance.\n![Table showing segment-level Kendall's Tau for out-of-English translations (e.g., en-cs, en-de); YiSi-1 is frequently bolded, indicating it is not significantly outperformed by other metrics in many language pairs.](image1)\nSpecifically, YiSi-1 is not significantly outperformed in 7 out of the 8 language pairs presented (en-cs, en-fi, en-gu, en-kk, en-lt, en-ru, en-zh), and YiSi-1_SRL also performs strongly, particularly for en-de and en-zh. ESIM is also a top performer for the en-zh pair [1].\n\nFor translations **into English (X-en)** at the system level, these semantic metrics continue to excel.\n![Table showing system-level Pearson correlation for into-English translations (e.g., de-en, fi-en); YiSi-1_SRL, YiSi-1, and ESIM are often bolded, signifying they are not significantly outperformed.](image5)\nIn this direction, YiSi-1_SRL is not significantly outperformed in 6 out of 7 language pairs (de-en, fi-en, kk-en, lt-en, ru-en, zh-en). YiSi-1 is also a leading metric for 4 pairs (fi-en, gu-en, kk-en, lt-en), and ESIM is among the top for 2 pairs (fi-en, kk-en) [5]. This data comes from system-level assessments using Pearson correlation [10].\n\nComparing the two directions, metrics like YiSi and ESIM are consistently among the top performers regardless of whether the translation is into or out of English, although the specific variant (e.g., YiSi-1 vs. YiSi-1_SRL) may show slight advantages depending on the language pair, direction, and evaluation level (segment or system). For language pairs not involving English, YiSi-1 also demonstrates strong performance at the segment level, for instance, in de-cs, de-fr, and fr-de language pairs [7].\n![Table showing segment-level Kendall's Tau for non-English language pairs (e.g., de-cs, fr-de); YiSi-1 is bolded for all three pairs, indicating strong performance.](image2)\nPairwise significance tests, as illustrated in various figures (referenced in [6] and exemplified by the structure of significance matrices), further confirm that metrics like YiSi and ESIM are seldom outperformed by others across multiple language pairs and directions.\n\nEvaluation metrics like YiSi and ESIM consistently perform well across different language pairs and are effective for translations both into and out of English, with their strong performance underscored by statistical significance."}

This represents a net decrease of $36 million.\n\nThis change is due to a few contributing factors:\n1.  **Amortization Expense**: The primary reason for the decrease in the net carrying amount was the amortization recorded during 2020. The accumulated amortization for finite-lived intangible assets increased from $113 million in 2019 to $162 million in 2020 [image5]. This increase of $49 million represents the amortization expense for these assets during 2020, which reduces their carrying value. Amortization expense is a regular charge for intangible assets with finite lives [1]. The company's total depreciation and amortization expense in 2020 was $232 million [1].\n2.  **Additions to Intangible Assets**: There was an increase in the gross carrying amount of finite-lived intangible assets, from $445 million in 2019 to $456 million in 2020 [image5]. This increase of $11 million, mainly due to a $11 million rise in the gross carrying amount of \"Developed technology\" (from $291 million to $302 million) [image5], suggests additions or acquisitions of new intangible assets during the year. These additions partially offset the decrease caused by amortization.\n3.  **Changes in \"Other\"**: The \"Other\" column in the breakdown of finite-lived intangible assets, which might include items like foreign currency translation adjustments or other reclassifications, increased from a total of $2 million in 2019 to $4 million in 2020 [image5]. This net increase of $2 million had a slightly positive impact on the net carrying amount.\n\nThe net decrease of $36 million is the result of these factors: an $11 million increase from additions to gross assets, a $49 million decrease due to amortization, and a $2 million increase from changes in the \"Other\" category ($11 million - $49 million + $2 million = -$36 million).\n\nThe net carrying amount of finite-lived intangible assets decreased by $36 million from 2019 to 2020, primarily due to amortization expense, partially offset by additions to these assets."}

The net effect of new leases being recognized would outweigh the reduction from payments made on existing leases or the termination/expiration of old leases.\n*   **Discount Rate**: The weighted average discount rate applied to operating leases decreased slightly from 3.1% in 2019 to 2.8% in 2020 [10]. For any new leases recognized, a lower discount rate would result in a higher present value of lease payments, thus increasing the lease liability.\n*   **Lease Term**: The weighted average remaining lease term remained constant at 7 years for both 2019 and 2020, suggesting that new leases entered into had, on average, a similar duration to those on the books, or that extensions balanced expirations [10].\n\nThe company's total operating lease liabilities increased from $797 million in 2019 to $974 million in 2020, likely due to the recognition of new or modified leases and a slight decrease in the weighted average discount rate."}

The Corporation took steps to strengthen its liquidity in 2020, including implementing significant capital and operating cost reductions due to lower realized prices for its products, which resulted in substantially lower earnings and operating cash flow compared to 2019 [4].\n\nThe decrease in Capex was seen across segments.

Image4 confirms this, showing an income tax benefit of $5,632 million in 2020 versus an expense of $5,282 million in 2019.

Consequently, the effective tax rate decreased from 34 percent in 2019 to 17 percent in 2020, mainly due to a change in the mix of results in jurisdictions with varying tax rates [10, 9]. Total other taxes and duties also decreased from $33.2 billion in 2019 to $28.4 billion in 2020 [9, 10].\n\n**Financial Implications**\n\nThe changes in capital expenditures and taxes occurred within a broader context of financial challenges and responses. Industry conditions in 2020 led to lower realized prices for ExxonMobil's products [4].\n\n`![Worldwide average hydrocarbon prices declined in 2020 compared to 2019.](image2)`\n\nThe lower prices for crude oil and NGL (from $56.32/barrel in 2019 to $35.41/barrel in 2020) and natural gas (from $3.05/thousand cubic feet in 2019 to $2.01/thousand cubic feet in 2020), as shown in image2, contributed to substantially lower earnings and operating cash flow [4].\n\nTo navigate these challenges, ExxonMobil took steps to strengthen its liquidity, including the significant capital reductions discussed earlier and issuing $23 billion of long-term debt. As a result, the Corporation ended 2020 with $68 billion in gross debt [4].\n\n`![ExxonMobil's debt-to-capital ratios increased in 2020, reflecting higher leverage.](image5)`\n\nThe increase in borrowing is reflected in the company's leverage ratios. As detailed in image5, the debt-to-capital ratio rose from 19.1% in 2019 to 29.2% in 2020, and the net debt-to-capital ratio increased from 18.1% in 2019 to 27.8% in 2020. The company intends to reduce this debt over time [4].\n\nFrom 2019 to 2020, ExxonMobil significantly reduced its capital expenditures in response to adverse market conditions and recorded a substantial decrease in total taxes, primarily due to an income tax benefit from asset impairments, which collectively impacted its financial position by increasing debt levels."}

This program is flexible, with no specified maximum number of shares or required repurchase amount, and it is expected to continue indefinitely [4]. A key condition is that repurchases will not occur if they reduce Berkshire’s consolidated cash, cash equivalents, and U.S. Treasury Bill holdings below $30 billion [4], [6]. In 2021, Berkshire significantly utilized this program, paying $27.1 billion to repurchase shares of its Class A and B common stock [4].\n\nThe details for the fourth quarter of 2021 show consistent repurchase activity:\n![Table showing total number of Class A and Class B shares repurchased, average price paid per share, and total shares as part of publicly announced program for October, November, and December 2021.](image2)\nThis table illustrates the repurchases of Class A and Class B common stock during October, November, and December 2021, including the number of shares purchased and the average price paid per share [3].\n\n**Net Earnings by Segment (2019-2021):**\nNet earnings attributable to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders showed significant fluctuation over the three years, as detailed in the table below [1]:\n![Table summarizing Berkshire Hathaway's net earnings by segment for 2021, 2020, and 2019, with totals of $89,795 million, $42,521 million, and $81,417 million respectively.](image5)\n\nHere's a breakdown of performance in key segments:\n\n*   **Insurance - Underwriting:** After-tax earnings from underwriting were $728 million in 2021, $657 million in 2020, and $325 million in 2019 [2], (image5). These results were affected by significant catastrophe losses ($2.3 billion in 2021, $750 million in 2020, $800 million in 2019), reductions in incurred losses for prior accident years in 2021, and impacts from the GEICO Giveback program and claims frequencies in 2020 and 2021 [2].\n\n*   **Insurance - Investment Income:** Earnings from insurance investment income decreased to $4,807 million in 2021 from $5,039 million in 2020 and $5,530 million in 2019 (image5). These declines were primarily due to lower interest rates on cash and U.S. Treasury Bill holdings [9].\n\n*   **Railroad:** The railroad business saw after-tax earnings rise 16.1% in 2021 to $5,990 million, compared to $5,161 million in 2020. Earnings had decreased 5.8% in 2020 from $5,481 million in 2019 (image5). The 2021 increase reflected higher freight volumes and revenue per car, while 2020 was impacted by lower volumes due to the pandemic [7].\n\n*   **Utilities and Energy:** This segment's earnings increased to $3,495 million in 2021 (up 13.1% from 2020) and $3,091 million in 2020 (up 8.8% from 2019's $2,840 million) (image5). Growth drivers included business acquisitions, higher earnings from utilities and natural gas pipelines, real estate brokerage, and renewable energy tax benefits [7].\n\n*   **Manufacturing, Service and Retailing:** Earnings from these businesses increased 34.0% in 2021 to $11,120 million, recovering from an 11.4% decline in 2020 ($8,300 million) compared to 2019 ($9,372 million) (image5). While customer demand was high in 2021, businesses faced higher input costs due to supply chain disruptions [10].\n\n*   **Other Earnings:** This category included significant after-tax goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charges, notably $11.0 billion in 2020 (largely from Precision Castparts) and $259 million in 2021 [5]. Foreign exchange rate gains also contributed $955 million in 2021, contrasting with losses in 2020 [5].\n\nBerkshire Hathaway significantly increased its stock repurchases in 2021, while its net earnings across segments varied, with strong recovery and growth in areas like manufacturing and railroad, steady growth in utilities and energy, but challenges in insurance investment income due to interest rates."}

This overall decline in revenues is evident in the financial summary, which shows total revenues dropping from $21,365 million in 2019 to $19,208 million in 2020 [image2].\n`![Table shows McDonald's operating results for 2020, 2019, and 2018, with total revenues decreasing by 10% in 2020 to $19,208 million.](image2)`\n\nThis decrease was primarily driven by sales declines in the International Operated Markets (IOM) segment due to COVID-19 [6]. Revenue declines were particularly significant in the IOM segment, affecting markets like the U.K., France, Germany, Italy, and Spain, due to temporary restaurant closures and limited operations [5]. The detailed revenue breakdown shows that in the International Operated Markets, company-operated sales fell by 19% and franchised revenues fell by 14% in 2020 compared to 2019 [image5]. While U.S. performance was more resilient, with a 2% decrease in total Company-operated sales and franchised revenues, it wasn't enough to offset the international declines [image5].

As shown in the table above, total average Card Member loans decreased from $69.4 billion in 2019 to $61.0 billion in 2021 [image2].\n*   Text quote [7] corroborates this, stating that net interest income increased (though this quote might refer to a specific segment or a shorter period, the components are relevant) \"primarily due to lower cost of funds, partially offset by lower average revolving Card Member loan balances.\" The impact of lower average loan balances was significant for the overall 2019-2021 trend.\n*   The interest rate environment also plays a role. As noted in [4], \"If the rate of interest we pay on our borrowings increases more or decreases less than the rate of interest we earn on our loans, our net interest yield, and consequently our net interest income, could decrease.\" Furthermore, \"interest rate changes may affect customer behavior, such as impacting the loan balances Card Members carry on their credit cards\" [4].\n\n**Card Member Receivables**\n\nTotal Card Member receivables experienced a slight decrease from 2019 to 2021.\n```markdown\n![Total Card Member receivables decreased from $22.8 billion in 2019 to $22.4 billion in 2021.](image4)\n```\nSeveral factors contributed to this change in Card Member receivables:\n*   A key factor influencing the level of receivables is the volume of transactions processed. Billed business decreased from $513.3 billion in 2019 to $490.9 billion in 2021.\n```markdown\n![Billed business was $513.3 billion in 2019, $406.5 billion in 2020, and $490.9 billion in 2021.](image1)\n```\nThis reduction in overall spending likely contributed to the slight decrease in year-end receivables from 2019 to 2021.\n*   While the overall 2019-2021 period shows a slight decrease, it's noted that reserve releases for credit losses during 2021 were \"partially offset by an increase in outstanding receivable balances\" [3, 6]. This suggests that receivables balances did show growth, particularly when compared to the lower levels in 2020 (image4 shows receivables increased from $18.7 billion in 2020 to $22.4 billion in 2021), and this growth dynamic influenced the provisioning levels. The improved portfolio quality and macroeconomic outlook also led to reserve releases on these receivables [3, 6].\n\nIn summary, net interest income decreased from 2019 to 2021 primarily due to lower average card member loan balances, while card member receivables saw a slight decrease, influenced by lower overall billed business, although there was some growth in balances from 2020 lows."}

The current income tax provision reflects taxes currently payable, while the \"deferred income tax provision or benefit generally reflects the net change in deferred income tax assets and liabilities during the year\" [1].\n\nThe breakdown of these components reveals the drivers of the trend:\n![Table showing the components of the provision for income taxes, broken down into current and deferred, for 2018, 2019, and 2020.](image5)\n\nFrom the table above (image5):\n*   The **Total current provision** was $3,520 million in 2018, slightly decreased to $3,512 million in 2019, and then substantially increased to $4,981 million in 2020.\n*   The **Deferred (benefit) provision** was an expense of $42 million in 2018 and increased to an expense of $230 million in 2019. However, in 2020, it shifted to a benefit of ($8) million.\n\nDeferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the differences between financial and income tax reporting bases of assets and liabilities [6].

The shift in the deferred tax provision from a $230 million expense in 2019 to an $8 million benefit in 2020 (as seen in image5) is a result of the net annual changes in these deferred tax assets and liabilities. This change indicates that, after considering all relevant factors (such as those mentioned in [1] like acquired businesses), the evolution of deferred tax items had a favorable impact on the 2020 income tax provision compared to 2019, helping to slightly offset the large increase in the current tax provision for that year.\n\nThe company's provision for income taxes increased from 2018 to 2020, driven mainly by a significant rise in the current tax provision in 2020, while the deferred tax provision fluctuated, turning from an expense in 2018 and 2019 to a benefit in 2020 due to changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities."}

In 2020, these net discrete tax benefits \"were primarily related to the conversion of employee share-based awards\" [1], [8]. In 2019, the higher net discrete tax benefits of $475 million were \"primarily associated with remeasurement of reserves and related interest as a result of new information pertaining to the resolution of multi-jurisdiction tax examinations, as well as benefits related to conversion of employee share-based awards\" [3], [5].\n\nConcurrently, \"Compensation and benefits expenses of $20,854 million in 2020 increased 11% from the prior year\" [9].

Secondly, the \"lower net discrete tax benefits\" [1], [8] in 2020, which also led to a higher effective tax rate, were noted to be \"primarily related to the conversion of employee share-based awards\" [1], [8].

Specifically, the Card Member loans reserve for credit losses decreased for the year ended December 31, 2021, due to improved portfolio quality and macroeconomic outlook, in large part driven by improvement in unemployment rate projections, partially offset by an increase in outstanding loan balances [7].

However, its operating profit consistently declined from $2,276 million in 2018 to $1,937 million in 2020 (Image4), indicating potential margin pressures or increased costs in the North American beverage market, compounded by $304 million in COVID-19 charges in 2020 (Image2).\n\n**International Divisions and Product Mix:**\n\n*   **LatAm (Latin America):** Net revenue grew from 2018 to 2019 but saw a significant decrease in 2020 ($6,942 million compared to $7,354 million in 2018). Operating profit followed a similar pattern, falling to $1,033 million in 2020 from $1,049 million in 2018 (Image4). The product mix in LatAm remained heavily skewed towards food/snack (90%) consistently from 2018 to 2020 (Image3). The 2020 decline in operating profit was also impacted by $102 million in COVID-19 charges (Image2).\n*   **Europe:** This division showed steady growth in both net revenue (from $10,973 million in 2018 to $11,922 million in 2020) and operating profit (from $1,256 million to $1,353 million) (Image4). The product mix shifted slightly towards beverages in 2019 (55% beverage, 45% food/snack) and remained stable in 2020, compared to a 50/50 split in 2018 (Image3). This relatively balanced and slightly beverage-leaning mix accompanied consistent growth. COVID-19 charges in 2020 were $88 million (Image2).\n*   **AMESA (Africa, Middle East and South Asia):** AMESA's net revenue was flat from 2018 to 2019, then saw a significant increase in 2020 ($4,573 million from $3,657 million in 2018). Conversely, operating profit, after a slight increase in 2019, dropped in 2020 ($600 million from $661 million in 2018) (Image4). This division saw a progressive shift towards food/snack, from 55% in 2018 to 70% in 2020 (Image3). The increased revenue in 2020, driven by a higher food/snack proportion, did not translate into higher operating profit, which was also affected by $33 million in COVID-19 charges (Image2).\n*   **APAC (Asia Pacific, Australia/New Zealand and China Region):** APAC experienced consistent net revenue growth, from $2,794 million in 2018 to $3,445 million in 2020. Operating profit, however, dipped in 2019 and, despite a recovery in 2020 ($590 million), remained below the 2018 level ($619 million) (Image4). The product mix in APAC was stable, with food/snack consistently accounting for 75% of net revenue from 2018 to 2020 (Image3). COVID-19 charges were minimal at $3 million (Image2).\n\nChanges in net revenue and operating profit across divisions from 2018 to 2020 were influenced by factors including market conditions, inherent strengths of food/snack or beverage segments in specific regions, shifts in product category mix for some international divisions, and significant COVID-19 related charges in 2020."}

However, pre-tax income for the Systems segment declined significantly by 36.0% to $449 million, and the pre-tax margin decreased by 2.7 points to 5.8% [5]. This decline in pre-tax income was primarily due to a higher level of workforce rebalancing charges, which impacted the pre-tax margin by 2.5 points [5]. In the fourth quarter of 2020, Systems pre-tax income was $455 million, a decrease of 43.2%, with the workforce rebalancing charge having a 6.0 point impact on the pre-tax margin [9].\n\nLooking at IBM's total revenue by region for the year ended December 31, 2020:\n```markdown\n![The table shows IBM's total revenue for 2020 was $73,620 million, a 4.6% decrease from 2019.

In 2019, IBM began winding down its OEM Commercial Financing business, and in 2020, entered arrangements to sell certain financing receivables [1]. While these actions were the primary driver for the decline in external revenue and pre-tax income for Global Financing, they also strengthened IBM's liquidity position and improved portfolio quality [1]. Global Financing pre-tax income decreased by 27.8% year to year, driven by lower revenue [8].\n\nIBM's total revenue for 2020 was $73,620 million, a decrease of 4.6% year to year as reported (5% adjusted for currency) [3].\n\nIn 2020, IBM's Systems segment saw an 8.2% decrease in external revenue and a 36.0% decrease in pre-tax income, while regionally, all areas experienced declines in external revenue, with the Americas showing the largest drop at 6.0%."}

Interest income itself decreased from $89 million in 2020 to $41 million in 2021, but then rose to $61 million in 2022. The increase in interest income in 2022 was primarily attributed to higher global interest rates [3]. Foreign-currency transaction gains, net, significantly increased from $7 million in 2020 to $56 million in 2021, and further to $106 million in 2022 [3].\n\nIn summary, SG&A expenses increased in absolute terms but decreased as a percentage of net sales from 2020 to 2022, while Interest Income and Other, Net, showed a consistent increasing trend over the same period."}

A significant factor contributing to this decrease was the repayment of the 2.300% Senior Notes due May 2022. On December 1, 2021, the Company repaid these notes prior to maturity [6]. This is reflected in the table where the 2.300% Senior Notes had a balance of $800 in 2021 and $— in 2022 [image5]. Additionally, \"Other long-term debt\" also decreased from $731 in 2021 to $590 in 2022 [image5]. The fair value of the company's total long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $6,033 in 2022 and $7,692 in 2021 [9].\n\nIn 2022, the total net Level 2 financial instruments increased to $561 from $408 in 2021, while long-term debt (excluding current portion) decreased to $6,484 from $6,692 over the same period primarily due to debt repayment."}

One significant contributor was higher operating income adjusted for non-cash items [1, 8]. Additionally, there were lower payments out of provisions, particularly those related to legal matters that impacted the prior year [1, 8]. Net cash flows from operating activities from continuing operations, a key component of free cash flow, rose to USD 15.1 billion in 2021 from USD 13.6 billion in 2020 [9]. This rise was mainly due to higher net income adjusted for non-cash items and other adjustments, including divestment gains, and the aforementioned lower payments out of provisions [9].\n\nThe detailed reconciliation to free cash flow further illustrates these points:\n![The table shows a reconciliation from operating income to free cash flow, detailing items like operating income, adjustments, and cash flow from operating activities leading to free cash flow figures for 2021 and 2020.](image5)\nAs seen in the table, operating income from continuing operations increased, and \"Payments out of provisions and other net cash movements in non-current liabilities\" were significantly lower (less negative) in 2021 (USD -1,119 million) compared to 2020 (USD -2,437 million).\n\nHowever, the increase in free cash flow was partly offset by a USD 650 million upfront payment to in-license tislelizumab from an affiliate of BeiGene, Ltd.

The funded status of these plans can be significantly affected by alterations in such actuarial assumptions, with the discount rate being a primary factor [10].\n\nThe following table details the components of actuarial gains and losses, highlighting the specific impact attributable to \"Changes in financial assumptions\" for fiscal years 2021 and 2020:\n![Table showing components of actuarial gains and losses, including changes in financial assumptions, for fiscal years 2021 and 2020.](image5)\nAs indicated in this table, changes in financial assumptions led to an actuarial gain of €26 million (represented as -€26 million) in fiscal year 2021. Conversely, in fiscal year 2020, changes in financial assumptions resulted in an actuarial loss of €72 million [image5]. These figures represent the direct effect of financial assumption changes and are components of the \"Total actuarial gains (-) and losses\" for each year.\n\nDiscount rates are a key financial assumption. The rates applied varied across currencies and years:\n![Table displaying discount rates used for Euro, U.S. dollar, British pound, and Swiss franc for 2021 and 2020.](image2)\nFor instance, the discount rate for obligations in Euro increased from 0.9% in 2020 to 1.0% in 2021, while the rate for U.S. dollar obligations rose from 2.4% in 2020 to 2.7% in 2021 [image2]. An increase in the discount rate typically reduces the present value of the defined benefit obligation, leading to an actuarial gain.\n\nThe sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to fluctuations in discount rates further illustrates their impact:\n![Table illustrating the effect (in millions of €) on the defined benefit obligation due to a half percentage-point change in discount rate, compensation increase, and pension progression for Sept 30, 2021 and 2020.](image3)\nAs of September 30, 2021, a 0.5 percentage-point increase in the discount rate would have decreased the defined benefit obligation by €242 million, whereas a 0.5 percentage-point decrease would have increased it by €271 million [image3]. This sensitivity analysis underscores how changes in discount rates, a core financial assumption, directly translate into significant financial impacts on pension liabilities, which are then reflected under \"Changes in financial assumptions\" within the total actuarial gains and losses.\n\nChanges in financial assumptions, which include alterations in discount rates, resulted in an actuarial gain of €26 million in 2021 and an actuarial loss of €72 million in 2020, thereby directly contributing these amounts to the total actuarial gains and losses for those respective fiscal years."}

This resulted in a noncurrent income taxes receivable and a noncurrent liability for uncertain tax benefits, both recorded at $1.9 billion as of September 26, 2021 [1].\n*   The company continues to evaluate the reinvestment of foreign earnings. As of September 26, 2021, approximately $761 million of undistributed earnings of certain subsidiaries were considered indefinitely reinvested, avoiding a deferred tax liability of about $63 million on foreign withholding taxes [7]. Any change to this strategy would impact the income tax provision [7].\n*   The company benefits from tax incentives in locations like Singapore, which are contingent on meeting specific criteria. Failure to meet these requirements could lead to refunding previously realized material tax benefits, impacting financial planning [4].\n*   Ongoing issues with Korean withholding tax are expected to increase unrecognized tax benefits, although this is not anticipated to significantly impact the income tax provision.

These increases were primarily due to higher revenues outpacing the growth in operating expenses for both entities.\n\nWhile specific net income figures for Amberjack and Mars for 2020 are not available in the provided data, several company-wide financial activities and conditions in 2020 would likely have influenced their performance:\n\n1.  **Debt and Interest Rates:** The company managed significant debt. As of December 31, 2020, the total carrying amount of debt was $2,694 million [10].\n    `![Table showing debt facilities as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, with outstanding balances, total capacity, and available capacity.

Changes in interest rates, including the upcoming discontinuation of LIBOR and transition to new benchmarks, could affect interest expenses [1], [9].\n\n2.  **Depreciation and Amortization:** Depreciation and amortization expense for the company was $50 million in 2020, a slight increase from $49 million in 2019 and $46 million in 2018 [7]. This non-cash expense impacts operating income and subsequently net income.\n    `![Breakdown of property, plant, and equipment as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, showing a net value of $699 million in 2020 and accumulated depreciation of $661 million.](image3)`\n\n3.  **Economic Conditions (COVID-19):** The company evaluated potential impairment indicators due to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. Although it was determined that no triggering event required an update to the impairment evaluation of property, plant, and equipment, the ongoing volatile market conditions were a noted risk [6]. Avoiding an impairment charge would have prevented a negative impact on net income from such an event.\n\n4.  **Capital Expenditures:** The company made no capital contributions to Permian Basin in 2020, compared to $25 million in 2019 [5]. While capital contributions are not direct expenses in the income statement, they reflect investment levels which can influence future revenue-generating capacity and associated operating costs.\n\nNet income for Amberjack and Mars increased from 2018 to 2019 due to revenue growth outpacing expense growth; while specific 2020 figures for these entities are not provided, their performance would have been influenced by company-wide debt management, interest rates, depreciation expenses, and the broader economic impact of COVID-19."}

The decrease in 2020 from $34,258 million in 2019 was largely due to the initial impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Changes in operating assets and liabilities, such as increased production spending and the broadcast of the Tokyo Olympics, also affected these figures [5].\n\n**Sky Segment:**\nThe Sky segment's Adjusted EBITDA showed a recovery in 2021 after a significant dip in 2020.\n![Sky segment's Adjusted EBITDA was $2,359M in 2021, $1,954M in 2020, and $3,129M in 2019, with a 10.2% constant currency increase from 2020 to 2021.](image4)\nAdjusted EBITDA for Sky was $2,359 million in 2021, up from $1,954 million in 2020, representing a 10.2% increase on a constant currency basis. This improvement was driven by a 3.1% increase in total revenue (constant currency) [4]. While total operating costs and expenses for Sky increased by 2.2% (constant currency) in 2021, specific expense management played a role. Excluding foreign currency, expenses decreased primarily due to lower costs for Serie A and entertainment programming, partially offset by more sporting events in 2021 which were delayed from 2020 due to COVID-19 [4]. Revenue also benefited from sales of Sky Glass televisions [6].

This 23.9% positive change was primarily due to decreased expenses in 2021 compared to 2020, as the prior year included significant costs incurred in response to COVID-19, such as severance charges [7, 3]. Revenue for this segment also increased in 2021, partly due to the recovery of Comcast Spectacor from COVID-19 impacts and sales of Sky Glass televisions [6]. The increased negative Adjusted EBITDA in 2020 compared to 2019 was influenced by these COVID-related costs and severance charges.\n\n**Other Segments (NBCUniversal and Cable Communications):**\nWhile specific Adjusted EBITDA tables for NBCUniversal and Cable Communications like those above are not provided in the images, text quotes offer insights into factors affecting their profitability:\n*   **NBCUniversal** expenses increased in 2021 due to rises in its Media, Studios, and Theme Parks segments [3]. However, 2020 included significant severance charges at NBCUniversal, with related cost savings being realized in 2021 [7].\n*   **Cable Communications** segment expenses increased due to higher programming costs, technical and product support costs, franchise fees, and advertising, marketing, and promotion expenses [3]. This segment also saw increased capital expenditures, though these do not directly impact Adjusted EBITDA [2].\n\nA segment presented in one image showed the following:\n![A segment's Adjusted EBITDA was $(65)M in 2021, $32M in 2020, and $2M in 2019.](image1)\nThis segment, with unusual negative revenue and operating costs figures in the table, saw its Adjusted EBITDA decline from $32 million in 2020 to $(65) million in 2021.

Current receivables from the Siemens Group decreased due to using invested funds for the Varian purchase price, while liabilities to the Siemens Group from financing activities increased substantially to fund the acquisition [1, 10].\n![Net debt increased from €1,484 million in 2020 to €11,901 million in 2021.](image1)\n\nAdditionally, intangible assets like goodwill increased significantly due to the Varian acquisition.\n![Goodwill increased from €9,038 million in 2020 to €17,512 million in 2021, and other intangible assets rose from €1,912 million to €8,211 million.](image5)\n\nThe acquisition also led to increased amortization, depreciation, and other effects from IFRS 3 purchase price allocation adjustments, as well as transaction, integration, retention, and carve-out costs [6].\n![Amortization, depreciation and other effects from IFRS 3 purchase price allocation adjustments increased from €0.17 per share in 2020 to €0.35 in 2021, and transaction, integration, retention and carve-out costs rose from €0.03 per share to €0.11.](image3)\n\nIn summary, the Varian acquisition positively impacted Siemens Healthineers' Adjusted EBIT through its earnings contribution and led to a significant increase in net assets, particularly goodwill and net debt, due to the acquisition and its financing."}

Higher average realised prices for commodities like iron ore, copper, nickel, oil, natural gas, and thermal coal led to a net positive impact of US$16,965 million on Underlying EBITDA. This increase in revenue was a primary driver, although partially offset by lower average realised prices for metallurgical coal and LNG [2]. The prices BHP obtains for its products are a key driver of its financial results [6].\n\n![The 'Change in sales prices' factor contributed a positive US$16,965 million to Underlying EBITDA, attributed to higher realised prices across several commodities.](image1)\n\n**Impact of Operating Cash Costs:**\nSeveral factors related to operating cash costs influenced the Underlying EBITDA:\n*   **Price-linked costs:** These increased by US$870 million, negatively impacting EBITDA. This rise was due to increased royalties (linked to the higher commodity prices) and higher third-party concentrate purchase costs, partially offset by lower royalties for petroleum and metallurgical coal.\n*   **Change in controllable cash costs:** These led to a decrease of US$34 million in Underlying EBITDA. Factors included higher inventory drawdowns at Olympic Dam and Nickel West, and increased planned maintenance, although these were partly offset by strong cost performance, cost reduction initiatives, and gains from renegotiated power contracts at Escondida and Spence.\n*   **Exchange rates:** Unfavourable movements in exchange rates, specifically the impact of the stronger Australian dollar and Chilean peso against the US dollar, increased costs by US$1,588 million, negatively affecting EBITDA [8].\n*   **Inflation:** Inflationary pressures added US$286 million to the Group's cost base, negatively impacting EBITDA.\n\n![The image details that 'Price-linked costs' negatively impacted EBITDA by US$870 million, 'Change in controllable cash costs' by US$34 million, 'Exchange rates' by US$1,588 million, and 'Inflation' by US$286 million.](image1)\n\nHigher sales prices significantly boosted BHP's Underlying EBITDA by US$16,965 million from FY2020 to FY2021, while increases in operating cash costs, notably US$870 million in price-linked costs and a US$1,588 million negative impact from exchange rates, partially offset these gains."}

This figure dropped to $1,841 million in fiscal 2020, which included licensing revenues from a settlement with Huawei and royalties under a new global patent license agreement [7]. By fiscal 2021, unallocated revenues further decreased to $54 million, mainly due to the release of a variable constraint against revenues not previously allocated to segment results [7].

This indicates a considerable rise in R&D spending not directly tied to specific segments during this period.\n\nUnallocated revenues significantly decreased from 2019 to 2021 primarily due to the conclusion of large settlements, while unallocated R&D expenses notably increased; the magnitude of the revenue decrease was several times larger than the $1,264 million in net assets acquired from NUVIA in 2021, and the R&D expense increase was a substantial fraction of these net assets."}

Specifically, higher volatility, increased client activity, and wider spreads supported improved FICC performance, particularly in Foreign Exchange (up $702m) and Credit (up $556m).

An increase in the discount rate reduces the present value of plan obligations [10]. This reduction in obligations typically results in actuarial gains. Indeed, in 2022, there was a substantial actuarial gain for pension plans, primarily related to these increases in discount rates [4]. This gain directly improves the funded status, which is the net amount recognized on the balance sheet.\n\nThe expected return on plan assets for Pension Benefits, used to determine net periodic benefit cost, saw a decrease.\n```markdown\n![Table showing expected return on plan assets for pension benefits decreased in 2022, while it remained unchanged for other retiree benefits; discount rates for cost also changed.](image4)\n```\nThe expected return on plan assets for Pension Benefits decreased from 6.5% in 2021 to 5.5% in 2022 [image4, 1]. A lower expected rate of return on plan assets generally increases the net periodic benefit cost, as less investment income is anticipated to offset other components of pension expense [1]. A 100 basis point change in this rate would impact annual after-tax benefit/expense by approximately $125 million [1].\n\nThe combined effect of these changes, particularly the large actuarial gains from increased discount rates, contributed to an improvement in the net amount recognized for Pension Benefits.\n```markdown\n![Table showing the net amount recognized (funded status) for pension benefits improved (liability decreased) and for other retiree benefits improved (asset increased) from 2021 to 2022.](image5)\n```\nThe net amount recognized (a net liability) for Pension Benefits decreased from $(5,428) million in 2021 to $(2,435) million in 2022, indicating an improved funded status [image5]. This improvement was significantly driven by a net actuarial gain of $(4,067) million in 2022, largely due to the higher discount rates [image3, 4].\n\n**Other Retiree Benefits (OPRB):**\n\nFor Other Retiree Benefits, the discount rate also increased. The discount rate for OPRB rose from 3.2% in 2021 to 5.0% in 2022 [image1]. Similar to pension benefits, this increase in the discount rate would reduce OPRB obligations and lead to actuarial gains [10]. Actuarial gains for OPRB in 2022 were also primarily related to increases in discount rates [4].\n\nThe expected return on plan assets for Other Retiree Benefits remained unchanged. The rate was 8.4% in both 2021 and 2022 [image4, 1]. Therefore, there was no impact on the net periodic benefit cost stemming from a change in this assumption.\n\nThe increase in the discount rate positively impacted the net amount recognized for Other Retiree Benefits. The net amount recognized (a net asset) for OPRB increased from $2,238 million in 2021 to $3,819 million in 2022, signifying an improved financial position for these benefits [image5]. This was supported by a net actuarial gain of $(586) million in 2022, largely due to the higher discount rates applied to the obligations [image3, 4].\n\nIn summary, the increase in discount rates for both Pension Benefits and Other Retiree Benefits from 2021 to 2022 primarily led to reduced benefit obligations and actuarial gains, thereby improving the net amount recognized (funded status), while the decrease in the expected return on plan assets for Pension Benefits would tend to increase pension expense."}

Peacock, NBCUniversal's streaming service, significantly contributed to this, with its revenue growing from $118 million in 2020 to $778 million in 2021, though operating costs also increased substantially due to investments in content and customer acquisition [1]. Looking ahead, the company expects continued declines in subscribers and audience ratings for its traditional networks due to a competitive environment and evolving video consumption habits [9].\n\nThe **Studios segment** saw its revenue increase by 16.2% to $9.4 billion in 2021. This growth was fueled by increases in content licensing revenue, theatrical revenue, and home entertainment, as film and television production operations returned to full capacity following earlier pandemic-related disruptions [1].\n\nThe **Theme Parks segment** experienced a remarkable recovery, with revenue surging by 141.2% to $5.1 billion in 2021. Adjusted EBITDA improved dramatically from a loss of $0.5 billion in the prior year to a positive $1.3 billion. This turnaround reflected the operation of theme parks throughout the period, compared to temporary closures and capacity restrictions due to COVID-19 in the previous year, as well as the opening of the new theme park in Beijing in September 2021 [1].\n\n**Sky's Performance:**\n\nSky's total revenue increased by 9.1% to $20.3 billion in 2021. When excluding the impact of foreign currency, Sky's revenue rose by 3.1%, primarily due to growth in advertising and direct-to-consumer revenue. This was partially offset by a decrease in content revenue, with both periods affected by COVID-19 and the current year also impacted by reduced broadcast rights for Serie A football [10].\n\nRegarding Sky's customer base:\n![Total Sky customer relationships stood at 23,027,000 in 2021, reflecting a net decrease of 198,000 from 2020, which itself saw a smaller decrease from 2019 when there were net additions.](image1)\nWhile the image shows a net loss in total customer relationships for 2021, these relationships remained relatively consistent overall compared to the prior year. Decreases in Italy, mainly due to the reduced broadcast rights for Serie A (which Sky held through the 2020-21 season and now has nonexclusive rights to fewer matches), were offset by increases in the United Kingdom and Germany. This change in Serie A rights is expected to continue to result in revenue and customer declines in Italy [8].\n\nDespite the slight dip in total customers, Sky's average monthly direct-to-consumer revenue per customer relationship showed positive growth:\n![Sky's average monthly direct-to-consumer revenue per customer relationship rose to $59.29 in 2021, up from $54.56 in 2020 and $56.09 in 2019.](image2)\nThis increase in 2021 was primarily driven by the impact of sporting events postponed from the prior year due to COVID-19, an increase in the sale of wireless handsets, and rate increases in the United Kingdom, partially offset by declines in average rates in Italy [8].\n\nIn summary, NBCUniversal's financial performance from 2019 to 2021 was positively shaped by strong revenue growth across its Studios and Theme Parks segments recovering from pandemic impacts and growth in the Media segment excluding unique events, while Sky, a related major media business, demonstrated resilience through increased revenue per customer which helped mitigate the impact of a slight decline in its total customer base due to specific European market conditions."}

This was largely driven by a $9.1 billion decrease in interest from \"Loans and leases\" (with \"Total consumer\" loans contributing a $3.3 billion decrease and \"Total commercial\" loans contributing a $5.8 billion decrease) and a $3.9 billion decrease from \"Federal funds sold and securities borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell.\"\n    *   **Interest Expense**: Decreased by $14.1 billion. Significant decreases came from \"Federal funds purchased, securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase, short-term borrowings and other interest-bearing liabilities\" (-$6.2 billion), \"Demand and money market deposit accounts\" (-$3.5 billion), and \"Long-term debt\" (-$2.4 billion).\n    *   **Net Result**: The larger decrease in interest income compared to the decrease in interest expense led to a net decrease in net interest income of $5.6 billion.\n\n*   **Change from 2018 to 2019**:\n    *   **Interest Income**: Increased by $4.5 billion. This was primarily driven by a $2.3 billion increase in interest from \"Loans and leases\" and a $1.7 billion increase from \"Federal funds sold and securities borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell.\"\n    *   **Interest Expense**: Increased by $3.7 billion.

This shift was primarily driven by lower interest rates in 2020 [1].\n\n**Reflection in Organizational Structure**\n\nBank of America operates through four main business segments: Consumer Banking, Global Wealth & Investment Management (GWIM), Global Banking, and Global Markets, with remaining operations in All Other [10].\n`![Diagram showing Bank of America's organizational structure with its main business segments and their respective activities.](image2)`\nThe changes in net interest income and expense reflect the performance and interest rate sensitivity of products and services across these segments:\n\n1.  **Consumer Banking**: This segment, which includes deposits and consumer lending (e.g., mortgages, credit cards) [image2], was significantly impacted. Net income for Consumer Banking decreased in 2020, with its net interest income falling by $3.5 billion due to lower rates, partially offset by higher deposit and loan balances [8]. The decrease in interest income from \"Total consumer\" loans (-$3.3 billion from 2019-2020) shown in the detailed breakdown [image4] directly corroborates this segment's NII pressure. Similarly, changes in interest expense on deposits, a core part of Consumer Banking, contributed to the overall NII movement.\n\n2.  **Global Banking**: This segment provides a range of lending services (commercial loans, real estate lending, etc.) [image2]. The decrease in interest income from \"Total commercial\" loans (-$5.8 billion from 2019-2020) [image4] indicates the impact of lower rates on this segment's lending activities.\n\n3.  **Treasury and \"All Other\" Activities**: Activities like managing Federal funds, securities, and long-term debt, which fall under treasury functions often reported within \"All Other\" or managed centrally, also saw significant shifts. The substantial decreases in income from \"Federal funds sold and securities...\" and expense on \"Federal funds purchased...\" and \"Long-term debt\" [image4] reflect changes in the bank's balance sheet management and funding costs in response to the rate environment.\n\nThe detailed components of interest income (e.g., consumer loans, commercial loans) and interest expense (e.g., deposits, long-term debt) [image4] directly correspond to the primary activities within Bank of America's organizational structure [image2], [10]. The overall decline in net interest income in 2020 was a reflection of how the prevailing lower interest rate environment affected the profitability of interest-earning assets and the cost of interest-bearing liabilities across these different business lines.\n\nThe major differences in net interest income and expense changes between the two periods (a net decrease in NII for 2019-2020 vs. a net increase for 2018-2019) were driven by shifts in interest rates, impacting loan and deposit-related NII across the bank's consumer and commercial banking segments, as well as its treasury and funding operations."}

The decline in interest and other investment income, despite an increase in cash holdings, reflects the impact of the low interest rate environment, which suppressed returns on these safe assets [6, 10]. The company \"continue[s] to hold substantial balances of cash, cash equivalents and short-term U.S. Treasury Bills,\" emphasizing a belief that \"maintaining ample liquidity is paramount\" and an insistence \"on safety over yield with respect to short-term investments\" [6]. The significant increase in equity securities could lead to higher overall returns but also introduces greater volatility to periodic net earnings, as \"Unrealized gains and losses arising from changes in market prices of our investments in equity securities are included in our reported earnings, which significantly increases the volatility of our periodic net earnings due to the magnitude of our equity securities portfolio and the inherent volatility of equity securities prices\" [9].\n\nOverall, net investment income declined due to lower interest rates impacting returns on cash and fixed maturity securities, while the asset mix shifted towards more cash and equities, potentially increasing earnings volatility but also reflecting a strategy of maintaining liquidity and seeking returns in a low-yield environment."}

The effects of non-U.S. denominated debt on net earnings saw a notable shift between 2020 and 2021 due to currency exchange rate fluctuations.\n\nRegarding the impact of interest rates on equity index put option contract liabilities, it's stated that \"Interest rate risks associated with the valuations of our equity index put option contract liabilities are no longer considered significant due to the short duration of remaining exposures as of December 31, 2021\" [3].\n\nThe following table provides a quantitative illustration of how hypothetical changes in interest rates could affect the fair value of these liabilities:\n![Table showing the estimated fair value changes of assets and liabilities, including equity index put option contracts, due to hypothetical changes in interest rates as of December 31, 2021 and 2020.](image2)\nAs detailed in the table, the fair value of equity index put option contracts as of December 31, 2021, was $\\S99$ million. A hypothetical 100 basis point (bp) decrease in interest rates would increase the fair value of this liability to $\\S105$ million, while a 100 bp increase in interest rates would decrease its fair value to $\\S94$ million. This demonstrates an inverse relationship: as interest rates rise, the fair value of these liabilities tends to fall, and vice versa. For comparison, as of December 31, 2020, the fair value was $\\S1,065$ million, and it exhibited similar sensitivity to interest rate changes (e.g., a 100 bp increase would decrease the fair value to $\\S1,008$ million).\n\nConcerning the differences in non-U.S. denominated debt effects on net earnings between 2020 and 2021, changes in foreign currency exchange rates play a key role. \"The effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates during the period are recorded in earnings as a component of selling, general and administrative expenses. Changes in the exchange rates resulted in pre-tax gains of $\\S1.3$ billion in 2021, pre-tax losses of $\\S1.0$ billion in 2020\" [8].\n\nThe impact of non-U.S. denominated debt included in net earnings is summarized in the following table:\n![Table showing the impact of non-U.S. denominated debt, net liabilities under certain reinsurance contracts, and foreign currency translation on net earnings and other comprehensive income for 2021 and 2020.](image5)\nThis table shows that in 2021, non-U.S. denominated debt contributed $\\S955$ million to net earnings.

For instance, shipment volumes in Canada fell by 18.6% due to the deconsolidation of Rothmans, Benson & Hedges Inc. (RBH) [2]. Declines were also seen in Argentina (down 12.2% due to lower market share and out-of-stocks), Colombia (down 14.2% due to a lower total market), and Mexico (down 18.0% due to a lower total market and market share) [2]. Conversely, Brazil experienced a 13.4% increase in shipment volumes, mainly due to a lower estimated prevalence of illicit trade [9]. The deconsolidation of RBH was a notable event, with PMI's total shipment volume (across all regions, not just LA&C) decreasing by 10.3% excluding its impact [10].\n\nKey financial activities also influenced the regional performance. The deconsolidation of RBH in 2019 not only affected shipment volumes but also had financial statement impacts, such as reducing cash used in investing activities in 2019 [1] and contributing to a \"loss on deconsolidation of RBH\" recognized in 2019 [7]. Additionally, in 2019, PMI recorded asset impairment and exit costs related to plant closures in Argentina and Colombia as part of global manufacturing infrastructure optimization [3].\n\nThese volume changes and financial activities directly impacted the financial results for the segment, as reflected in a financial summary:\n```markdown\n![Financial summary for a PMI segment shows a 22.9% decrease in Net Revenues but a 100% increase in Operating Income from 2019 to 2020.](image4)\n```\nNet Revenues for the segment decreased by 22.9% (or 15.5% excluding currency effects), from $2,206 million in 2019 to $1,701 million in 2020 [image4]. The decline in shipment volumes was a significant contributor to this, with the \"Vol/Mix\" variance unfavorably impacting Net Revenues by $(285) million [image4].\n\nDespite the drop in revenues and an unfavorable Vol/Mix impact of $(219) million on Operating Income, the segment's Operating Income increased by 100% (from $235 million in 2019 to $564 million in 2020) [image4]. This substantial increase was largely driven by a favorable \"Cost/Other\" variance of $523 million [image4]. This favorable variance likely reflects the non-recurrence of significant 2019 charges, such as the \"loss on deconsolidation of RBH\" [7] and the asset impairment and exit costs from plant closures in 2019 [3], which would have depressed 2019's operating income.\n\nThe changes in PMI shipment volumes in Latin America & Canada led to lower net revenues, while financial activities such as the non-recurrence of 2019's RBH deconsolidation loss and plant closure costs significantly boosted operating income in 2020 compared to 2019."}

The decrease in noninterest expense was partly due to \"lower operating losses due to lower expense for customer remediation accruals and litigation accruals\" and \"lower personnel expense\" [2].

It is noteworthy, however, that Wells Fargo continues to administer certain Institutional Retirement and Trust (IRT) client assets ($19 billion AUM and $582 billion AUA at December 31, 2021) under a transition services agreement with the buyer, an arrangement set to terminate in June 2022 [4].\n\n**Broader Effects on Company Income**\nThe sale of WFAM significantly influenced Wells Fargo's income statement. Firstly, the company recognized a substantial gain from this transaction. Wells Fargo recorded a net gain of $269 million from the sale of WFAM [2, 10]. This gain was a component of the increase in \"Other income\" [10] and contributed to a notable rise in overall noninterest income for 2021.\n`![Consolidated income statement highlighting noninterest income of $10,036 million in 2021, a 104% increase compared to $4,916 million in 2020.](image1)`\nThe income statement demonstrates a significant year-over-year increase in noninterest income, which was partially driven by gains on sales of businesses like WFAM [3]. Conversely, the divestiture means a cessation of ongoing revenue streams previously generated by WFAM. Prior to the sale, Wells Fargo earned investment advisory and other asset-based fees from managing and administering assets through WFAM [6]. Consequently, there was a reduction in asset-based fees following the November 1, 2021, sale [3]. The sale also contributed to lower expenses related to divested businesses [7].\n\n**Broader Effects on Company Balance Sheet**\nThe sale of WFAM also affected Wells Fargo's balance sheet. The divestiture of a business segment involves receiving cash proceeds (an inflow) while derecognizing the net assets (including goodwill, if any) associated with the sold entity.\n`![Selected consolidated balance sheet data showing total assets (period-end) of $721,335 million in 2021, compared to $728,667 million in 2020, a slight decrease.](image3)`\nThe company's total assets at period-end showed a modest decrease, from $728,667 million in 2020 to $721,335 million in 2021. This change reflected \"the timing of cash deployment by our investment portfolio near the end of 2021, partially offset by an increase in equity securities related to our affiliated venture capital business\" [1]. The cash received from the WFAM sale would have augmented the company's cash position before any subsequent deployment or other balance sheet movements.\n\nThe sale of WFAM on November 1, 2021, eliminated its $587.1 billion in assets under management, generated a $269 million gain for Wells Fargo while reducing future asset-based fees, and contributed to a modest decrease in the company's total assets at year-end."}

This decrease was primarily driven by lower interest rates, which impacted the income generated from assets more significantly than they reduced the expense on liabilities.\n`![Image 5 shows the net interest spread decreased from 2.03% in 2019 to 1.75% in 2020.](image5)`\nThis table also details that the average yield on earning assets fell from 3.52% in 2019 to 2.25% in 2020, a drop of 1.27 percentage points. Concurrently, the average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities decreased from 1.49% in 2019 to 0.50% in 2020, a fall of 0.99 percentage points. Since the yield on assets decreased more than the rate on liabilities, the net interest spread narrowed.\n\nThe detailed changes in interest income and expense components further illustrate this:\n`![Image 2 shows that from 2019 to 2020, total interest income decreased by $19.7 billion, while total interest expense decreased by $14.1 billion.](image2)`\nAs shown in this image, the decrease in interest income was largely due to lower rates on loans and leases (contributing $9.1 billion to the decrease) and federal funds sold and securities purchased under agreements to resell (contributing $4.5 billion to the decrease). The reduction in interest expense was primarily driven by lower rates on demand and money market deposit accounts (contributing $4.0 billion to the decrease) and federal funds purchased and short-term borrowings (contributing $6.7 billion to the decrease).\n\nThe main contributing factors to these changes and the resulting impact on the net interest spread were:\n1.  **Lower Interest Rates**: The predominant factor was the decline in the overall interest rate environment [6]. This directly led to lower yields on earning assets such as loans and securities.\n2.  **Reduced Funding Costs**: While interest expenses on deposits and borrowings also decreased due to lower rates, this reduction was not enough to offset the larger decline in interest income [6]. The data in Image 2 confirms that interest income fell by $19.7 billion while interest expense fell by $14.1 billion.\n3.  **Asset and Liability Sensitivity**: The yields on interest-earning assets declined more sharply than the rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities, as evidenced by the 1.27 percentage point drop in asset yields versus a 0.99 percentage point drop in liability rates (derived from Image 5). This differential compression directly caused the net interest spread to narrow.\n\nThe changes in net interest income (a larger decrease) and net interest expense (a smaller decrease) from 2019 to 2020 resulted in a compressed net interest spread, primarily due to the lower interest rate environment which reduced yields on assets more than it reduced costs of liabilities."}

Noninterest income also experienced a decline, falling by $1.9 billion to $8.6 billion in 2020. This decrease was driven by lower service charges (resulting from higher deposit balances), reduced card income due to decreased client activity, and lower other income from the allocation of asset and liability management (ALM) results [8]. Consequently, total revenue for Consumer Banking fell from $38.7 billion in 2019 (which was $28.2 billion in net interest income and $10.5 billion in noninterest income) to $33.3 billion in 2020.\nThe net income for Consumer Banking decreased substantially by $6.5 billion, from $13.0 billion in 2019 to $6.5 billion in 2020. This sharp decline was primarily attributed to the lower revenue, combined with higher provision for credit losses and increased expenses [8].\n\n**Global Wealth & Investment Management (GWIM)**\n\nThe Global Wealth & Investment Management (GWIM) segment, which is composed of two main businesses: Merrill Lynch Global Wealth Management (MLGWM) and Bank of America Private Bank [2], also reported a downturn in its financial results for 2020.\nGWIM's total revenue, net of interest expense, decreased from $19,538 million in 2019 to $18,584 million in 2020.\n![The table shows GWIM's Net Interest Income decreased to $5,468 million in 2020 from $6,504 million in 2019, Noninterest Income slightly increased to $13,116 million in 2020 from $13,034 million in 2019, and Total Revenue (net of interest expense) decreased to $18,584 million in 2020 from $19,538 million in 2019.](image3)\nThis overall revenue decline was influenced by a decrease in net interest income, which fell to $5,468 million in 2020 from $6,504 million in 2019 (as seen in image3). Conversely, noninterest income, primarily comprising investment and brokerage services income, increased by $82 million to $13.1 billion in 2020. This rise was mainly due to higher market valuations and positive AUM flows, though these gains were largely offset by declines in AUM pricing and lower other income [3].\nBreaking down the revenue by GWIM's businesses, Bank of America Private Bank's revenue was $3,292 million in 2020 ($3.3 billion), a four percent decrease from $3,426 million in 2019, primarily driven by the impact of lower interest rates [5]. Merrill Lynch Global Wealth Management's revenue also declined from $16,112 million in 2019 to $15,292 million in 2020.\n![The table shows that Merrill Lynch Global Wealth Management revenue decreased from $16,112 million in 2019 to $15,292 million in 2020, and Bank of America Private Bank revenue fell from $3,426 million in 2019 to $3,292 million in 2020.](image2)\nAs a result of these revenue changes and other factors, GWIM's net income saw a significant reduction. Net income for the segment fell by 28%, from $4,251 million in 2019 to $3,075 million in 2020.\n![The table shows GWIM's Net Income for 2020 was $3,075 million, a decrease from $4,251 million in 2019.](image3)\n\nIn 2020, both the Consumer Banking and Global Wealth & Investment Management segments of Bank of America saw decreases in their revenue and net income compared to 2019."}

The increase in net earnings in 2020 compared to previous years was driven by several factors, including \"net earnings from increased sales in the Company's existing businesses, net earnings from Cytiva, [and] the 2020 gain on sale of product lines\" [6]. Consolidated sales for 2020 increased by 24.5% compared to 2019, with acquisitions, primarily Cytiva, contributing 18.0% to this increase [4]. Additionally, a gain on the sale of certain product lines in 2020 contributed $455 million pretax ($305 million after-tax) to earnings [3].\n\nThe \"Total other comprehensive income (loss), net of income taxes\" also saw a significant positive shift, moving from a loss of $646 million in 2018 to a gain of $2,700 million in 2020 (see image1). A primary driver for the improvement in comprehensive income, particularly in 2020, was a significant gain from foreign currency translation adjustments. Comprehensive income \"increased by approximately $\\S3.6$ billion in 2020 as compared to 2019, primarily due to a gain on foreign currency translation adjustments in 2020 compared to a loss in 2019\" [1].

The company's sensitivity analysis indicates the magnitude of such impacts; for example, as of September 30, 2021, a 0.5 percentage-point increase in the discount rate would decrease the DBO by €242 million [1].\n`![A 0.5 percentage-point increase in the discount rate as of Sept 30, 2021, would decrease the DBO by €242 million, while a decrease would increase it by €271 million.](image1)`\n\nThe net effect of all changes in actuarial assumptions on the DBO is quantified as actuarial gains or losses. In fiscal year 2021, changes in financial assumptions (which include discount rate effects) led to a €26 million decrease (gain) in the DBO. Concurrently, changes in demographic assumptions resulted in an €8 million decrease (gain) in the DBO.\n`![In fiscal year 2021, changes in demographic assumptions led to an €8 million gain and changes in financial assumptions led to a €26 million gain, resulting in total actuarial gains of €22 million that reduced the DBO, compared to total actuarial losses of €67 million in 2020.](image3)`\nThese combined changes resulted in total actuarial gains of €22 million in 2021, which reduced the DBO. This contrasts with 2020, which saw total actuarial losses of €67 million from assumption changes.\n\nChanges in specific assumptions like mortality rates also contribute. A hypothetical 10% reduction in mortality rates for all beneficiaries would increase the DBO by €110 million as of September 30, 2021 (a similar impact of €109 million as of September 30, 2020) [7].\n\nRegarding plan assets, actuarial assumptions do not directly alter their market value. However, by changing the DBO, these assumptions significantly impact the *funded status* of the pension plans, which is the difference between plan assets and the DBO [4, 8]. The actuarial gains experienced in 2021, which lowered the DBO, would have positively influenced the funded status, assuming other factors like asset returns remained constant. Siemens Healthineers explicitly states that the \"funded status can be affected by changes in actuarial assumptions\" and manages risks by considering both plan assets and the DBO [8].\n\nFrom 2020 to 2021, changes in actuarial assumptions, including an increased discount rate, resulted in net actuarial gains that reduced the defined benefit obligation, thereby improving the pension plans' funded status."}

The company's strategy involves assessing new regions by leveraging local industry contacts and securing a portfolio of stores to establish an operating footprint upon entry [3]. Lovisa aims to remain \"nimble and opportunistic in expanding and moving into new markets,\" accelerating or deferring entry based on available opportunities [3]. A key aspect of their rapid expansion capability is a refined global store model with a target 50 square metre floor space and a homogenised layout, which allows stores to be fitted out quickly and at low cost, typically within 14 days [9].\n\n![A typical Lovisa store interior, illustrating the standardized layout that supports rapid international roll-outs.](image2)\n\nThe evolution of this expansion is evident in the significant increase in store numbers across various international markets between 2016 and 2020.\n![A table illustrating Lovisa's international store count growth by country from 2016 to 2020.](image5)\nThis table shows a growth from 250 total stores in 2016 to 435 in 2020, with notable expansion in markets like the USA (from 0 in 2017 to 48 in 2020), the United Kingdom (from 3 in 2016 to 42 in 2020), and France (from 0 in 2017 to 21 in 2020) [image5]. This aligns with their strategy to \"Roll out USA, France and UK territory and investigate other Northern Hemisphere markets\" and \"Expand into new international markets, targeting one new trial territory per annum\" [image4].\n\nKey achievements during this period include successfully establishing and operating a profitable portfolio of company-owned stores in numerous countries, including Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, Malaysia, South Africa, the United Kingdom, France, and the United States, alongside supporting franchised stores in several Middle Eastern countries and Vietnam [4]. For instance, specific achievements highlighted include the net opening of 47 stores outside of Australia in a single year, with significant openings in the UK, France, and the USA [image4]. The global roll-out of piercing services was also completed during FY20 to enhance customer loyalty [1].\n\n![Lovisa's growth pillar table detailing strategies, risks, and achievements for international expansion.](image4)\n\nHowever, this expansion has faced challenges.

Lovisa also continuously monitors external factors, such as the impact of COVID-19 on the global retail leasing market, to identify and capitalize on opportunities [3].\n\nLovisa's international store expansion strategy evolved by consistently applying a successful market entry and store model approach to new and existing territories, resulting in significant growth in store numbers and market presence, particularly in the USA and Europe, despite facing competition and dynamic retail conditions."}

This increase was seen across all components:\n*   Finished goods increased from $833 million to $1,232 million.\n*   Work in process increased from $285 million to $369 million.\n*   Raw materials increased from $510 million to $691 million [image1].\n\nThis increase in inventory impacted the company's financial statements. On the balance sheet, it's reflected as a higher asset value. The change in inventory levels also affected operating cash flows; specifically, \"the aggregate of trade accounts receivable, inventories and trade accounts payable used $160 million in operating cash flows during 2020\" [1]. Furthermore, the cost of sales in 2020 was impacted by acquisition-related charges, including \"fair value adjustments to inventory in connection with the Cytiva Acquisition, which increased cost of sales by $457 million in 2020\" [9]. The company uses LIFO for some inventories, but the difference between LIFO and FIFO was not significant, and LIFO liquidations did not have a material impact [7].\n\n**Lease Assets:**\nThe company's operating lease Right-of-Use (ROU) assets also increased between 2019 and 2020.\n![The table details lease assets and liabilities, showing operating lease ROU assets of $942 million in 2020 and $764 million in 2019, along with associated lease liabilities and maturity details.](image4)\nOperating lease ROU assets, classified as \"Other long-term assets,\" grew from $764 million in 2019 to $942 million in 2020 [image4]. These ROU assets represent the company's right to use assets leased for its operations.\n\nThis change is reflected on the balance sheet by an increase in long-term assets and a corresponding increase in operating lease liabilities, which rose from $797 million in 2019 to $974 million in 2020 [image4]. The increase in lease assets also implies an increase in associated lease expenses on the income statement, typically comprising depreciation of the ROU asset and interest expense on the lease liability. Depreciation expense for the company relates to \"both the Company's manufacturing and operating facilities as well as instrumentation leased to customers under operating-type lease arrangements\" [1], indicating the types of assets under lease. The weighted average remaining lease term remained consistent at 7 years for both 2020 and 2019, while the weighted average discount rate decreased slightly from 3.1% to 2.8% [image4].\n\nIn summary, the company's inventories and operating lease ROU assets both increased in value from 2019 to 2020, with changes in inventory composition across all stages and these increases reflected as higher assets on the balance sheet and impacting cash flows and expenses."}

Specifically, total deferred tax liabilities decreased from $363 million in 2019 to $213 million in 2020, a reduction of $150 million. Total deferred tax assets, after valuation allowance, decreased from $482 million in 2019 to $466 million in 2020, a reduction of $16 million.\n```markdown\n![The table details deferred tax assets and liabilities, showing total deferred tax assets after valuation allowance at $466 million for 2020 and $482 million for 2019, and total deferred tax liabilities at $213 million for 2020 and $363 million for 2019, resulting in a net deferred tax asset of $253 million for 2020 and $119 million for 2019.](image2)\n```\nA key event impacting these changes was the favorable resolution of uncertain tax positions. In 2020, the company recognized a significant tax benefit from such changes. Specifically, \"Reductions for tax positions of prior years in 2020 include a $249 million tax benefit for the effective settlement of a depreciation-related uncertain tax position\" [3]. This settlement directly reduced the company's liabilities for uncertain tax positions. The balance of liabilities for uncertain tax positions decreased from $303 million at the beginning of 2020 to $89 million by the end of the year, with \"Reductions for tax positions of prior years\" amounting to $249 million [3].\n```markdown\n![The table shows a reconciliation of unrecognized tax benefits, with a beginning balance of $303 million in 2020, reductions for tax positions of prior years of ($249) million, and an ending balance of $89 million.](image4)\n```\nThis settlement of uncertain tax positions, particularly the depreciation-related one, likely contributed to the $150 million decrease in total deferred tax liabilities. For example, the deferred tax liability related to \"Property, plant and equipment\" decreased by $48 million between 2019 and 2020 (from $164 million to $116 million, as seen in image2).\n\nAdditionally, valuation allowances against deferred tax assets decreased by $1 million in 2020 [8]. This decrease in valuation allowance (from $180 million in 2019 to $179 million in 2020, as seen in image2) also had a small positive impact on the net deferred tax asset.\n\nChanges in tax positions, particularly the significant settlement of a depreciation-related uncertain tax position, along with a minor decrease in valuation allowances, led to a substantial decrease in deferred tax liabilities which primarily drove the increase in the net deferred tax asset from $119 million in 2019 to $253 million in 2020."}

This negative value could be due to the forfeiture or revaluation of options or performance rights, details of which are generally outlined in relation to KMP remuneration [1], [9]. Other components like Salary & Fees saw a slight increase ($1,282,749 in FY19 to $1,341,286 in FY20), but this was more than offset by the change in share-based payments and a decrease in Long Term Benefits.\n\n**Implications on Financial Position:**\nS Fallscheer's financial position was impacted in two main ways:\n1.  **Increased Equity Stake:** By purchasing over 1.68 million additional shares, S Fallscheer substantially increased their ownership in the company. This signifies a larger direct financial stake and alignment with shareholder interests, though it also increases exposure to the company's stock performance, which saw a price decline in FY20. The purchase itself would have reduced cash reserves unless financed.\n2.  **Reduced Annual Remuneration:** The reported remuneration for FY20 was significantly lower than in FY19, mainly due to the accounting treatment of share-based payments. This means a lower recognized income from employment for the year.\n\nIn summary, S Fallscheer increased their shareholding in the company while their recognized total remuneration for the year decreased significantly, primarily due to changes in share-based payment values."}

G&A expenses include R&D costs, salaries for administrative personnel, professional service fees, and amortization [3, 9].\n\nA key driver for the increase in G&A expenses was the escalating investment in Research & Development (R&D). R&D expenses were RMB 1,159 million in 2019, RMB 1,667 million in 2020, and RMB 2,339 million (US$367 million) in 2021 [1].

While the company states its intention to manage both general and administrative expenses and selling and marketing expenses [3, 5], the overall cost of revenues and operating expenses as a percentage of total revenues have increased from 2019 to 2021. This has led to a reduction in operating profit margin from 18.2% in 2019 to 12.2% in 2021 (derived from `image4`). This indicates that while strategic investments are being made, cost growth outpaced revenue growth during this period, impacting profitability.\n\nThe company's cost structure and operating expenses increased both in absolute terms and as a percentage of revenue from 2019 to 2021, primarily driven by higher service costs, agency fees, and significant strategic investments in research and development, indicating a focus on long-term growth and innovation despite short-term pressure on profit margins."}

A major factor influencing the cash flow was the decrease in net cash used for investing activities, which fell from $26,936 million in 2019 to $3,028 million in 2020. This substantial drop was largely due to the Red Hat acquisition in the prior year not being repeated [8]. Financing activities shifted from a net source of cash of $9,042 million in 2019 to a net use of cash of $9,721 million in 2020 [10]. This change was driven by factors including debt repayments and dividend distributions. Consequently, IBM saw a net increase in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash of $5,361 million in 2020, a strong improvement from the net decrease of $3,290 million in 2019.\n\nRegarding equity, total equity decreased by $258 million from December 31, 2019. This was primarily due to dividends paid ($5,797 million) and a decline in accumulated other comprehensive income ($740 million, mainly from foreign currency translation adjustments), partially offset by net income ($5,590 million) and increases in common stock ($661 million) [7].\n\nThe financial changes between 2019 and 2020 indicate an improved financial standing for IBM, characterized by increased assets, reduced overall debt, and significantly stronger cash flows, despite a slight decrease in total equity."}

The key drivers for this decrease were lower price impacts (net of price-linked costs) amounting to US$0.7 billion, and lower volumes which decreased Underlying EBITDA by US$168 million [2]. Additionally, controllable cash costs increased by US$102 million, driven by increased maintenance costs at Queensland Coal and increased stripping volumes, although this was partially offset by cost reduction initiatives [2].\n\n**Impact on Nickel:**\nIn contrast, Nickel West experienced a positive impact from commodity price changes and other factors. Its Underlying EBITDA increased by US$296 million to US$259 million in FY2021 [1]. This improvement was primarily due to higher nickel prices and volumes, along with lower maintenance costs following major shutdowns in the prior year and lower contractor costs due to the ramp-up of new mines [1]. The average realised sales price for nickel in FY2021 was US$16,250 per tonne, up from US$13,860 per tonne in FY2020 [10]. This price strength was supported by positive investor sentiment, a strong rebound in end-use demand, multi-region supply disruptions, and falling London Metal Exchange stocks [10]. However, the positive impacts on Nickel West's EBITDA were partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate movements and the adverse impacts of the stronger nickel price on third-party concentrate purchase costs [1]. The impact of foreign currency exchange rates on market prices is a general factor affecting the minerals BHP produces [8].\n\nChanges in commodity prices significantly affect BHP's financial results: for coal, lower prices and volumes led to a substantial decrease in Underlying EBITDA, while for nickel, higher prices and volumes drove an increase in Underlying EBITDA, though moderated by exchange rates and related purchase costs."}

In 2022, available-for-sale securities consisted of Government and agency securities [5].\n\nThe following table generally illustrates how cost basis is adjusted by unrealized gains or losses to arrive at the recorded basis:\n![Image2 details how cost basis is adjusted by unrealized losses or gains to arrive at the recorded basis for securities.](image2)\nFor the available-for-sale securities in 2022, a net unrealized loss was incurred. The relevant calculation from image2 is found in the 'Unrealized Losses, Net' section for 2022. This section shows that for securities with a cost basis of $534 million (which is the cost basis of available-for-sale securities in 2022), net unrealized losses of $5 million resulted in a recorded basis of $529 million.\n\nThis recorded basis represents the fair value of these available-for-sale securities. The details from another table confirm these figures:\n![The table shows that for 2022, available-for-sale securities had a total cost basis of $534 million and a total fair value of $529 million.](image3)\nAs seen here, the total cost basis for available-for-sale securities in 2022 was $534 million, and their total fair value was $529 million. The difference of $5 million ($534 million - $529 million) represents the net unrealized loss. This loss reduces the cost basis to arrive at the fair value, which is the recorded basis for these securities.\n\nTherefore, in 2022, the net unrealized losses on available-for-sale securities decreased their cost basis to arrive at their recorded basis, which is their fair value."}

A primary driver for this was lower cigarette shipment volume, predominantly in Japan [8]. Additionally, in Korea, PMI experienced a market share decline, mainly due to the growth of the \"cigarette new taste dimension segment,\" where PMI has a relatively low presence [10].\n\nConversely, heated tobacco unit shipment volume in East Asia & Australia grew by 10.4%, from 30,677 million units in 2019 to 33,862 million units in 2020. This growth was largely driven by higher HTU shipment volume in Japan [8].\n\n**Latin America & Canada**\n\nIn Latin America & Canada, cigarette shipment volume decreased, while HTU shipment volume showed a significant percentage increase from a smaller base.\n`![Latin America & Canada shipment volumes for cigarettes (63,749 million units in 2020 vs. 72,293 in 2019) and HTUs (451 million units in 2020 vs. 299 in 2019).](image4)`\nCigarette shipment volume in this region decreased by 11.8%, from 72,293 million units in 2019 to 63,749 million units in 2020. This was primarily due to lower cigarette shipment volume in Argentina and Mexico, partly offset by Brazil [8]. The estimated total market in Latin America & Canada also decreased by 2.8% [2]. Specific contributing factors included:\n*   **Argentina**: A decline due to lower market share, as adult smokers down-traded to ultra-low-price brands, and PMI brands experienced retail out-of-stock situations [5].\n*   **Canada**: An unfavorable impact from the deconsolidation of Rothmans, Benson & Hedges Inc. (RBH) [5].\n*   **Colombia**: Reduced product availability and lower adult smoker average daily consumption due to pandemic-related mobility restrictions contributed to a lower total market and impacted PMI's volume [1, 5].\n*   **Mexico**: The market was affected by excise tax-driven price increases in January 2020 and pandemic-related measures impacting adult smoker consumption patterns, alongside adult smoker down-trading [1, 5].\n\nHeated tobacco unit shipment volume in Latin America & Canada increased by 50.8%, from 299 million units in 2019 to 451 million units in 2020. While the provided texts detail reasons for cigarette volume changes, they do not specify the particular drivers for the HTU volume increase in this region beyond the reported figures.\n\nIn summary, between 2019 and 2020, cigarette volumes declined in both East Asia & Australia and Latin America & Canada due to factors including market dynamics, consumer behavior shifts, and pandemic impacts, while heated tobacco unit volumes increased in both regions."}

In May 2020, Danaher completed a common stock offering, resulting in net proceeds of approximately $1.73 billion [2]. The \"Issuance of common stock\" line item under additional paid-in capital in the Statement of Changes in Stockholders' Equity shows contributions of $1,729 million in 2020 and $1,443 million in 2019. Furthermore, \"Common stock-based award activity\" increased additional paid-in capital by $351 million in 2020 and $315 million in 2019.

Additionally, \"Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock dividends declared\" were $136 million in 2020 and $68 million in 2019.\n    `![The table of changes in stockholders' equity shows declarations of common stock dividends and mandatory convertible preferred stock dividends, which reduced retained earnings in 2019 and 2020.](image1)`\n\n*   **Other Significant Financing-Related Equity Changes:** In 2019, a significant transaction impacting equity was the \"Tendered common stock in exchange offer for Envista Holdings Corporation common stock,\" which reduced retained earnings by $3,452 million [Image1]. This was related to the separation of Envista and represented a substantial financing-related reduction in equity.\n\nThe issuance of mandatory convertible preferred stock and net proceeds from common stock issuances within financing activities substantially increased Danaher's total stockholders' equity from 2018 to 2020, although dividend payments and the Envista exchange offer partially offset this growth."}

Specifically, U.S. upstream operations reported earnings of $7.3 billion in 2021, a significant recovery from a loss of $1.6 billion in 2020. This was attributed to higher realizations ($6.9 billion), the absence of 2020 impairments and write-offs ($1.2 billion), higher sales volumes ($760 million), and higher asset sales gains ($640 million) [9]. U.S. downstream operations also contributed positively, with earnings of $2.4 billion in 2021 compared to a loss of $571 million in 2020, mainly due to higher margins on refined product sales ($1.6 billion) and higher earnings from its 50 percent-owned CPChem ($1.0 billion) [8].\n\nInternationally, upstream operations also saw a strong recovery, reporting earnings of $8.5 billion in 2021 compared with a loss of $825 million in 2020. This increase was primarily due to higher realizations ($7.6 billion) and the absence of 2020 impairments, write-offs ($3.6 billion), and severance charges ($290 million) [6]. However, international downstream earnings decreased from $618 million in 2020 to $525 million in 2021, largely due to lower margins on refined product sales and higher operating expenses, though partially offset by favorable foreign currency effects [10].\n\nChevron's Comprehensive Income (Loss) attributable to Chevron Corporation also saw a major positive shift, from a loss of ($6,165) million in 2020 to an income of $17,348 million in 2021.\n```markdown\n![Comprehensive income attributable to Chevron Corporation was $17,348 million in 2021, compared to a comprehensive loss of ($6,165) million in 2020.](image4)\n```\nThis change reflects the significant improvement in net income, which is a primary component of comprehensive income. Other components of comprehensive income, as detailed in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income, include items such as currency translation adjustments (which moved from a $35 million gain in 2020 to a $55 million loss in 2021) and changes related to defined benefit plans (which contributed $1,779 million to other comprehensive income in 2021 compared to a $655 million loss in 2020) [4].\n\nChevron's net income and comprehensive income significantly increased from 2020 to 2021, driven by higher upstream realizations, improved downstream margins, and the absence of prior-year impairments and write-offs."}

By 2020, this figure rose to 19.4%. This represents an overall increase of 0.4 percentage points over the two-year period.\n\nThis increase, though modest, generally indicates an improvement in the company's ability to convert its revenue into operating profit, suggesting enhanced operational efficiency or cost management over the period.\n\nHowever, looking at the year-over-year changes within this period provides more context. While the margin improved from 2018 to 2020 overall, there was a decrease between 2019 and 2020.

While \"SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales declined 30 basis points on a year-over-year basis for 2020 compared with 2019\" due to factors like increased leverage from higher sales volumes and cost savings, this was \"partially offset by incremental year-over-year amortization charges which adversely impacted SG&A as a percentage of sales by approximately 160 basis points, primarily related to the Cytiva Acquisition in 2020\" [8].

This substantial growth in profit was due to several positive factors. The overall profit increase was \"primarily due to higher sales volume and favorable price realization\" [10]. Total sales and revenues for 2021 increased by 22 percent compared to 2020, mainly because of \"higher sales volume, driven by higher end-user demand for equipment and services and the impact from changes in dealer inventories, along with favorable price realization\" [1]. The operating profit also saw a 51 percent increase, attributed to \"higher sales volume, favorable price realization, higher profit from Financial Products and lower restructuring expenses,\" although this was \"partially offset by unfavorable manufacturing costs and higher SG&A/R&D expenses\" [2]. Additionally, \"Other income/expense\" contributed positively, changing from an expense in 2020 to significant income in 2021, \"primarily due to mark-to-market gains for remeasurement of pension and other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans in 2021, compared with mark-to-market losses in 2020\" [7]. A lower effective tax rate in 2021 compared to 2020 also contributed to the higher net profit [7, 10].\n\nHowever, the substantial increase in profit was partially offset by a negative shift in \"Other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax.\" This component changed from an income of $679 million in 2020 to a loss of $(665) million in 2021 [Image3]. A key element within this was \"Foreign currency translation,\" which swung from a gain of $577 million in 2020 to a loss of $(598) million in 2021 [Image3]. Other components such as \"Derivative financial instruments\" (from a $97 million gain to a $3 million loss) and \"Available-for-sale securities\" (from a $34 million gain to a $34 million loss) also contributed to this unfavorable movement in other comprehensive income [Image3].\n\nComprehensive income attributable to shareholders increased by $2,147 million from 2020 to 2021, primarily driven by higher profits resulting from increased sales and favorable pricing, though this was partly offset by a negative shift in other comprehensive income, mainly due to unfavorable foreign currency translation effects."}

These figures also show a generally increasing trend in tax benefits derived from stock-based compensation that impact the company's overall tax expense.\n\n**What these changes might indicate about the company's financial strategy:**\nThe steady rise in stock-based compensation expense from $619 million in 2020 to $724 million in 2022 suggests an increased issuance of equity awards or a higher valuation of such awards. This can be indicative of several financial strategies:\n1.  **Talent Acquisition and Retention:** Companies often increase stock-based compensation to attract, retain, and motivate employees, particularly in competitive industries. Aligning employee incentives with shareholder value is a common goal.\n2.  **Cash Flow Management:** Stock-based compensation is a non-cash expense (though it can have cash flow implications later, e.g., through tax withholdings upon share issuance). Relying more on it can help preserve cash for other operational needs, investments, or during periods of growth.\n3.  **Growth Initiatives:** An expanding company might be hiring more employees and thus issuing more equity grants, or using stock incentives more aggressively to drive performance linked to growth targets.\n\nThe corresponding increase in related tax benefits naturally follows the higher expense, as these compensation costs are typically tax-deductible for the company.

Inditex decided to absorb between 1,000 and 1,200 stores during 2020 and 2021, targeting 500-600 units each year. This plan focused on \"stores at the end of their useful life, especially those in the younger formats, whose sales can be recuperated in local shops and online\" [1]. In 2021, Inditex was very active in these optimisation activities, with 578 stores absorbed and 226 new store openings [4]. The net reduction of 352 stores (578 absorbed - 226 opened) precisely matches the decrease from 6,829 stores at the end of FY2020 to 6,477 stores at the end of FY2021 [4].\n\nThe geographical distribution of stores changed between 2021 and 2022 due to a net reduction in store counts across all reported regions, driven by Inditex's strategic store optimisation and absorption plan."}

Premium revenues are mainly derived from risk-based health insurance arrangements where the premium is typically fixed per individual for a one-year period [10]. The company's premium revenues for Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D are subject to adjustments under CMS’ risk adjustment payment methodology, which apportions premiums based on health severity and demographic factors [5]. This methodology can lead to higher payments for enrollees with certain conditions [5]. The company also records premium revenues for certain risk-based arrangements at its OptumHealth care delivery businesses [7].\n\nThe financial statements include amounts based on significant estimates and judgments, particularly for medical costs payable and goodwill, which can impact earnings [4].

This growth in noncurrent assets was attributed to various factors, indicating continued investment in the company's long-term operational capabilities or strategic assets [10].\n\nLong-term debt saw a slight increase from $54,102 million in 2019 to $54,355 million in 2020, a rise of $253 million [see image2]. This occurred even as the company was focused on reducing its overall debt burden. IBM's total debt decreased by $1,361 million from December 31, 2019 [2]. The company emphasized its ample financial flexibility and commitment to deleveraging, noting that debt levels had already decreased significantly from their peak in mid-2019 post-Red Hat acquisition and would continue to decrease throughout 2021 [1]. The slight increase in the specific \"long-term debt\" category suggests that while overall debt was being paid down, there might have been some new long-term issuances or reclassification from short-term to long-term debt. For instance, Non-Global Financing debt increased from the end of 2019 but had decreased significantly since mid-2019 [7], while Global Financing debt decreased due to lower funding requirements [3].\n\nNoncurrent liabilities (excluding debt) also increased, moving from $39,398 million in 2019 to $41,020 million in 2020 [see image2]. This represents an increase of $1,622 million, primarily driven by unspecified factors related to the company's ongoing, non-debt long-term obligations [6].\n\nThe implications of these changes on the company's financial strategy suggest a multi-faceted approach. The increase in noncurrent assets points to continued strategic investments for future growth [10]. The slight rise in long-term debt, when viewed against the backdrop of a reduction in total company debt [2] and a stated goal of deleveraging [1], indicates active management of the debt portfolio, possibly involving refinancing or specific project financing while reducing overall indebtedness. The increase in noncurrent liabilities (excluding debt) reflects growth in other long-term obligations that the company is managing. Overall, the strategy appears to be focused on strengthening the balance sheet by reducing total debt, particularly post-acquisition, while ensuring resources are available for long-term growth initiatives.\n\nThe company's financial strategy between 2019 and 2020 involved reducing its overall debt while increasing investments in long-term assets and managing other long-term liabilities."}

This increase was largely driven by economic conditions. The aggregate allowance for loans and lending commitment losses increased in 2020, \"reflecting the provision for credit losses within the Institutional Securities business segment principally resulting from the continued economic impact of COVID-19\" [8]. This provision was also based on \"actual and forecasted changes in asset quality trends, as well as risks related to uncertainty in the outlook for the sectors in focus due to COVID-19\" [8]. Additionally, non-compensation expenses in 2020 rose partly due to \"an increase in the provision for credit losses for lending commitments\" [1].\n\n2.  **Net (Charge-offs) Recoveries**: Net charge-offs during 2020 reduced the ACL by $97 million. This figure is composed of gross charge-offs of $105 million, partially offset by recoveries of $8 million (image4).\n\n3.  **Effect of CECL Adoption**: The company adopted the Current Expected Credit Losses (CECL) accounting standard on January 1, 2020. The rollforward table (image4) lists an \"Effect of CECL adoption\" as a -$41 million adjustment during 2020. It's important to note that the initial transition to CECL on January 1, 2020, \"resulted in an increase in the allowance for credit losses of $131 million\" [5]. The -$41 million figure in the rollforward may represent net adjustments related to CECL throughout the year 2020, distinct from the initial transition impact.\n\n4.  **Other**: Other miscellaneous factors contributed a net increase of $17 million to the ACL during 2020 (image4).\n\n5.  **Growth in Loan Portfolio**: Underlying these changes, the overall portfolio of loans and lending commitments grew. In 2020, \"total loans and lending commitments increased by approximately $28 billion\" [6]. An expansion in the loan portfolio typically necessitates a corresponding increase in the allowance for potential credit losses.\n\nThe Allowance for Credit Losses increased from $590 million in 2019 to $1,231 million in 2020, primarily driven by a significant provision for credit losses largely due to the economic impact of COVID-19, alongside the effects of CECL adoption and net charge-offs."}

Subsequently, GPI's normalized price experienced a significant decline, finishing at 84 by March 2003.\nIn contrast, the BSE Sensex, also starting at 100, dipped to around 90 by August-September 2002.

The total gross margin percentage decreased by 65 basis points in 2022 compared to 2021 [5].\n\nSeveral factors contributed to this decrease:\n1.  **Decreases in Core Merchandise Categories**: Gross margin was negatively impacted by decreases in core merchandise categories [1]. In 2022, this accounted for a 33 basis-point decrease, predominantly driven by decreases in fresh foods and foods and sundries [5]. The gross margin in core merchandise categories, as a percentage of core merchandise sales, decreased by 27 basis points, most significantly in fresh foods [6].\n2.  **LIFO Charge**: The U.S. segment's gross margin was negatively impacted by a LIFO (Last-In, First-Out) charge due to higher merchandise costs [1], [5]. This charge accounted for a 19 basis-point decrease in the total gross margin percentage in 2022 [5].\n3.  **Increased 2% Rewards**: The Other International segment was negatively impacted by increased 2% rewards [1], which also contributed one basis point to the decrease in total gross margin percentage in 2022 [5].\n4.  **Impact of Gasoline Sales**: The company's gasoline business generally has a lower gross margin percentage than its non-gasoline business, and a higher penetration of gasoline sales typically lowers the overall gross margin percentage [2]. In 2022, higher gasoline prices positively impacted net sales by $9,230 million (a 481 basis point impact), with a 42% increase in the average price per gallon, and the volume of gasoline sold also increased, positively impacting net sales by $3,847 million (a 200 basis point impact) [7]. While warehouse ancillary businesses (predominantly gasoline) positively impacted gross margin dollars by 29 basis points in 2022 [5], the effect of gasoline price inflation on the higher net sales base negatively impacted the gross margin *percentage*. Excluding gasoline price inflation, the gross margin percentage decrease in 2022 would have been 19 basis points instead of the reported 65 basis points, indicating that gasoline price inflation contributed significantly (46 basis points) to the decline in the gross margin percentage [5].\n5.  **Inflation and Pricing Philosophy**: Merchandise costs in 2022 were affected by inflation higher than in recent years [3]. The company's philosophy is to provide competitive prices, and investments in merchandise pricing, such as holding prices steady despite cost increases, can negatively impact gross margin percentage [3].\n6.  **Foreign Currencies**: Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted gross margin by approximately $176 million in 2022 compared to 2021 [5].\n\nPartially offsetting these negative impacts was the benefit from ceasing incremental wages related to COVID-19, which positively impacted gross margin across all segments [1] and contributed five basis points to gross margin in 2022 (net of a one-time charge for additional paid time off) [5].\n\nOverall, the gross margin percentage decreased from 11.20% in 2020 to 10.48% in 2022 primarily due to lower margins in core merchandise, a LIFO charge, increased rewards, and the impact of higher, lower-margin gasoline sales, alongside inflationary pressures and the company's pricing strategy."}

This aligns with the broader trend of \"lower net interest income reflecting lower loan balances driven by weak demand and the lower interest rate environment\" [3].\n\nConcurrently, average total loans in Commercial Banking also declined.\n```markdown\n![Commercial Banking balance sheet data shows a 14% decrease in average total loans from 2020 to 2021.](image2)\n```\nAverage total loans decreased by 14%, from $211,436 million in 2020 to $181,237 million in 2021 (image2). This reduction in loan balances contributed to the lower net interest income observed [2]. The decrease in total loans was attributed to \"lower loan demand, including lower line utilization, and higher paydowns\" [5].\n\n**Corporate & Investment Bank**\nThe Corporate & Investment Bank segment saw a more modest change in its net interest income.\n```markdown\n![Corporate & Investment Bank income statement shows a 1% decrease in net interest income from 2020 to 2021.](image3)\n```\nNet interest income for this segment decreased slightly by 1%, from $7,509 million in 2020 to $7,410 million in 2021 (image3).\n\nIn terms of average total loans, this sector experienced a slight increase.\n```markdown\n![Corporate & Investment Bank balance sheet data shows a 1% increase in average total loans from 2020 to 2021.](image4)\n```\nAverage total loans in the Corporate & Investment Bank rose by 1%, from $255,324 million in 2020 to $257,036 million in 2021 (image4). This contrasts with the overall trend of decreasing average loans mentioned in text quote [5], suggesting sector-specific dynamics.\n\n**Consumer/Retail Segment**\nFor the segment covering consumer-oriented lending (such as Home Lending, Auto, Credit Card), there was a significant decrease in average total loans. (Net interest income for this specific segment is not detailed in the provided images).\n```markdown\n![Consumer/Retail segment balance sheet data shows an 11% decrease in average total loans from 2020 to 2021.](image5)\n```\nAverage total loans in this consumer-focused segment decreased by 11%, from $376,463 million in 2020 to $333,885 million in 2021 (image5).

By 1880, the population had risen to 8,267, and it reached its historical peak in 1890 with 14,096 residents [5]. Several historical factors fueled this rapid growth. The Transcontinental Railroad Act and the Homestead Act, both enacted in 1862, were instrumental in transforming Nebraska into an agricultural hub, attracting a \"great tide of emigration\" [9]. The Homestead Act, offering 160 acres of land to settlers, particularly spurred this influx [9]. The county was settled by people from eastern states like Missouri, Iowa, Illinois, and Ohio, as well as immigrants from Germany, Sweden, England, and Russia, who often formed distinct ethnic communities [8].\n\nAfter reaching its peak in 1890, the population of Hamilton County entered a period of general decline, with some fluctuations over the decades [5].

The number of farms decreased while their average size increased; in 1900, there were over 2,000 farms, but by 2002, this number had dropped to 603, with the average farm size growing from 179.7 acres in 1920 to 577 acres in 2002 [4]. This transformation had \"significant impacts on rural life,\" as fewer people were needed to operate the larger, more mechanized farms, contributing to the population decline in the agricultural county [4].\n\nFrom 1870 to 2000, Hamilton County's population first boomed due to factors like the Homestead Act and railroad expansion, peaked in 1890, and then generally decreased due to agricultural mechanization and farm consolidation."}

Generally, pre-training word embeddings in either the source, target, or both languages contributes to an increase in these scores [6]. The improvement is often more pronounced when source language embeddings are pre-trained, indicating that a better encoding of the source sentence is a primary factor for the observed gains [6].\n\n```markdown\n![Table comparing BLEU scores for standard (std) vs. pre-trained (pre) embeddings across various language pairs (GL→EN, PT→EN, AZ→EN, TR→EN, BE→EN, RU→EN), with columns differentiating pre-training on source only (pre std), target only (std pre), or both (pre pre), generally showing improvements, especially with pre-trained source embeddings.](image4)\n```\nAs seen in the table above (image4), for the GL → EN pair, the BLEU score significantly increases from 2.2 (std std) to 13.2 (pre std) when pre-trained source embeddings are used [].\n\nThe impact of pre-training on BLEU scores varies depending on the characteristics of the language pairs. For higher-resource languages, pre-training yields consistent gains, typically around 3 BLEU points for pairs like PT → EN [1]. In contrast, for extremely low-resource languages, the effect is more varied: some, like Azerbaijani (AZ) and Belarusian (BE), show minimal gains, while others, such as Galician (GL), can achieve substantial improvements of up to 11 BLEU points [1]. This suggests that pre-trained embeddings can be particularly effective for bootstrapping models that are on the verge of producing decent translations [1]. The data in image4 reflects this, showing a large jump for GL → EN from 2.2 to 13.2 (pre std), while AZ → EN improves from 1.3 to 2.0 (pre std).\n\nThe effectiveness of pre-training is also related to the initial performance of the NMT system. The largest gains in BLEU score are often observed when the baseline system is performing poorly but not extremely so, usually when its baseline BLEU score is in the 3-4 range [4]. This implies that a moderately effective system is necessary for pre-training to take full effect, but once basic language characteristics are captured, pre-training can be highly beneficial [4].\n\n```markdown\n![Top graph shows BLEU scores for Pt→En, Tr→En, Ru→En with standard (solid lines) vs. pre-trained (dashed lines) embeddings across varying training set sizes. Bottom graph shows the BLEU score increase due to pre-training for these pairs.](image2)\n```\nThe experiments involving down-sampling training data for higher-resource languages illustrate this point (image2). The bottom panel shows that the increase in BLEU score from pre-training (pre vs std) is most significant at smaller training set sizes, which correspond to lower baseline BLEU scores [].\n\nFurthermore, when translating various languages into a common target language like Portuguese (PT), those with very low baseline BLEU scores, such as Russian (RU) and Hebrew (HE), tend to see more substantial accuracy gains from pre-training compared to languages like French (FR) and Italian (IT) that start with higher baselines [9].\n```markdown\n![Table showing BLEU scores for translations from Spanish (ES), French (FR), Italian (IT), Russian (RU), and Hebrew (HE) into Portuguese (PT), comparing standard (std) and pre-trained (pre) embeddings.

For instance, the Galician/Portuguese (GL/PT) pair, which has high similarity, showed the largest gains [10].\n\nPre-training word embeddings generally improves BLEU scores for different language pairs, with the magnitude of this improvement varying based on factors like language resource availability, baseline system performance, whether source or target embeddings are pre-trained, and language similarity in multilingual settings."}

This comparison helps isolate the contribution of the source text when a reference is already being used.\n\nThe results of this comparison are shown in the table below:\n![Table comparing COMET-RANK (ref. only) and COMET-RANK for various language pairs, showing Kendall's Tau scores and the difference (Δτ).](image2)\nThis table presents Kendall's Tau correlations for `COMET-RANK (ref. only)` and `COMET-RANK` (which uses both source and reference) across several language pairs [9]. The `Δτ` row quantifies the improvement in correlation achieved by including the source text in addition to the reference.\n\nFor language pairs where English is the source (en-cs, en-de, en-fi, en-tr), the inclusion of the source text alongside the reference leads to an improvement, with `Δτ` values ranging from 0.024 to 0.051. For example, for en-cs, the score improves from 0.660 (reference only) to 0.711 (reference and source) [9].\n\nInterestingly, the improvement (`Δτ`) is more significant for language pairs where English is the target language (cs-en, de-en, fi-en, tr-en). For these pairs, `Δτ` values are considerably higher, ranging from 0.107 to 0.155 [9], [8]. For instance, for de-en, the score increases from 0.390 to 0.542 when the source is included [9]. This suggests that the source text provides a particularly valuable signal when evaluating translations into English. The COMET-RANK model itself weighs source and reference differently during inference, although they are weighted equally in its training loss function [7].\n\nThe inclusion of source text alongside reference translations generally enhances the COMET-RANK metric's correlation with human judgments for language pairs involving English, with a more pronounced improvement observed when English is the target language."}

This indicates the importance of providing LLMs with both demonstrations (\"What\") and logical constraints (\"How\") [10].\n\nIncreasing the number of demonstration samples generally improves Micro-F1 performance on MAVEN-ERE and CTB datasets, with diminishing returns at higher numbers; incorporating logical constraints consistently enhances this performance further across different sample sizes."}

The multi-task setup of SciIE effectively improves performance across tasks like entity identification, relation extraction, and coreference resolution by sharing span representations and leveraging cross-sentence information [10].\n\nOn the SciERC dataset, SciIE's performance is detailed for entity recognition, relation extraction, and coreference resolution.\nAs stated, \"Table 2 compares the result of our model with baselines on the three tasks: entity recognition (Table 2a), relation extraction (Table 2b), and coreference resolution (Table 2c). As evidenced by the table, our uniﬁed multi-task setup\" shows superior results [7].\n![Table 2 shows SciIE achieves an F1 score of 64.2 for entity recognition, 39.3 for relation extraction, and 48.2 for coreference resolution on the test set, generally outperforming other models like E2E Rel and LSTM+CRF variants.](image3)\nFor entity recognition on the test set, SciIE achieves P: 67.2, R: 61.5, F1: 64.2. For relation extraction on the test set, SciIE achieves P: 47.6, R: 33.5, F1: 39.3. For coreference resolution on the test set, SciIE achieves P: 52.0, R: 44.9, F1: 48.2. These scores indicate strong performance, particularly in F1 for entity recognition and relation extraction compared to the E2E Rel models, and in coreference resolution against E2E Coref [7].\n\nOn the SemEval 17 dataset, SciIE also shows competitive results.\n\"Table 4 compares the results of our model with the state of the art on the SemEval 17 dataset for tasks of span identiﬁcation, keyphrase extraction and relation extraction as well as the overall score. Our model outperforms all the previous models that use hand-designed features.

In Keyphrase Extraction, SciIE's F1 was 46.0, compared to Best SemEval's 44 and (Luan 2017)'s 45.3. For Relation Extraction, SciIE had an F1 of 27.8, slightly below Best SemEval's 28. Overall, SciIE achieved an F1 of 44.7, surpassing the Best SemEval system's F1 of 43 [3].\n\nThe inclusion of coreference linking significantly enhances the model's performance and the utility of the extracted information. Human evaluation confirmed that \"propagating coreference can signiﬁcantly improve the quality of the automatic con-structed knowledge graph\" [1]. Furthermore, experiments demonstrate this improvement quantitatively: \"Figure 8 shows precision/recall curves for both systems... We observe that the knowledge graph curve with coreference linking is mostly above the curve without corefer-ence linking. The precision of both systems is high (above 84% for both systems), but the system with coreference links has signiﬁcantly higher recall\" [2].\n![Figure 8 shows precision/recall curves where the system 'With Coref.' (blue line) generally maintains higher precision for a given recall or achieves higher recall for a given precision compared to the system 'Without Coref.' (red line).](image4)\nThis visual evidence supports the claim that coreference linking boosts recall while maintaining high precision [2]. The developers also \"show the importance of coreference links in making a dense, useful graph\" [10].\n\nThe SciIE model generally outperforms other models in precision, recall, and F1 scores across tasks like entity recognition, relation extraction, and span identification, and the incorporation of coreference resolution significantly improves recall and the quality of the resulting knowledge graph."}

For general language understanding tasks, SenseBERT_BASE maintains comparable performance to BERT_BASE (OURS), while it shows more significant improvements on tasks that specifically require deep lexical semantic understanding.\n\nOn the General Language Understanding Evaluation (GLUE) benchmark, which covers nine different NLP tasks, SenseBERT_BASE performs on par with BERT_BASE (OURS) [5]. The overall GLUE score for SenseBERT_BASE is 77.9, slightly edging out BERT_BASE (OURS) which scored 77.5 [5].\n```markdown\n![Table comparing BERT_BASE (OURS) and SenseBERT_BASE scores across 9 GLUE tasks, showing SenseBERT_BASE with a slightly higher overall score.](image4)\n```\nAs seen in the table above, SenseBERT_BASE shows improvements in tasks like CoLA (54.6 vs. 50.1) and QNLI (90.6 vs. 89.4). In other tasks such as SST-2 (92.2 vs. 92.6) and STS-B (83.5/82.3 vs. 85.7/84.6), BERT_BASE (OURS) has a slight edge, while performance is identical on MNLI (83.6) [5]. This indicates that incorporating lexical semantic information into SenseBERT's pre-training did not compromise its performance on other downstream tasks [5].\n\nFor tasks demanding a high level of lexical semantic understanding, SenseBERT_BASE demonstrates clearer advantages.\n```markdown\n![Table comparing BERT_BASE, BERT_LARGE, SenseBERT_BASE, and SenseBERT_LARGE on SemEval-SS (Frozen and Fine-tuned) and Word in Context tasks, showing SenseBERT models consistently outperforming BERT counterparts.](image3)\n```\nOn a supersense variant of the SemEval Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) dataset (SemEval-SS), SenseBERT_BASE significantly outperforms BERT_BASE. In the \"Frozen\" setting, where a linear classifier is trained over pretrained embeddings without changing network weights, SenseBERT_BASE (75.6) improves upon BERT_BASE (65.1) by over 10 points [1, 4]. In the \"Fine-tuned\" setting, SenseBERT_BASE (83.0) also surpasses BERT_BASE (79.2) [1, 4].

The NIDF is 17.1%.\n-   A **moderately positive weight (Wt 3.0)** leads to a more specific and engaging response that builds upon the baseline: \"That sounds like a lot of fun. How long have you been studying?\". The NIDF slightly increases to 18.3%.\n-   As the **weight increases further (Wt 7.0)**, the response starts to become less coherent and somewhat nonsensical: \"I majored in practising my spiritual full time philosophy test\".

These methods offer different ways to navigate the multi-layered RAPTOR tree to retrieve relevant information [8].\n\nThe **tree traversal** method processes the tree level by level [2]. It begins by selecting the top-k most relevant root nodes based on their similarity to the query. Then, it considers the children of these selected nodes at the next layer, again choosing the top k nodes. This process continues until the leaf nodes are reached [7]. This approach allows for control over the specificity and breadth of information by starting broadly at the top layers and becoming more focused as it moves down [9].\n```markdown\n![A diagram illustrating the tree traversal retrieval process, where a query is encoded and then used to select nodes layer by layer from a tree structure to form the retrieved context.](image2)\n```\nThis diagram (A. Tree Traversal Retrieval) shows how the query leads to a selection of nodes in a hierarchical manner from the tree structure [2].\n\nOn the other hand, the **collapsed tree** method evaluates all nodes across all layers simultaneously to find the most relevant ones [2]. It essentially \"flattens\" the multi-layered tree into a single layer, bringing all nodes to the same level for comparison [3].\n```markdown\n![A diagram illustrating the collapsed tree retrieval process, where a query is encoded and used to select nodes from a flattened, single-layer representation of the tree structure to form the retrieved context.](image2)\n```\nThis diagram (B. Collapsed Tree Retrieval) illustrates how all nodes from the tree are considered together as a single collection [3]. This approach offers greater flexibility because it can retrieve information at the correct level of granularity for a given question by searching through all nodes at once [1]. In contrast, tree traversal maintains a constant ratio of nodes from each tree level, regardless of the question [1]. Tests have shown that the collapsed tree approach generally performs better due to this flexibility [1].\n```markdown\n![A line graph comparing the F1 performance of collapsed tree and tree traversal methods against context length, showing collapsed tree consistently outperforming tree traversal.](image5)\n```\nAs seen in the performance graph, the collapsed tree approach (green line) consistently achieves a higher F1 score compared to the tree traversal method (blue line) across different context lengths [1].\n\nIn summary, Tree Traversal Retrieval navigates the tree layer-by-layer, while Collapsed Tree Retrieval evaluates all nodes simultaneously as if they were in a single layer."}

Its inference capabilities, such as visual question answering, image captioning, text generation, image generation, and long-form mixed-modal generation, are directly influenced by its supervised fine-tuning (SFT) dataset [4].\n\nThe SFT dataset is categorized to train specific functionalities. The categories include Text, Code, Visual Chat, Image Generation, Interleaved Text/Image Generation, and Safety [7]. The statistics for these categories within the Chameleon-SFT dataset are as follows:\n![Chameleon-SFT dataset statistics table showing categories like Text, Code, Visual Chat, Image Generation, Interleaved Generation, and Safety, along with their respective number of samples, tokens, and images.](image5)\nThese statistics [Image5] show the data distribution used for fine-tuning. For example, the \"Interleaved Text/Image Generation\" category, with 16.9K samples and 30.7K images, specifically trains the model to handle prompts that require mixed sequences of text and images in the output [8]. This is crucial for Chameleon's ability to generate relevant images within a textual context, making documents with interleaving text and images appealing [8]. The \"Image Generation\" category (64.3K samples) directly supports the model's capacity for non-trivial image generation [4].\n\nData balancing during the SFT stage is emphasized as important for high-quality alignment; an imbalance can lead to the model excessively favoring or muting a particular modality [5]. The distribution of data across categories, as seen in [Image5], helps in achieving this balance. The fine-tuning process uses a batch size of 128 and accommodates sequences up to 4096 tokens, with each instance being a paired prompt and answer [1]. This prepares the model to handle long contexts and diverse prompt-answer formats during inference, which is essential for tasks like long-form mixed-modal generation [4]. Additionally, a significant \"Safety\" dataset, including mixed-modal prompts, is used to ensure the model produces safe content during inference [9].\n\nThe supervised fine-tuning dataset statistics directly shape Chameleon's inference strategy by providing targeted training data for its diverse mixed-modal understanding and generation capabilities."}

After generation, these pairs undergo a filtering process (as shown in Step 3 of the image) to ensure quality. Finally, the validated instruction-response pairs are translated into multiple languages, including Chinese, Japanese, Spanish, German, French, Korean, and Arabic [6].\n\nThe Sythus process involves: 1. Defining system messages and providing visual annotations; 2. Using these with in-context examples (refined via a cold start) to prompt ChatGPT; 3. Generating instruction-response pairs with ChatGPT; 4. Filtering the generated pairs; and 5. Translating the pairs into multiple languages."}

In settings where these are provided or easily identifiable, models tend to perform better. For instance, a single-paragraph BERT model achieves a 67.08 F1 score in the \"distractor setting,\" where two gold paragraphs are paired with eight distractor paragraphs [1].\n```markdown\n![Table 1 shows the Single-paragraph BERT model achieves 67.08 F1 in the Distractor setting and 38.40 F1 in the Open F1 setting.](image3)\n```\nHowever, in an \"open-domain\" setting, where the model must first retrieve relevant paragraphs from a larger corpus, performance can drop significantly. The same single-paragraph BERT model achieves only 38.40 F1 in this setting [3]. The importance of retrieving gold paragraphs is further highlighted by an experiment where adding the two gold paragraphs to 500 retrieved paragraphs (in an open-domain scenario) increased the F1 score from 39.12 to 53.12 [10].\n```markdown\n![Table 5 shows F1 scores for different settings, highlighting a jump from 39.12 to 53.12 when gold paragraphs are added in the open-domain 500 paragraphs scenario.](image5)\n```\nThis shows that the ability to locate the gold paragraphs is a major factor in model performance [10].\n\nDistractors are paragraphs designed to be irrelevant or misleading. The effectiveness and type of distractors also impact F1 scores. When using more challenging, adversarially selected distractors, the F1 score of the single-paragraph BERT model declined from 67.08 to 46.84 [4].\n```markdown\n![Table 4 shows the F1 score of a model on original evaluation data (67.08), adversarial data (46.84), and type-filtered adversarial data (40.73) when trained on original data, and improved scores when trained on adversarial data.](image2)\n```\nSimilarly, when distractors were filtered to match the entity type of gold paragraphs (type distractors), the original model's F1 score dropped to 40.73 [2]. These results demonstrate that models can struggle when the distribution of distractors changes [8]. However, if the model is re-trained on these new types of distractors, it can recover a significant portion of its accuracy. For example, after re-training on adversarial distractors, the F1 score increased to 60.10 [4], and on type-filtered adversarial distractors, it increased to 58.42 after re-training on adversarially selected distractors [2].\n\nDespite these efforts, creating distractors that genuinely force multi-hop reasoning remains a challenge. Even when using a large number of distractors (e.g., 500), a single-paragraph BERT can still achieve a reasonable F1 score (53.12 when gold paragraphs are included), suggesting that current distractor selection methods may not be sufficient to prevent single-hop shortcuts [5]. More carefully chosen distractors are needed to induce questions that require multi-hop reasoning, but even adversarial selection methods can be overcome by re-training single-hop models, indicating these distractors are still insufficient [7].\n\nThe presence and successful retrieval of gold paragraphs significantly boost F1 scores, while challenging distractors can lower scores unless models are re-trained, indicating that both effective evidence retrieval and robust distractor handling are crucial for multi-hop QA model performance."}

To investigate the importance of word-order features, experiments were conducted where words in the training set were randomly shuffled, while keeping the original word order for test samples. LSTM was used for this purpose as it can capture word-order information from an original training set [3].\n\nFor sentiment analysis tasks, such as on the Yelp Polarity dataset, the removal of word-order information by shuffling the training data led to a noticeable drop in LSTM performance [6]. The results, as shown in the table below, indicate that for the Yelp P. (Polarity) dataset, LSTM accuracy dropped from 95.11 on the original dataset to 93.49 on the shuffled dataset [7].\n\n![Table showing LSTM performance on original vs. shuffled datasets for Yahoo, Yelp P., and SNLI.

LSTM models, which can capture word-order, generally perform better than models like SWEM (Simple Word Embedding-based Models) on sentiment analysis tasks precisely because word order can be crucial for determining sentiment [2]. For instance, phrases like \"not really good\" and \"really not good\" convey different levels of negative sentiment due to word ordering, a nuance that LSTMs can capture [2]. The performance of LSTM on the Yelp dataset with a shuffled training set was very close to SWEM's results, indicating that the main difference between LSTM and SWEM in this context may be due to LSTM's ability to capture word-order features [1].\n\nIn contrast, for tasks like topic categorization (e.g., Yahoo dataset) and natural language inference (e.g., SNLI dataset), the LSTM model trained on a shuffled training set showed comparable accuracies to those trained on the original dataset [7].

In fact, analysis suggested that BERT's peak 77% performance could be entirely accounted for by these cues [10]. BERT was identified as a very strong learner, more adept than models like BoV and BiLSTM at exploiting subtle distributional information and cues, such as learning when to ignore common cue words like \"not\" and focus on other signals [4].\n\nTo address this issue and provide a more reliable measure of argument comprehension, an adversarial dataset was created.

The adversarial transformation thus exposed that BERT, much like the other models, was relying on these spurious cues rather than demonstrating genuine argument comprehension skills [9].\n\nThe adversarial transformation caused BERT's performance to drop significantly to random accuracy, and it similarly reduced the performance of other models to random, indicating that all models were exploiting spurious statistical cues rather than truly understanding argument reasoning."}

This outperformance is observed across multiple datasets.\n\nFor instance, on the Organ AM NIST dataset, the \"Hard-to-Contrast\" initial query (represented by red lines) consistently leads to higher AUC scores in every cycle of active learning, irrespective of the subsequent active learning querying strategy used [10]. This is visually demonstrated in the performance graphs where the red line, indicating \"Hard-to-Contrast,\" generally stays above other lines representing different initial query strategies combined with various active learning methods [1].\n![The \"Hard-to-Contrast\" initial query strategy (red lines) consistently achieves higher AUC scores compared to other strategies across different numbers of labeled images and active learning methods on the Organ AM NIST dataset.](image1)\nThis consistent outperformance is not limited to one dataset. The \"Hard-to-contrast data (our proposal) consistently outperforms the others on Organ AM NIST (Figure 5), BloodMNIST (Figure 13), and PathMNIST (Figure 14), and steadily improves the model performances within the next active learning cycles\" [1].

The choice of the initial query is crucial because \"it is the ﬁrst few choices that deﬁne the efﬁcacy and efﬁciency of the subsequent learning procedure\" [2]. The \"Hard-to-Contrast\" strategy offers a practical and effective solution to the \"cold start problem\" in vision active learning by providing a strong baseline for sampling the initial query [2]. Furthermore, there is a \"strong positive correlation\" between the performance in the initial cycle (e.g., AUC with 20 labeled images) and the performance in later cycles (e.g., AUC with 50 labeled images) [1], [4]. This highlights that a good start, facilitated by a strategy like \"Hard-to-Contrast,\" tends to lead to better overall performance throughout the active learning process.\n\nThe \"Hard-to-Contrast\" querying strategy generally achieves higher AUC scores than other methods across different numbers of labeled images, indicating that selecting hard-to-contrast data for the initial query is crucial for effective active learning."}

The AUC performance of both methods improves when `p` increases from 0. When `p` is too small, the model tends to overfit on the Long-Term User Representation (LTUR), as LTUR has many parameters, leading to suboptimal performance [8]. However, when `p` becomes too large, the performance of both methods, including AUC, starts to decline. This decline may occur because the useful information in LTUR cannot be effectively incorporated if it's masked too frequently [4, 8]. A moderate choice for `p` (e.g., 0.5) is suggested as most appropriate for both LSTUR-ini and LSTUR-con methods, as this value properly balances the learning of LTUR and STUR [4].

It involves an enzyme called glycosylase recognizing and removing the damaged base, creating an abasic site. This site is then processed, new bases are added by a polymerase, and a ligase seals the DNA strand [5]. As shown in the image, BER handles damage like 8-Oxoguanine and single-strand breaks (SSB) caused by oxygen radicals and alkylating agents.\n*   **Mismatch Repair (MMR)**: The MMR system corrects mismatched or unpaired bases that occur due to errors during DNA replication. It involves recognizing the mutated strand, removing the incorrect sequence, synthesizing the correct sequence using DNA polymerase, and rejoining the DNA strands with ligases [6]. The image indicates MMR addresses single base mismatches and insertion/deletions arising from replication errors.\n*   **Nucleotide Excision Repair (NER)**: NER is a versatile system that can remove a variety of DNA lesions, including UV-induced pyrimidine dimers and bulky adducts. It is a highly conserved mechanism [4]. The image shows NER repairing pyrimidine dimers and bulky adducts caused by UV light.\n*   **Recombinational Repair**: This mechanism is crucial for fixing double-strand breaks in DNA, which are among the most severe types of DNA damage. It includes pathways like homologous recombination (HR) and non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) [10]. The image illustrates that recombinational repair handles double-strand breaks (DSB) and interstrand crosslinks, which can be caused by DNA damaging drugs.\n\nFigure 11 demonstrates base excision repair (BER), mismatch repair (MMR), nucleotide excision repair (NER), and recombinational repair as DNA repair mechanisms."}

Specifically, fine-tuned Llama 2-Chat models have shown remarkable improvements. After instruction fine-tuning, Llama 2-Chat models of all sizes achieve an effectively zero percentage of toxic generations [2]. This reduction is substantial, with the 70B Llama 2-Chat model's toxicity dropping from approximately 24.60 (for the pretrained 70B Llama 2) to effectively 0% (0.01 is mentioned as the specific value after fine-tuning), marking the lowest toxicity level among the compared models [7].\n\nAccording to the evaluation, ChatGPT has the highest truthfulness score, and the fine-tuned Llama 2-Chat models have the lowest toxicity score."}

The inputs to the model are a logical reasoning problem described in natural language and a goal, which can be a multiple-choice or free-form question [4].\n\nThe process begins with the **Problem Formulation** stage. In this stage, an LLM is employed to translate the natural language problem and its goal into a task-specific symbolic language [1]. The LLM converts the problem description into an appropriate symbolic formulation by identifying key entities, facts, and rules present in the problem statement [2]. This shifts the LLM's role from \"solving the problem by reasoning step-by-step\" to \"representing the problem in symbolic language\" [1].\n\n![Diagram illustrating the LOGIC-LM framework with its three stages: Problem Formulator, Symbolic Reasoner, and Result Interpreter, processing various logical problems.](image5)\n\nAs seen in the diagram above (image5), the \"Problem Formulator\" takes natural language questions and converts them into structured symbolic representations. LOGIC-LM uses different symbolic formulations for various types of logical reasoning problems, such as deductive reasoning, first-order logic reasoning, constraint satisfaction problems, and analytical reasoning [5].\n\n![Table showing examples of different logical reasoning problems, their symbolic formulations, corresponding solvers, and datasets.](image4)\n\nThe table above (image4) provides examples of these problem types, their symbolic formulations (like LP, FOL, CSP, SAT), and the solvers they employ.\n\nNext is the **Symbolic Reasoning** stage. Here, a deterministic symbolic solver (e.g., a logic programming engine, First-order Logic Prover, Constraint Optimization, or SMT Solver as shown in image5 and detailed in image4) performs inference on the symbolic formulation generated in the previous stage [1], [2]. Because the reasoning is performed by deterministic algorithms within the symbolic reasoner, the answer obtained is guaranteed to be faithful as long as the problem formulation is correct [1].\n\nFinally, the **Result Interpretation** stage takes place. An LLM or a rule-based system translates the symbolic answer produced by the solver back into natural language [1]. This interpreter explains the output and maps it to the correct answer format for the original question [2], as depicted in image5 where the outputs from the symbolic reasoners are converted into human-readable answers.\n\nTo enhance the accuracy of the initial symbolic parsing, LOGIC-LM also incorporates a self-refinement module. This module uses error messages from the symbolic solver as feedback to iteratively revise the generated symbolic formalizations [2], [6].\n\nLOGIC-LM solves a problem by first using an LLM to formulate the natural language problem into a symbolic representation, then employing a deterministic symbolic solver for reasoning, and finally using an interpreter to translate the symbolic solution back into natural language."}

Conversely, coal is a carbon-intensive fossil fuel, and its combustion releases significant amounts of CO2. Text quote [7] highlights that \"energy is not currently derived from carbon-neural sources in many locations,\" and this contributes to the environmental cost of high energy demands. The U.S. breakdown of energy, which includes 27% coal, is noted as being \"comparable to that of the most popular cloud compute service, Amazon Web Services,\" and is used as a basis for estimating CO2 emissions [4].\n\nTherefore, Microsoft's substantially larger share of renewable energy (an almost twofold difference compared to AWS) would suggest a tendency towards lower CO2 emissions per unit of energy consumed from that portion of its energy mix. While Microsoft's coal usage is slightly higher, the significant advantage in renewable energy percentage is a more dominant factor when considering the overall carbon intensity of their energy portfolios.\n\nAmazon-AWS uses 17% renewable energy and 30% coal, while Microsoft uses 32% renewable energy and 31% coal; Microsoft's significantly higher renewable energy share suggests a potentially lower overall CO2 emission intensity per unit of energy consumed compared to Amazon-AWS, despite a marginal 1% higher coal usage."}

Probing experiments indicated that by considering only the warrants (W), BERT could achieve 71% accuracy [2, 6]. Adding cues from reasons (R, W) accounted for an additional four percentage points, and cues from claims (C, W) accounted for another two percentage points, making up the total 77% [2, 6].\n\nTo create a more robust evaluation, an adversarial dataset was constructed to eliminate these spurious cues [3].

For text quality, both models show strong performance, with scores generally improving in specific settings [image5].\n\nThe reason for this improved performance in specific settings is that \"specific questions provide clearer instructions to the models on which knowledge to use\" [9]. Furthermore, \"the specific questions target the knowledge more explicitly in the question context, and hence cover the scope of the paragraph better. It stands for an upper bound for knowledge coverage\" [9]. In contrast, \"general questions implicitly target the knowledge in the question context, and there loosely cover the scope of the paragraph. It stands for an upper bound for question naturalness and a lower bound for knowledge coverage\" [9].\n\n**Implications for Citation and Text Evaluation:**\nThe superior performance in specific settings implies that for tasks requiring high accuracy in citation and high-quality text generation (e.g., academic summaries, factual reporting), providing clear and targeted prompts or questions is crucial. While general questions might elicit more natural or broadly conversational responses, they may come at the cost of precision and relevance in citations and detailed accuracy in the text. Therefore, to maximize the quality of both citations and generated text, users should aim to formulate their queries as specifically as possible. The models generally demonstrate better text-citation alignment and overall citation quality when the task is well-defined [6, image5].\n\nIn summary, both GPT-4 and ChatGPT perform better on citation and text evaluation metrics when provided with specific questions, indicating that query specificity significantly enhances their ability to generate accurate and relevant responses."}

In total, we collected 14 batches of human preference data (i.e., Meta Safety $^+$ Helpfulness) on a weekly basis, consisting of over 1 million binary model generation comparisons. In general, later batches contain more samples as we onboard more annotators over time and the annotators also become more familiar with the tasks and thus have better work efficiency. We also intentionally collect more multi-turn samples to increase the complexity of RLHF data and thus the average number of tokens per sample also increase accordingly over batches.\n![Table 26 details Meta human preference data per batch, showing an increasing trend in the average number of tokens per example, culminating in 1008.0 for batch 14 and an overall average of 798.5.](image2)\n\nBased on the provided data, the Meta (Safety & Helpfulness) dataset has the highest average number of tokens per example."}

The results of this comparison are illustrated below:\n`![The graph shows F1 scores on the y-axis and context length on the x-axis, with the 'Collapsed tree' method consistently achieving higher F1 scores than the 'Tree Traversal' method across all tested context lengths.](image3)`\nAs depicted in the graph, the collapsed tree approach (green line) consistently demonstrates superior performance over the tree traversal approach (blue line) in terms of F1 score across all context lengths tested [6]. For instance, at shorter context lengths (e.g., around 500 tokens), the collapsed tree method achieves an F1 score of approximately 52, while the tree traversal method scores around 45. This trend continues as context length increases; for example, at a context length of 2000 tokens, the collapsed tree method reaches an F1 score near 59, whereas tree traversal is around 57. The collapsed tree method's better performance is attributed to its greater flexibility, as it searches through all nodes simultaneously, allowing it to retrieve information at the most appropriate level of granularity for a given question [6].

For instance, in Afghanistan, NAMRU-3 partnered with the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) Cooperative Biological Engagement Program (CBEP) to build medical capacity within Ministry of Health laboratories [8]. This involved assessing the capacity of laboratories and staff, initially focusing on the Central Public Health Laboratory (CPHL) in Kabul [3]. NAMRU-3's efforts included establishing five hospital laboratories and specialized virology, bacteriology, and serology laboratories within the CPHL [2]. A key component of their work is training; in 2011, NAMRU-3 trained 160 Afghan scientists and technicians on laboratory operations, diagnostic procedures, research ethics, and management concerning U.S. select agents [1], [6].\n![Several individuals in lab coats are gathered around a table in a laboratory, appearing to be engaged in a training or research activity.](image3)\nThey also developed a comprehensive training plan with nine modules covering areas like parasitology, bacteriology, and clinical epidemiology [9]. Furthermore, NAMRU-3 conducted workshops on proper laboratory procedures, supply inventory, quality control, and the development of national laboratory biosafety plans [10]. They also worked to improve information and sample flow to and from laboratories, providing necessary supplies and training to address identified gaps [5]. Beyond Afghanistan, NAMRU-3 is also involved in medical research capacity building in Liberia [7]. These activities directly support U.S. military operations by enhancing biodefense and disease surveillance capabilities in strategic regions [8].\n\nThe Naval Submarine Medical Research Laboratory (NSMRL) is an operational medicine laboratory with a primary focus on the submarine force and human factors within it [4]. NSMRL's contributions include conducting medical, psychological, and human performance research. It also provides independent reviews of human systems-related projects and develops innovative concepts for the Commander, Submarine Forces (CSF) [4]. A significant area of NSMRL's research is diving medicine. The laboratory features a Genesis hyperbaric chamber with an external hatch, allowing it to simulate high altitudes by drawing a vacuum. This unique chamber can lock-in and lock-out at depth or altitude, enabling prolonged studies and the examination of mission profiles that transition between these environments, such as those a Special Operations Forces mission might undertake (e.g., locking out of a submarine and then scaling a mountain) [4]. NSMRL's mission is directly aligned with U.S. military operations, as it serves as CSF’s primary human technology laboratory, focusing on all aspects of submariner health and performance, and its work is aligned with the submarine force's strategic direction [4].\n\nBoth NAMRU-3 and NSMRL contribute significantly to medical and scientific research through capacity building, training, and specialized research, with their missions directly supporting U.S. military health, readiness, and operational capabilities."}

It was presented to the Force Health Protection and Readiness, Strategic Analysis Working Group and, once accredited, is set to become the Joint patient occurrence generating application [3]. The primary function of the PCOF tool is to generate tables that detail the \"occurrence probabilities of disease and injury types typically sustained in a contingency by a population at risk\" [10]. These tables cover various casualty categories such as wounded in action, non-battle injuries, diseases, and outpatient visits across the full range of military operations (ROMO) [10]. ROMO includes humanitarian assistance, disaster relief, defense support of civil authorities, and different combat operations [10].\n![Military medical personnel stand in front of a helicopter, representing the operational environment where PCOF is used for planning.](image4)\nThe PCOF tool empowers planners to advance from less precise, \"anecdotal, rule-of-thumb planning estimates into a repeatable, organized and robust estimating method,\" which has the potential to \"dramatically enhance medical mission planning\" [2]. By using this accredited tool, planners can utilize \"baselined, mission-centric PCOF data and tailor it to more precisely fit the anticipated mission,\" thereby informing decision-makers about the types of patient conditions they should prepare for [6].\nTo ensure its accuracy and relevance, the PCOF tool incorporates data from diverse sources. For example, combat PCOF tables were developed using data from Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom [5]. For humanitarian assistance scenarios, patient encounter data from Operations Continuing Promise and Pacific Partnership (2008–2011) were utilized [5].\n![A medical professional treats a young patient's foot, exemplifying a humanitarian assistance mission where PCOF would aid in medical resource planning.](image1)\nThe PCOF tool offers an \"effective, accurate and repeatable method of generating PCOF estimates using standardized and documented means of adjusting baseline distributions\" [9].

From its home port in San Diego, the USNS Mercy sailed in early May 2012 with a diverse crew including clinical staff, civil mariners, personnel from various U.S. military branches, NGOs, and members of 13 partner nation militaries [4]. The missions were conducted in Indonesia, the Philippines, Vietnam, and Cambodia. During these missions, \"more than 49,000 patients were seen and treated ashore,\" encompassing general adult and pediatric medical care, dental and vision screenings. Additionally, \"more than 900 surgeries\" were performed, and \"veterinarians treated and evaluated more than 7,000 livestock and domestic animals.\" The mission also involved \"engineering repairs, construction and community service donations\" and \"more than 60,000 hours during 62 subject-matter expert exchanges (SMEEs)\" on various health and disaster response topics [6].\n\nThe DoD Bone Marrow Program, on the other hand, focuses on providing life-saving marrow transplants for individuals suffering from marrow toxic injuries or other fatal diseases. The NMRC Bone Marrow Research Directorate supports this by providing \"military contingency support for causalities with marrow toxic injury due to radiation or chemical warfare agents\" and performing \"laboratory research that supports technology innovations to make highly reliable and cost-effective DNA-based typing for marrow transplants\" [1]. Donor drives, like the one at Marine Corps Base Hawaii, involve collecting oral swabs with cell samples [8].\n![A Marine in uniform uses an oral swab to collect cell samples for the DoD Marrow Donor Program.](image3)\nThese samples are then sent to the C.W.

He demonstrated that parents transmit discrete heritable factors, which we now call genes, to their offspring [7].\n\nIn a typical monohybrid cross, such as one between true-breeding purple-flowered pea plants and true-breeding white-flowered pea plants (Parental generation), Mendel observed that all offspring in the first filial (F1) generation exhibited purple flowers. This indicated that the trait for white flowers seemed to disappear in this generation [5].\n![Mendel's monohybrid cross showing purple flowers in P and F1 generation, and a 3:1 ratio of purple to white flowers in the F2 generation.](image5)\n\nThis observation is explained by the concept of dominant and recessive alleles. Alleles are alternative forms of a gene. For instance, on a chromosome, there are specific locations called gene loci where these alleles reside. One allele can be dominant, masking the effect of a recessive allele when both are present.\n![A chromosome with gene loci for P, a, and B, with one indicated as a dominant allele.](image1)\n\nWhen Mendel allowed the F1 generation plants (all purple-flowered) to self-pollinate, the white flower trait reappeared in the second filial (F2) generation. He found that approximately three-quarters of the F2 plants had purple flowers, and one-quarter had white flowers [5]. This is a 3:1 phenotypic ratio.\n\nTo understand these ratios, we look at the genotypes, which are the specific combinations of alleles an individual possesses. For example, an individual can be homozygous for the dominant allele (e.g., PP), homozygous for the recessive allele (e.g., aa), or heterozygous (e.g., Bb), carrying one of each [6].\n![Defines genotypes such as PP (homozygous for the dominant allele), aa (homozygous for the recessive allele), and Bb (heterozygous).](image3)\n\nMendelian inheritance explains these F2 ratios through the law of segregation, which states that allele pairs separate during gamete formation, and the random union of gametes during fertilization.\nIf 'P' represents the dominant allele for purple flowers and 'p' represents the recessive allele for white flowers:\n*   The parental (P) generation consisted of PP (purple) x pp (white) plants.\n*   The F1 generation plants were all heterozygous (Pp) and phenotypically purple because P is dominant over p.\n*   When F1 plants (Pp) self-pollinate, their gametes carry either a P or a p allele. The combination of these gametes in the F2 generation results in the following genotypic ratio: 1 PP : 2 Pp : 1 pp.\n*   Phenotypically, PP and Pp plants both have purple flowers, while pp plants have white flowers. This leads to the observed 3 purple : 1 white phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation.\n![Diagram explaining a monohybrid cross, showing parental (P) genotypes (PP x pp), F1 genotype (All Pp), and F2 genotypic (1 PP : 2 Pp : 1 pp) and phenotypic (3 purple : 1 white) ratios.](image4)\n\nMendelian inheritance explains the observed 3:1 phenotypic ratio and 1:2:1 genotypic ratio in the F2 generation of pea plants through the segregation of dominant and recessive alleles during gamete formation and their subsequent random combination during fertilization."}

For instance, the principle of **Continuity** states that elements of objects tend to be grouped together and integrated into perceptual wholes if they are aligned or form a continuous pattern. This allows us to follow individual lines on a graph as distinct entities, even when they intersect [2, 10]. Similarly, the principle of **Similarity** suggests that objects similar in attributes like color are perceived as belonging to a group, which helps us track a single data series represented by a consistently colored line [5].\n\nConsider the following multi-line graph:\n![A multi-line graph displays multiple data series, each denoted by a unique color, charting values from 0 to 70 across a timeline from June to December.](image4)\n\nObserving this graph, several trends emerge over the six-month period:\n*   **Overall Fluctuation:** Most lines display considerable month-to-month variability rather than a smooth, consistent trajectory. For example, the red line starts near 20 in June, spikes to around 60 in July, drops back to 20 in August, and then fluctuates for the remaining months.\n*   **Divergence and Intersection:** The various data series begin at different points in June. Their paths diverge, intersect frequently throughout the observed period, and conclude at different levels in December, indicating varied performance or changes across the entities being tracked.\n*   **Varied Individual Line Trends:**\n    *   Some lines exhibit an overall upward trend. For instance, the light green line, starting near 43 in June, experiences a dip in July but then generally rises, becoming one of the highest lines by December, finishing near 60.\n    *   Other lines show an overall downward trend. The dark blue line, for example, begins near 55 in June, peaks around 60 in July, and then generally declines to approximately 30 by December.\n    *   Several lines exhibit more complex patterns without a clear overall upward or downward movement, but rather a series of peaks and troughs, such as the yellow line which starts low, rises significantly, and then continues with notable fluctuations.\n*   **Lack of Uniformity:** There isn't a single, overarching trend (e.g., all lines increasing or all decreasing) that applies to all data series simultaneously. Each series appears to follow its own distinct pattern.\n\nThese interpretations are partly due to how our perception works to simplify complex visual information and identify patterns [7].\n\nThe multi-line graph shows varied trends over the six months, with most lines exhibiting significant fluctuations, diverging and intersecting paths, and no single uniform trend applicable to all data series."}

Meta descriptions are often used by search engines to generate the snippet displayed beneath the title in search results [1]. When these are not optimized, they may fail to attract users to click on the link, even if the page ranks well. Duplicate descriptions, in particular, represent missed opportunities to provide unique, compelling summaries for different pages.\n\nThe figures also indicate significant problems with structured markup:\n`![Image4 displays a table indicating a large volume of structured markup errors, with 72,441 items with errors for 'Blog' data type and 49,222 for 'Article' data type, both using schema.org.](image4)`\nStructured markup helps search engines understand the content on a page in more detail, which can lead to rich snippets (e.g., ratings, prices, event information) in search results. The high number of errors shown in the structured markup, particularly for blog and article content, means that search engines may struggle to correctly interpret this data or fail to display rich snippets for these pages. This can lead to lower visibility and CTR compared to competitors whose structured data is correctly implemented. The need for valid markup is critical for search engines to process this information effectively [4].\n\nThe depicted meta description issues and structured markup errors can negatively impact SEO performance by reducing click-through rates from search results and hindering search engines' ability to understand and feature content effectively."}

This aligns with the statement that \"A Silo ed Approach is the Greatest Barrier to Adoption of a Customer Management Approach\" [3].\n\nFurthermore, \"Adoption barriers relate to management & culture, not data & technology!\" [2]. This highlights that people and processes are critical, as underscored by the \"90-10 Rule! 90% about People Invest in people, skills, roles, responsibilities processes!!\" [2].\n\nOther key barriers include:\n*   **Metric-related issues**: Organizations often use \"The wrong metrics-too much focus on reach and not enough on engagement\" [6]. Traditional marketing and measurement often fail to address or indicate the engagement of an individual or capture sentiment and affinity [8]. This is compounded by \"Drowning in data-looking at way too much data which is ultimately not insightful and actionable\" [6].\n*   **Lack of a holistic view**: Many marketers have \"No 360 degree view,\" looking at tactical metrics in isolation instead of a complete picture of all activities and customer behavior [6]. The customer journey is complex, resembling \"a complex network of detours, backalleys, alternate entry and exit points, external influences, and alternative resources,\" which traditional linear models ignore [9].\n*   **Process and resource deficiencies**: A lack of \"No processes, no clear roles & responsibilities and a lack of skilled resources\" is a common problem [6].\n*   **Attribution challenges**: A specific instance of flawed metrics is seen in attribution models. \"One of the key problems across marketing...is that far too much, or all performance attribution of marketing campaigns...is being given to the First Click or Last Click\" [4].\n```markdown\n![A bar chart shows that attributing activity to the most recent touch point (52%) is the most common method of attribution.](image5)\n```\nAs indicated, 52% attribute activity to the most recent touchpoint, which doesn't reflect the true impact of various interactions across the customer journey [image5].\n\nIn summary, the major barriers to adopting an integrated customer management approach are organizational silos, a lack of unified ownership, cultural resistance, inadequate or improperly focused metrics, and insufficient processes or resources."}

The term \"Gestalt\" itself is German for \"shape, form\" [9]. The design of the word 'GESTALT' in the provided image effectively illustrates several of these principles.\n\n![The word 'GESTALT' is visually designed to demonstrate various Gestalt principles such as segregation, proximity, similarity, closure, continuity, Prägnanz, and unity.](image1)\n\nThe image above showcases how different Gestalt laws of grouping are applied within the typography of the word \"GESTALT\". Let's explore some of these:\n\n1.  **Closure**: The principle of closure suggests that we tend to perceive incomplete objects as whole by mentally filling in the missing parts [10]. In the image, the letter 'G' is not fully drawn; it is formed by the letter 'C' and an implied continuation. Our perception completes the shape to see a 'G'. This is highlighted by the \"Fechamento\" (Closure) label pointing to the 'G'.\n\n2.  **Proximity**: According to the principle of proximity, objects that are close to each other are perceived as belonging to a group [2]. The red squares forming part of the letter 'S' are grouped together because of their closeness, as indicated by the \"Proximidade\" (Proximity) label. Similarly, the individual letters 'G', 'E', 'S', 'T', 'A', 'L', 'T' are placed near each other to form a single word.\n\n3.  **Similarity**: The principle of similarity states that objects similar in characteristics like shape or color are grouped together [5]. In the design, the letters 'T', 'A', 'L', and 'T' share a similar striped pattern. This visual similarity groups them together, as pointed out by the \"Semelhança\" (Similarity) label.\n\n4.  **Continuity**: The law of continuity suggests that elements of objects tend to be grouped together, and organized based on their tendency to maintain a continuous direction [4]. The pink vertical line passing through the letter 'S' illustrates this, as our eyes tend to follow this line smoothly through the letter, as indicated by the \"Continuidade\" (Continuity) label.\n\nThese principles demonstrate how our minds organize visual information to create meaningful perceptions, which is a core idea in Gestalt theory [3].\n\nThe design of the word 'GESTALT' visually demonstrates Gestalt principles such as closure, proximity, similarity, and continuity to form a cohesive and meaningful whole."}

Interestingly, the direct use of the intranet for \"Access to Patient Clinical Information\" is expected to decrease (from 53% today to 45% in two years), as is \"Physician Access for Clinical Orders\" (from 57% to 44%).\n\nThese changes suggest that while the intranet will become more crucial for organizational communication and resource sharing, the direct handling of specific clinical data and order entry might be transitioning, perhaps to more specialized systems like EMR/EHR or CPOE systems [2]. The current system often fragments patient information [5], and future systems aim to consolidate information and unify efforts [1].\n\n![The top Health IT staffing needs in 2006 include Network Support, Clinical Informaticists, Process/Workflow Design, and Application Support.](image3)\nCurrent Health IT staffing needs for 2006 [4] highlight a demand for \"Network Support\" (27%), \"Clinical Informaticists\" (24%), \"Process/Workflow Design\" (24%), \"Application Support\" (22%), \"Clinical Transformation\" (19%), \"Programmers\" (16%), and \"Systems Integration\" (15%).\n\nThe increased reliance on the intranet for communication, policies, and resource tools directly correlates with the need for strong \"Network Support\" to ensure the platform is robust and accessible, and \"Application Support\" for the various tools and functionalities hosted on the intranet.\n\nIf the decrease in using the general intranet for \"Access to Patient Clinical Information\" and \"Physician Access for Clinical Orders\" indicates a shift towards more dedicated clinical systems, then the staffing needs for \"Clinical Informaticists,\" \"Process/Workflow Design,\" \"Application Support\" (for these specialized systems), \"Systems Integration\" (to connect these systems with the broader IT infrastructure), and \"Clinical Transformation\" become critical. These roles are essential for designing, implementing, integrating, and managing the adoption of more sophisticated systems that handle sensitive patient data and clinical ordering, aligning with the goal to create a future system that consolidates information [1].\n\nThe expected evolution of intranet functions, emphasizing administrative and communication tasks while potentially shifting direct clinical access to more specialized platforms, directly aligns with and necessitates the prominent Health IT staffing needs identified, such as network support for the intranet itself and clinical informatics and systems integration for the broader evolving clinical IT landscape."}

Many performance attributions for marketing campaigns, especially those with digital components, are overly credited to the First Click or, more commonly, the Last Click [1]. Sadly, too much performance attribution is given to the Last Click, which often involves Paid Search (PPC) or Organic Search (SEO) [2]. This over-attribution to the last click, such as paid search, is a noted problem [5]. For instance, if a customer types in a branded search term like \"Commonwealth Bank Home Loans,\" it's because they've already been exposed to other marketing efforts, yet those other efforts receive no credit because the last click (PPC or SEO) gets all the attribution [8]. This means that marketers are often miscalculating attribution for transactions more than half the time [3].\n\nThe most common method marketers use to calculate attribution for a transaction is attributing it to the most recent touchpoint or last click."}

A value of +10 for the first unit is consistent with these principles. While the tables within Image1 provide specific utility schedules for hot dogs (for example, the \"Diminishing marginal utility\" table shows +6 utility for the first hot dog, and the \"Differential outcome\" table shows 0 utility for the first), the question's \"+10 utility\" serves as a characteristic of the type of item on the plate, not a requirement that this exact value must be present in the accompanying tables within the image.\n\nThe man in the photograph is wearing a t-shirt.

This economic principle is known as diminishing marginal utility. For example, the first hot dog consumed might provide a high level of satisfaction, but each subsequent hot dog offers progressively less utility.\n![A table demonstrates diminishing marginal utility, showing utility decreasing from +10 for the first hot dog to -10 for the sixth.](image4)\nAs illustrated in this table, the utility gained from the first hot dog is +10. However, the second hot dog only adds +4 to utility, the third adds 0, and consuming a fourth hot dog actually results in negative utility (-1), indicating that it makes the consumer worse off [image4].\n\nThis pattern of declining satisfaction with increased consumption is a common observation. Another example further demonstrates this:\n![A table illustrates diminishing marginal utility in hot dog consumption, with utility per hot dog decreasing from +6 for the first to -50 for the 66th.](image5)\nIn this table (left side, \"Diminishing marginal utility\"), the first hot dog provides +6 utility, but by the 66th hot dog, the utility derived from consuming that additional unit is -50, indicating a strong negative experience [image5].\n\nThis principle of diminishing marginal utility has direct implications for consumption behavior. \"Variety is important because diminishing marginal utility changes preferences. When enjoyment drops we should switch to another choice\" [9]. This means that as the enjoyment or utility from consuming more units of the same item (like hot dogs) decreases, individuals are naturally inclined to stop consuming that item and seek out other options to maximize their overall satisfaction. Indeed, \"In standard consumption economics focusing is often bad\" [4], partly because of this diminishing utility experienced with repeated consumption of the same good.\n\nTherefore, the utility from each additional hot dog consumed generally decreases, which implies that consumers will typically stop consuming an item and seek variety when the additional enjoyment they get from it significantly diminishes or becomes negative."}

It's also advised to soften remnants of burnt food in pans. However, rinsing dishes under running water is not necessary [5]. When loading, it's recommended to load the lower basket first, then the upper one [6]. Ensure not to overload your dishwasher, as this is important for good results and reasonable energy consumption [10].\n\n**Lower Basket Loading:**\nThe lower basket is primarily for larger and more difficult-to-clean items. This includes pots, pans, lids, serving dishes, and bowls [3].\n```\n![image5 illustrates the arrangement of items like an oven pot (7), dessert plates (8), dinner plates (9), soup plates (10), an oval platter (11), melamine dessert plates (12), melamine bowls (13), and a small pot (14) in the lower basket.](image5)\n```\nIt is preferable to place serving dishes and lids on the side of the racks to avoid blocking the rotation of the top spray arm [3]. Plates placed in front of the detergent dispenser should have a maximum diameter of $19\\,\\mathsf{c m}$ to prevent hampering the opening of the dispenser [3].\n\n**Upper Basket Loading:**\nThe upper basket is designed to hold more delicate and lighter dishware such as glasses, coffee, and tea cups [10].\n```\n![image1 shows an example of how to load the upper basket with items like cups (1), saucers (2), glasses (3), mugs (4), a glass bowl (5), and dessert bowls (6).](image1)\n```\nLoad hollow items such as cups and glasses with the opening facing downwards so that water cannot collect in the container or a deep base [10]. Any curved items, or ones with recesses, should be loaded aslant so that water can run off effectively [10]. To avoid damage, ensure that glasses do not touch one another [10].\n\n**Cutlery Loading:**\nWhen loading cutlery, there are specific safety and cleaning considerations. Knives and other utensils with sharp points must be loaded in the basket with their points facing down or placed in a horizontal position [9].\n```\n![image4 displays an arrangement for various cutlery items in a designated basket, including spoons (1, 4, 5, 6, 8), forks (2, 7), and knives (3).](image4)\n```\nLong and/or sharp items of cutlery, such as carving knives, must be positioned horizontally in the upper basket [10]. All utensils should be stacked securely so they cannot tip over, and placed in such a way that the spray arms can rotate freely during washing. Dishes and items of cutlery must not lie inside one another or cover each other [10].\n\n**Potential Consequences of Improper Loading:**\nImproperly loading the dishwasher can lead to several negative outcomes:\n*   **Reduced Cleaning Performance**: If items block the spray arms [3, 10] or cover each other [10], they will not be cleaned thoroughly. Similarly, if the detergent dispenser is hampered by oversized plates, detergent distribution will be affected [3].\n*   **Water Collection**: Hollow items not faced downwards will collect water [10].\n*   **Damage to Dishware or Dishwasher**: Glasses touching each other can lead to damage [10]. Sharp items improperly loaded can damage the door seal [9].\n*   **Inefficient Operation**: Overloading the dishwasher leads to poor results and unreasonable energy consumption [10].\n*   **Safety Hazards/Appliance Damage**: Placing heavy objects on or standing on the open door can cause the appliance to tip forward [9].\n\nDishes and cutlery should be arranged to ensure proper water circulation and detergent access, with specific placements for different item types and sizes to prevent damage and ensure effective cleaning; improper loading can lead to poor wash results, damage to items or the dishwasher, and inefficient operation."}

Based on these inputs, the ECU controls the opening of the injectors [1], managing fuel delivery to the engine. Electronic Fuel Injection systems utilize these engine sensors and the control module (ECU) to regulate the opening and closing of the injector valve [3].\n\nFurthermore, the ECU has other critical functions:\n*   **Idle Speed Control**: The ECU monitors the engine RPM via the crankshaft position sensor, which is crucial for engine timing functions for fuel injection, spark events, and valve timing, thereby controlling the idle speed [5].\n*   **Ignition Timing Control**: The ECU can adjust the exact timing of the spark to initiate combustion, optimizing for better power and economy [6].\n\nThe ECU acts as the brain of the engine, processing sensor data to precisely control fuel injection and ignition timing for optimal engine performance."}

Variety becomes important because \"when enjoyment drops we should switch to another choice\" [3]. For example, consider the everyday enjoyment of eating a hot dog:\n\n![A young girl enjoys eating a hot dog.](image2)\n\nThe initial enjoyment might be high, but with each subsequent hot dog, the pleasure lessens. This is illustrated by a general utility model for hot dog consumption:\n\n![A table shows that the utility from consuming hot dogs decreases with each additional hot dog, eventually becoming negative.](image4)\n\nHere, the utility from the first hot dog is +10, but by the fourth, it's -1, indicating disutility [4].\n\nHowever, in a competitive context, the utility calculation can change dramatically. While the physical act of consuming many hot dogs might still be subject to diminishing (or even negative) marginal utility from a purely sensory perspective, the \"cumulative effect of focus may be good\" [10] when aiming for a specific outcome. The drive for \"competitive mastery\" [5] or an \"improved activity outcome\" [7] can override the diminishing pleasure of consumption itself.\n\nConsider a competitive hot dog eating contest:\n\n![Joey Chestnut competes in a hot dog eating contest, with tables showing diminishing marginal utility versus utility derived from differential outcomes in competition.](image5)\n\nIn this scenario, while the utility from each hot dog in isolation might follow a diminishing pattern (as seen in the left table of image5, where the 66th hot dog yields -50 utility), the utility derived from achieving a competitive milestone, like tying or winning, can be immense. The right table in image5, \"Differential outcome,\" shows utility dramatically increasing to +5000 and +10000 for the 64th and 65th hot dogs respectively, because these are linked to the specific outcome of tying and then surpassing a competitor for the championship [5]. This illustrates how \"focused practice may result in increased utility due to... Improved activity outcome\" [7].\n\nIn standard consumption, diminishing marginal utility leads to decreased enjoyment and a desire for variety, whereas in competitive contexts, the utility can increase dramatically based on achieving specific outcomes, even if the act itself becomes less pleasurable."}

This stage is explicitly part of the lead funnel progression, tracking how many MQLs are accepted by sales [4].\n\nOne dataset provides a specific instance of this conversion rate:\n![Image4 shows a sales funnel dashboard with a 1.50% MQL to SAL conversion rate among other metrics.](image4)\nThis dashboard reveals an MQL to SAL conversion rate of 1.50%. This means that out of all the leads marketing qualified, only 1.50% were accepted by the sales team for further action.\n\nFor comparison, another dataset offers benchmark percentages for various stages in a sales and marketing funnel:\n![Image5 outlines benchmark percentages for key sales funnel stages, indicating Sales Accepted Leads (SALs) typically range from 45% to 75%.](image5)\nIn this benchmark data, the \"Sales Accepted Leads (SALs)\" stage shows a typical range of 45% to 75%. Interpreting this as the conversion rate from the preceding MQL stage, it suggests that a healthy MQL to SAL conversion rate would fall within this range.\n\nComparing the observed 1.50% MQL to SAL conversion rate from the first dataset (Image4) with the benchmark range of 45% to 75% (Image5) highlights a significant performance gap. The implications of this low conversion rate are manifold:\n\n*   **Poor MQL Quality or Misalignment**: A 1.50% MQL to SAL rate strongly suggests that the leads marketing deems \"qualified\" are not meeting sales' criteria or expectations. This could stem from an inadequate or poorly defined MQL definition, or a fundamental misalignment between the marketing and sales departments on what constitutes a sales-ready lead.\n*   **Ineffective Lead Scoring**: Lead scoring is designed to rank a prospect's interest and sales readiness, and when a lead's score reaches a certain threshold, they are considered an MQL and passed to sales [1]. If the MQL to SAL conversion is extremely low, it indicates that the lead scoring methodology [1] may be flawed—either the scoring criteria do not accurately predict sales readiness, or the threshold for MQL status is set too low, resulting in premature handoffs.\n*   **Wasted Resources and Inefficiency**: When sales accepts only a tiny fraction of MQLs, it means the sales team's time is being wasted evaluating and rejecting leads that are not truly ready. This also implies that marketing efforts and budget spent on generating these MQLs are not translating effectively into sales pipeline, indicating significant inefficiency in the lead management process.\n*   **Potential Flaws in Handoff Process**: Beyond lead quality, the process of transferring leads from marketing to sales could also be a contributing factor. Issues in the handoff mechanism, lack of timely follow-up, or poor communication can lead to leads being overlooked or improperly dispositioned by sales.\n\nThe MQL to SAL conversion rate from one dataset is 1.50%, which is substantially lower than the benchmark range of 45%-75% suggested by another dataset, indicating significant issues in lead qualification quality, alignment between marketing and sales, or the lead scoring process."}
