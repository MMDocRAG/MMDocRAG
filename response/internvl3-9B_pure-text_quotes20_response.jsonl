Among those with at least a college degree, 31% believe neither party has high ethical standards, while 43% think one party does and the other does not, and 17% think both do [10].

This trend is consistent across demographics, but older and less educated groups are more critical, as seen in [3] and [11].\n\nPolitical affiliations also play a role in these perceptions.

However, [12] shows that positive ratings of government efforts have declined across the political spectrum, with Democrats now the only group where a majority (64%) still rates the government's performance positively, down from 85% in January.\n\n![image4](image4) further breaks down these differences, showing that Republicans and independents have seen a significant drop in positive ratings, while Democrats remain more supportive.

This indicates a stark partisan divide in strategies to combat terrorism.\n\nOn the economic front, **Democrats** are more concerned with economic issues, with 34% prioritizing the economy compared to 23% of Republicans and 28% of Independents [7]. This suggests that economic concerns are more prominent among Democrats, possibly reflecting their focus on domestic policies and social welfare. The survey also shows that Democrats are more likely to believe that anti-terrorism policies have gone too far in restricting civil liberties, with 41% holding this view, compared to 71% of Republicans who think policies have not gone far enough [10].

This aligns with the general trend of older Americans expressing more concern about China-related issues and prioritizing limiting China's power and influence.\n\nFurthermore, confidence in the Chinese leadership plays a role in shaping these opinions. As seen in the data, older Americans and Republicans tend to have less confidence in Xi Jinping, with 53% of those aged 65 and older and 35% of Republicans having no confidence at all in him. This lack of confidence likely contributes to their support for limiting Chinese students, as they perceive these students as part of China's broader influence and dominance strategy.

For instance, college graduates are substantially more likely to say that technology has made their work more interesting (64% vs. 38% for those with high school diplomas or less) and has increased their opportunities for career advancement (53% vs. 32% for high school graduates or less) [1, 2, 9, 10, 12]. This trend is evident in the bar chart in image1, which shows that higher education levels correlate with a greater perception of work becoming more interesting and opportunities for advancement.\n\nConversely, workers without a college education are less likely to express positive attitudes towards current workforce technologies. They report fewer positive impacts on their jobs and careers, with only 32% feeling that technology has increased their opportunities for advancement compared to 53% of college graduates [11]. This disparity is also reflected in image6, which illustrates the perceived impact of various technologies, showing that a higher percentage of college graduates report positive impacts compared to those with less education.\n\nAdditionally, the survey highlights that younger adults and other specific demographic groups are impacted by workforce automation at higher than average levels. For example, the age group of 18-24 has a higher percentage of individuals who lost a job or had their pay or hours reduced (6% lost a job, 11% had pay or hours reduced) compared to the overall U.S. adult population (2% lost a job, 5% had pay or hours reduced) [3, 6]. This is visualized in image3, which provides a detailed breakdown of job and pay impacts across different age groups.\n\nFurthermore, the likelihood of different jobs being affected by automation varies. For instance, fast food workers and insurance claims processors are more likely to perceive a significant impact compared to software engineers or nurses [4, 5]. This is depicted in image4, which shows the NET likelihood of various professions being affected by automation, with fast food workers having the highest perceived impact.\n\nIn"}

According to the provided data, both men and women prioritize flexibility to balance work and family obligations, with 71% of men and 76% of women valuing this characteristic, though the difference is not significant. However, there are notable differences in other areas:\n\n- **Opportunities for Promotion and High Pay:** Men in STEM value these more than women. 57% of men and 46% of women prioritize opportunities for promotion, and 59% of men and 48% of women value high-paying jobs. This suggests that men may perceive career advancement and financial rewards as more important, potentially impacting their career choices and satisfaction.\n\n- **Jobs Helping Others:** Women in STEM place a higher value on jobs that help others, with 59% valuing this characteristic compared to 31% of men. This reflects a greater emphasis on societal contribution and meaningful work, which could be a significant factor in women's decisions to pursue or remain in STEM fields.\n\nThe perceived difficulties faced by women in entering the STEM workforce are closely tied to these values. Women are more likely to experience discrimination and perceive gender as a barrier to success, as highlighted in the image showing that 62% of Black women and 40% of Black men reported experiencing discrimination, with race/ethnicity being a significant barrier for Black respondents. Additionally, women are more inclined to consider gender discrimination a major reason for the underrepresentation of women in STEM, as noted in the text quotes.\n\nThe emphasis on jobs that help others and the perceived lack of encouragement from an early age (cited by 39% of Americans as a major reason for the underrepresentation of women in STEM) further illustrate the challenges women face. The lack of female role models and the stereotype that women are less likely to succeed in STEM contribute to the perception that the field is less welcoming and less supportive of women's career goals.\n\n![image7](image7) illustrates these differences in job values, showing that while both genders value flexibility, women place a higher"}

For women, discrimination in recruitment, hiring, and promotions is a major concern, with 39% of women in STEM jobs citing this as a major reason for the lack of gender diversity [3]. Additionally, a lack of encouragement to pursue STEM from an early age is also a significant factor, affecting both women and minority groups [7]. Women are more likely to value characteristics such as making a meaningful contribution to society and having a job focused on helping others, which may influence their career choices [image2].\n\nFor blacks and Hispanics, limited access to quality education is a primary barrier, with 72% of blacks in STEM jobs and 42% of Hispanics in STEM jobs identifying this as a major reason for underrepresentation [1, 4]. Discrimination in recruitment, hiring, and promotions is also a significant issue, with 72% of blacks and 43% of Hispanics in STEM jobs highlighting it as a major factor [2, 10]. The lack of encouragement to pursue STEM from an early age is another key reason, affecting both groups [7].\n\nThe differences in perceptions are evident in how each group prioritizes these factors. Women in STEM place more emphasis on the importance of a job's societal impact and helping others, while blacks and Hispanics focus more on educational access and discrimination in the hiring process. The data from image3 further illustrates these differences, showing that while women and minority groups share concerns about early encouragement and discrimination, the specific reasons they prioritize vary.\n\nIn summary, while both women, blacks, and Hispanics face challenges related to discrimination and early encouragement, the primary reasons differ slightly, with educational access being a more significant concern for blacks and Hispanics compared to women.

According to the data from image6, 36% of STEM workers hold a bachelor's degree, while only 21% of non-STEM workers do. Additionally, 29% of STEM workers have a postgraduate degree, compared to 12% of non-STEM workers. This educational disparity is evident in the employment sectors they predominantly work in.\n\nImage4 provides insights into the distribution of employment types across various job categories. STEM workers are more likely to be employed in the private, for-profit sector, with 66% working there, compared to 66% of all employed individuals. However, within STEM fields, there are variations. For instance, engineers (82%) and computer workers (77%) are the most likely to work in the private, for-profit sector, while healthcare practitioners and technicians (58%) have a higher percentage working in the not-for-profit sector.\n\nNon-STEM workers also predominantly work in the private, for-profit sector (66%), but they have a higher percentage working in government (15%) compared to STEM workers (13%). This suggests that while both groups are similarly distributed in the private sector, non-STEM workers are more likely to be employed in government roles.\n\nThe educational attainment of STEM workers, as shown in image6, contributes to their higher likelihood of working in specialized and often higher-paying sectors like engineering and computer work, which are predominantly private, for-profit. In contrast, non-STEM workers, with a lower percentage holding advanced degrees, are more evenly distributed across sectors, including government and not-for-profit roles.\n\nIn summary, the higher education levels among STEM-employed individuals correlate with their predominant employment in the private, for-profit sector, particularly in specialized fields like engineering and computer work, whereas non-STEM workers, with lower educational attainment, are more evenly distributed across sectors, including government and not-for-profit roles.\n\n![STEM and non-STEM employment sectors](image4)"}

This is starkly contrasted by the experiences of women in STEM jobs, where 50% report gender-related discrimination, with the most common forms including earning less than a man doing the same job (29%) and being treated as if they were not competent (29%).\n\n![image1](image1) highlights these disparities, showing that Black respondents experience higher levels of discrimination and perceive race/ethnicity as a barrier to success more frequently than other groups. The chart also indicates that Black respondents feel their workplaces pay insufficient attention to diversity issues, with 57% reporting this, compared to 15% of White respondents.\n\nIn terms of gender-based discrimination, women in STEM jobs face challenges such as being treated as if they are not competent and receiving less support from senior leaders.

Among self-identified Hispanics, 39% report feeling discriminated against due to their background, with 42% of first-generation immigrants and 38% of second-generation Latinos experiencing discrimination often or sometimes. This rate decreases to 29% for third or higher generations, indicating a decline in discrimination perception with each subsequent generation [2], [4].\n\nRacial identification also shifts with generational changes. The majority of self-identified Hispanics (70%) see themselves as Hispanic or Latino, but this percentage drops to 46% among third or higher generations [image3]. Conversely, the percentage of self-identified non-Hispanics increases from 7% among first-generation immigrants to 25% among third or higher generations [image3]. This trend suggests a fading of Hispanic identity and a growing perception of whiteness as one moves further from the immigrant experience [3], [6].\n\nThe connection to Hispanic heritage diminishes with each generation. Foreign-born Hispanics feel the most connected (82%), while third or higher generations report only 44% feeling connected [image4]. This decline in connection correlates with a decrease in perceived discrimination, as higher generations are more likely to be seen as white by others [image3], [9].\n\nIn summary, as Hispanics assimilate into American society, their perception of discrimination decreases, and their racial identification shifts towards whiteness, reflecting broader societal trends and generational adaptation [image3], [4], [6], [7], [8], [11], [12].\n\n![The image shows a bar chart illustrating the racial identification of self-identified Hispanics and non-Hispanics, highlighting the shift from Hispanic or Latino to white identification across generations.](image3)"}

However, these preferences vary across generations. Image2 highlights that foreign-born Hispanics are more likely to often self-identify as Hispanic (57%), compared to second-generation (50%) and third or higher generation (33%) individuals. This trend reflects a shift towards a stronger U.S. national identity among later generations, as noted in text quote [7], where the share of those using \"American\" rises from 7% among immigrants to 56% among the third generation.\n\nLanguage use also varies by generation. Image4 shows that while 71% of self-identified Hispanics do not speak Spanish, this percentage increases significantly among the second (84%) and third or higher generations (92%). Text quote [4] supports this, stating that even among immigrant Latinos, a majority (58%) believe speaking Spanish is not required to be considered Latino, and this view is even more prevalent among U.S.-born Latinos. This trend is further illustrated in image6, which shows that the frequency of speaking Spanish often decreases with each generation.\n\nAdditionally, image3 reveals that reasons for not identifying as Hispanic include not speaking Spanish or having no cultural link, which are less relevant for third or higher generation Hispanics. Text quote [9] confirms that connections with ancestral national origins decline as immigrant roots become more distant, with only 44% of the third generation feeling connected to their family’s country of origin.\n\nIn summary, generational differences lead to a gradual shift from a strong connection to ancestral origins and Spanish language use to a stronger identification with American identity and a reduced reliance on Spanish language and cultural markers. This is evident in the changing self-identification terms and language proficiency across generations.\n\n![Self-identification terms among Hispanics](image1)  \n![Frequency of self-identification by generation](image2)  "}

This shift is evident in the increasing percentage of young Arabs who prioritize modern values over traditional ones, as seen in text quotes [2], [3], [6], and [9]. For instance, the statement \"We want to embrace modern values\" reflects a clear trend towards modernization. However, traditional values continue to hold substantial influence, as highlighted in quotes [8] and [12], where individuals express a desire to preserve these values for future generations.\n\nThe image data provides further insights into this evolution. Image1, a bar chart from 2014, likely illustrates the distribution of opinions across different countries, showing varying levels of agreement with modern values. The split segments in the chart suggest a comparison between traditional and modern perspectives, with countries like Egypt, Jordan, and the UAE showing significant segments of both traditional and modern views. This indicates a nuanced landscape where both values coexist and influence opinions.\n\nImage4, a stacked bar chart from 2011 to 2014, shows a trend of decreasing red segments (possibly representing traditional values) and increasing orange segments (modern values), suggesting a gradual shift towards modernity over the years. This trend aligns with the text quotes that emphasize the growing embrace of modern values.\n\nImage8, a horizontal bar chart comparing influence in 2013 and 2014, reveals a decline in the influence of traditional groups such as parents and family, while modern influences like social media/bloggers and music gain traction.

This high energy consumption is largely driven by the transportation sector, which accounts for 24% of CO2 emissions globally [12]. The bubble chart [3] further illustrates that the USA has the largest bubble, indicating a significant share in global motor vehicle demand and a high number of motor vehicles per 1,000 people. This suggests that the USA's high motor vehicle ownership contributes substantially to its CO2 emissions.\n\nChina, on the other hand, has a large share in global motor vehicle demand but a lower number of motor vehicles per 1,000 people compared to the USA [3]. This indicates rapid growth in vehicle ownership, which is expected to lead to rising GHG emissions from passenger vehicles [10]. The energy consumption per capita in China is 597 kg oil equivalent [6], which is much lower than the USA but still substantial.\n\nGermany, with a moderate share in global motor vehicle demand and a relatively high number of motor vehicles per 1,000 people [3], has an energy consumption per capita of 4017 kg oil equivalent [6].

This is supported by the image of a bar chart (image1) that compares venture investments and exits across different European regions. The chart shows that while investments are lower in Europe (e.g., Germany, UK, France, and other regions), the exits are significantly higher, indicating a higher return on investment. For instance, Germany invested $0.8 billion but exited with $4.4 billion, showcasing a strong exit performance despite lower initial investments.\n\nAdditionally, the text emphasizes that European VC has emerged with strong fundamentals, benefiting from higher capital efficiency compared to the US.

One of the key components of this framework is the **Problem Formulator**, which converts natural language descriptions of problems into symbolic representations. For deductive reasoning, the paper utilizes the **Pyke** expert system, which operates on the logic programming language. The Pyke system is designed to create a knowledge base from known facts and rules, and then apply forward- and backward-chaining algorithms to infer new facts and substantiate the goal. This integration allows the framework to leverage the natural language understanding strengths of LLMs while ensuring logical faithfulness through symbolic reasoning.\n\n![LOGIC-LM Framework Overview](image1)\n\nIn the LOGIC-LM framework, as depicted in Figure 1, the **Problem Formulator** stage involves translating the problem and goal into a symbolic formulation. The **Symbolic Reasoner** then performs inference on this formulation using deterministic algorithms. The **Result Interpreter** translates the symbolic result back into natural language. The framework also includes a **Self-Refine** component that iteratively refines the symbolic formulation using feedback from the symbolic solver to improve accuracy.\n\nThe use of the Pyke system for deductive reasoning is crucial as it provides a structured approach to logical inference, ensuring that the reasoning process adheres to well-defined rules and principles. This complements the probabilistic nature of LLMs, which can sometimes lead to unfaithful reasoning, by providing a transparent and reliable method for solving logical problems.\n\nIn summary, the symbolic solver used for the logic programming module in the LOGIC-LM framework is the **Pyke** expert system, as shown in the flowchart in image1.\n\n**Answer:** The symbolic solver used for the logic programming module in the LOGIC-LM framework is the Pyke expert system."}

BiDAF and FastQA are both LSTM-based extractive QA models that have shown robust performance across several datasets. However, their performance varies significantly when evaluated on multi-document settings like WikiHop and MedHop. The text highlights that BiDAF is overall stronger across both datasets, particularly due to its iterative latent interactions, which are more beneficial for tasks where information is distributed across documents. In contrast, FastQA, with fewer latent interactions, struggles more with integrating cross-document information.\n\nThe image quotes further elucidate these findings. Image3 presents a table that compares the performance of BiDAF, BiDAF mask, FastQA, and FastQA mask on WikiHop and MedHop under standard and gold chain conditions. Under the standard condition, BiDAF achieves higher scores than FastQA on both datasets. For WikiHop, BiDAF scores 42.9% and 49.7% on the test and test* conditions, respectively, while FastQA scores 25.7% and 27.2%. On MedHop, BiDAF scores 47.8% and 61.2%, whereas FastQA scores 23.1% and 24.5%.

According to the text quotes, positional encodings play a crucial role in maintaining spatial information within the model. For instance, the removal of spatial positional encodings leads to a substantial drop in Average Precision (AP), as seen in the results presented in Table 3 [8]. The table compares different configurations, such as passing positional encodings at the decoder input versus adding them at every decoder attention layer. The baseline model, which uses fixed sine positional encodings at every attention layer in both the encoder and decoder, achieves the highest AP scores. When spatial positional encodings are not used, there is a noticeable decrease in AP, highlighting their importance in the model's performance.\n\nAdditionally, the text quotes mention that learned embeddings are shared across all layers, and output positional encodings are always learned. This suggests that the choice of how and where positional encodings are applied can affect the model's ability to generalize and detect objects accurately. The results indicate that passing positional encodings directly in attention leads to better performance compared to passing them once at the decoder input.\n\nFurthermore, the text quotes discuss the impact of the loss components, particularly the set-based loss used in DETR, which eliminates the need for non-maximum suppression (NMS) by design. The analysis in Figure 4 [11] shows that NMS improves performance for the predictions from the first decoder but diminishes as the depth increases. This is because early layers may not compute cross-correlations between output elements, leading to multiple predictions for the same object, while deeper layers benefit from self-attention mechanisms that inhibit duplicate predictions.\n\nThe visualization in Figure 7 [4] supports this by showing that each slot in the DETR decoder learns to specialize on certain areas and box sizes, with a mode for predicting large image-wide boxes common in the COCO dataset. This specialization is likely enhanced by the effective use of positional encodings and the set-based loss, contributing to the model's overall performance.\n\nIn summary, the configuration of positional encodings and the set-based loss in DETR-DC5 are critical for achieving high AP scores.

For instance, using 5 demonstrations with logical constraints on MAVEN-ERE achieved a 25.7% performance, surpassing 10 demonstrations without logical constraints (24.5%). This highlights the importance of both \"What\" (demonstrations) and \"How\" (logical constraints).\n   - **Text Quote [8]**: Adding relevant logic directly improves model performance on both MAVEN-ERE and Proof Writer. However, irrelevant logic can cause fluctuations, indicating the necessity of obtaining pertinent logic for optimal results.\n   - **Image1**: The left graph shows that models with logical constraints (w. lc) consistently outperform those without (w/o. lc) as the number of demonstrations increases. The right graph demonstrates a decreasing trend in logical inconsistency with iterations, suggesting that logical constraints enhance consistency.\n\n2. **Impact of Demonstration Samples**:\n   - **Text Quote [1]**: Initial improvements are evident as the number of demonstrations increases from 1 to 5, but subsequent increases (e.g., ≥10) yield limited gains. This suggests a saturation point beyond which additional demonstrations do not significantly enhance performance.\n   - **Text Quote [12]**: Incorporating logical constraints into prompts can achieve better performance with fewer demonstrations, indicating a balance between demonstrations and logical constraints is crucial.\n   - **Image1**: The left graph illustrates that while increasing demonstrations improves performance, the gains diminish after a certain point. The right graph shows that logical inconsistency decreases with iterations, supporting the effectiveness of logical constraints.\n\n3. **Model Performance Comparison**:\n   - **Image3**: Vicuna-13B-PT and Llama2-13B-PT show significant improvements with CoT and logical constraints, achieving the highest Micro-F1 scores and lowest Logical Inconsistency percentages.

For instance, [1] mentions that retrieval-based approaches reduce logical inconsistency and improve performance. [6] highlights that adding logical constraints to prompts provides stable improvements, even with fewer demonstrations. [7] further emphasizes that directly conveying constraints to LLMs is more effective than post-processing operations. [12] notes that incorporating relevant logic into LLM instructions helps solve reasoning tasks, though obtaining and utilizing this logic remains challenging.\n\nThe image quotes provide visual evidence of these findings. Image1 shows a table comparing model performance with logical constraints, retrieved logical constraints, and post-processing. It indicates that models with logical constraints generally have lower logical inconsistency percentages compared to those with post-processing. Image7 presents a detailed comparison of Vicuna-13B-PT and Llama2-13B-PT, showing that models trained with logical constraints achieve higher Micro-F1 scores and lower Logical Inconsistency percentages, especially when post-processing is applied.\n\nImage4 illustrates the approaches of generative, retrieval, and pretraining methods, demonstrating how logical constraints refine LLM outputs. Image6 shows graphs where logical constraints lead to improved Micro-F1 scores and reduced logical inconsistency over iterations. Image7 provides a table showing that models with logical constraints outperform those without, with post-processing achieving the lowest logical inconsistency.\n\nIn conclusion, logical constraints are more effective than post-processing in reducing logical inconsistency across different LLM models on the MAVEN-ERE and Causal-TimeBank datasets. Post-processing, while achieving zero logical inconsistency, may compromise the quality of the generated answers. Logical constraints, when properly incorporated, enhance both performance and consistency without the drawbacks of post-processing.\n\n![Effectiveness of Logical Constraints and Post-Processing](image1)\n\n![Detailed Performance Comparison](image7)\n\n**Answer:** Logical constraints are more effective than post-processing in reducing logical inconsistency in LL"}

Initially, the system employs a pre-processing phase where images are analyzed to identify and isolate objects of interest using bounding boxes. This is depicted in `![image7](image7)`, where multiple objects within an image are highlighted and cropped to focus on specific regions. These cropped regions are then resized to a fixed proportion, ensuring uniformity and enhancing the model's ability to process each object effectively.\n\nFollowing pre-processing, the system utilizes CLIP's inherent image-text interaction capabilities to conduct image-to-text retrieval. This process involves extracting image embeddings and querying a large multi-modal external memory or database to find information relevant to the input query or context. The multimodal retriever, as shown in `![image6](image6)`, creates and stores multimodal embeddings, optimizing retrieval speed through index construction techniques. This ensures efficient and accurate retrieval of relevant information.\n\nOnce the top-k category information is retrieved, the system leverages MLLMs to refine and rank these categories. The MLLMs assess the contextual appropriateness of each class name with the input image, employing advanced linguistic and semantic analysis to make precise predictions. This ranking process is crucial for enhancing the model's performance in few-shot and zero-shot recognition tasks, as highlighted in `![image4](image4)`, where a ranking prompt is used to classify images based on their relevance.\n\nThe integration of the multimodal retriever and MLLMs not only addresses the limitations of traditional approaches but also preserves the model's extensive knowledge base, significantly boosting its performance on downstream tasks.

This indicates that Step-Back + RAG is highly effective in addressing reasoning errors in TimeQA, where the model's ability to abstract and refine answers before answering plays a crucial role. The low error introduction rate suggests that the abstraction process is robust and does not disrupt the retrieval augmentation significantly.\n\nIn contrast, for **StrategyQA**, Figure 11 shows that Step-Back + RAG corrects 15.4% of baseline errors but introduces 6.1% new errors. The improvement is not as pronounced as in TimeQA, and the error introduction rate is slightly higher. This difference could be attributed to the nature of StrategyQA, which may involve more complex reasoning and contextual dependencies that are harder to abstract effectively. The error analysis also reveals that reasoning errors are a dominant factor in both datasets, but their impact varies. In TimeQA, reasoning errors are more prevalent, while in StrategyQA, they are less dominant compared to other error types like context loss.\n\nThe significance of these differences lies in the dataset examples and task type. TimeQA, with its focus on temporal reasoning, benefits more from the abstraction step, as it simplifies the task by breaking down complex questions into more manageable parts. StrategyQA, which involves multi-hop reasoning and contextual understanding, sees a smaller improvement, indicating that while Step-Back + RAG helps, the task's inherent complexity limits its effectiveness.

However, when considering data augmentation techniques such as +negative, which increases the proportion of negative examples, the performance can be affected. As noted in [1], +negative underperforms the original dataset, likely due to the creation of a more imbalanced dataset. This imbalance can lead to issues like the dominance of easy-negative examples, which are not adequately addressed by traditional objectives like CE.\n\nIn contrast, data augmentation techniques that balance the dataset, such as +positive, can improve performance. For example, in the Chinese datasets (CTB5, CTB6, UD1.4), the proposed DSC loss outperforms other baselines by a significant margin, achieving SOTA performances with improvements of +1.86, +1.80, and +2.19 in F1 scores respectively, as shown in Table 3.

This architecture, as depicted in `![Translation Ranking model architecture](image5)`, uses a pretrained cross-lingual encoder and a triplet margin loss to minimize the distance between the \"better\" hypothesis and the \"anchors\" (source and reference), aiming to capture semantic similarity and context more effectively than traditional metrics.\n\nOn the other hand, BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy) is a widely used n-gram matching metric that assesses translation quality by counting the number of matching n-grams between the machine-translated hypothesis and a reference translation. While BLEU is lightweight and fast, it primarily focuses on lexical-level features and may not capture semantic nuances as effectively as more advanced metrics like COMET-RANK.\n\nComparing their performance across different language pairs, as shown in `![Table 1](image1)` and `![Table 2](image2)`, COMET-RANK often outperforms BLEU by significant margins. For instance, in the en-cs (English-Czech) pair, COMET-RANK achieves a score of 0.711, whereas BLEU scores lower.

This complexity is further supported by the data in [4], which states that the gap to human-level performance remains large across both tasks, but particularly in CHAI due to the inherent ambiguities and planning challenges.\n\nPerformance metrics also reflect these differences. In [10], it is noted that human performance on LANI has a stop distance error (SD) of 5.2 and task completion (TC) of 63%, whereas on CHAI, the human distance error is 1.34 and manipulation accuracy is 100%.

On the SciERC dataset, DyGIE's entity score of 65.2 and relation score of 41.6 also lead the competition, and on the WLPC dataset, it scores 79.5 for entities and 64.1 for relations, which are the best among the compared models.\n\nThe effects of using coreference and relation propagation layers are significant. Coreference propagation, as seen in image1, shows that DyGIE without CorefProp performs slightly better in entity extraction (F1 score of 68.0) compared to DyGIE (F1 score of 68.2), but it is less effective for relation extraction (F1 score of 41.2 compared to DyGIE's 42.0). Conversely, relation propagation, as depicted in image4, enhances relation extraction performance, with DyGIE without RelProp achieving a higher F1 score of 60.2 for relations compared to DyGIE's 58.4. This indicates that while coreference propagation slightly benefits entity extraction, relation propagation has a more substantial positive impact on relation extraction.\n\nThe iterative processes for coreference and relation propagation, as illustrated in image8, are optimized at two iterations for both tasks, highlighting the importance of balancing the number of iterations to achieve the best performance.

Specifically, as shown in Table 4 (image3), BERT's peak performance on the adversarial test set reduced to 53%, with both the mean and median scores at 50%. This reduction indicates that the adversarial dataset effectively neutralized the cues that BERT and other models were previously exploiting, leading to a more robust evaluation of their argument comprehension abilities.\n\nThe adversarial dataset's design, which involves negating the claim and inverting the label for each data point, ensures that the statistical cues are no longer a factor in the model's performance. This setup provides a clearer picture of the models' true capabilities, as seen in the results where all models, including BERT, perform at random levels on the adversarial dataset. This outcome supports the conclusion that BERT has not truly learned to comprehend arguments but rather relies on exploiting statistical patterns in the data.\n\nThe adversarial dataset should be adopted as the standard for future work on ARCT to ensure that evaluations are not skewed by such cues. This approach not only provides a more accurate assessment of model performance but also encourages further research into the extent of this problem in natural language processing more broadly.

According to the provided text quotes and image descriptions, the COMET model demonstrates superior performance across various metrics when evaluated on the ConceptNet dataset. \n\nFirstly, the text quotes indicate that COMET is capable of generating high-quality and novel knowledge tuples. For instance, quote [1] mentions that 59.25% of the generated tuples from COMET are novel, with 3.75% of the nodes being novel, showcasing the model's ability to extend the size of the knowledge graph by creating new edges and nodes. This is further supported by quote [7], which states that COMET achieves up to 91.7% precision at the top 1 for ConceptNet relations, approaching human performance.\n\nImage5 provides a comparative table of model performance metrics, including perplexity (PPL), a score, and novelty metrics (N/T\\(_{sro}\\) and N/T\\(_{o}\\)). The COMET model, without any specific variant label, shows the lowest perplexity (4.32), the highest score (95.25), and the closest approximation to human performance (91.69). This suggests that COMET not only generates plausible and high-quality knowledge but also does so in a manner that is highly novel and aligned with human judgment.\n\nAdditionally, image6 illustrates the relationship between edit distance and classifier accuracy for novel ConceptNet tuples. The graph shows that as the edit distance increases, the percentage of novel tuples decreases, but the classifier's accuracy remains high, close to 100%. This indicates that COMET's generated knowledge is not only novel but also maintains a high level of plausibility and correctness, as confirmed by the classifier.\n\nThe text quotes also discuss the impact of pre-training on model performance. Quote [6] highlights that pre-training COMET on a large language corpus improves its ability to generalize commonsense knowledge, as evidenced by the improvements in automatic and human evaluations.

BiDAF's iterative latent interactions and bidirectional LSTMs make it more effective at integrating information across documents compared to FastQA, which has fewer latent interactions. This is evident in the text quotes [5], [6], and [8], which highlight BiDAF's strength in handling multi-step inference and cross-document information.\n\nThe image quotes provide specific performance metrics for both models on the WikiHop and MedHop datasets under different conditions. Image1 and image2 show that BiDAF achieves higher accuracy scores than FastQA in both the standard and gold chain setups. For example, in the gold chain setup for WikiHop, BiDAF reaches 81.2% and 85.7% accuracy, while FastQA achieves 44.5% and 53.5%. Similarly, in MedHop, BiDAF's performance is significantly higher, reaching 99.3% and 100.0% accuracy, compared to FastQA's 54.6% and 59.2%.\n\nImage6 further supports this by showing that BiDAF outperforms FastQA in both standard and masked conditions across various models. The highest values in the table for BiDAF indicate its superior performance, especially in the masked setup where FastQA's performance drops more significantly.\n\nIn summary, BiDAF consistently outperforms FastQA across different datasets and test conditions due to its ability to better integrate cross-document information and handle multi-step reasoning.

This change can be observed in the table provided in image8, which shows the operating lease liabilities for both years. The increase in liabilities is primarily attributed to the Cytiva Acquisition in 2020, as mentioned in text quote [3]. The acquisition likely led to the addition of new lease obligations, contributing to the rise in operating lease liabilities. Additionally, the weighted average remaining lease term and discount rate have remained relatively stable, with a slight decrease in the discount rate from 3.1% in 2019 to 2.8% in 2020. The table in image8 also highlights the maturity of operating lease liabilities, indicating that the company has extended its lease obligations over a longer period, which could be another factor influencing the increase in liabilities. The consistent weighted average remaining lease term of 7 years for both years suggests that the company's lease commitments have been structured to maintain a similar duration, but the overall liability has grown due to the acquisition and possibly other operational expansions. ![The table shows operating lease expenses for the years 2020 and 2019](image8)"}

This substantial growth can be attributed to several key factors highlighted in the Annual Report:\n\n- **Revenue Increase**: The total revenues for fiscal 2021 were $33.6 billion, a 43% increase from the $23.5 billion in fiscal 2020. This growth was driven by higher equipment and services revenues from the QCT segment, which increased by 64% due to increased demand for 5G products and recovery from the impacts of COVID-19. Additionally, licensing revenues from the QTL segment also saw an increase, contributing to the overall revenue growth.\n\n- **Acquisitions and Integrations**: The acquisition of NUVIA in March 2021 for $1.1 billion, which included the integration of its technologies into Qualcomm's products, likely contributed to the revenue and earnings growth. The acquisition of Veoneer in October 2021, valued at approximately $4.5 billion, is expected to enhance Qualcomm's automotive technology offerings, further supporting future revenue potential.\n\n- **Cost Management and Efficiency**: The report mentions higher net gains on investments, which contributed to the increase in earnings before income taxes for the QSI segment. Efficient cost management and strategic investments in technology and market expansion also played a role in enhancing profitability.\n\n- **Tax Implications**: The cash amounts paid for income taxes, net of refunds received, were $1.5 billion in fiscal 2021, compared to $830 million in fiscal 2020 and $1.1 billion in fiscal 2019.

This reduction was primarily driven by lower global project spending, as noted in [10] and [12].

The revenue declines were particularly pronounced in the International Operated Markets (IOM) segment, driven by temporary restaurant closures and limited operations due to COVID-19. This segment saw a 17% decrease in total company-operated sales and franchised revenues, while the U.S. market, which performed positively, was offset by support provided to franchisees, including free meals to first responders and healthcare workers.\n\nThe impact on earnings per share is evident in the reconciliation table (image1), which shows a decrease in both GAAP and Non-GAAP earnings per share for 2020 compared to 2019. The GAAP earnings per share decreased by 20%, while the Non-GAAP earnings per share decreased by 23%. These declines were primarily due to the strategic gains from the sale of McDonald's Japan stock, which contributed $0.26 per share in 2020, compared to a strategic charge of $0.07 in 2019. Additionally, the decrease in revenues and the increase in Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses, including support for franchisees and higher costs for Ronald McDonald House Charities, further impacted earnings.\n\nThe table in image3 provides a detailed breakdown of revenue changes, showing a 14% decrease in total company-operated sales and a 10% decrease in franchised revenues for 2020.

According to the provided text quotes, the company reported a net income (loss) attributable to Chevron Corporation of approximately $7.3 billion in 2021, a substantial increase from the $1.6 billion loss in 2020. This improvement was driven by several factors, including higher realizations, the absence of impairments and write-offs, and higher sales volumes, as detailed in quotes [4] and [7]. Additionally, the U.S. upstream segment reported earnings of $7.3 billion in 2021, compared to a loss of $1.6 billion in 2020, further contributing to the overall financial turnaround.\n\nRegarding return on stockholders' equity, while the exact figures for 2020 and 2021 are not explicitly stated in the provided text, the improvement in net income suggests a positive impact on this metric. Return on stockholders' equity is a measure of a company's profitability relative to shareholders' equity, and an increase in net income typically leads to a higher return on equity.

This discrepancy suggests that while the core operating income increased in USD terms, the constant currency measure shows a smaller growth, highlighting the impact of currency fluctuations on the reported figures.\n\nThe main factors contributing to these changes include the ongoing effects of the pandemic, which impacted operations in Oncology and Sandoz, leading to delays in cancer care and a weak flu season that dampened generics sales. Additionally, the safety update on Beovu had a negative impact on performance. These factors, combined with the strategic review initiated to position Sandoz as a long-term leader in the generics industry, likely influenced the financial outcomes for the segment.\n\nIn summary, the Sandoz segment faced challenges in 2021 that led to a decline in operating income and a more modest increase in core operating income, reflecting the complexities of the pharmaceutical market and the strategic adjustments being made within the company.\n\n**Answer:** The Sandoz segment experienced a decline in operating income and a modest increase in core operating income between 2020 and 2021, primarily due to pandemic-related challenges and strategic reviews."}

However, these gains were offset by strategic charges of $74 million in 2019.\n- **Impairment and Other Charges**: The write-off of impaired software that was no longer being used amounted to $26 million in 2020, which was partly offset by $13 million of income from the reversal of a reserve related to the sale of the India Delhi market in January 2020.\n- **Effective Income Tax Rates**: The effective income tax rate for 2020 was 23.0%, which included $50 million of income tax benefits due to new U.S. tax regulations and $48 million related to a tax rate change in the U.K. In 2019, the effective income tax rate was 24.9%, reflecting $84 million of income tax benefits due to regulations issued in the fourth quarter of 2019.\n\nThe comprehensive income also decreased from $6.1522 billion in 2019 to $4.6264 billion in 2020.

The divisions listed include FLNA, QFNA, PBNA, LatAm, Europe, AMESA, and APAC. The data indicates that operating profit increased for most divisions, primarily due to net revenue growth and productivity savings, although certain operating cost increases and COVID-19 pandemic charges impacted some divisions.\n\nFor instance, image2 shows that PBNA had significant net revenue growth, which contributed to its operating profit increase. Similarly, LatAm and Europe also saw growth in net revenue, which likely supported their operating profits. The image also highlights that corporate unallocated expenses, which include costs like commodity derivatives and business transformation initiatives, affected the divisions' profitability.\n\nImage6 provides a breakdown of the percentage distribution of beverage and food/snack categories across various regions and PepsiCo. For example, in LatAm, food/snack products consistently accounted for 90% of the revenue, while in Europe, beverages and food/snacks were more evenly split. This distribution could influence the net revenue and operating profit, as different product categories may have varying profit margins and market demands.\n\nText quote [2] mentions that the primary performance obligation is the distribution and sales of beverage and food/snack products. The distribution of these categories across divisions can impact revenue and profitability. For instance, divisions with a higher percentage of food/snack products might experience different market dynamics compared to those with a higher beverage focus.\n\nText quote [3] discusses the importance of major customers like Walmart, which had a significant impact on net revenue. The loss of such a customer could adversely affect divisions like FLNA, QFNA, and PBNA, which rely heavily on these sales. This highlights the dependency on major customers and the potential risk"}

According to the provided text quotes and image data, the key factors driving these changes include:\n\n- **Financing Activities**: There was a substantial increase in cash inflows from financing activities in 2021, primarily due to the financing of the acquisition of Varian. The cash inflows changed by €12,087 million to €11,839 million, as shown in image5. This was partly offset by cash outflows from the repayment of matured loans and other financing activities, as detailed in image9.\n\n- **Investing Activities**: Cash outflows from investing activities increased by €12,228 million to €14,140 million in 2021, mainly due to the payout for the acquisition of Varian. Additionally, there were increases in outflows for intangible assets and property, plant, and equipment, as highlighted in image6 and image4.\n\n- **Equity and Share Repurchases**: The company repurchased more treasury shares in 2021 to fulfill share-based payment programs, leading to an increase in treasury shares by €203 million to €240 million, as seen in image10. This was also influenced by the transformation of share-based payment programs from Siemens AG shares to Siemens Healthineers AG shares.\n\n- **Net Income and Cash Flows**: The net income rose by €323 million to €1,746 million in 2021, contributing to the overall cash flow improvements. The change in operating net working capital had a lesser negative impact, with a decrease of €97 million compared to the previous year, as noted in image3.\n\n- **Debt and Equity**: The equity rose by €3,828 million to €16,339 million, mainly due to the issuance of new shares for the acquisition of Varian, as indicated in image5.

This improvement is evident in the text quote [3], which highlights a favorable change in net income of $1.58 billion compared to the prior year.\n\n2. **Other Comprehensive Income Adjustments:** The foreign currency translation adjustment also played a role.

This represents a significant growth of approximately $3,816 million, or about 28.7%. The increase in total revenue can be attributed to several factors, including the acquisition of Tableau in August 2019, which contributed significantly to the revenue growth. The acquisition added approximately $650 million to the remaining performance obligation related to the Tableau acquisition, as mentioned in text quote [4]. Additionally, the company's existing business operations likely saw growth, contributing to the overall revenue increase.\n\nRegarding unearned revenue, the image5 table provides a detailed breakdown. The unearned revenue at the beginning of fiscal year 2019 was $6,995 million, which increased to $8,564 million by the end of fiscal year 2020. This represents a growth of $1,569 million, or about 22.4%. The increase in unearned revenue is influenced by several factors, including seasonality, renewals, and invoice timing, as noted in text quote [11]. The company generally invoices customers in annual installments, and the unearned revenue balance is subject to future economic risks such as bankruptcies and regulatory changes.\n\nThe implications of these changes are multifaceted. The significant increase in total revenue indicates strong business performance and the successful integration of acquired assets, such as Tableau. However, the substantial growth in unearned revenue also suggests that a large portion of the revenue recognized in fiscal year 2020 was from advance payments, as approximately 50% of the total revenue recognized in fiscal year 2020 was from the unearned revenue balance as of January 31, 2019, as mentioned in text quote [9]. This could mean that the company has a substantial amount of future revenue that will be recognized over the next few years, impacting its cash flow and financial planning.\n"}

This increase was driven by sales of receivables and tax relief measures, which partially offset performance-related declines within net income.\n\n- **Investing Activities**: Net cash used in investing activities decreased by $23.9 billion in 2020 compared to the prior year. This reduction was mainly due to a decrease in net cash used for acquisitions, which was significantly impacted by the Red Hat acquisition in the previous year. Additionally, there was a decrease in cash provided by net non-operating finance receivables, primarily driven by the wind down of OEM IT commercial financing operations.\n\n- **Financing Activities**: Financing activities were a net use of cash of $9,721 million in 2020, compared to a net source of cash of $9,042 million in 2019.

This decline was primarily due to lower real estate and structured finance fee income and losses on legacy corporate restructuring positions. However, there was growth in capital markets revenue and an increase in net interest income from corporate lending.\n   - **Risk-Weighted Assets (RWAs):** The bank achieved significant reductions in RWAs, with a global reduction of $37 billion in 2020, contributing to a cumulative reduction of $47 billion, including accelerated savings from transformation programs.

Firstly, the text quote [10] highlights that earnings from insurance investment income decreased by 4.6% in 2021 compared to 2020, and by 8.9% in 2020 compared to 2019. This decline was primarily due to lower interest rates on substantial holdings of cash and U.S. Treasury Bills. The text quote [12] further elaborates that interest and other investment income declined by $470 million (44.4%) in 2021 compared to 2020, and by $1.0 billion (49.0%) compared to 2019. These declines were mainly due to lower income from short-term investments and fixed maturity securities, which were affected by the prevailing low interest rates throughout 2021.\n\nThe image quotes provide additional context on the asset allocations that reflect these changes.

Similarly, fixed maturity securities decreased from $20,317 million to $16,386 million, indicating a reduction in higher-yielding fixed-income investments.

In 2021, the recovery of goodwill was adequately guaranteed through the profitability of the acquired companies, whose future cash flows supported the carrying amount of goodwill at year-end (as noted in Note 2.2.f). This indicates a strong financial backing for the goodwill values recorded in 2021.\n\nIn contrast, the text mentions that goodwill arising from the acquisition or termination of franchise contracts corresponds to the amount of intangible assets that did not meet the requirements for separate recognition under IFRS 3. These requirements focused on the capacity of the assets to generate future cash flows. This suggests that in 2020, there might have been more instances where the criteria for recognizing goodwill separately were not met, possibly due to the economic impacts of the pandemic, which affected the cash flow projections and valuations of these assets.\n\nAdditionally, the pandemic's impact on the Group's operations in 2020, as highlighted in text [10] and [11], could have influenced the valuation and recognition of goodwill, leading to differences in how goodwill was accounted for between the two years. The significant restrictions and lockdown measures in 2020 likely impacted the cash flows and, consequently, the valuation of goodwill compared to the recovery and support seen in 2021.\n\n![image3](image3) shows the financial data for various entities, including Zara Polska and Massimo Dutti, which are likely part of the acquisitions that contributed to the goodwill in 2021.

This increase was primarily driven by higher Derivatives exposures due to market volatility and an increase in Investment securities resulting from the E*TRADE acquisition. Additionally, Lending commitments within Wealth Management and Institutional Securities business segments, as well as higher Equity investments, contributed to the rise in credit risk RWA. The Advanced Approach also saw an increase in Credit Value Adjustment (CVA) due to increased Derivatives exposure and higher credit spread volatility. This rise in credit risk RWA indicates a higher level of risk exposure, which can affect the capital requirements and the institution's ability to absorb potential losses.\n\nSecondly, **External TLAC** as a percentage of Risk-Weighted Assets decreased from 49.9% in 2019 to 47.7% in 2020. The regulatory minimum for External TLAC as a percentage of RWA is 18.0%, and the required ratio is 21.5%. Despite the decrease, the institution still maintained a substantial buffer above the regulatory minimum, reflecting its strong capital position. The decrease in the percentage could be due to changes in the composition of TLAC or adjustments in the calculation of RWA, but it remains well above the required ratio, indicating robust compliance with regulatory standards.\n\nThe interplay between these changes suggests that while the institution faced increased risk exposure (as seen in the rise in Credit Risk RWA), it maintained a strong capital buffer through TLAC. This balance is crucial for maintaining financial stability and meeting regulatory requirements. The institution's ability to manage and mitigate risks effectively, as evidenced by the changes in operational risk RWA and the overall capital ratios, further supports its robust capital structure.\n\n![The table shows risk-based capital information in millions of dollars.

The decrease in interest income outpaced the decrease in interest expenses, resulting in a net decrease of $19,747 million. This decline is consistent with the broader economic downturn due to COVID-19, which affected the bank's ability to generate interest income from its assets, such as loans and securities. Image6 provides further insight, showing a reduction in interest-bearing deposits and a decrease in the net interest spread, indicating that the bank faced challenges in maintaining profitability from its core lending activities.\n\nIn contrast, from 2018 to 2019, there was an increase in net interest income, with a net increase of $4,452 million. This period saw some improvements in interest income, particularly in areas like U.S. commercial loans, as shown in image6. The bank's organizational structure, with segments like Global Banking and Global Markets, likely played a role in managing these shifts by adjusting lending strategies and investment portfolios to respond to changing market conditions.\n\nThe organizational structure, as depicted in image1, with divisions such as Consumer Banking, Global Wealth & Investment Management, Global Banking, Global Markets, and All Other, allowed the bank to diversify its income streams and manage risks across different segments.

This reduction is primarily due to the decrease in interest and other investment income, which fell from $1,059 million in 2020 to $589 million in 2021, a drop of $470 million or 44.4%. The decline in interest income is attributed to lower returns from short-term investments and fixed maturity securities, as noted in [4]. Additionally, dividend income increased slightly from $4,890 million in 2020 to $5,060 million in 2021, a rise of $170 million or 3.5%, as seen in [7].

This increase suggests a shift towards safer, lower-yielding assets, likely in response to the low-interest-rate environment. Equity securities also rose from $269,498 million to $334,907 million, indicating a possible diversification strategy to mitigate the impact of low interest rates on fixed-income investments.

The table in image6 illustrates this sensitivity, showing that a 30% decrease in equity index put option contract liabilities' fair value can lead to substantial pre-tax losses, as seen in the hypothetical scenarios. For instance, a 30% decrease in 2021 resulted in a $781 million loss, highlighting the potential volatility in net earnings due to interest rate fluctuations.\n\nRegarding non-U.S. denominated debt, the financial data indicates a notable shift in its impact on net earnings between 2020 and 2021. In 2020, non-U.S. denominated debt included in net earnings was a $(764) million loss, while in 2021, it turned into a $955 million gain.

However, the pre-tax income declined by 12.4% to $7,811 million. The decline in pre-tax income was attributed to several factors, including the purchase price accounting impacts from the Red Hat acquisition, ongoing investments in key strategic areas, and lower income from IP partnership agreements [7]. Despite these challenges, the segment maintained a strong gross profit margin of 77.1%, indicating robust operational efficiency in its software offerings [4].\n\nIn contrast, **Global Business Services** reported an external gross profit of $4,655 million in 2019, a 3.0% increase from 2018. The pre-tax income also saw a modest increase of 1.3% to $1,623 million. This performance was driven by strong growth in Consulting services, particularly in offerings that enabled clients' digital journeys, such as cognitive technology and data platform services, application modernization, and AI-driven applications [9]. The adjusted revenue growth, which accounted for currency fluctuations, further underscores the segment's resilience and adaptability in the face of changing market dynamics.\n\nThe financial results for both segments reflect IBM's strategic focus on digital transformation and cloud adoption. The Cloud & Cognitive Software segment, with its high gross margin, underscores the value of its software offerings, while GBS's growth in consulting and application services highlights the demand for modernization and AI-infused solutions.

This decline in shipment volumes is attributed to factors such as adult smoker down-trading to ultra-low-price brands and the impact of the pandemic on consumption patterns.\n\nThe financial activities further illustrate the impact on the region. The net cash provided by operating activities decreased by $0.3 billion in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to higher net earnings but offset by increased working capital requirements and asset impairment and exit costs. The net cash used in investing activities decreased by $0.7 billion in 2020 from the comparable 2019 period, mainly due to lower capital expenditures and the deconsolidation of RBH. This reduction in capital expenditures and the deconsolidation of RBH contributed to a decrease in net cash used in investing activities.\n\nThe image quotes provide additional context. Image3 shows that the shipment volume of cigarettes in Latin America & Canada decreased by 11.8% from 2019 to 2020, while heated tobacco units increased by 50.8%.

This growth was primarily driven by higher net gains from equity securities, mortgage banking income, and investment advisory and other asset-based fee income, as noted in [8]. The provision for credit losses decreased due to improved economic conditions, leading to lower charge-offs and better portfolio credit quality. Noninterest expenses also decreased due to lower operating losses and restructuring charges, partially offset by higher incentive and revenue-related compensation in personnel expenses.\n\n**Selected Balance Sheet Data:**\n- **Loans:** The total loans decreased from $229.354 billion in 2019 to $211.436 billion in 2020, and further to $181.237 billion in 2021. This decline was due to paydowns exceeding originations and specific actions taken in 2020 to curtail certain non-conforming residential mortgage originations and suspend home equity originations, as mentioned in [5].

According to the provided data, the average Card Member loans decreased from $13.3 billion in 2019 to $15.0 billion in 2021, indicating a growth of 12.5%. This increase suggests that despite the decrease in average loans from 2020 to 2021, the overall loan portfolio expanded, likely due to new card acquisitions and high retention rates, as mentioned in [1] and [2]. The growth in loans contributed to the company's efforts to maintain strong credit performance and customer satisfaction, as highlighted in [8].\n\nNet interest income, however, experienced a decline from $866 million in 2019 to $1,011 million in 2021, showing a slight increase of 16.5%. This increase was primarily driven by lower cost of funds, as noted in [12]. Despite the growth in loans, the net interest income did not increase as significantly, which could be attributed to the decrease in net interest yields due to higher paydown rates on revolving loan balances, as explained in [2]. The decrease in net interest yields was a result of the company's customer base maintaining strong financial health and liquidity, leading to higher paydown rates.\n\nThe implications for the company's financial performance were mixed. While the growth in average Card Member loans and net interest income indicated a robust loan portfolio and improved financial health, the decrease in net interest yields highlighted challenges in maintaining profitability from interest income. The company's ability to manage these factors effectively, as seen in the reserve releases and lower net write-offs in 2021, as detailed in [4] and [10], suggests a strategic focus on risk management and customer retention. The company's strong liquidity position, with $24.6 billion in cash and investments as of December 31, 2021, as mentioned in [7], further supports its ability to navigate these financial dynamics.\n\n![image5](image5) shows the financial data for the years ended December 31, 2021, 202"}

This expense reflects the cost of providing equity-based incentives to employees, which is recorded as a reduction in net income but increases the company's equity through Additional Paid-in Capital. This is evident in the image2 table, which shows the impact of share-based compensation on equity components, including Restricted Share Units and Additional Paid-in Capital.\n\n**Cash Flow from Operating Activities:**\nThe cash flow statement (image4) provides insights into the company's cash position. Net income for 2020 was $5,185,313, which is a positive indicator of cash flow from operating activities. Adjustments for depreciation, amortization, and other expenses further refine the cash flow from operations. Additionally, changes in assets and liabilities during the year affected the cash position. For instance, the purchase of property, equipment, and businesses likely impacted cash flow from investing activities, which in turn affects the overall cash position.\n\n**Impact on Shareholders' Equity:**\nThe image2 table illustrates how various transactions, including share-based compensation and dividends, influenced shareholders' equity.

This increase was primarily due to current year tax positions, which rose by $416 million, and prior year tax positions, which decreased by $130 million. The company also benefited from statute of limitations lapses, though the exact amount for 2020 is not specified. The increase in unrecognized tax benefits suggests potential future tax savings, which can positively impact the company's financial position by reducing future tax liabilities.\n\nRegarding common share repurchases, the company repurchased 14 million shares in 2020 at an average price of $300.58 per share, compared to 22 million shares in 2019 at an average price of $245.97 per share, as detailed in `![image1](image1)`. The aggregate cost of share repurchases was $4,250 million in 2020, down from $5,500 million in 2019. This reduction in share repurchases indicates a decrease in the company's capital expenditure on buying back its own shares, which can improve the company's capital structure by reducing the number of outstanding shares and potentially increasing earnings per share.\n\nThe implications for the company's financial position are mixed. The increase in unrecognized tax benefits could lead to future tax savings, enhancing financial flexibility. However, the decrease in share repurchases might suggest a shift in capital allocation priorities, potentially towards other investments or debt reduction. The company's ability to manage these changes effectively will depend on its strategic financial planning and market conditions.\n\nIn summary, the company's financial position was influenced by both the increase in unrecognized tax benefits and the reduction in share repurchases, each with its own set of implications for future financial health and capital structure."}

In 2021, Chevron paid out substantial dividends, which directly decreased the retained earnings portion of stockholders' equity. This is evident from the financial data showing a reduction in retained earnings due to the dividend payments. The cash flow from financing activities also reflects this, as dividends are a cash outflow, impacting the company's liquidity.\n\nSecondly, **treasury stock transactions** affected the equity structure by altering the number of outstanding shares. The company repurchased shares, which are recorded as a deduction from common stock and an increase in treasury stock. This activity reduced the total number of outstanding shares, potentially increasing the value of remaining shares and impacting earnings per share. The cash flow from financing activities shows a significant outflow for treasury stock purchases, indicating the cash used to buy back shares.\n\nThe interplay between these two factors—dividends and treasury stock transactions—demonstrates Chevron's strategy to manage its capital structure and return value to shareholders while potentially enhancing shareholder value through share repurchases. The financial data, as seen in image5 and image6, highlights these transactions' effects on both equity and cash flow, showcasing how dividends and share buybacks influence the company's financial health and shareholder returns.\n\n![The table provides a comprehensive insight into how the company's equity structure changed over these periods, driven by financial performance, dividends, share repurchases, and acquisitions.](image5)\n\n![This summary indicates various cash flow movements relating to different corporate activities across the examined years, emphasizing how operational, investment, and financial initiatives affect the overall liquidity and cash positions of the company.](image6)\n\nIn conclusion, both cash dividends and treasury stock transactions played crucial roles in shaping Chevron's equity structure and cash flow dynamics in 2021."}

This represents the present value of future lease payments, calculated using the Group's incremental borrowing rate as of that date. This change from prior accounting standards, which did not recognize lease liabilities on the balance sheet, resulted in a substantial increase in reported liabilities.\n\n- **Adjustments and Movements:** During the year 2020, the lease liability increased by $50,245 thousand due to new leases and re-measurements of existing leases. Interest expenses on these liabilities amounted to $4,707 thousand, reflecting the cost of financing the lease obligations. Additionally, the movement in exchange rates had a negative impact of $1,092 thousand, affecting the reported liability.\n\n- **Lease Payments and Interest:** The Group made lease payments totaling $31,886 thousand, which reduced the lease liability. The interest expense on the lease liabilities was $4,707 thousand, indicating the cost of borrowing to finance the lease obligations.\n\n- **Current vs. Non-Current Liabilities:** At the end of 2020, the lease liabilities were split into current and non-current components.

The degree of attainment of consolidated operating income in the current fiscal year is assessed against a target set in 2011 for sustainable growth. The reference value is set at 1 trillion yen, and the evaluation result for the current fiscal year is 150%. This indicates a strong performance in terms of operational efficiency and profitability, which directly impacts the company's ability to generate returns for shareholders.\n\n2. **Volatility of Toyota’s Share Price**: This also accounts for 50% of the evaluation weight. The volatility of Toyota's share price is compared to the Nikkei stock average at the end of the previous fiscal year. The reference values for Toyota's share price and the Nikkei average are 6,501 yen and 18,917 yen, respectively.

These expenses were primarily due to the amortization of intangible assets and inventory fair value adjustments related to the acquisition.\n\n5. **Noncash Charges and Gains**: The 2020 comprehensive income included noncash impairment charges and fair value adjustment gains related to certain long-lived assets and investments, which impacted earnings without affecting cash flows.\n\n6. **Stock Compensation Expense**: An increase in depreciation, amortization, and stock compensation expenses in 2020 compared to 2019 also contributed to the change in comprehensive income.\n\n![Comprehensive Income Change](image5) shows the detailed breakdown of these components, highlighting the significant impact of foreign currency translation adjustments and higher net earnings on the comprehensive income over the three years.\n"}

According to the provided text quotes and image data, the RWA under both the Standardized and Advanced approaches increased due to various factors, including higher market volatility and increased exposure in derivatives and investment securities. Specifically, the text quotes [8] and [12] highlight that market risk RWA increased in 2020 under both approaches primarily due to higher Regulatory VaR and market volatility, while credit risk RWA also increased due to factors like the E*TRADE acquisition and higher exposure in derivatives.\n\nImage7 provides a detailed breakdown of the TLAC and Eligible Long-Term Debt (LTD) as of December 31, 2020, and December 31, 2019. It shows that the External TLAC as a percentage of RWA decreased from 49.9% in 2019 to 47.7% in 2020. This decrease can be attributed to the overall increase in RWA, which outweighed the increase in TLAC. The regulatory minimum for External TLAC as a percentage of RWA is 18.0%, and the required ratio is 21.5%. Despite the increase in TLAC from $196,888 million to $216,129 million, the percentage of TLAC relative to RWA decreased because the RWA increased more significantly.\n\nThe image data also indicates that the TLAC as a percentage of leverage exposure increased from 17.0% in 2019 to 18.1% in 2020, which aligns with the regulatory requirement of 9.5%.

According to the provided text quotes, net interest income for 2020 decreased by $2.9 billion or 9.5% compared to 2019. This decline was primarily due to lower average market interest rates across major currencies, which reduced interest income. However, the increase in average interest-earning assets (AIEA) by $170.1 billion or 8.8% partially offset this decrease. The net interest margin for 2020 was 1.32%, which was 26 basis points lower than in 2019, reflecting the impact of reduced yields on AIEA and lower funding costs on average interest-bearing liabilities.\n\nInterest expense for 2020 was $2.7 billion, down $2.9 billion year-on-year, mainly due to lower market interest rates and growth in interest-bearing customer accounts. This reduction in interest expense helped mitigate the decline in net interest income.\n\nThe decrease in net interest income, despite the reduction in interest expense, contributed to a lower net operating income. The organization's overall profitability was further affected by increased expected credit losses and other credit impairment charges, which led to a reported profit before tax of $8.8 billion, a 34% decrease, and an adjusted profit before tax of $12.1 billion, a 45% decrease. These factors, combined with lower operating revenue and higher operating expenses, resulted in a return on average tangible equity (RoTE) of 3.1% for 2020, significantly below the target of 10% to 12% originally planned for 2022.\n\n![The table shows financial data, with categories such as Interest Income, Interest Expense, Net Interest Income, and Average Interest-Earning Assets.

This growth in noncurrent assets suggests an expansion in IBM's long-term investments and asset base, which can enhance its ability to generate future revenue streams and support its operational strategies. The increase in deferred taxes and prepaid pension assets further indicates strategic financial planning and investment in long-term liabilities, which can provide stability and predictability in IBM's financial performance.\n\nOn the other hand, the decrease in long-term financing receivables by $1,626 million (adjusted for currency) in 2020, as mentioned in [9], reflects a reduction in outstanding receivables. This could be due to sales of receivables or changes in product cycle dynamics, which might have freed up cash and reduced the risk associated with long-term receivables. However, the decrease in net intangible assets and goodwill by $44 million (adjusted for currency) suggests a reduction in intangible assets, which could impact IBM's valuation and future growth potential.\n\nIn terms of cash flows, the net cash used in financing activities was a net use of $9,721 million in 2020 compared to a net source of $9,042 million in 2019, as highlighted in [2]. This shift indicates that IBM was more actively using cash to fund its financing activities in 2020, which could be related to the wind down of OEM IT commercial financing operations and other strategic financial decisions.

This reduction was primarily due to lower retail spending and higher payments, as indicated in text quote [11]. The **risk-adjusted margin** increased from 8.28 to 9.16, suggesting a better margin despite the decline in purchase volumes. The decrease in **new accounts** from 4,320 to 2,505 thousand also reflects a reduction in new credit card applications, likely due to economic uncertainty and changes in consumer spending habits.\n\nIn the **home equity portfolio**, image2 highlights a decrease in outstanding balances from $11,131 million in 2019 to $8,160 million in 2020, a reduction of $2,971 million. This decline is attributed to paydowns outpacing new originations and draws on existing lines, as mentioned in text quote [1].

The report highlights several key drivers behind these impacts:\n\n- **Coal**: The underlying EBITDA for coal decreased by US$1.3 billion to US$288 million in FY2021, primarily due to lower price impacts and reduced volumes. Controllable cash costs increased by US$102 million, driven by higher maintenance costs at Queensland Coal and increased stripping volumes. The unit costs for Queensland Coal are expected to be between US$80 and US$90 per tonne in FY2022, reflecting higher diesel prices and the need for mine plan optimization. The ongoing uncertainty regarding restrictions on coal imports into China has led to a lack of medium-term volume and unit cost guidance.\n\n- **Nickel**: Underlying EBITDA for Nickel West increased by US$296 million to US$259 million in FY2021, benefiting from higher prices and volumes, as well as lower maintenance costs following major shutdowns. However, unfavorable exchange rate movements and the impact of a stronger nickel price on third-party concentrate purchase costs partially offset these gains.\n\nThe report also emphasizes that commodity prices are subject to significant volatility due to global economic and geopolitical factors, industrial activity, supply and demand dynamics, technological changes, product substitution, tariffs, and exchange rate fluctuations.

The table indicates that in 2020, the restructuring charges were $25 million, whereas in 2019, there was a negative charge of $15 million. This shift from a credit to a charge highlights a significant change in the financial impact of restructuring activities between the two years.\n\nAdditionally, image6 offers a quarterly breakdown of financial data, including restructuring charges/other.

In 2019, the variable lease expenses were $32,113 thousand, as indicated in the financial data table (image3). However, in 2020, this expense dropped to $404 thousand.

This substantial rise in net earnings directly contributed to the growth in comprehensive income.\n- **Other Comprehensive Income**: The table in image7 shows that other comprehensive income fluctuated, with a notable loss in 2020 due to foreign currency translation losses of $983 million. However, gains from investment securities and reclassification adjustments also played a role, albeit with varying impacts across the years.\n- **Comprehensive Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests**: There was a decrease in comprehensive income attributable to noncontrolling interests, which slightly offset the overall growth.\n\nThe financial statements, including image5 and image7, provide a detailed breakdown of revenues, operating costs, and earnings, illustrating the factors that influenced the comprehensive income changes. The increase in revenues, particularly from premiums and services, alongside effective cost management, were key drivers of the growth in comprehensive income over the years.\n\n![Comprehensive Income Changes](image7)"}

This increase can be attributed to several factors:\n\n1. **Issuance of New Debt**: The company issued additional long-term debt in 2020, including $750 million in May and $750 million in June, as detailed in text quotes [3] and [7]. These issuances were used for general corporate purposes and to repay maturing debt.\n\n2. **Debt Retirement**: In 2020, the company retired $500 million of maturing debt, as mentioned in text quote [12]. This retirement reduced the overall debt but was offset by the new issuances.\n\n3. **Interest Rate Impact**: A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would decrease the fair value of investments and long-term debt, as noted in text quote [2]. However, since the interest rates on long-term debt are fixed, this change does not affect cash flows, but it could impact the valuation of debt on the balance sheet.\n\n4. **Net Unamortized Discounts and Premiums**: The net unamortized discounts, premiums, and issuance costs were ($52) million in 2020 and ($47) million in 2019, as shown in image1. These adjustments slightly reduced the total debt figures.\n\n5. **Lease Obligations**: The company's lease obligations, which are accounted for as operating leases, also contribute to the long-term liabilities, as indicated in text quote [8] and image4. The lease payments and liabilities are detailed in image4, showing annual payments and total lease liabilities.\n\nOverall, the increase in long-term debt was primarily driven by new issuances and the retirement of maturing debt, with adjustments for interest rate impacts and issuance costs. The lease obligations further contribute to the long-term liabilities, as reflected in the financial data provided.\n\n![The table shows details about notes (types of debt) with various due dates and interest"}

Net income rose by €323 million to €1,746 million in 2021, up from €1,423 million in 2020.

Non-current assets remained relatively stable, with a slight increase from €2,032 million to €2,051 million, indicating that Inditex effectively managed its assets while expanding its sales significantly.\n\nIn Asia and the rest of the world, net sales increased from €3,980 million in 2020 to €4,521 million in 2021, a growth of €541 million. Non-current assets decreased from €1,255 million to €1,215 million, a reduction of €40 million.

In 2022, the total deferred tax assets amounted to $4,091 million, a decrease from $4,564 million in 2021. This reduction is primarily due to a decrease in the valuation allowance, which went from a negative $569 million in 2021 to a negative $409 million in 2022. The valuation allowance is a critical component of deferred tax assets, as it reflects the company's expectation of whether it can realize the benefits of these assets. The decrease in the valuation allowance suggests that the company has become more optimistic about its ability to utilize these deferred tax assets in the future, which is a positive indicator for its financial health.\n\nTurning to deferred tax liabilities, the total increased from $8,503 million in 2021 to $9,288 million in 2022. This increase is attributed to several factors, including an increase in liabilities related to goodwill and intangible assets, fixed assets, and other retiree benefits. Specifically, the liability for goodwill and intangible assets rose from $5,761 million in 2021 to $5,783 million in 2022, while fixed assets increased from $1,512 million to $1,542 million. Additionally, there was a notable rise in liabilities for unrealized gain on financial and foreign exchange transactions, from $111 million in 2021 to $439 million in 2022.

This table provides a structured overview of how the vesting is adjusted based on performance, ensuring alignment with the company's financial goals.\n\nIn summary, the vesting of restricted share units over the first three years is conditioned on meeting or exceeding the Non-GAAP OI targets set in the AOP, with the company retaining the ability to adjust these targets based on performance across different business units.\n\n![The table details the number of restricted share units vesting at different vesting dates based on specific financial performance conditions](image8)"}

This trend has shown little change over the past few years, indicating a consistent preference for the Democratic Party among this demographic.\n\nHowever, the perception of differences between the parties among Latino voters varies. A significant portion of Latino registered voters perceive a great deal of difference between the Democratic and Republican parties, with 45% of all Hispanics and 47% of Democrats/Lean Democrats holding this view [8]. This perception is slightly higher among Republicans/Lean Republicans, with 48% indicating a great deal of difference [8]. The chart in image8 visually represents these perceptions, showing that a majority of Latinos recognize distinct differences between the two parties.\n\nAdditionally, the survey results suggest that while there is a clear preference for the Democratic Party, there is also a notable percentage of Latino voters who are unsure or leaning toward the Republican Party.

This indicates that while the Democratic Party holds a strong lead, there is still a segment of the Latino vote that is not entirely aligned with the Democratic Party.\n\nThe perception of differences between the parties may influence this alignment. The Democratic Party is seen as caring more about Latinos and working harder to earn their votes, with a NET approval rating of 78% among Democrats/Lean Democrats [4].

This decline is indicative of a shift in the venture capital landscape following the burst of the bubble in the late 1990s. The text quotes highlight several key points that align with this trend:\n\n- **Text Quote [2]** mentions that the financial boom combined with a mature venture ecosystem allowed European early-stage companies to scale faster and achieve higher valuations sooner than ever before. This suggests that despite the initial decline, the quality and performance of VC funds improved.\n- **Text Quote [5]** notes that the supply of venture capital started to dry out only after 2004, which aligns with the chart showing a reduction in funds.\n- **Text Quote [10]** emphasizes that the scarcity of VC money in Europe led to lower entry valuations but also increased capital efficiency and yield, as investors became more selective.\n- **Text Quote [11]** points out that the post-bubble struggle resulted in the emergence of some of the strongest VC firms in the world, indicating a refinement in the industry.\n\nThe chart, particularly image6, visually supports these points by showing the dramatic decrease in the number of funds, reflecting a period of consolidation and improvement in the quality of VC firms.

According to text quote [9], among Independents in 2018, 17% lean Democrat, 7% have no lean, and 13% lean Republican. This suggests that the majority of Independents are not truly independent in their political stance, as they tend to lean towards one party or the other. The data from image4 supports this trend, showing that while the overall percentage of Independents has risen, the number of truly independent individuals remains small. This reflects a persistent dynamic where most Independents are not entirely detached from party affiliations, aligning with the findings in text quote [8] that most Independents are not all that \"independent\" politically. The increase in Independents also highlights a shift in public opinion, as seen in image1, where Independent opinions have fluctuated over different presidential terms, reflecting the broader political climate and shifting party dynamics. The data from image5 further illustrates this by showing that Independents often have views that align more closely with one party on key issues, such as the impact of increased tariffs or the approval of the tax law passed by Trump and Congress. Overall, the rise in Independents indicates a growing segment of the population that may be seeking a middle ground or expressing dissatisfaction with the two major parties, but still leaning towards one side on various issues. ![The image shows the percentage of people identifying as Democrats, Republicans, or Independents in the United States from 1994 to 2018, with a notable increase in Independents from 33% to 38%.](image4)"}

This surge was partly due to the influx of pioneers attracted by the Homestead Act of 1862, which offered 160 acres of land to settlers who built a permanent structure and resided on the land for five years. The Transcontinental Railroad Act of 1862 also played a crucial role by transforming Nebraska into a booming agricultural state, facilitating westward expansion and encouraging settlement. The county's population peaked in 1890 but began to decline thereafter, reaching 9,403 by 2000. Factors contributing to this decline include farm consolidation, which reduced the number of farms and increased the average size of each farm, as seen in the data from 1900 to 2002. The shift from small-scale to large-scale farming led to fewer farms and a decrease in rural populations. Additionally, the relocation of the county seat to Aurora in 1874 likely impacted other towns, as seen in the table of population trends from various census years. The image of the population data (image2) illustrates these trends, showing a peak in the late 1800s followed by a steady decline.

According to the Pew Research Center survey, women in computer jobs are significantly more likely to report experiencing gender discrimination compared to their male counterparts. Specifically, 74% of women in computer jobs have experienced gender-related workplace discrimination, while only 16% of men in these jobs report the same experience [4]. This stark contrast highlights a substantial gender disparity in perceptions and experiences of discrimination within the tech industry.\n\n![image7](image7) illustrates these differences, showing that women in computer jobs are more than four times as likely as men to report gender-related discrimination. Additionally, women in computer jobs are more likely to experience pay inequities and to be treated as if they are not competent due to their gender, with 46% reporting pay inequities compared to 29% of all women in STEM jobs [9]. Furthermore, women in computer jobs are less likely to believe that they are treated fairly in opportunities for promotion and advancement, with only 43% of women believing this compared to 77% of men [11].\n\nIn summary, women in computer jobs face a higher incidence of gender-related discrimination and are less likely to perceive fair treatment in critical areas such as promotion and advancement, reflecting a significant gender gap in the tech industry.\n\n**Answer:** Women in computer jobs are significantly more likely to experience gender-related discrimination than men, with 74% of women reporting such experiences compared to 16% of men."}

In contrast, the share of Hispanic Republicans and Republican leaners who viewed abortion as a very important issue remained relatively stable, rising only from 43% to 48% over the same period. This change in perception aligns with the broader trend observed among all U.S. registered voters, where abortion also became a more significant issue leading up to the 2022 midterm elections. The increase in importance of abortion among Latino voters can be attributed to the Supreme Court's decision to end the federal guarantee of a right to legal abortion, which likely heightened its relevance in their political considerations.

In contrast, third or higher generation Hispanics reported this less frequently, with only 35% saying the same. This trend is mirrored in the image data, particularly in image1, which shows that among self-identified Hispanics, foreign-born individuals (often considered part of the first generation) had the highest frequency of attending cultural celebrations, with 8% reporting \"Often.\" The second generation had 7% reporting \"Often,\" while the third or higher generation had only 6%. This decline across generations is further supported by image7, which shows that the percentage of self-identified Hispanics who attend cultural celebrations \"Often\" decreases from 59% among foreign-born individuals to 49% among the second generation and 35% among the third or higher generation. The data suggests that as individuals move further from their immigrant roots, their engagement with Hispanic cultural celebrations diminishes, which may impact their Hispanic identity and cultural connection as adults. This trend is also reflected in the decline of Spanish language use and cultural traditions across generations, as noted in text quotes [10] and [11], and in image6, which shows a significant drop in Spanish dominant speakers from 61% among foreign-born Hispanics to 6% among the third or higher generation.

When the number of demonstration samples increases from 1 to 5, there is a noticeable improvement in Micro-F1 scores for both datasets. However, further increases in demonstration samples (e.g., to 10 or 20) yield limited additional improvements. This suggests that a moderate number of demonstrations is optimal for enhancing model performance.\n\nIncorporating logical constraints into the demonstrations leads to consistent improvements in Micro-F1 scores across all demonstration sample sizes. For instance, in the MAVEN-ERE dataset, the performance with logical constraints (w. lc) consistently outperforms the performance without logical constraints (w/o. lc) as the number of demonstrations increases. This is evident from the graph where the orange bars representing logical constraints show higher Micro-F1 scores compared to the blue bars without constraints.\n\nThe right graph in image1 further supports this by showing that logical constraints help reduce logical inconsistency over multiple iterations, particularly in the MAVEN-ERE dataset.

The process continues until leaf nodes are reached.\n- **Progressive Focus**: Initially, it provides a broad overview by considering higher layers, then progressively focuses on finer details as it descends through the lower layers.\n- **Control Over Specificity and Breadth**: By adjusting the depth (d) and the number of nodes (k) selected at each layer, the method offers control over the specificity and breadth of the information retrieved. This allows for a more tailored selection of nodes that match the query's detail level.\n\n**Collapsed Tree Retrieval (as depicted in image3)**:\n- **Flattening the Tree**: Instead of traversing the tree layer-by-layer, this method flattens the multi-layered tree into a single layer, bringing all nodes onto the same level for comparison.\n- **Simultaneous Evaluation**: All nodes in the tree are considered collectively, allowing for a more holistic view of the information available.\n- **Simplified Search**: This approach simplifies the search process by evaluating nodes across all layers simultaneously, which can be more efficient for certain types of queries that require a broad understanding of the context.\n\n**Performance Comparison (as shown in image4)**:\n- **Context Length Impact**: The collapsed tree method generally performs better with longer context lengths, peaking at 2000 tokens for the best F1 score in the QASPER dataset.

Here’s a detailed breakdown of the process:\n\n1. **Step 1: System Message + Visual Annotation**\n   - The process begins with the formulation of a system message that defines the desired tone and style of the instruction-response pairs. This is accompanied by visual annotations, which provide essential image information such as bounding boxes and descriptions. These elements serve as prompts for the language model (ChatGPT) to generate the initial instruction-response pairs.\n\n2. **Cold Start**\n   - In this stage, the system focuses on identifying the best system message and in-context examples. This is crucial for setting a strong foundation for the subsequent generation of instruction-response pairs. The cold-start strategy employs a heuristic approach to collect satisfactory in-context examples by prompting ChatGPT solely through system messages and visual annotations. This step ensures that the initial examples are of high quality before scaling up the process.\n\n3. **Step 2: Generate Instruction-Response Pairs**\n   - Utilizing ChatGPT, the system generates the instruction-response pairs based on the visual content provided. This step leverages the capabilities of ChatGPT to create diverse and high-quality pairs that align with the visual context.\n\n4. **Step 3: Filtering**\n   - After generating the initial pairs, a filtering process is applied to ensure the quality of the data. This step involves another round of prompting ChatGPT to refine the instruction-response pairs, ensuring they meet the desired standards for perception, reasoning, and planning capabilities.\n\n5. **Step 4: Translation**\n   - The final step involves translating the instruction-response pairs into eight languages: English, Chinese, Japanese, Spanish, German, French, Korean, and Arabic. This step expands the dataset's accessibility and utility across different linguistic contexts.\n\nThe Sythus pipeline emphasizes the iterative use of ChatGPT and the incorporation of in-context examples to enhance the quality and diversity of the generated instruction-response pairs. This structured approach ensures that the final dataset is robust and capable of supporting various vision-language tasks effectively.\n\n![Sythus Process Flowchart](image2)"}

While relation propagation is designed to enhance the model's ability to handle broader contexts and improve performance in sentences with more entities, as indicated by Figure 4, the actual performance gains are not as substantial as expected. The addition of relation propagation introduces a small computational cost but does not fully compensate for the noise introduced by propagating relations among all possible span pairs.

This process iterates a specified number of times or until a threshold is met, ensuring that the system refines its understanding and output progressively.\n\n- **Recursive Retrieval (Middle in image2)** gradually refines the user query and divides problems into sub-problems, allowing the system to continuously solve complex issues through retrieval and generation. It utilizes query transformation/decomposition to tackle intricate searches, making it particularly useful in scenarios where the user's needs are not initially clear or where the information sought is highly specialized.\n\n- **Adaptive Retrieval (Right in image2)** enables the RAG system to decide when external knowledge retrieval is necessary. It can autonomously determine when to stop retrieval and generation, using special tokens to manage the process dynamically. This approach allows the system to be more efficient and relevant by retrieving information only when needed, enhancing the overall performance and adaptability.\n\nEach method addresses different aspects of the retrieval process, from iterative refinement to query transformation and on-demand retrieval, thereby improving the system's ability to handle diverse and complex tasks effectively.\n\n![Different Retrieval Processes in RAG](image2)\n\nThe iterative approach enhances context richness through repeated cycles, the recursive method improves problem-solving by breaking down complex queries, and the adaptive process optimizes efficiency by selectively retrieving information as needed."}

Each of these segments is independently encoded using a pretrained cross-lingual encoder, which converts the textual input into a numerical format that captures semantic meaning. Following encoding, a pooling layer aggregates the encoded features to produce a fixed-size vector representation for each segment, effectively summarizing the input into a sentence embedding.\n\n![Translation Ranking Model Architecture](image4)\n\nThese sentence embeddings for the source, reference, better hypothesis, and worse hypothesis are then used to compute the triplet margin loss.

Initially, without repetition control, the model is designed to produce 100% questions when z=10. However, when repetition control is introduced, the question-asking rate is reduced to 79.67%. This reduction occurs because the weighted decoding feature, `extrep bigram`, discourages bigrams that are commonly used in questions, such as \"do you\" and \"what is.\" To address this issue, an additional setting was introduced where `z=10 (boost)` is used. This setting allows the model to produce necessary question-asking bigrams by not using the `extrep bigram` feature during weighted decoding but using it to rerank candidates after beam search. As a result, the question-asking rate increases to 99.54%, albeit at the cost of slightly increased external bigram repetition.\n\n![The graph shows how different methods control the frequency of question-asking in generated text.

However, when the adversarial transformation was applied, BERT's performance dropped to a maximum of 53% on the adversarial test set, as shown in Table 5 [5]. This reduction demonstrates that BERT's initial performance was largely due to exploiting these statistical cues rather than genuine comprehension of arguments.\n\nOther models also saw a decline in performance on the adversarial dataset, but the extent of the drop varied. For instance, the BoV and BiLSTM models, which were baselines, showed a more substantial decrease in performance, indicating that they were also heavily reliant on the same cues. The adversarial dataset effectively neutralized these cues, making it challenging for all models to perform well, as evidenced by the random accuracy results across different configurations [3, 5].\n\nThe adversarial transformation, by negating the claims and inverting the labels, ensured that the distribution of statistical cues was mirrored over both labels, eliminating the signal that models could exploit.

This detailed annotation helps in understanding how the Knowledge Graph Language Model (KGLM) processes and generates text by linking entities to their respective facts and relations. Here's how it is represented:\n\n- **Tokens (xt):** These are the individual words or phrases in the text, such as \"Super Mario Land,\" \"1989,\" \"side-scrolling,\" \"platform video game,\" \"developed,\" \"published,\" and \"Nintendo.\"\n\n- **Mention Type (tt):** This indicates whether an entity is a new mention or a reference to an existing entity. For example, \"Super Mario Land\" is a new mention, while \"side-scrolling\" and \"platform video game\" are related to existing concepts.\n\n- **Entity Mentioned (et):** This specifies the entity associated with each token. For instance, \"SML\" represents \"Super Mario Land,\" \"SIDE_SCROLL\" for \"side-scrolling,\" and \"NIN\" for \"Nintendo.\"\n\n- **Relation (rt):** This defines the relationship between entities. For example, \"pub date\" connects \"1989\" to the publication date of \"Super Mario Land,\" and \"genre\" links \"video game\" to \"SML.\"\n\n- **Parent Entity (pt):** This identifies the parent entity connected to other entities through relationships. \"SML\" is the parent entity for the publication date \"04-21-1989\" and the genre \"PVG\" (platform video game).\n\nThe annotations also highlight which entities are new or related based on their reachability by entities linked so far. For instance, \"Game Boy\" is linked to \"Super Mario Land\" as its platform and to \"Nintendo\" as its manufacturer, with \"Super Mario Land\" being more relevant in this context. The annotations help in identifying plausible reasons for mentioning entities and ensuring that the model correctly references existing knowledge.\n\n![Example Annotation](image4) illustrates this structured representation, showing how each token is linked to its corresponding entity and relation, providing a clear view of the model's reasoning process.\n\nIn summary, the"}

For instance, Figure 13 and Figure 12 show that the Hard-to-Contrast initial query strategy (red lines) achieves higher performance in every cycle of active learning on datasets like BloodMNIST and PathMNIST, respectively. The performance of the initial cycle (20 labeled images) and the last cycle (50 labeled images) are strongly correlated, indicating that a good initial query sets a strong foundation for subsequent active learning cycles.\n\nImage 5 further illustrates this by comparing different methods in terms of AUC percentage with varying numbers of labeled images. The red line representing the Hard-to-Contrast strategy generally outperforms other methods across the graphs, demonstrating its effectiveness in both training from scratch and fine-tuning from self-supervised pre-training.\n\nImage 3 provides a bar chart comparing map-based querying strategies across four datasets, where the Hard-to-Contrast strategy tends to outperform others, especially in medical imaging datasets like PathMNIST and BloodMNIST. This suggests that the Hard-to-Contrast strategy is particularly beneficial for datasets with long-tailed distributions, as it enforces label diversity and selects hard-to-contrast data, which are crucial for addressing the cold start problem in active learning.\n\nThe implications for initial query selection in active learning are significant. The choice of initial query can define the efficacy and efficiency of subsequent learning procedures. By selecting hard-to-contrast data, the model can achieve higher AUC scores and better performance in later cycles, as shown in the empirical results across multiple datasets. This strategy not only improves model performance but also mitigates the cold start problem by providing a diverse and informative set of initial data points, which is particularly important in scenarios where labeled data is scarce or imbalanced.\n\nIn conclusion, the Hard-to-Contrast querying strategy significantly enhances active learning performance by consistently achieving higher AUC scores across different numbers of labeled images, making it a strong baseline for initial query selection in image classification tasks.\n\n![Hard-to-Contrast outperforms other strategies in AUC across different labeled images](image5)"}

Initially, as \\( p \\) increases from 0, the AUC metric improves, indicating that incorporating more of the long-term user representation enhances the model's ability to capture diverse user interests effectively. However, when \\( p \\) becomes too large, the performance starts to decline.

Here's how it works:\n\n- **Pre-trained BERT Models**: The model utilizes two BERT models. One BERT model is fixed and acts as a feature extractor for the candidate-value list, generating representations for each categorical slot. The other BERT model is fine-tuned to process the concatenation of domain-slot pairs and recent dialog context. This setup allows the model to leverage the strengths of BERT in encoding both the context and the slot information effectively.\n\n- **Slot Gate Mechanism**: For non-categorical slots, the model employs a two-way linear mapping to find text spans in the dialogue context. This means it looks for specific phrases or words in the conversation that match the slot values. For categorical slots, the model selects the most plausible values from a predefined picklist based on the contextual representation provided by the fine-tuned BERT model.\n\n- **Cosine Similarity Matching**: The representations from the fixed BERT model (candidate values) and the fine-tuned BERT model (context and domain-slot pairs) are matched using cosine similarity. This ensures that the model can accurately determine which candidate values are relevant to the current dialogue context.\n\n- **Direct Interactions**: Unlike previous approaches that separately encode the dialogue context and domain-slot pairs, DS-DST enables direct interactions between them. This interaction is crucial for handling both categorical and non-categorical slots effectively, as it allows the model to understand how the context influences the slot values.\n\n![DS-DST Model Architecture](image8) illustrates the architecture, showing how the fixed BERT model processes candidate values and the fine-tuned BERT model handles the context and domain-slot pairs. The matching process is facilitated by the cosine similarity between these representations, ensuring that the model can accurately determine the relevant slot values based on the dialogue context.\n\nIn summary, the DS-DST model uses a dual strategy with BERT models and direct interactions to determine the matching between candidate values and the dialogue context, achieving improved performance in dialogue state tracking tasks."}

Finally, DNA ligase regains the phosphate-sugar backbone of the DNA strand.\n\n- **Nucleotide Excision Repair (NER)**: This repair system is highly conserved and can excise a wide range of DNA lesions, such as UV-induced pyrimidine dimers and bulky adducts. It is particularly important for repairing damage that can disrupt the DNA structure and function.\n\n- **Direct Reversal Repair**: This mechanism directly repairs specific types of damage, such as UV-induced pyrimidine dimers and alkylation adducts, using enzymes like DNA photolyase and alkyl-transferases.\n\n- **Mismatch Repair (MMR)**: This system corrects mismatched or unpaired bases resulting from errors during DNA replication. It involves complex interactions of enzymes and proteins to recognize and repair mismatches.\n\n- **Recombination Repair**: This mechanism is primarily used to repair double-strand breaks, which are among the most devastating types of DNA damage.

Here's how each module contributes to the solution:\n\n1. **Problem Formulator**: This module uses language processing models, specifically large language models (LLMs), to convert the natural language description of the problem into a symbolic representation. This involves identifying key entities, facts, and rules within the problem statement. The model employs in-context learning to align the natural language statement with its corresponding symbolic form, as described in [1]. For example, in the context of a logical reasoning problem involving Netflix shows and a person named Karen, the Problem Formulator would translate the conditions into symbolic logic predicates and premises, as shown in image3.\n\n2. **Symbolic Reasoner**: Once the problem is formulated symbolically, the Symbolic Reasoner module takes over. This component uses deterministic symbolic solvers, such as logic programming engines, first-order logic provers, or constraint optimization tools, to perform logical inference on the formulated problem. The choice of solver depends on the nature of the problem. For instance, logical programming might be used for problems involving rules, while constraint optimization could be applied to problems with constraints. The Symbolic Reasoner ensures that the reasoning is faithful and transparent by executing deterministic algorithms embedded within the symbolic solver, as explained in [2]. This stage is crucial for maintaining the accuracy and reliability of the solution, as depicted in image5.\n\n3. **Result Interpreter**: The final module, the Result Interpreter, translates the symbolic answer derived by the Symbolic Reasoner back into natural language to provide a comprehensible response to the original problem. This step is essential for making the output understandable to users who may not be familiar with symbolic logic. The Result Interpreter ensures that the solution is presented in a clear and natural language format, as illustrated in image3, where the conclusion is given as (B) False for the question about the popularity of \"Black Mirror.\"\n\nThe integration of these modules allows LOGIC-LM to leverage the strengths of both LLMs and symbolic solvers. LLMs handle the natural language understanding and symbolic formulation, while symbolic solvers provide precise and reliable logical reasoning.

The text quotes discuss the use of knowledge graphs (KGs) for attribution in language models, specifically focusing on the task of Knowledge-aware Language Model Attribution (KaLMA). The image descriptions provide insights into how precision and recall are calculated for generated citations and the evaluation of models.\n\nFrom the text quotes, particularly [6], it is mentioned that KaLMA attributes sentences or phrases to knowledge triplets rather than single entities. This implies that the relations in the knowledge graph are structured to connect entities with specific attributes, which are represented as leaf nodes. The image descriptions, such as image2, explain how precision and recall are calculated based on the model output and a set of minimum knowledge. This suggests that leaf nodes are the specific attributes or entities that are directly connected to the main entity in the knowledge graph.\n\nHowever, the question specifically asks about relation arrows that do not point to specific leaf nodes. In the context of knowledge graphs, leaf nodes are typically the most specific attributes or entities. If a relation arrow does not point to a specific leaf node, it might indicate a more general or abstract relationship that does not directly connect to a specific attribute or entity.\n\nGiven the information from the text and images, it is reasonable to infer that the relation arrows that do not point to specific leaf nodes are those that represent more abstract or general relationships. For example, a relation like \"influence\" might not point to a specific attribute but rather to a broader concept or another entity.\n\nTo visualize this, consider the diagram in image6, which illustrates the influence of Orazio Gentileschi on Artemisia Gentileschi's life and career. The arrows in this diagram likely represent specific attributes like occupation, style, and citizenship, which are direct connections to leaf nodes. However, a relation like \"influence\" might be represented by an arrow that connects to a more general concept rather than a specific attribute.\n\nThus, the relation arrows that do not point to specific leaf nodes are those that represent more abstract or general relationships, such as influence or association, which connect to broader concepts rather than specific attributes.\n\n![Relation arrows representing abstract or general relationships do not point to specific leaf nodes](image"}

However, the coal usage is relatively similar, indicating that both companies still rely on fossil fuels to a considerable extent. This reliance on coal could contribute to higher CO2 emissions, as coal is a major source of greenhouse gases. The implications for CO2 emissions are that Amazon-AWS, with a lower renewable energy share, may have higher emissions per unit of energy consumed compared to Microsoft.

This indicates that the R-GCN component is crucial for maintaining high accuracy, even without accessing contextual information. The R-GCN helps the model perform above Coref-GRU by updating mention representations based on their relation to other entities, which is essential for the task. \n\nIn the masked setting, the impact is even more pronounced.

For instance, removing the abstract from the input leads to a substantial decrease in performance, as shown in the top four rows of Table 2. This suggests that the abstract is crucial for capturing document-level relatedness. Adding author names, despite being a common feature, actually hurts performance, possibly due to the sparsity and tokenization issues with author names in the corpus.

When considering the full model (BERT), it achieves a maximum test set accuracy of 77%, which is surprisingly close to the average untrained human baseline. However, this performance is largely due to exploiting spurious statistical cues in the dataset, as shown in Table 10, where removing these cues reduces BERT's performance to essentially random levels.\n\nThe configurations that include warrants (W) alone yield a maximum accuracy of 71%, accounting for the majority of BERT's performance. Adding reasons (R, W) and claims (C, W) further contributes to the performance, with gains of four and two percentage points respectively, totaling the missing six points. This analysis, as detailed in [5], indicates that BERT's peak performance is entirely reliant on these statistical cues rather than genuine comprehension of arguments.\n\n![BERT's performance across configurations](image4) shows that BERT (Large) has the highest median and maximum scores on the test set, highlighting its robustness in certain configurations. However, when trained on the adversarial dataset, as described in [12], BERT's performance drops to a maximum of 53%, demonstrating the effectiveness of the adversarial approach in eliminating these cues.\n\nIn summary, BERT's test performance is highly dependent on the presence of spurious statistical cues, and its performance is significantly reduced when these cues are eliminated, as seen in the adversarial dataset experiments. This underscores the need for more robust evaluation methods in assessing argument comprehension.\n\n**Answer:** BERT's test performance is highly dependent on exploiting spurious statistical cues, with its maximum accuracy of 77% reduced to random levels on an adversarial dataset."}

The table includes columns for \"All,\" \"– Crowd,\" \"– Head,\" and \"– EL,\" which represent the model's performance when trained on the entire dataset, excluding crowdsourced data, excluding head data, and excluding entity linking data, respectively. The rows are divided into \"Total,\" \"General,\" \"Fine,\" and \"Ultra-Fine,\" each with precision (P), recall (R), and F1-score (F1) metrics.\n\nFrom the table in image3, we can observe the following:\n\n- **Excluding Crowdsourced Data (– Crowd)**: The Ultra-Fine category shows a significant drop in recall and F1 scores compared to the \"All\" dataset. This suggests that the crowdsourced data is crucial for improving recall and F1 scores in the Ultra-Fine category.\n  \n- **Excluding Head Data (– Head)**: The Ultra-Fine category also shows a noticeable decrease in recall and F1 scores when head data is excluded. This indicates that head word supervision is beneficial for predicting ultra-fine labels.\n  \n- **Excluding Entity Linking Data (– EL)**: The impact on the Ultra-Fine category is less pronounced compared to"}

This process is crucial for transmitting signals over long distances with minimal loss, as seen in image7, which illustrates how light is guided through the fiber with minimal diffusion.\n\n![Reflection and Fiber Optics](image2) and ![Fiber Optics](image7) demonstrate how these surfaces effectively reflect light, making them essential in various applications such as telecommunications and imaging.\n\n**Answer:** Mirrors and fiber optics are two examples of reflecting surfaces."}

For example, one plant has the genotype PP (homozygous dominant for purple flowers), and the other has the genotype pp (homozygous recessive for white flowers).\n\n- **Gamete Formation**: Each parent produces gametes carrying only one allele. The PP plant produces gametes with the P allele, while the pp plant produces gametes with the p allele.\n\n- **F₁ Generation (Hybrids)**: When these gametes combine, all offspring in the F₁ generation are heterozygous (Pp) and exhibit the dominant phenotype (purple flowers), as the P allele is dominant over the p allele.\n\n- **F₂ Generation Gametes**: The F₁ hybrids (Pp) produce gametes with a 1:1 ratio of P and p alleles during meiosis.\n\n- **F₂ Offspring**: When these gametes combine randomly, the F₂ generation shows a phenotypic ratio of 3 purple to 1 white flowers. This occurs because:\n  - PP (homozygous dominant) results in purple flowers.\n  - Pp (heterozygous) also results in purple flowers due to the dominant P allele.\n  - pp (homozygous recessive) results in white flowers.\n\n- **Genotypic Ratio**: The genotypic ratio in the F₂ generation is 1 PP: 2 Pp: 1 pp, reflecting the combinations of alleles from the gametes.\n\n![Mendelian Cross Diagram](image4) illustrates this process, showing the cross between purple-flowered and white-flowered plants in the P generation, resulting in all purple-flowered plants in the F₁ generation.

These sensors provide critical data about the engine's operating conditions, including temperature, airflow, throttle position, and crankshaft and camshaft positions.\n\nThe ECU processes this information and uses it to control the injectors, which are responsible for the precise delivery of fuel into the engine. This control is essential for optimizing fuel efficiency and performance. For instance, the ECU adjusts the quantity of fuel injected based on parameters like throttle position and engine temperature, as described in text quotes [3] and [4]. It also manages ignition timing to ensure optimal combustion, as mentioned in text quote [5], and controls idle speed by monitoring engine RPM and adjusting the throttle stop or idle air bypass, as detailed in text quote [6].\n\nIn image2, the ECU is part of the control system that interacts with the fuel metering system and other subsystems to manage fuel and air flow. The diagram illustrates how control signals flow from the detecting system to the control system and then to the fuel metering system, highlighting the ECU's role in coordinating these processes.\n\nAdditionally, the ECU ensures that the engine operates efficiently by monitoring and reporting engine conditions to the Engine Control Module (ECM), as stated in text quote [9].

This process is crucial for ensuring that each daughter cell receives an identical set of genetic material. The image quotes that support this step include image1 and image4, which depict the tangled mass of DNA inside a bacterial cell, indicating the presence of genetic material that is being replicated.\n\n2. **Cell Elongation and Separation of Chromosomes**: The second step involves the elongation of the cell and the further separation of the chromosomal copies. Text quote [11] describes how the cell elongates, and the chromosomal copies separate further. This is visually represented in image8, which shows a bacterial cell dividing into two daughter cells with genetic material being split evenly. The elongation and separation of the chromosomes are essential for the proper distribution of genetic material during cell division.\n\n3. **Plasma Membrane Growth and Cell Division**: The final step is the growth of the plasma membrane inward at the midpoint to divide the cell into two separate daughter cells. Text quote [11] mentions that the plasma membrane grows inward at the midpoint to divide the cells. This process is visually depicted in image8, where the cell is shown dividing into two distinct cells, each containing a copy of the genetic material.\n\nThe image quotes that support the visualization of these steps include image8, which clearly illustrates the process of binary fission in a prokaryotic cell, showing the division of the cell and the distribution of genetic material.\n\nIn summary, the three steps of binary fission in prokaryotic cells are DNA replication, cell elongation and separation of chromosomes, and the growth of the plasma membrane to divide the cell into two daughter cells.

This principle is often illustrated using examples like hot dog consumption, where each additional hot dog provides less utility than the previous one. In standard consumption contexts, as seen in image1 and image8, the utility from consuming hot dogs decreases with each additional unit, eventually leading to negative utility. For instance, the first hot dog might provide a utility of +10, but by the sixth, the utility drops to -10, indicating that consuming more hot dogs beyond a certain point becomes less enjoyable and even detrimental.\n\nHowever, in competitive contexts, such as sports or performance, the application of diminishing marginal utility can differ significantly. In image1, we see a dramatic shift in utility at the 64th hot dog, where the utility jumps from -50 to +5000, suggesting that in competitive scenarios, the utility might not only stabilize or increase after a certain point but could even surpass previous levels. This is particularly relevant in image6, which shows the accumulated practice hours of violinists, where early divergence in practice hours leads to significant differences in outcomes by age 20. The Best violinists accumulate the most practice hours, indicating that in competitive contexts, the focus and repetition of practice can lead to improved skills and outcomes, countering the typical diminishing returns seen in standard consumption.\n\nMoreover, image7 highlights the importance of practice in sports, where the text emphasizes that practice makes the game more fun and increases the likelihood of winning.

The 3D bar chart shows banana exports from various countries over the years 1994 to 2005. Ecuador is one of the countries listed, and while the specific export volumes for Ecuador are not detailed in the description, we can infer that Ecuador likely had a significant presence in the banana export market during this period. The chart's y-axis represents export volume, ranging from 0 to 5,000,000, suggesting that Ecuador's exports were substantial, possibly indicating a consistent or increasing trend in banana exports during this time.\n\nNext, we look at the changes in time spent with family and friends from 2005 to 2010 using **image4**. The pie charts illustrate how time was allocated on weekends during these years. For 2005, time spent with family and friends was 35%, while in 2010, this percentage decreased to 21%. This indicates a shift in how people allocated their weekend time, with a notable decrease in time spent with family and friends.\n\nTo compare these trends, we can apply the principles of Gestalt psychology, particularly the **Law of Proximity** [9], which suggests that objects close together are perceived as part of a group. In both data sets, there is a temporal proximity: the banana export data spans from 1994 to 2005, and the time allocation data spans from 2005 to 2010. The overlap in the year 2005 allows for a direct comparison of the two trends.\n\nThe banana export trend from Ecuador, assuming a consistent or increasing trend, contrasts with the decreasing time spent with family and friends from 2005 to 2010. This contrast highlights a shift in societal priorities or economic activities during this period. The export data suggests a focus on international trade"}

The **Matrix Metering Mode** (image5) measures light across the entire frame, making it ideal for natural landscapes where the light varies across the scene. This ensures that the exposure is balanced across the entire image, capturing both the sky and the foreground without overexposing or underexposing any part. \n\nOn the other hand, **Center Metering Mode** (image5) focuses on light near the center of the screen, which is perfect for portraits. By centering the metering on the subject, it ensures that the face or main subject is correctly exposed, even if the background is bright or dark. This mode is particularly useful in scenarios where the subject is the focal point, and the background lighting is inconsistent.\n\nLastly, **Spot Metering Mode** (image5) focuses on a specific region, such as the subject's eyes, making it ideal for situations where precise exposure of a small area is crucial. This is especially useful in low-light conditions or when the subject is surrounded by varying light intensities.\n\nRegarding **focus modes**, Pro Mode provides several options to ensure the camera locks onto the subject accurately. **AF-S (single autofocus)** (image4) is best for stationary subjects, ensuring that the focus remains sharp on the subject without adjusting as it moves. This is ideal for portraits or still life photography where the subject doesn't move much. \n\n**AF-C (continuous autofocus)** (image4) is designed for moving subjects, such as sports or wildlife photography. It continuously adjusts the focus as the subject moves, keeping it sharp and in focus throughout the shot. This mode is essential for capturing action without blur.\n\nFor more manual control, **MF (manual focus)** allows the user to touch the subject of interest to focus on it, such as the subject's face. This is particularly useful in low-light conditions or when the camera's autofocus struggles to lock onto the subject.\n\n![Comprehensive guide to using Pro Mode settings]("}
