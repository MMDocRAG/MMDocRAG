According to [7], half of Americans in 2019 believed that spending levels should remain the same, a significant change from 2017 when 45% felt that European allies should dedicate more resources to national defense. This shift is further illustrated in image4, which shows a decrease in the percentage of Americans advocating for an increase in defense spending from 45% in 2017 to 35% in 2019. Additionally, partisan differences are evident: Republicans and Republican-leaning independents, who were more likely to support increased defense spending in Europe, have seen a decline in this view by 14 percentage points between 2017 and 2019, as highlighted in [12] and image3.\n\nIn Germany, the public is divided on whether to increase or maintain current levels of defense spending. In 2017, about half of Germans were content with their country’s defense spending, while about a third felt it should be increased. By 2019, the division was more pronounced, with roughly equal support for increasing and maintaining spending, as shown in [3] and image4. This change indicates a growing debate within Germany about defense priorities.

In contrast, the automated scoring of people up for parole is viewed as 49% effective and 50% fair, with a negligible difference of -1 point [8].\n\nImage8 provides a clear visual representation of these differences, showing the percentage of respondents who find each system effective versus fair. The largest gap is observed in the personal finance score, where the effectiveness is perceived higher than fairness by 22 points. This indicates a notable mistrust in the fairness of financial assessments, despite their perceived utility. The smaller gaps in other systems suggest relatively balanced views, but still highlight concerns about fairness.\n\nImage3 further illustrates these perceptions, with 33% of respondents finding the personal finance score not fair at all, compared to 17% for parole scoring. This reinforces the text's point that fairness concerns are particularly pronounced in financial contexts [3]. Image2 shows that 68% find the personal finance score unacceptable, while 56% find the criminal risk assessment unacceptable, aligning with the text's assertion that fairness is a major concern [2].\n\nThe demographic variations mentioned in the text, such as racial differences in perceptions of fairness, are also crucial. For example, blacks are more likely to find the personal finance score fair compared to whites, but also more concerned about parole scoring [10]. This adds a layer of complexity to public trust, indicating that trust levels can vary based on personal experiences and societal contexts.\n\nIn summary, the data from both text and images suggest that while some systems are perceived as effective, concerns about fairness significantly impact public trust, particularly in financial and employment contexts. This implies a need for greater transparency and fairness in algorithm design to build trust.\n\n![Image8 shows the effectiveness and fairness perceptions of various automated systems, highlighting a significant gap in the personal finance score](image8)\n\n![Image3 illustrates"}

According to the data, Mountain View and Palo Alto have seen significant ridership growth, with Palo Alto experiencing a 38% increase from 2012 to 2014 and Mountain View a 16% increase during the same period [image5]. This growth reflects the rapid development in these areas, as highlighted by the map showing the expansion of housing and job opportunities along the transit corridor [image3]. \n\nThe crowded conditions on trains, as evidenced by the image of a packed train interior [image2] and the table indicating that trains often exceed seated capacity (e.g., 135% to 158% during peak times) [image6], underscore the strain on existing transit infrastructure. The high demand for transit in these areas is driven by millennials and younger individuals who prefer living in transit-accessible locations, reducing their reliance on cars [1]. However, the current infrastructure, with 40 at-grade crossings and limited frequency, exacerbates congestion and stress at intersections [3], further impacting capacity.\n\nThe image of a busy train station [image7] visually reinforces the high volume of passengers, while the heavy traffic depicted in [image8] suggests that many commuters might otherwise be contributing to road congestion if not for the transit system. To accommodate the projected doubling of Caltrain ridership from 60,000 to 120,000 daily trips [10], improvements such as grade separations and increased service frequency are essential to manage growth and enhance capacity [8].\n\nIn summary, the ridership growth in Mountain View and Palo Alto directly contributes to train overcrowding, necessitating infrastructure upgrades to meet demand and maintain efficient transit service.\n\n![Mountain View and Palo Alto ridership growth from 2012 to 2014](image5)  \n![Crowded train interior](image2)  \n![Heavy traffic congestion](image8)  \n\nThe increase in ridership in Mountain View and Palo Alto contributes to train overcrowding, highlighting the need for capacity improvements."}

According to the data, the USA has the highest CO2 emissions per capita, as shown in image3, where the bubble size represents total CO2 emissions. The USA's bubble is the largest, indicating substantial emissions, while China and Germany have smaller bubbles, suggesting lower per capita emissions. This aligns with text [8], which states that the size of the bubble reflects the total CO2 emissions from energy use.\n\nIn terms of motor vehicle ownership, image3 also shows that the USA has a high percentage share in global motor vehicle demand, which correlates with higher emissions. China, despite having a large population, has lower per capita emissions but is projected to have rising GHG emissions from passenger vehicles, as noted in text [10]. Germany, known for stringent vehicle standards (text [11]), balances lower emissions with moderate vehicle ownership.\n\nThe environmental implications are clear: the USA's high emissions per capita and significant vehicle ownership contribute to a larger carbon footprint. China's growing vehicle market and emissions suggest potential future increases in environmental impact. Germany's stringent standards help mitigate emissions despite vehicle ownership, highlighting effective policy measures.\n\n![The USA has the highest CO2 emissions per capita and significant motor vehicle ownership](image3)\n\nIn conclusion, the USA has the highest CO2 emissions per capita and significant motor vehicle ownership, implying a larger environmental impact compared to China and Germany."}

This highlights a robust activity in the European venture capital market. However, the distribution of these events varies by region, with Germany and the UK leading in terms of total exits, as depicted in image1. Germany has a total exited value of $4.4 billion, while the UK follows with $3.9 billion, indicating strong regional performance.\n\nIn terms of investment efficiency, Europe demonstrates higher capital efficiency compared to the USA. Text quote [1] states that Europe produces higher exit multiples despite lower average exit values, which is supported by image4, showing that European ventures have a median multiple of cash invested at 7.2, compared to 4.5 in the USA. This suggests that European ventures are more efficient in generating returns relative to the capital invested.\n\nThe IPO performance also differs between the regions. Image2 illustrates that the Europe IPO index value has been more volatile but has shown a recovery trend, while the U.S. IPO index has been relatively stable but lower in overall value. This indicates that European IPOs might be experiencing a resurgence, aligning with text quote [6], which notes that European VC is driving the best exit multiples globally.\n\nFurthermore, the scarcity of VC money in Europe, as mentioned in text quote [4], has led to lower entry valuations and higher capital efficiency. Image7 shows that since 2004, Europe has had a higher percentage of exits with values over $100 million compared to the USA, with 22% of European exits exceeding this threshold versus 18% in the USA. This efficiency is also reflected in the higher hit rate and yield for European funds, as stated in text quote [11].\n\nHowever, the European venture capital industry faces challenges, such as a lack of institutional investors, which is a barrier to growth, as highlighted in text quote [4]. This contrasts with the US, where market publication requirements ensure more transparency and active participation of funds, as noted in text quote [8].\n\nIn summary, while Europe lags in total investment amounts, its higher capital efficiency and strong exit multiples indicate a mature and efficient venture capital ecosystem, despite structural challenges.\n\n![Europe has a total exited value of $"}

According to the text, European VC has emerged with strong fundamentals, benefiting from higher capital efficiency than the US [2]. This efficiency is partly due to lower entry valuations and a scarcity of VC money, which allows investors to be more selective [10][11]. Despite average exit values being about 25% smaller in Europe, the higher capital efficiency and lower entry valuations compensate for this, leading to better exit multiples [9].\n\nImage4 illustrates that the median multiple of cash invested in Europe is 7.2, compared to 4.5 in the USA. Additionally, 57.26% of European exits have a multiple of cash ≥5, while in the USA, this figure is 47.27%. This indicates that European VC drives better exit multiples globally [6]. Image6 further supports this by showing numerous European companies achieving exit multiples of 5-10x and over 10x, highlighting successful exits despite lower average values.\n\nIn summary, European venture capital outperforms the USA in terms of investment multiples due to higher capital efficiency and selective investments, even though average exit values are smaller. ![European VC has higher median multiples and a greater percentage of exits with multiples ≥5 compared to the USA](image4) ![European companies achieve significant exit multiples](image6) European VC outperforms the USA in investment multiples due to higher capital efficiency and selective investments."}

This dialogue state is used by the dialogue state tracker to update the estimation of the user's goals, represented as slot-value pairs.\n\nThe policy network, which takes inputs from the dialogue state, slot value logits, and query results encoding, emits a system action in the form of a dialogue act, as detailed in [5].

As shown in ![image3](image3), removing spatial positional encodings leads to a significant drop in AP (from 40.6 to 32.8). Passing fixed sine encodings at the input results in a minor drop (-1.4 AP), while learned encodings at attention layers yield the best results (40.6 AP).\n   - **Output Positional Encodings**: These are required and cannot be removed. Passing them at the input or at every attention layer shows minimal differences, with the latter being slightly better.\n\n2. **Loss Components**:\n   - **Class and GIoU Losses**: The combination of class and GIoU losses improves AP.

Initially, the system applies two additional pre-processing steps: cropping and blurring. As shown in image7, the image is divided into regions based on proposal bounding box coordinates, and each region is resized to a fixed proportion. This step is crucial because, unlike in image classification tasks where objects are often large and centrally positioned, objects in detection datasets are smaller and more varied in position. The blurring technique is then employed on non-target areas to direct the model's focus toward the relevant objects, enhancing their identification.\n\nAfter pre-processing, the system uses an encoder to generate embeddings for each cropped region, as depicted in image7. These embeddings are indexed and stored in a memory bank, allowing for efficient retrieval. The retrieval process involves querying this memory bank to find the top-k similar results, which are then ranked by the MLLM. This ranking is based on the MLLM's ability to assess the contextual appropriateness of each class name with the input image, as mentioned in [4]. The MLLM combines its internal knowledge with the retrieved information to make the final prediction, ensuring a more accurate classification, as highlighted in [7].\n\nThe effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated in image3, where the RAR method significantly improves performance metrics such as AP_r, AP_c, and AP_all across different models, showing the system's ability to enhance object detection tasks.

The hypothesis that pre-training is more effective for linguistically similar languages is supported by the observation that gains are larger for similar language pairs [3]. Additionally, pre-training is most effective when there is a moderate amount of training data, typically with baseline BLEU scores in the range of 3-4 [4]. The effectiveness of pre-training is also influenced by whether the system is bilingual or multilingual; in multilingual systems, aligning embeddings is beneficial, whereas in bilingual systems, it may not be necessary [11][12].\n\nImage1 shows the BLEU scores for different language pairs, highlighting that languages with no common family (e.g., HE → PT) see significant gains, while those with more similarity (e.g., ES → PT) also benefit, albeit to a slightly lesser extent. This supports the text's assertion that pre-training is more effective for languages with larger headroom for improvement [1].\n\nImage2 illustrates the relationship between training set size and BLEU score improvements. It shows that pre-training provides the most significant gains when the training set size is small but not too small, aligning with the text's finding that pre-training is effective in this sweet spot [4].

Smaller datasets, like GL → EN, show larger relative improvements with pre-training, reinforcing the point that pre-training is particularly useful for low-resource scenarios [12].\n\nImage4 demonstrates that pre-training improves the F-measure for target words, especially for low-frequency words, indicating that pre-trained embeddings help capture rarer vocabulary better [7].

As shown in [4], removing R-GCN from a GloVe-based model results in an 8.0-point drop in accuracy on the unmasked validation set. This highlights the importance of R-GCN in updating mention representations based on their relations, even without context. The impact is further illustrated in ![Model performance with and without R-GCN](image4), where the absence of R-GCN leads to a substantial decrease in accuracy for both unmasked (62.4) and masked (63.2) settings compared to the full model (68.5 and 71.6, respectively).\n\nSecondly, the type of relations used in the graph also affects performance. The ablation study in [7] reveals that removing DOC-BASED connections, which link mentions within the same document, has a more significant impact than removing MATCH or COREF connections. This is because DOC-BASED connections provide critical information about mentions appearing closely in the document. The data in ![Model performance with different relation types](image4) shows that removing DOC-BASED connections results in a drop to 62.9 in the unmasked setting, while removing MATCH or COREF connections leads to less severe drops (64.3 and 64.8, respectively). This suggests that while all relation types contribute, DOC-BASED connections are most vital.\n\nLastly, the use of coreference links (COREF) is less impactful and can even degrade performance on the test set, as noted in [7]. The table in ![Model performance with coreference](image4) indicates that including COREF slightly improves the unmasked setting (64.8) but is not reported for the masked setting, and the ensemble model without coreference performs better overall (71.2 in masked).\n\nIn summary, R-GCN and DOC-BASED relations are essential for maintaining high performance, while other relation types like COREF have a marginal or sometimes negative impact.\n\nThe removal of R-GCN and specific relation types significantly degrades model performance, with DOC-BASED connections being most critical."}

Specifically, the model makes better use of DOC-BASED connections than MATCH or COREF connections, primarily because the majority of connections are between mentions in the same document, and removing these connections removes important contextual information [8]. However, when coreference information is included, there is an observed performance degradation on the test set, likely due to the test documents being more challenging for the coreference system [8]. This suggests that while coreference links can aid in some cases, they may not be reliable across all datasets, particularly when the test set presents additional difficulties.\n\nIn the masked setting, the model does not apply the coreference resolution system due to masking, yet it performs better because coreferred mentions are labeled with the same identifier, simplifying the task [5]. This is evident in the results where the Entity-GCN with coreference (single model) shows a lower performance in the unmasked setting compared to the version without coreference, as seen in the table [image8].

Specifically, the joint accuracy drops from 58.98% to 53.54% with GEM, whereas naive fine-tuning results in a more drastic drop to 36.08%.

The results indicate that all tested MT systems exhibit significant gender bias, with varying degrees of accuracy and bias across languages.\n\n**Accuracy and Bias Metrics:**\n- **Accuracy (Acc):** This measures the percentage of instances where the translation correctly preserves the gender from the original English sentence. The best-performing model for each language often does not significantly outperform random guessing, except for German, where three out of four systems achieve higher accuracy [7].\n- **Δ_G (Gender Performance Difference):** Higher values indicate stronger gender bias. For example, Google Translate shows a Δ_G of 23.4 for Spanish, while SYSTRAN has a Δ_G of 46.3 for the same language [4].\n- **Δ_S (Stereotypical vs. Non-Stereotypical Bias):** This metric shows the performance difference between stereotypical and non-stereotypical gender roles.

This bias is quantified by metrics such as the difference in performance (Δ_S) between pro-stereotypical and anti-stereotypical gender roles. For instance, Google Translate shows higher accuracy on stereotypical roles compared to non-stereotypical ones across tested languages [2]. The addition of stereotypical adjectives, such as \"handsome\" and \"pretty,\" to the dataset is shown to improve performance in some languages, significantly reducing bias in Spanish, Russian, and Ukrainian [9].\n\nImage1 provides a detailed comparison of translation accuracy (Acc) and the difference in performance (Δ_G and Δ_S) for various systems across languages.

Initially, BERT achieved a peak performance of 77% on the original dataset, which was surprisingly close to the average untrained human baseline [1]. However, this performance was attributed to the exploitation of statistical cues, particularly the presence of cue words like \"not\" in the warrants [2]. \n\nWhen evaluated on the adversarial dataset, which was designed to eliminate these cues by mirroring the distribution of cues across labels, BERT's performance dropped dramatically. Image3 shows that BERT's mean accuracy on the adversarial test set reduced to 50.4%, with a median of 50.5% and a maximum of 53% [6]. This decline indicates that the adversarial dataset successfully removed the spurious signals that BERT was exploiting, leading to results that align more closely with random guessing. \n\nThe adversarial setup involved training and validating models on adversarial data, which included negated claims and inverted labels to balance the statistical cues [8][9]. This method effectively forced models to rely less on superficial patterns and more on understanding the underlying arguments. The results, as depicted in image3, demonstrate that without these cues, BERT's performance is significantly impaired, suggesting that the model has not genuinely learned to comprehend arguments [10].\n\nFurthermore, image2 highlights the original performance of BERT (Large) on the non-adversarial dataset, where it achieved a mean test accuracy of 67.1% and a peak of 77%, reinforcing the notion that the model was leveraging statistical shortcuts. The adversarial transformation, as shown in image6, involved creating mirrored examples to disrupt these cues, which is crucial for a more robust evaluation of argument comprehension.\n\nIn conclusion, the adversarial data setup exposes BERT's reliance on spurious statistics and underscores the necessity of using such datasets to ensure models are evaluated on their true comprehension abilities rather than their ability to exploit dataset biases.

However, the reduction in tax benefits might be attributed to changes in tax laws, such as the increase in the FDII tax rate from 13% to 16% starting in 2027, as mentioned in the text [1]. Additionally, the company's restructuring efforts and changes in tax positions, such as the derecognition of deferred tax assets, could have impacted the tax provision [8].\n\nThese changes might influence the company's financial strategy by necessitating adjustments in tax planning and cash flow management.

These assumptions are crucial for calculating the defined benefit obligation (DBO). The discount rates are determined by yields on high-quality corporate bonds or government bond yields if necessary.\n\n![Discount rates for 2021 and 2020](image1) shows that the discount rates for the Euro and U.S. dollar have increased from 0.9% to 1.0% and from 2.4% to 2.7%, respectively, between 2020 and 2021. This increase in discount rates generally reduces the present value of future obligations, thereby decreasing the DBO.\n\n![Effect of a change in discount rate on defined benefit obligation](image4) illustrates that a 0.5 percentage-point increase in the discount rate would decrease the DBO by €271 million in 2021, compared to a decrease of €266 million in 2020. This indicates a slightly higher sensitivity to discount rate changes in 2021.\n\n![Actuarial gains and losses](image6) highlights that actuarial losses in 2021 were €22 million, primarily due to changes in financial assumptions, whereas there were actuarial gains of €67 million in 2020.

By 2019, the net income decreased to $5,017 million, and the retained earnings balance dropped to $2,309 million [8]. This decline can be attributed to significant share repurchases of $5,100 million and dividends declared and paid of $2,555 million, which reduced the retained earnings substantially [6].\n\nIn 2020, the net income further decreased to $5,545 million, and the retained earnings balance at the end of the year was $1,920 million [8]. The reduction in retained earnings was primarily due to continued share repurchases of $4,547 million and dividends declared and paid of $3,426 million [6]. Despite the decrease in net income, the company maintained a strong cash position, ending 2020 with $6.57 billion in cash and cash equivalents, an increase of $1.18 billion from 2019 [7].\n\nThe company's strategic focus on returning capital to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, as well as the impact of operational expenses and strategic investments, significantly influenced these financial metrics.

These changes are illustrated in the following images:\n\n![Discount rate and expected return changes for Pension Benefits](image2)  \n![Discount rate and expected return changes for Other Retiree Benefits](image2)\n\nThe increase in the discount rate generally reduces the present value of future obligations, potentially lowering the net amount recognized for both Pension and Other Retiree Benefits.

This increase was primarily driven by the recovery of the market post-COVID-19, with a notable 51.9% rise in revenue from 2020 to 2021. However, when compared to 2019, the revenue still showed a 26.6% increase, indicating a strong recovery and growth trajectory. The operating costs and expenses also rose by 59.0%, reflecting higher costs associated with services like Sky’s wireless phone and broadband, as mentioned in [12]. Despite these increased costs, the Adjusted EBITDA improved by 6.5%, highlighting operational efficiencies and strategic investments.\n\n**Customer Relationships:**\n- The total customer relationships remained relatively stable, with a slight decrease from 23,280 in 2019 to 23,027 in 2021, as depicted in image5. The net additions/losses in customer relationships were -198 in 2021, compared to -56 in 2020 and 394 in 2019.

According to the text, credit risk RWA increased in 2020 primarily due to higher derivatives exposures, investment securities from the E*TRADE acquisition, lending commitments, and equity investments [3]. The image data shows that the balance of credit risk RWA rose from $342,684 million in 2019 to $387,066 million in 2020 under the Standardized Approach, and from $228,927 million to $284,930 million under the Advanced Approach [4]. This increase reflects heightened risk exposure, necessitating higher capital buffers to maintain regulatory compliance and financial stability.\n\nSecondly, the External TLAC as a percentage of RWA decreased from 49.9% in 2019 to 47.7% in 2020 [7]. This decline indicates a relative reduction in the institution's capacity to absorb losses in a stressed scenario, which could impact its ability to meet regulatory requirements without additional capital measures. The regulatory minimum for External TLAC is 18.0%, and the required ratio is 21.5%, so while the institution remains above these thresholds, the reduction suggests a tighter margin.\n\nThese changes collectively imply that the institution faced increased risk exposure, requiring adjustments in its capital structure to ensure compliance with regulatory standards. The higher RWA necessitates more capital to maintain required ratios, while the slight decrease in External TLAC as a percentage of RWA underscores the need for ongoing vigilance in managing loss-absorbing capacity.\n\n![Credit Risk RWA increased significantly in 2020, reflecting higher risk exposure](image4)  \n![External TLAC as a percentage of RWA decreased from 49.9% to 47.7%](image7)\n\nThe financial institution's overall capital structure was affected by increased risk-weighted assets and a slight reduction in loss-absorbing capacity relative to RWA, necessitating careful management to meet regulatory requirements."}

To mitigate these risks, Nestlé implemented policies and procedures to ensure the health and safety of their people, products, and sites, and developed business continuity and disaster recovery plans [6].\n\nThe images provide insights into Nestlé's factory distribution across different regions. Image1 shows the Americas (AMS) with various countries listed, indicating the presence of factories and their operational status. Similarly, Image3 details the distribution in Africa (Afr), and Image5 in Europe, Middle East, and North Africa (EMENA). These images illustrate the geographic spread of Nestlé's manufacturing facilities, which is crucial for understanding how supply chain disruptions could affect different regions differently.\n\nNestlé's response to supply chain risks involved enhancing their digital capabilities and optimizing transport and production schedules using AI-powered tools, as mentioned in the text [10]. This approach helps in quickly adapting to changes in demand and optimizing logistics, which is essential given the widespread distribution of their factories as seen in the images.\n\nIn conclusion, Nestlé's potential impacts from supply chain disruptions include supply shortages and increased costs, while their mitigations involve robust health and safety measures and advanced logistics planning.

The increase in total assets indicates that the company has expanded its asset base, which could be due to investments in property, plant, and equipment, or an increase in receivables and inventories, suggesting potential growth in operations or expansion efforts.\n\nRegarding cash flow from operating activities, the consolidated segment reported a net cash provided by operating activities of $6,493 million in 2021, up from $3,003 million in 2020, as detailed in image2. This significant increase of $3,490 million is primarily attributed to higher profit before taxes adjusted for non-cash items, including higher accruals for short-term incentive compensation, and lower payments for short-term incentive compensation, as mentioned in [1] and [5]. However, this was partially offset by increased working capital requirements, particularly in inventory and accounts receivable, which negatively impacted cash flow.\n\nThe implications of these changes are multifaceted. The increase in total assets suggests that the company is investing in its long-term growth, which could lead to enhanced production capabilities and market expansion. The improved cash flow from operating activities indicates stronger operational performance and better management of working capital, providing the company with more liquidity to fund its operations, invest in new projects, or return value to shareholders. However, the need to manage working capital effectively, as highlighted by the unfavorable changes in inventory and receivables, remains crucial to sustaining this positive trend.\n\n![Total assets increased from $78,324 million in 2020 to $82,793 million in 2021](image1)  \n![Net cash provided by operating activities increased from $3,003 million in 2020 to $6,493 million in 2021](image2)\n\nThe total assets and cash flow from operating activities both increased from 2020 to 2021, indicating growth and improved operational efficiency, but require careful management of working capital to sustain these positive trends."}

This decrease is primarily attributed to a decline in cash and cash equivalents, which dropped from $32,965 million to $22,028 million, as shown in image1. The reduction in cash and cash equivalents is largely due to an increase in Card Member loans and receivables, debt maturities, share repurchases, and a reduction in customer deposits, as mentioned in [9].\n\n- **Total Liabilities**: Increased from $17,679 million in 2020 to $17,244 million in 2021, a decrease of $435 million. This change reflects adjustments in customer deposits and other liabilities, as detailed in image1.\n\nThese changes relate to the entity's comprehensive income and cash flows in the following ways:\n\n- **Comprehensive Income**: The comprehensive income for 2021 was $8,010 million, a significant decrease from $2,977 million in 2020, as shown in image2. This decline is influenced by net unrealized losses on debt securities and foreign currency translation adjustments, which impacted the entity's financial position.\n\n- **Cash Flows**: The net cash provided by operating activities increased from $3,135 million in 2020 to $8,060 million in 2021, as depicted in image7. This increase is due to higher net income and adjustments for non-cash items like provisions for credit losses and depreciation. However, the net cash used in financing activities also increased, primarily due to share repurchases and dividends, which affected the cash and cash equivalents balance.\n\nThe interplay between these financial metrics indicates that while the entity experienced a reduction in total assets, it also saw a significant increase in operating cash flows, which were offset by higher financing outflows, impacting the overall liquidity position.\n\n![Total assets decreased by $2,012 million from 2020 to 2021, primarily due to a reduction in cash and cash equivalents.](image1)  \n![Comprehensive income decreased from $2"}

This increase is also reflected in the effective tax rate, which dropped from 41% in 2019 to 12% in 2021, as shown in image2. The effective tax rate's decline is attributed to various factors, including the benefit from the FDII deduction and excess tax benefits associated with share-based awards, which were particularly notable in 2021 [2].\n\nIn 2019, Qualcomm recorded a significant tax benefit of $570 million due to establishing new U.S. net deferred tax assets from foreign subsidiaries' check-the-box elections [8]. However, this was offset by a $2.5 billion charge in the same year due to the derecognition of a deferred tax asset related to intellectual property distributed to a U.S. subsidiary [8]. These events contributed to the high effective tax rate of 41% in 2019, as seen in image2.\n\nThe unrecognized tax benefits also saw fluctuations, with an ending balance of $1,705 million in 2019, increasing to $2,136 million in 2021, primarily due to expected refunds of Korean withholding taxes [10].

In 2019, the company had a current provision benefit of $3,095 million, largely due to foreign tax benefits, while in 2021, the current provision benefit was $1,231 million, with a significant portion from foreign sources [7].

This approach ensures that remuneration is not only tied to corporate performance but also reflects individual contributions and responsibilities [3].

These changes are reflected in the actuarial gains and losses, which showed a total actuarial loss of €22 million in 2021 compared to a gain of €67 million in 2020. The actuarial losses were primarily due to changes in financial assumptions, which contributed to a €26 million decrease, while experience gains and losses resulted in a €12 million gain. This suggests that adverse changes in financial assumptions, such as discount rates and compensation increases, negatively affected the defined benefit obligation and plan assets. ![Actuarial gains and losses were -22 million in 2021, compared to 67 million in 2020](image4) [4].\n\nThe defined benefit obligation and plan assets were influenced by changes in key assumptions, including discount rates and compensation increases.

According to the text, net interest income for 2020 was $27.6 billion, a decrease of $2.9 billion or 9.5% compared with 2019 [9]. This decline was primarily due to lower average market interest rates across major currencies, which reduced the yield on average interest-earning assets (AIEA) by 84 basis points. However, this was partly offset by interest income from the growth in AIEA, which increased by $170.1 billion or 8.8% [9].

This decline was primarily due to a significant reduction in interest and other investment income, which fell from $1,059 million in 2020 to $589 million in 2021, a decrease of 44.4% [6]. The reduction in interest income was attributed to lower yields on short-term investments and fixed maturity securities, as short-term interest rates remained low throughout 2021 [9]. Despite this, dividend income increased slightly from $4,890 million in 2020 to $5,060 million in 2021, reflecting changes in the investment portfolio and dividend payments from certain investees [2].\n\nOn the other hand, railroad operating earnings increased from $7,752 million in 2020 to $8,811 million in 2021, a rise of 13.7% [8]. This improvement was driven by higher railroad operating revenues, which grew by 11.6% due to increased freight volumes and higher average revenue per car/unit [5]. The volume increase was largely due to the recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic impacts seen in 2020, with continued improvements in service and productivity partially offsetting higher fuel costs [5][11].

This growth is primarily attributed to the Cytiva Acquisition, which expanded the company's operational footprint and lease commitments. The increase in ROU assets indicates a higher investment in leased assets, which could be part of the company's strategy to manage capital expenditure efficiently by leasing rather than purchasing assets outright. The total operating lease liabilities also rose to $974 million in 2020 from $797 million in 2019, aligning with the increased ROU assets and reflecting the company's expanded lease obligations. ![Lease assets and liabilities increased in 2020](image4)\n\n**Inventories:**\n- Inventories in 2020 totaled $2,292 million, a significant increase from $1,628 million in 2019. This rise is largely due to the inclusion of Cytiva's inventories post-acquisition, which added $664 million to the total. The composition of inventories also shifted, with raw materials increasing from $510 million to $691 million, work in process from $285 million to $369 million, and finished goods from $833 million to $1,232 million. This suggests a ramp-up in production activities and inventory management to support higher sales volumes and meet market demand, particularly in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. ![Inventories increased significantly in 2020](image6)\n\nThese changes are reflected in the financial statements through higher operating expenses and asset values, impacting both the balance sheet and income statement.

For coal, the report highlights that Underlying EBITDA decreased by US$1.3 billion to US$288 million due to lower prices and volumes, with price impacts net of costs amounting to US$0.7 billion [2]. Additionally, Queensland Coal's unit costs are expected to rise between US$80 and US$90 per tonne in FY2022, influenced by higher diesel prices, although mine plan optimization and efficiency are expected to offset increased stripping requirements [3]. The table in image6 shows a decline in average realized prices for metallurgical coal from US$130.97 to US$106.64 per tonne and thermal coal from US$57.10 to US$58.42 per tonne, reflecting market volatility [image6].\n\nFor nickel, the report notes that Underlying EBITDA for Nickel West increased by US$296 million to US$259 million in FY2021, driven by higher prices and volumes, despite unfavorable exchange rate movements [9]. The average realized sales price for nickel rose to US$16,250 per tonne in FY2021 from US$13,860 per tonne in FY2020, supported by strong demand and supply disruptions [6]. The impact of a US$1 per tonne decline in nickel price on profit after taxation is estimated at US$1 million, underscoring the sensitivity of financial performance to price fluctuations [5].\n\n![Commodity price impacts on coal and nickel financials](image5) illustrates the estimated impact on profit after taxation and Underlying EBITDA from changes in commodity prices, showing a US$1 per tonne decline in nickel price affects profit by US$1 million and EBITDA by US$1 million.

The Health Insurance Industry Tax, which was permanently repealed effective January 1, 2021, significantly affected the year-over-year comparability of financial statements, including the effective tax rate [2][11]. Additionally, the table in image7 shows the detailed components contributing to the tax provision, highlighting the various adjustments and their impacts over the years.\n\n![The provision for income taxes increased from $3,562 million in 2018 to $4,973 million in 2020](image7)\n\nThe provision for income taxes increased from $3,562 million in 2018 to $4,973 million in 2020."}

Initially, the population surged dramatically, growing from just 130 in 1870 to 8,267 by 1880 and peaking at 14,096 in 1890 [1]. This rapid increase was primarily driven by the Homestead Act of 1862, which attracted settlers by offering 160 acres of land to those who could establish a permanent residence and farm it for five years [5]. The Transcontinental Railroad Act of the same year also played a crucial role by facilitating westward expansion and transforming Nebraska into a booming agricultural hub [5]. \n\n![Population growth in Hamilton County from 1870 to 1890](image2) illustrates the sharp rise in population during this period, highlighting the impact of these legislative acts. The county's population growth was further bolstered by the influx of immigrants from states like Missouri, Iowa, Illinois, Ohio, and New England, as well as from countries such as Germany, Sweden, England, and Russia, who settled in distinct ethnic clusters [2]. These settlers established rural school districts and religious congregations, contributing to the community's development [1][12].\n\nHowever, after reaching its peak in 1890, Hamilton County's population began a slow decline, with numbers dropping to 9,403 by 2000 [1]. This decline can be attributed to several factors. The mechanization of agriculture, which started in the early 20th century, led to larger farm sizes and fewer farm units, reducing the need for a large rural workforce [6]. As shown in ![Population decline from 1890 to 2000](image2), the population steadily decreased, reflecting the broader trend of rural depopulation in the Midwest and Great Plains [8][9]. Additionally, the consolidation of farms and the shift in economic focus away from small-scale agriculture impacted local towns, many of which struggled to maintain their populations [8][10].\n\nThe map of Hamilton County ![Hamilton County, Nebraska](image3) provides a geographical context, showing the distribution of towns like Aurora, which experienced population gains, while others faced decline [8].

According to the text, European venture capital statistics are notoriously misleading, with performance data often skewed by the poor quality of published industry fund statistics [6]. The image illustrates that pre-bubble vintage years (1997-2001) had a higher proportion of realized values, while post-bubble vintages (2004 onwards) show a complete transition to unrealized values, indicating that these funds are still growing and have not yet reached their full potential [![Post-bubble vintages have 100% unrealized values](image1)]. This suggests that the performance of post-bubble vintages is better than previously reported, as evidenced by recent exits across top-tier funds, and they are now at an inflection point [7].\n\nThe trend depicted is that European venture funds, particularly those from post-bubble vintages, have substantial unrealized potential, reflecting a maturing industry with improving performance metrics. This is further supported by the dramatic changes in the European venture ecosystem, such as Germany's increased exit activity, which is enhancing the performance of post-bubble vintages [4][5].\n\n**Answer:** The trend shows a shift to 100% unrealized values in post-bubble vintages, indicating growing potential and improved performance in European venture funds."}

However, there was a dramatic increase in the following decades, reaching a peak of 14,096 by 1890, as shown in the text [2] and supported by the data in image3. This rapid growth was driven by the expansion of railroads and the establishment of numerous rural school districts, which attracted settlers to the area [2][4]. \n\nAfter 1890, the population began to decline, with numbers slowly decreasing over the years. By 1940, the population had dropped to 9,982, and by 1950, it further decreased to 8,778. This decline can be attributed to factors such as farm consolidation and the shift in economic focus, which led to smaller towns struggling to maintain their populations [5][11]. Despite this overall downward trend, Aurora, the county seat, saw population gains, peaking at 4,225 in 2000 [5].\n\nThe data in image3 illustrates these changes clearly, showing the population peaks and subsequent declines.

It creates and stores multimodal embeddings for visual images and text descriptions, optimizing retrieval speed through index construction techniques. The multimodal retriever uses an encoder to process input images and retrieve the top-k class names most similar to the image from a memory bank, as illustrated in ![Multimodal Retriever](image1). This step is crucial for efficiently encoding and storing a large volume of images/text embeddings for quick, accurate retrieval [9][11].\n\n2. **Pre-processing for Object Detection**: In object detection datasets, the methodology involves additional pre-processing steps such as cropping and blurring. Cropping is based on proposal bounding box coordinates, and blurring is applied to non-target areas to direct the MLLMs' focus toward relevant objects. This is depicted in ![Pre-process](image3), where bounding boxes are used to isolate objects of interest, enhancing the model's ability to identify smaller and variably positioned objects [4].\n\n3. **Embedding and Retrieval**: After pre-processing, the image embeddings are indexed and compared against a memory bank containing category labels. The retrieval phase uses k-NN (k-Nearest Neighbors) to find the most similar categories, as shown in ![Embedding & Retrieve](image3). This step ensures that the model retrieves the most relevant candidate categories for further ranking [11].\n\n4. **Ranking Prompt**: The retrieved category labels and image embeddings are integrated and sent to the MLLMs through a ranking prompt. The prompt format guides the MLLMs to rank the retrieved candidate object categories based on similarity, combining internal knowledge with retrieved information to make the final prediction. An example of this process is shown in ![Ranking Prompt Example](image6), where the MLLM ranks retrieved car categories to determine the correct classification [5][2].\n\n5. **Index System**: To enhance retrieval speed, especially with large datasets, the pipeline implements an index system using the HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World) algorithm. This reduces the dimensionality of vectors, enabling faster and more efficient retrieval from a condensed index, as highlighted in"}

The triplet margin loss is crucial for improving the model's ability to rank translation hypotheses effectively, as it directly influences how the embeddings are positioned in the semantic space relative to each other. [5][10]\n\nThe purpose of the triplet margin loss in the Translation Ranking model is to optimize the embedding space so that the distance between the anchors (source and reference) and the \"better\" hypothesis is minimized, while the distance to the \"worse\" hypothesis is maximized by a margin."}

This approach allows for more diverse and informative feedback, which can be critical in correcting errors and improving the quality of the output without altering the model's parameters. As described in [6], post-hoc correction is flexible and does not require retraining the language model, making it adaptable for various applications. \n\n![Post-hoc Correction with External Feedback](image3) illustrates this process, where the language model generates outputs, and a critic model evaluates them using external tools such as knowledge bases, trained models, code interpreters, and search engines. This feedback is then used by a refine model to adjust the outputs, ensuring they are more accurate and contextually appropriate. The external feedback can be in natural language or scalar values, providing detailed diagnostic reports or broader suggestions, as shown in [9]. \n\nIn [2], external knowledge sources like Wikipedia or the internet are used to ensure factual accuracy, and models like FACTOOL extend this to tasks such as code generation and scientific literature review.

It then progressively narrows down the selection by considering the children of these nodes at each subsequent layer, again selecting the top-k nodes based on similarity. This process continues until the leaf nodes are reached, allowing for a controlled descent through the tree that starts broad and becomes more specific. This approach is advantageous for queries requiring a structured, layered exploration of information, as it can adjust the depth and breadth of retrieval by modifying the parameters \\(d\\) (depth) and \\(k\\) (number of nodes selected at each layer) [9]. \n\nIn contrast, the Collapsed Tree Retrieval method, as illustrated in ![The Collapsed Tree Retrieval method flattens the tree structure into a single layer for simultaneous comparison](image3), simplifies the retrieval process by considering all nodes in the tree at once. Instead of traversing the tree layer-by-layer, it flattens the structure, bringing all nodes to the same level for comparison. This method evaluates nodes collectively across all layers to find the most relevant ones, offering greater flexibility and the ability to retrieve information at the correct level of granularity for a given question [10]. \n\nThe key difference lies in the traversal strategy: Tree Traversal is hierarchical and sequential, while Collapsed Tree is holistic and simultaneous. The Collapsed Tree approach is noted for its flexibility, as it does not maintain a constant ratio of thematic to granular information, unlike Tree Traversal, which keeps this ratio constant regardless of the question [3]. This flexibility often results in better performance, as seen in Figure 3, where the Collapsed Tree approach consistently outperforms Tree Traversal across different top sizes and token numbers [3].\n\n**Answer**: Tree Traversal Retrieval navigates the tree layer-by-layer, starting broad and narrowing down, while Collapsed Tree Retrieval evaluates all nodes simultaneously for flexibility and granularity."}

This demonstrates that BiDAF can effectively identify the answer when few or no plausible false candidates are mentioned, particularly in the context of MEDHOP where documents tend to discuss only single drug candidates. FastQA, on the other hand, shows a slight increase in performance in the gold chain setup but still lags behind BiDAF, achieving scores of 65.3% and 70.0% on WIKIHOP. This indicates that FastQA has difficulties integrating cross-document information compared to BiDAF, which is better suited for tasks requiring information distributed across documents due to its iterative latent interactions [2].\n\nFor MEDHOP, BiDAF's performance in the gold chain setup is even more pronounced, with scores reaching 99.3% and 100.0%, as shown in image7. This highlights BiDAF's capability to leverage cross-document information effectively. FastQA, while showing improvement, achieves scores of 51.8% and 55.1% on MEDHOP, which is significantly lower than BiDAF. This further supports the conclusion that BiDAF's architecture, with its bidirectional LSTMs and attention mechanisms, is more effective in integrating information from different locations in the document sequence [4].\n\nThe results from the gold chain setup also underscore the importance of document selection in improving model performance. When models are provided with only relevant documents, their accuracy increases substantially, indicating that learning to intelligently select relevant documents is a promising direction for future model development [2]. The substantial gap between the models' performance in the gold chain setup and their standard setup highlights the challenge of handling irrelevant documents with type-consistent candidates, which can confuse the models' answer selection process [2].\n\nIn summary, BiDAF outperforms FastQA in both WIKIHOP and MEDHOP datasets when tested with only relevant documents, demonstrating its superior ability to integrate information across documents and handle multi-step inference tasks.\n\n![BiDA"}

The dataset statistics, as shown in ![Chameleon-SFT dataset statistics](image5), highlight the extensive number of samples and tokens used, emphasizing the model's exposure to a wide array of data types and modalities. This comprehensive dataset supports Chameleon's inference strategy, which involves generating interleaved image-text documents and reasoning across modalities, as described in [1] and [9]. The inclusion of high-quality data, particularly for Visual Chat and Interleaved Text/Image Generation, ensures that the model can produce contextually relevant and coherent outputs, as illustrated in ![Mixed-Modal Auto-Regressive LM](image1). The safety data, which includes prompts designed to test and mitigate unsafe content generation, aligns with Chameleon's goal of maintaining responsible AI practices, as mentioned in [7]. The balanced approach to modality pairing during SFT, as noted in [11], prevents the model from favoring one modality over another, ensuring balanced and effective inference across text and images.\n\nChameleon's inference strategy is thus deeply rooted in its SFT dataset, which provides the necessary breadth and depth of data to support its mixed-modal capabilities and safety measures.

According to the text, object queries are learned positional encodings that are added to the input of each attention layer in the decoder [5]. These queries are essential for the model to differentiate between the objects it predicts, as the decoder processes them in parallel to output class labels and bounding boxes for each object [5]. The object queries enable the model to globally reason about all objects together using pairwise relations between them, leveraging the entire image context [5]. \n\n![The DETR architecture diagram shows object queries being processed by the transformer decoder to predict bounding boxes and class labels](image5) \n\nIn the architecture diagram (image5), object queries are depicted as inputs to the transformer decoder, which then processes them through multiple attention layers to produce predictions. This setup allows DETR to handle object detection as a direct set prediction problem, simplifying the pipeline by removing the need for components like non-maximal suppression [2]. The object queries are crucial for maintaining the permutation invariance of the decoder, ensuring that each query corresponds to a unique object prediction [5]. \n\nThe use of object queries in DETR is a significant departure from traditional detection methods, which often rely on anchor boxes or region proposals. By using learned queries, DETR can dynamically predict objects without predefined anchors, making the model more flexible and easier to implement across different frameworks [2]. \n\nThe DETR model utilizes object queries to enable parallel decoding of objects, leveraging self-attention mechanisms to reason about object relations and global image context."}

The model's architecture, as shown in ![The model architecture shows the use of BERT for encoding and cosine similarity for matching](image8), illustrates how it processes both types of slots by leveraging BERT's contextual embeddings and span prediction mechanisms.\n\nThe effectiveness of this dual strategy is evident in the performance improvements over models like BERT-DST, as demonstrated in the joint accuracy results on the MultiWOZ datasets. DS-DST outperforms BERT-DST by 7.81% on MultiWOZ 2.1, highlighting the importance of direct interactions between dialog context and domain-slot pairs [10]. The comprehensive analysis in ![The table shows the joint accuracy improvements of DS-DST over other models](image5) and ![The table details slot-wise accuracy improvements](image6) further supports the model's ability to accurately match candidate values with the dialogue context across various slots.\n\nIn summary, the DS-DST model determines the matching by using BERT for contextual encoding and applying cosine similarity for categorical slots, while employing span prediction for non-categorical slots, thereby effectively handling both slot types through strong contextual interactions.\n\nThe DS-DST model determines the matching by using BERT for contextual encoding and applying cosine similarity for categorical slots, while employing span prediction for non-categorical slots."}

[1] explains that genetic repair systems are essential for correcting mutations, involving enzymes and proteins that work collaboratively. [4] lists several repair mechanisms, including base excision repair (BER), nucleotide excision repair (NER), direct reversal repair, mismatch repair, transcription-coupled repair (TCR), and recombination repair. [5] elaborates on BER, which targets single-strand point mutations by removing damaged bases and replacing them. [6] describes NER, which handles bulky DNA lesions like UV-induced pyrimidine dimers. [7] discusses recombination repair, focusing on double-strand breaks, using homologous recombination (HR) and non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ). [11] mentions direct reversal repair, which fixes UV-induced damage without incisions. [12] explains mismatch repair (MMR), correcting replication errors.\n\nImage5 visually represents these mechanisms, showing how different damaging agents lead to specific types of DNA damage and the corresponding repair processes. For instance, oxygen radicals cause 8-oxoguanine, repaired by BER; replication errors result in single base mismatches, addressed by MMR; UV light forms pyrimidine dimers, repaired by NER; and DNA-damaging drugs cause double-strand breaks, handled by recombination repair.\n\nCombining the textual and visual evidence, Figure 11 illustrates the pathways of BER, MMR, NER, and recombination repair, aligning with the descriptions in the text.\n\n![Figure 11 demonstrates various DNA repair mechanisms, including base excision repair (BER), mismatch repair (MMR), nucleotide excision repair (NER), and recombination repair for double-strand breaks](image5)\n\nThe DNA repair mechanisms demonstrated in Figure 11 include base excision repair, mismatch repair, nucleotide excision repair, and recombination repair."}

In image1, BiDAF achieves the highest accuracy scores of 54.5% on the standard test and 59.8% on the masked test for WIKIHOP, compared to FastQA's 35.8% and 38.0% respectively. For MEDHOP, BiDAF scores 33.7% on the standard test and 42.9% on the masked test, while FastQA scores 31.3% and 30.6% respectively. This indicates that BiDAF's architecture, which includes iterative latent interactions, is better suited for integrating information across multiple documents, as mentioned in [6].\n\nFurther analysis in image2 shows that when only relevant documents are provided (gold chain setup), BiDAF's performance significantly improves to 81.2% and 85.7% for WIKIHOP, and 99.3% and 100.0% for MEDHOP, demonstrating its capability to leverage cross-document information effectively. FastQA also improves but to a lesser extent, reaching 53.5% and 70.0% for WIKIHOP, and 51.8% and 55.1% for MEDHOP. This suggests that BiDAF is more adept at handling multi-document reasoning tasks, as highlighted in [5] and [8].\n\nAdditionally, image6 provides insights into the models' reliance on candidate mentions. When candidate mentions are removed (rem), BiDAF's performance drops more significantly than FastQA's, indicating a stronger dependency on these mentions for BiDAF. However, BiDAF still maintains higher overall performance, reinforcing its robustness in multi-hop reasoning as discussed in [10].\n\nIn summary, BiDAF's superior performance can be attributed to its ability to integrate information across documents more effectively, which is crucial for tasks requiring multi-step inference, as seen in both WIKIHOP and MEDHOP datasets.\n\n![BiDAF outperforms FastQA on both WIKIHOP and MEDHOP datasets, especially in leveraging cross-document information](image1)\n![BiDAF shows significant improvement in the gold"}

Word-level embeddings provide semantic and syntactic information about the entire word, which is useful for understanding the word's meaning in context. Character-level embeddings, on the other hand, capture subword information such as morphological variations and capitalization patterns, which are crucial for handling words that are not present in the training vocabulary or for languages with rich morphology. By combining these two types of embeddings, the model can better handle out-of-vocabulary words and improve the accuracy of named entity recognition (NER) tasks. This approach is supported by the architecture described in [6], which mentions using a character-level neural network to capture subword information and a word-level neural network to model contextual dependencies.

This step is crucial for enhancing the model's ability to focus on relevant objects within an image. According to text quote [8], the pre-processing begins with cropping the image regions based on proposal bounding box coordinates, which helps isolate the objects of interest. Subsequently, a blurring technique is applied to the non-target areas surrounding these objects. This strategy directs the Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to concentrate on the objects to be detected, thereby improving their identification accuracy. The diagram in image8 shows how different bounding boxes (bbox1, bbox2, bbox3) are used to crop specific regions of an image, each containing different objects. After cropping, these regions are encoded and used in the retrieval process to match against stored embeddings in the memory bank. The blurring of non-target areas ensures that the model's attention is not distracted by irrelevant parts of the image, which is particularly important in object detection datasets where objects vary in size and position. This method is designed to help MLLMs understand and identify objects more effectively by providing a clearer focus on the target areas, as evidenced by the improved classification accuracy reported in text quote [7], where adaptations like Gaussian blurring and adaptive crop scales are shown to enhance performance.\n\n![The pre-processing step involves cropping and blurring to focus on relevant objects](image8)\n\nIn summary, the pre-processing step contributes to the zero-shot recognition system by isolating and highlighting objects of interest through cropping and blurring, which enhances the model's ability to accurately identify objects."}

This approach allowed researchers to quantitatively compare word meanings across different periods, as highlighted in the pioneering work by Jurgens and Stevens (2009) [1].\n\nIn 2011, the Google Ngrams corpus became a significant resource, enabling the detection of differences in word usage and meaning across 50-year time spans [12]. This corpus spurred the field of \"culturomics,\" which studies cultural trends through digital media, and was used by Mihalcea and Nastase (2012) to analyze semantic shifts [12].\n\nBy 2012, the focus shifted to \"Word epoch disambiguation,\" where systems were evaluated on their ability to determine the time period of specific word contexts undergoing shifts [3]. This was followed by the development of \"Prediction-based models\" in 2014, notably the use of Continuous Skipgram with negative sampling (SGNS) by Kim et al. (2014), which marked a seminal advancement in employing prediction-based word embeddings for tracing semantic shifts [10].\n\nIn 2015, \"Word embeddings with incremental updates\" were introduced, allowing for more dynamic modeling of semantic changes over time [10]. This period also saw the use of diverse corpora, such as the New York Times Annotated Corpus, to trace subtle shifts [8].\n\nFrom 2016 to 2017, there was a proliferation of research using corpora like COHA and Gigaword, leading to the discovery of \"Laws of semantic change\" and \"Local measures of semantic change\" [8]. The image illustrates the timeline of these developments, showing the progression from foundational concepts to advanced models and corpora usage [![Timeline of diachronic semantic shift research](image1)].\n\nThe culmination of these efforts by 2017 involved \"Criticism of semantic change laws\" and \"Joint learning across time spans,\" reflecting ongoing refinement and critique in the field [![Timeline of diachronic semantic shift research](image1)].\n\n**Answer**: The key milestones from 2"}

DS-DST uses a dual strategy that combines categorical and non-categorical approaches, while DS-Picklist relies on a picklist for categorical slots when the full ontology is accessible [3]. \n\nIn the error analysis, it is mentioned that for slots like 'taxi-leave at' and 'train-arrive by', which are time-related and often not directly mentioned in the dialog, DS-Span and DS-DST struggle due to the lack of span matching in the context [4]. However, DS-Picklist can reduce error rates by selecting values from candidate lists, which is beneficial when the ontology is available [4].\n\nThe image showing slot performance statistics (image4) provides specific metrics. For 'taxi-leave at', DS-Span has a 43.84% success rate, while DS-DST shows 0.00% and DS-Picklist 71.75%. For 'train-arrive by', DS-Span has a 79.20% success rate, DS-DST 9.60%, and DS-Picklist 71.75%.

This highlights the advantage of DS-Picklist in scenarios where explicit mentions are absent but candidate values are available.\n\nIn summary, DS-Picklist performs better than DS-DST for 'taxi-leave at' and 'train-arrive by' slots when the full ontology is accessible, as it can select values from predefined lists, addressing the limitations of context-based extraction in DS-DST.\n\n![DS-Picklist outperforms DS-DST for 'taxi-leave at' and 'train"}

Initially, BERT achieves a peak test accuracy of 77% on the Argument Reasoning Comprehension Task (ARCT), which is just three points below the average untrained human baseline [1]. This performance is attributed to the model's ability to exploit statistical cues rather than understanding argument comprehension [5][6][7]. \n\nWhen analyzing the contributions of different components (warrants, reasons, and claims), BERT's performance can be broken down as follows: warrants alone (W) contribute to 71% accuracy, reasons and warrants (R, W) add four percentage points, and claims and warrants (C, W) add two percentage points, totaling the 77% peak performance [5][10]. This breakdown is illustrated in image4, which shows BERT's performance metrics across different configurations, highlighting the reliance on these cues.\n\nHowever, when evaluated on an adversarial dataset designed to eliminate these spurious cues, BERT's performance drops dramatically. On the adversarial test set, BERT's accuracy reduces to 53%, with the mean and median hovering around 50%, indicating random performance [9][12]. Image5 provides a detailed comparison of BERT's performance on the adversarial test set, showing that all configurations (BERT, BERT (W), BERT (R, W), and BERT (C, W)) achieve near-random accuracy, confirming the elimination of statistical cues.\n\nImage6 further illustrates the difference between the original and adversarial datasets, where the adversarial set is constructed by negating claims and inverting labels to balance the distribution of cues.

The collapsed tree method achieves higher F1 scores across all tested context lengths, peaking at around 2000 tokens. This aligns with the text's assertion that the collapsed tree method is superior due to its flexibility and ability to adapt to the question's required granularity [5][6].\n\nIn summary, the collapsed tree method outperforms tree traversal in terms of F1 score across different context lengths due to its flexibility and adaptive retrieval strategy.\n\nThe collapsed tree method consistently outperforms tree traversal across various context lengths."}

For instance, VQA and GQA each have over 1 million questions, but MMMU's focus is on college-level knowledge, making it more specialized. This is evident from [12], which states that MMMU is designed for college-level multi-discipline multimodal understanding and reasoning, featuring problems sourced from college exams and textbooks. The comprehensive nature of MMMU is further emphasized by its coverage of 30 diverse image types, as shown in ![image1](image1), which displays a wide range of categories from diagrams to medical images. This diversity is a stark contrast to benchmarks like ScienceQA, which only includes 5 image types, as noted in ![image6](image6).\n\nSecondly, MMMU's breadth in image types is unparalleled. The distribution of image types in MMMU, as depicted in ![image1](image1), includes a variety such as diagrams, tables, chemical structures, and medical images, totaling 30 different types. This diversity is crucial for testing a model's ability to handle heterogeneous visual inputs, a feature that is lacking in other benchmarks. For example, ![image6](image6) shows that benchmarks like VQA and GQA primarily use visual (V) images, while MMMU incorporates both visual and textual (I+T) formats, enhancing its complexity.\n\nThirdly, the depth of reasoning required in MMMU is more advanced compared to other benchmarks. MMMU demands expert-level visual perception and deliberate reasoning with subject-specific knowledge, as highlighted in [9] and illustrated in ![image4](image4). This is a significant departure from benchmarks that typically require commonsense knowledge or simple reasoning. The depth is also reflected in the difficulty distribution, where MMMU has 27% hard questions, as shown in ![image2](image2), compared to benchmarks like ScienceQA, which may not have such a detailed difficulty categorization.\n\nIn summary, MMMU's larger dataset size, extensive image type diversity, and requirement for deep reasoning set it apart from other benchmarks, making it a more rigorous test for multimodal models.\n\nThe MMMU benchmark is more comprehensive in dataset size, image type diversity, and reasoning depth compared to other benchmarks."}

Gregor Mendel discovered that traits are inherited as discrete units, now known as genes, which are passed from parents to offspring [1]. In a monohybrid cross, such as the one depicted in image4, where purple-flowered (P) and white-flowered (p) pea plants are crossed, the F1 generation is heterozygous (Pp) and all exhibit the dominant phenotype (purple flowers) [11]. \n\n![Mendelian cross showing F1 generation with all purple flowers](image4) illustrates that the F1 generation, resulting from crossing true-breeding purple (PP) and white (pp) flowers, produces all purple flowers (Pp). When these F1 plants self-fertilize, the F2 generation shows a phenotypic ratio of 3:1 (purple to white) and a genotypic ratio of 1:2:1 (PP:Pp:pp) [11]. This is because each parent contributes one allele, and the possible combinations result in 25% PP, 50% Pp, and 25% pp. The dominant allele (P) masks the recessive allele (p) in heterozygotes, leading to the observed phenotypic ratio.\n\n![Genotypic and phenotypic ratios in F2 generation](image1) further clarifies this by showing the genetic makeup and resulting phenotypes. The dominant allele (P) is responsible for the purple color, while the recessive allele (p) results in white flowers when homozygous. This segregation of alleles during gamete formation and their random combination during fertilization lead to the predictable ratios observed in the F2 generation.\n\nMendel's laws of inheritance thus provide a framework for understanding how traits are passed through generations and why certain traits reappear in specific ratios.\n\nMendelian inheritance explains the F2 generation ratios through segregation of alleles and random fertilization, resulting in a 3:1 phenotypic and 1:2:1 genotypic ratio."}

Gestalt psychology, originating from the Berlin School of Experimental Psychology [6], focuses on how we perceive and organize visual elements into meaningful wholes [4]. The design of the word \"GESTALT\" in image2 illustrates these principles effectively.\n\nFirstly, the principle of **similarity** is demonstrated by the use of consistent shapes and colors for each letter, making them appear as a cohesive group [10]. The letters are designed with similar visual elements, such as uniform thickness and style, which helps the viewer perceive them as part of a single entity.\n\nSecondly, the principle of **proximity** is utilized by placing the letters close to each other, reinforcing the perception that they belong together [1]. This spatial arrangement helps the viewer see the letters as a unified word rather than individual components.\n\nThe principle of **continuity** is also evident, as the lines and shapes flow smoothly from one letter to the next, guiding the viewer's eye across the word [3]. This creates a sense of movement and connection between the letters, enhancing the perception of a continuous form.\n\nAdditionally, the principle of **closure** is subtly applied, where the viewer's mind fills in any gaps to perceive complete letters, even if parts are missing or abstracted [11]. This is seen in the stylized design where some letters may not be fully enclosed but are still recognized as complete forms.\n\nLastly, the principle of **figure-ground** is used to distinguish the letters from the background, ensuring they stand out clearly [12]. The contrast between the letters and the background helps in easily identifying the word \"GESTALT.\"\n\n![The design of \"GESTALT\" uses similarity, proximity, continuity, and closure to create a unified perception](image2)\n\nIn summary, the design of \"GESTALT\" in image2 effectively employs Gestalt principles to create a cohesive and meaningful visual representation."}

This is a critical step where the chromosome number is reduced by half, from diploid to haploid. This separation occurs during anaphase I, as shown in the diagram [image4], where homologous chromosomes move to opposite poles of the cell.\n- **Cell Division:** Meiosis I involves the first division, resulting in two haploid cells. The nuclear envelope breaks down, and the chromosomes align at the metaphase plate during metaphase I. The spindle fibers then pull the homologous chromosomes apart, as depicted in [image4]. The cell undergoes cytokinesis, forming two cells, each with a haploid set of chromosomes, as shown in [image2].\n\n**Meiosis II:**\n- **Chromosome Separation:** In meiosis II, sister chromatids separate. This occurs during anaphase II, where the sister chromatids are pulled apart to opposite poles. Unlike meiosis I, the chromosome number remains the same during this stage, as each chromatid becomes an independent chromosome. This is illustrated in [image2], where sister chromatids are shown separating, and in [image6], where anaphase II is depicted.\n- **Cell Division:** Meiosis II is similar to mitosis in that it results in the division of the nucleus and cytoplasm, producing four haploid daughter cells. The process includes prophase II, metaphase II, anaphase II, and telophase II, as shown in [image6]. The final result is four genetically distinct haploid cells, each with a unique combination of chromosomes due to the previous separation of homologous chromosomes and the shuffling of genetic material.\n\n**Summary:**\n- Meiosis I reduces the chromosome number by separating homologous chromosomes, while meiosis II maintains the haploid number by separating sister chromatids. The diagrams [image2], [image4], and [image6] visually support these processes, showing the distinct stages and outcomes of each division.\n\n![Meiosis I involves the separation of homologous chromosomes, reducing the chromosome number](image4)\n![Meiosis II involves the separation of sister chromatids, maintaining the haploid number](image2)\n![Meiosis II stages, including anaphase II and telophase II,"}

This setup ensures that the lock bits are correctly programmed, enabling the desired security features as outlined in the lock bits logic table.\n\n![Lock Bits Logic](image4) provides the logic enabled by different combinations of LB1 and LB2. For instance, setting both LB1 and LB2 to 'P' disables MOVX instructions from external program memory and further programming of the EPROM, including verification.\n\nThe programming supply voltage (Vpp) must be 12.75 ± 0.25 volts, and ALE/PROG is pulsed low for 100 microseconds, 25 times as shown in ![Programming Pulse Timing](image3).

It uses input from sensors such as the engine temperature sensor, intake air temperature sensor, mass air flow sensor, throttle position sensor, and others to determine the appropriate fuel quantity and timing for efficient combustion [1][7][9].\n\nIn the provided diagram (image1), the ECU is shown receiving signals from multiple sensors and sending control signals to the fuel injectors. This illustrates its function as the brain of the system, coordinating the flow of information and control commands [image1]. The ECU adjusts fuel injection based on parameters like throttle position and engine temperature, ensuring the engine receives the correct amount of fuel for its operating conditions [4]. It also manages ignition timing to enhance power and economy, as depicted in the subsystem block diagram (image2), where the control system interacts with the fuel and air supply systems [image2].\n\nFurthermore, the ECU monitors the engine's operating condition and reports this data to the Engine Control Module (ECM), facilitating real-time adjustments and diagnostics [9]. This comprehensive control ensures optimal engine performance, efficiency, and emissions management.\n\nThe ECU's role is to manage and optimize engine functions by processing sensor data and controlling actuators to maintain efficient and reliable operation."}

In standard consumption contexts, this principle is straightforward: each additional unit provides less satisfaction than the previous one. However, in competitive contexts, the dynamics can change significantly, as illustrated by the hot dog consumption examples provided.\n\nIn standard consumption, diminishing marginal utility is evident as the utility gained from each additional hot dog decreases progressively. For instance, the first hot dog might provide a high utility of +10, but subsequent hot dogs provide less utility, eventually becoming negative, as shown in image8. This reflects the typical consumer behavior where overconsumption leads to dissatisfaction.\n\nIn competitive contexts, however, the utility calculation shifts. Image1 shows a scenario where the utility from each hot dog consumed initially decreases, but at a critical point (64 hot dogs), the utility spikes dramatically due to the competitive outcome of tying for a championship. This illustrates that in competitions, the focus and potential rewards can override the diminishing utility experienced in standard consumption. The utility here is not just about the consumption experience but also about the achievement and recognition, which can provide a significant positive utility spike.\n\nText quote [2] highlights that variety is important because diminishing marginal utility changes preferences, suggesting that in non-competitive settings, switching choices can maintain utility levels. However, in competitive settings, as per text quote [9], the cumulative effect of focus can be beneficial, leading to mastery and significant outcomes, as seen in the hot dog eating competition.\n\nText quote [11] further explains that focused practice can result in increased utility through improved activity experience and outcomes, which aligns with the competitive context where the goal is to achieve a specific outcome, such as winning a competition. This is in contrast to standard consumption, where the focus is on the immediate satisfaction of each unit consumed.\n\nImage6 supports this by showing the divergence in accumulated practice hours among violinists, indicating that focused, directed practice leads to better outcomes, similar to how focused consumption in a competitive context can lead to higher utility through achievement.\n\nIn conclusion, while diminishing marginal utility typically leads to decreased satisfaction in standard consumption, in competitive contexts, the focus on achievement can transform the utility landscape, making the additional effort or consumption worthwhile due to the potential for significant rewards. This is illustrated by the hot dog consumption examples, where the utility from competition far outweighs the diminishing utility of individual consumption.\n\n![Diminishing marginal utility in standard consumption leads"}

Image2 shows a 3D bar graph representing banana exports from various countries, including Ecuador, over the years from 1994 to 2005. The bars for Ecuador indicate fluctuations in export volumes, with noticeable peaks and troughs. Specifically, the export volumes appear to have varied significantly over the years, with some years showing higher exports than others.\n\nNext, we look at the changes in time spent with family and friends from 2005 to 2010. Image4 presents two pie charts comparing how time was spent on weekends in 2005 and 2010. In 2005, 35% of time was spent with family and friends, while in 2010, this percentage increased to 21%. This indicates a decrease in the proportion of time dedicated to family and friends over the five-year period.\n\nBy comparing these two sets of data, we can observe that while banana exports from Ecuador showed variability, the time spent with family and friends decreased from 2005 to 2010. However, without more specific yearly data on exports, it's challenging to draw a direct correlation between the two trends. The decrease in family time might reflect broader societal changes rather than being directly influenced by export trends.\n\n![Banana export trends from Ecuador](image2) show fluctuations in export volumes from 1994 to 2005, with significant variations year over year. ![Time spent with family and friends](image4) decreased from 35% in 2005 to 21% in 2010, indicating a reduction in this activity over the period.\n\nIn conclusion, while both datasets show changes over time, the specific relationship between banana exports and family time is not directly evident from the provided information. The decrease in family time may be attributed to other factors not covered by the export data.\n\nThe banana export trends from Ecuador and the changes in time spent with family and friends from 2005 to 2010 both show significant changes, but the direct correlation between them is not clear from the data provided."}

Interphase is further divided into three sub-phases: G1, S, and G2. During G1, the cell grows and increases its cytoplasm. In the S phase, chromosomes duplicate, and nucleoli, which are sites of ribosome assembly, become visible [1][2]. G2 is a period of growth and preparation for division. The mitotic phase includes mitosis, where the nucleus divides, and cytokinesis, where the cytoplasm divides [4][5].\n\n![The cell cycle diagram shows interphase with G1, S, and G2 phases, followed by the mitotic phase](image1)\n\nIn prokaryotic cells, the process is simpler, involving the duplication of a single circular chromosome and separation of copies, followed by cell elongation and division through the plasma membrane [6][10].
