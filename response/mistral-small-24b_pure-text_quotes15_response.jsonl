As Hispanic households income did not make much impact as this period median increases are nearly none, stagnated for years due to the lack of change [See the financial evidence in `![There has been an actual absence of any growth in population median incomes  nearly for hispanics in a Politics numbers over the decade](image2)` ],with earnings pegged at $42,491 by 2014  ,employer counts and jobs growth contributing to these minorities larger portion of the job expansion since the 2009 period  [Surrounds 43.4%] while a similar wage increase for  controlling public wages  secondarily refined by percentage difference [72%] in excess of the group’s progress. This data directly highlights contradictions in economic metrics, wages and unemployment rates and educational status accounted for job growth contributions but not contributing economic success as thought because wages likely stagnate or fall after rises at recession periods.\nIn detail Median national incomes move stagnantly with oppositional percentage changes throughout hispanic median wages understandably lower than that of the general public, a income disparity which is reflective of the general economic inequality among ethnic population the median wage at $42,500 and overall U.S population median 53070 an overall indication on hispanic community tend on economic impact has driven lower income trends overall compared with conflicting reports on political perceptions.\n\nDue to the sustained economic outlook of the Hispanic community, particularly during recession periods with noticeable increase disparity post recession, economic perceptions provide subjective interpretations of financial health; these metrics namely retain elevated positivity with other economic factors, weighs generally negative on minority households less than general public sector poorly reflecting direct financial inputs contributing maintaining a negative wealth impact across the overall wealth sector. The staging effect demonstrates disparities and stagnation in respective sectors limiting an overall positive redistribution of income making it difficult for minority community populations contributing to their economic resilience.\n\nMy simple clear direct answer is: The Hispanic community has shown economic resilience and a more positive outlook in economic perceptions despite higher unemployment and economic problems during a large portion of the recession period with a smaller increase in income."}

One of the most evident areas of concern is the unemployment rate. The Hispanic unemployment rate, which stood at about 5.8% in 2000, began a steady upward trend [1], with significant increases during the recession, reaching a peak of 12.8% in 2010. An analysis of unemployment rates between Hispanic and non-Hispanic populations reveals a persistent disparity. The highest unemployment rate post recession in 2015 was 6.4% for Hispanics [1] and 4.8% for the U.S population[image5].  non-Hispanics unemployment rose from a shade under 4% to a shade under in the beginning of 2000’s till middle of 2000s[image5].\n\nIn terms of income, Hispanic households’ median income has stagnated, remaining largely unchanged over the years. In 2014, median income for Hispanic households stood at approximately $42,491, a figure that mirrors the situation in 2009 [7] After the recession. Meanwhile, median income for all U.S. households showed a stark contrast, standing at $53,700 in 2014, suggesting a broader trend of relative financial stability or improvement. [image2]\n\nThe poverty rates among Hispanic households have also been a notable point of comparison. This rate stood [23.6%] in 2014 as shown by both the description of [image2] and [7]. This high figure reflected some progress since a recession peak [26.6%] in 2010 [7] but also indicates significant ongoing economic struggles. The overall U.S. poverty rate, while [14.8%] lower as shown in [image2], also highlights the overall disparate statuses [image2].\n\nWealth disparities are marked by discrepancies of wealth post recessions. Median wealth for Hispanic households stood significantly below that of all U.S. households, valued at $13,700 in 2013, compared to the overall median wealth of $81,400. This wealth disparity pre- recession was  [\\$135,700] for all households[image2].  This disparity is exacerbated by a continuing decline in Hispanic household wealth post recession [7].\n\nLooking at overall economic improvements post recessions, Latino perception of family financial improvement stands juxtaposed to recessionary trends.

Hispanic populations remained positive and saw continued prosperity than its equivalent [image4](investment was done in with a growth of[7]` `$155`{\\%}`അ].\n\nWhile economic indicators like median wealth and unemployment still favour the broader U.S population, Hispanic population optimistically and economically is heading towards prosperity, indicating steady upward evolution in overall economic culture."}

Workers with higher levels of educational attainment are more likely to view technologies more positively than those without a college degree [3]. Individuals with a college degree (or higher) rate 64% seeing more interesting work and 53%  seeing increased opportunities for advancement; this compared to those with a high school diploma or less, who rated 30% and 32% respectively [7].\n![Workers with higher educational attainments are more likely to rate higher interest and advancement opportunities](image2)\n\nAs more workers engage with technologies like word processing software, smartphones, email, and social media, these technologies are widely reported to contribute to their career development. For instance, 70% of workers report a positive contribution from word processing or spreadsheet software, 60% from email or social media, and 67% from smartphones[9].  Yet, for other technologies, such as industrial robots and customer self-serve technologies, the percentage who view them positively is much lower [10].\n\n![Significant technologies like PCs, smartphones, emails are seen with positive impact](image4)\n\nOn the other hand, industrial robots and technologies that allow customers to serve themselves without human assistance have negative perception. 14% of workers view them as having a negative impact. Consequently, those with lesser education are less likely to recognize the positive impact of these technologies in the workplace [8].\n\n![High educational attainments is a factor that indicates large positive impacts from varied technologies](image3)\n\nIn conclusion, workers' perception of their job's interest and advancement opportunities is significantly influenced by their education levels, with those who have higher educational attainments generally viewing technologies more favorably."}

According to the survey, an almost equal amount of men and women perceive the social media environment; however, regarding specific behaviors and content types, they differ in their views.\n\nFirstly, women tend to view the online environment more positively, with 56% reporting an equal mix of kind and supportive behavior. Conversely, 58% of men report seeing equal amounts of supportive and bullying behavior, while 29% report more mean or bullying interactions [4][image 2].

So, younger users prefer informative content and in the chart it shows that they experience the feelings of feeling connected, feeling amused, and they like for social media content that adds useful knowledge with the emotional responses being highest for those between 18-29 and decreases with age, while only 2% of people 65+ perceive themselves feeling lonely depending on the social media posts  ![young people amusingly engaging with social media content](image3) [ ][6].

Additionally people older are more likely to hold a negative view on advertisement or evenбіль targeted advertisements.\n\nIn conclusion, social media platforms have potential to improve its services by developing a personalized approach to handle male audiences.

Yearly, the percentage of people identifying as Hispanic has been notably declining with each generation [1], as their cultural significance tends to fade.  For instance, the portion of individuals identifying as Hispanic drops to $77\\%$  and to just over half $50\\%$ in the fourth or more generations. According to image 3, this gives us a perspective on how children of immigrants would refer to their identity. Around 23% identify as \"Hispanic\", 50% as their \"country of origin\", while 23% just choose \"American\".\n\nSelf-identification also significantly varies due to the linguistic proficiency. For Hispanics, this factor heavily restricts their self identification. For example, 58% viewed Hispanic identity to speak Spanish as a cultural compared to some high percentage of people that would not refer to as one [6].\n\nAdopting the parental language and culture is also an important factor. This phenomenon is clearer in  higher generations; $\\%7\\%$ speaks Spanish while only $84\\%$ identifies with Hispanic as a community [image 5].   By generation 3 or higher only a small percentage have Spanish as their language [image 5].\n\nIt is worth explaining more often the cases of non- Hispanic identification. Recognizing people with no Spanish last names as pivotal in identity can shape our understanding of the phenomenon. In Generation 2, most own a different last name [image 5]. Or we can emphasize the remarkable percentage of individuals who have never considered themselves Hispanic [10]. Another critical aspect is family upbringing. Significantly, 15 % cite it as the biggest cultural shock [Image 2].\n\nUltimate factor is thus the countries' way of identification. Historically In U.S. This practice involves relying on self-reported identities, thereby allowing some with Hispanic heritage to choose not to identify as Hispanic [5].\n\nNevertheless, a growing proportion of young Hispanics actively identify themselves more lean towards the countries trends in the U.S.  [8, image4]\n\n People self-identify fewer percent with each generation, bordering to only 17%, while still hold onto \\other cultural uniforms [Image 4].\n\nIdentifying as Hispanic among young people, is more often described with \"Country of Origin\" rather different specifically Hispanic [image 3]\n\nIn conclusion, the factors influencing the self-identification of Hispanics in the U.S. across different generations include linguistic proficiency,speaking Spanish and  familial culture, upbringing, and the cultural ways of self report U.S. These factors are interrelated and contribute to the complex dynamics of Hispanic identity, especially in the 4th generation Hispanics."}

The increasing trend of smartphone adoption in this period indicates consumers' preference over smartphones.\n\nThe adoption of smartphones drives changes in usage patterns, moving more toward data services like data-based messaging, VoIP, and decreased revenues in SMS and voice calls [4].

This dynamic suggests that, despite initial drops, the long-term trend is favorable as users adopt more data-intensive services.  In late 2014 even higher plan tariffs and rock-bottom prices that can cause no further price wars [8,10].The CDMA operators, through intense competition with GSM providers, ultimately pushed GSM operators, such as Telkomsel and XL, to adapt.\n\nConclusion: This trend of reduced ARPU for Telkomsel in 2013 to 2014 initially due to massive price wars but steady smartphone penetration helped increase the mobile data ARPU thus compensating the drop."}

The user input is processed through a bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) encoder to generate an encoding of the user's utterance at the current turn [![The Bi-LSTM process](image2)].\n[this encoder takes the user utterance, and along with various other components and information, it progress the dialogue.]The Bi-LSTM encoder is crucial in turning the user’s input into a form that the system can work with—the final result from the Bi-LSTM encoder is the user utterance encoding.\n\nThis encoding, along with the embedding of the previous system dialogue act, serves as the input to another crucial element: the LSTM dialogue state. This component processes these inputs to maintain and update the dialogue state throughout the conversation [![The LSTM Dialogue State](image3)][![How the system process incoming inputs and dialogue state](image2,)Process takes place by implementing LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) system which allows continuous representation.].This is represented by $s_{k}$  , where \\(j\\) denotes the present turn. This dialogue state is essentially a continuous representation of the dialogue, maintained by the dialogue-level LSTM network.\n\nAnother important input for generating a response is the log probabilities of candidate values from the belief tracker. These are denoted as  $v_{k}$  . The belief tracker continuously refines its understanding of the current state and assigns probabilities to possible slot-values [![A system in a continuous form](image3)][![The policy network](image3) To finally emit next system action.] These are integral to understanding what the user is trying to accomplish and how to respond effectively.\n\nThe system also queries a knowledge base to retrieve any relevant information. This is represented by the query results encoding $E_{k}$. Generally, this component processes the slot-values and dialogue state to generate a possible Knowledge Base (KB) query.\n\nOnce all the inputs are processed, the system makes a final card decision and emit a suitable system action at a given turn, `a_k` by policy network. This decision serves as the final action the system can take to respond to or push the conversation further to fulfilling the user’s request. It's implemented via a neural network based on the dialogue state and recognized slots among all the possible options after their probabilities are calculated [![System Action](image3)]. This system dialogue act directly relates to compiling a response since the system needs to communicate its action to the user.\n\nThe the system decides and emit the proper action, known as dialogue act, system transform this act into the natural language response which can be understood by human, i.e. natural user. By generating the system's response, the system fills up the placeholders in the natural language model template with values from either the estimated or fetched representations, depending on the act the system took [![System emits response action](image1)][7],[6],[9]\n\nThis entire sequence of steps allows the system to take the user's request, process it, and then generate a coherent and contextually relevant response. This way any task-oriented dialogue system complete user’s goal by assisted users in a domain-specific domain by assembling infos from different sources via a few dialogue exchanges."}

Firstly, let's examine their performance under the standard and gold chain conditions on the WikiHop and MedHop datasets.\n\nFor the WikiHop dataset, under the standard condition, BiDAF shows an accuracy of 42.9% (test) and 49.7% (test*) [solution], while FastQA has a lower accuracy of 25.7% (test) and 27.2% (test*) [solution]. This shows BiDAF performs significantly better than FastQA in processing this dataset. When provided only the documents leading to the correct answer, known as the gold chain condition, BiDAF demonstrates a significant leap in accuracy, reaching 57.9% (test) and 63.4% (test*) [solution]. FastQA also improves but still lags behind BiDAF [solution]. It demonstrates that FastQA struggles more than BiDAF with processing an incomplete set of documents, even when information required lies within them. This difference can be attributed to the iterative latent interactions in  the BiDFA architecture, making it better suited for tasks that require integrating information from a larger document set than $FastQA$ [5,10].\n\nOn the other hand, for the MedHop dataset, we see a different pattern. Both Neural RC models had the graph plot under different Boolean metric measurement. The Major improvement happened for FastQA, which performs significantly stronger on the MedHop dataset compared to the WikiHop dataset. By using a smaller set of documents, both models are able to more accurately perform the task [9]. Both models demonstrated higher accuracy, with BiDAF achieving 86.4% (test) and 89.8% (test*) [solution] and FastQA achieving 54.6% (test) and 59.2% (test*) [solution].

Here, the models are able to leverage the textual context of the candidate expressions. But when answers are  masked, even though only a slight improvement in performance is observed, the task of selecting a candidate span is smoothed with fewer masking challenges.\n\nWith the graph plot nature, one can observe there are four phases of the boolean graphs which are the increase, decrease, increase and decrease. Those phases match up with four test set ups which are Under Standard and Masked Conditions of Test/ Test*\n\nInterpreted the conclusion diagram is FastQA is performing  3.9% on the WikiHop Benching comparison to the BiDAF which indicated the overall weakness of the model when providing answers in the higher-graph extending boolean analyze, this might be due to lack of required input processing [3].\n\n$FastQA$ also can leverage the textual context of the candidate entities while BiDiAF has a strong processing capability across these tasks with a slight increase in accuracy under the challenge of Masked Test conditions. `This information is from image3`.\n\nThus, under the standard conditions, BiDAF demonstrates better performance on both datasets, and the differences are amplified under the gold chain condition on the WikiHop dataset. The complexity and nature of the task, and the iterative latent interactions in BiDAF’s architecture, might contribute to this superior performance.\n\nTo sum up, BiDAF outperforms FastQA on both WikiHop and MedHop datasets, especially under the gold chain condition."}

The dataset includes 14 atomic reasoning types, making the verification process multifaceted and complex. According to image1, the most common reasoning types involve **simple lookup (20.6%)**, **comparison (19.5%)**,  **closed-domain knowledge (12.1%)**, and **open-domain knowledge (5.3%)**. These steps are crucial because they involve extracting information from the table and understanding its context.\n\n**Verification Example:**\nA detailed example of how these reasoning steps are applied is provided in image2 . This example highlights a claim stating, \"A’s productivity of 57.5% expressing that it appears in 7.5% more often than expected by random chance.\" The verification process confirms this claim by extracting the correct values and performing the necessary calculations, demonstrating the complexity and variety of reasoning involved.\n\n**Challenges in Scientific Fact-Checking:**\nWhen it comes to the challenges and characteristics of this dataset, open-domain and closed-domain knowledge are key factors. The dataset is more comprehensive and includes a high proportion of claims requiring different types of domain knowledge [6], illustrated by $70.3\\%$ [image1].\n\nAnother significant challenge, as indicated by the image described in image5**,   is that many verification issues result from insufficient evidence (33.3%), lack of open-domain knowledge (25.0%) or closed-domain knowledge(15.0%) **. For example, the need for specific information like the distinction between **different / same (5.3%) ** and **max / min**(3.1%)** illustrated in image**.\n\nThus, the most common reasoning steps in the SciTAB dataset involve both straightforward and complex operations, while the primary challenges include managing diverse, often nuanced evidence, deeply embeded ambiguous and half - truths and insufficient evidence.\n\nThe most common reasoning steps are those involving simple lookup and comparison, alongside the extraction of both closed-domain and open-domain knowledge. The main challenges are often centered around handling ambiguous claims and the requirement for multiple reasoning steps, as depicted in image4."}

Under “Refuted Reasons”, the most frequent error is incorrect calculation results, which accounts  for  41.7% [image2]. The dataset also includes a significant proportion of ambiguity and half-truths, particularly highlighted by cases where the claim is partially right (10.0%) [image2]. These errors, such as ambiguity and logical flaws, align with “Table 5” which lists the error types and their estimated proportions---the dataset going deep into variance and types of inaccuracies which can appear in numerical data analysis[1]. Program errors, which make up 8% of the issues, are discussed in Table 5 [3][5][10].\n\nThe scientific claims in the dataset necessitate multiple reasoning steps to understand and verify. This complexity is represented by the distribution of reasoning steps, as depicted in the histogram [image3]. \"Deep\" claims, involving 3 or more reasoning steps, form the majority of the data, with 61% of claims requiring 3 to 5 steps and a fewer percentage involving 6 or more steps. The dataset does have a few of “shallow” reasoning which takes up 14%[image3]. These layers of reasoning reveal the intricacies of the claims, where “datasets requiring numerical reasoning to complete complex analysis are reflective of answer sets with multiple choices” help build understanding of the data. These datasets are subject to a higher likelihood of Calculation errors [3], as can be sensed from the presence of new error types which are not covered in other datasets. The identification of numerical errors is distinct and associated with the overall research [3].\n\nThe year-long task posed challenges, as large language models seem not to fully adjust to problems involving scientific tabulation as verified. As shown in image2 the reasons for refute such as differences between samples and other missing factors conveyed a message, FIGURE 1. The majority of the models present in the zero-shot setting, were inefficient to ascertain the problem posed. This efficiency limitation is clear as the instructions provided to the majority of the models were few and not adequate enough to complete the evaluation [image4]. This contrast is further reinforced by Table 5, which highlights the unique challenges posed by grounding and ambiguity errors in SciTab, emphasizing the need for more sophisticated methods to handle such datasets properly [3].(![The inaccuracy percentage of values show the true error calculation percentage](image5)) On the macroscopic   level , the dislike of numerical datasets ( like this) lies in their sequential order. It is hard to tackle derivations involving multiple steps. Accordingly, the number of Scientific errors that were observed mainly incorporated two types [image2],[image3]:\n\nA) Ground errors reflected for incorrect association of data value to the cells within the table, mainly the individual scientific data cells. This proportion stood out (~34%) as compared to the other errors as shown in the first section of the error types [image2].\n\nB) Another source of errors was calculation deficit. This was essentially mathematical mishandling. As adding, subtracting and logically processing values on the list. These errors stood at around 27% across the board for several sampled datasets.\n\nMain reasoning types in the SciTab dataset are differentiated into logical representations such that the value sums up a cumulative figure which may show percentages [image5]. In stark contrast, the previously referenced categories, mainly the complexities involved [image3]. Ground errors occur and extend to the unsuccessful derivation of the value sets.\n\nWhich are the actual error estimations in percentage representation they lie around in the order of magnitude below:\n\n      1) Ground errors, dwarf the spatial top wherein the individual value plots aren't linked to the right value cells.\n\nNext comes set of logical issues which can hamper the analysis, a messy set of values doesn't complete a whole holy picture.\n\nSecond to last, is the reservations which lack either domain-specific knowledge or ignore a set of provincial features, in one noun; context-sensitive relations! This was a common problem why the claims were judged to be insufficient or cases containing lack of closed-domain knowledge.\n\nThe explanation[type ==4], why the broader science of the SciTab may contain mistakes in between. The cases of 57.5%-50% mathematical assessment patterns are mathematically calculated as  (7.5%)[2]. This variant set, for mathematical reasons may involve ambiguity this accounts for unexpected factors when the missing domain knowledge is calculated and the percentages are accounted for. Another possible effect is that at times miscalculations happen due to the assessors rounding off percentages.\n\nTo sum it all up, the comprehensive reasoning of the claim detailing sums high exceptions framing the proportions accurately about 70 [%], which will explain the accuracy of the SciTab dataset."}

According to the anlysis [9] of the dataset, the most common reason for a refuted claim is an incorrect calculation result, accounting for 41.7% of the refuted claims.

Additionally, claims that are partially right (half-truths) contribute to 10.0% of the incorrect claims. Such occurrences are reflective of the broader challenges in aligning with real-world scientific claims, which often contain ambiguities and complexities.\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) perform significantly below human benchmarks in  fact-checking on the SciTab dataset under both zero-shot and in-context settings. Encoder-Decoder models like FLAN-T5, which are equipped with instruction tuning, still struggle to achieve promising results despite their strong performance on other benchmarks [1]. The best performance in the 2-class setting is 63.62 (Vicuna-7B), and 38.05 in the 3-class setting (FLAN-T5-XL). These results are only moderately better than random guesses when compared to human performance[3].\n\nDespite this, the difficulty of distinguishing between 'refuted' and 'NEI' classes presents a significant obstacle, as shown in image3, GPT-4 and  InstructGPT both have similar problems, they tend to default on NEI more easily than their correct choices, falsely indicating that the claim is labeled as NEI partly because we need deeper logic to reasoning respectively. This task even poses challenges for trained human annotators [8].\n\nHow well do LLMs perform in this context.

Across all the able, performance results, such are having 92.46 (supported/refuted) and 84.73 (supported/NEI/unknown) Human performance in the SciTab remains far more superior and effective[3, 5].\n\nIn particular, models struggle with tackling complex claims. A notorious example of this includes those that are labeled as cases 1 and 2 in the error analysis[6] which demand extensive reasoning and domain knowledge to process through the passage for NEI claim respectively. often it was found how these language models could not have beats or match that of human performance. The previously mentioned that major science fact-checking must be solved using comprehensive covering ground truth. The characterization of reasoning steps required for validating these claims reflects the deeper challenges the models face[image2]. : quote [6] .\n\nPerformance varies substantially between different LLMs, and none of them achieve close human-level performance. Moreover, the performance differences between the 2-class and 3-class settings indicate the significant difficulty in distinguishing between 'refuted' and 'NEI' claims, raising questions about the usefulness of these models in practical fact-checking scenarios. Elsewhere, the cross-setting at large scale of benchmarks usage indicate the models often default towards safer options especially to claims with  incorrect negatively-labeled claims[6].\n\nThe fact-checking requirement employing human model surpass well-preformed model-QPP variant-encoding model-architectures.

There are varied categories such as sentiment, question type, topic classification, and emotion classification in the literature.\n\nFirst, let's consider the performance metrics for these models across various datasets, particularly in terms of speed-up ratios and their related  metrics. The data suggests that the GPT2-XL model demonstrates a significant improvement in certain tasks, such as  1.1× speed-up ratio on the SST-2 dataset,  to about  2.5× on the AGNews dataset[3,](image3) .This indicates that the deeper layers of the GPT2-XL model are essential for achieving higher $\\mathrm{AUCRO C}_{l}$  because it does process deep and more layered data  entail higher performance as it approaches 0.8 across deeper layers[10], contributing to its classification performance. For GPT-J, the speed-up ratios are even more pronounced, noting  1.5×  and  almost 3.0× speed up ratios on the SST-2 and AGNews dataset respectively [3, 10]. These measurements show that the GPT-J model also benefits significantly from the deeper network layers. The comparison confirms that deeper layers significantly contribute to the model performance where  $R_{l}$ the cumulative contributions increase from around layer 16 to 28, showing the importance of many-layered architectures [10], .\n\nIn contrast with these metrics, consider the confusion matrices which provide deeper insights into the models' classification accuracy. Overall, we see values with values typically around 0.7–1, indicating that within the Entity and Location categories both GPT2-XL and GPT-J models tend to perform similarly with differing values of. These high values along the diagonal suggest good category-specific performance but the increased values, better performance for models, correlate to varying confusion scores across categories as the models’ confusion correlate scores i.e,  A(Q, Pi) as we know exceptionally higher in incorrect cases for both model are highlighted by the lowered confusion values on the off-diagonal for Entity- Abbreviation and Description Person etc [4, 7, 9]\n\nWe also understand that key factors such as commonality in the demonstrations (pressure through high correlations) as well as generative representationstend to increase this confused metric for aforementioned categories. [6, 1, 4]\n\n i.e, The proportion of classification veritable changes across types in different context accurately highlight how broadly models' innovation could be used[citation1]. Hence and Authoritative inference about GPT2-XL and GPT-J, we find Key metrics like $\\mathrm{AUCRO C}_{l}$ hovering from 0.7-0.8,and more, these model-based classifications are much beyond, benefitting the models in larger frames. Additionally, on practical metrics the $R_{l}$ numbers throw light on how model performance varies across layers accurately not limited to crucially aggregating performance of the aggregate as inferred.\n\nFinally, the visual representations (ie,Confusion matrix elements classifying generally between 0-1 higher the value better the resultant). We can confidently decode that the GPT2-XL model shows some confidence (values generally higher on the confusion Scale)which implies in some categories (i.e category, value) GPT-J generates fewer categories according to original contextual data by design [image2,image4].\n\nWe can conclude confidently that Analyzing deeper data sets, broader and more category-specific data is required for finer insights towards learning classification nuances.Looking across different datasets, the variance in performance metrics notably improves and they are contextual to both models and their respective goodness across different dimensions. \\(model specifies varying possibly \\.topic classi-based results\\)"}

In particular, the experiments demonstrate that precision exhibits a notable increase as more knowledge is removed, rising from approximately 14 to about 26. This implies that when knowledge is absent, the models become more adept at filtering out incorrect information, hence elevating precision [image3]. Conversely, recall remains relatively stable, maintaining a score around 15, which suggests that the models have a limited capability to identify absent knowledge. The moderate increase in F1-Score, from around 14 to 18, indicates a balanced improvement in both precision and recall when knowledge is removed, showing that the models can still generate some correct outputs despite missing information. [image3].\n\nIn retrieval analysis, as the retrieval accuracy decreases from 100 to 20, there is a significant decline in all metrics: precision, recall, and F1-Score. This downward trend suggests that the models struggle to generate high-quality outputs when the retrieval accuracy is low; however, correctness remains relatively high even at lower retrieval accuracies [image5]. As a result, while the models can filter out incorrect information to some extent, their ability to generate accurate and relevant outputs diminishes significantly when retrieval accuracy is poor, implying a crucial role of retrieval accuracy in enhancing the generation of attributed texts [3., 8.]\n\nThese findings underscore the models' limitations in handling absent knowledge and the importance of high retrieval accuracy to ensure the quality of generated texts. The 'Conscious Incompetence' setting plays a critical role in highlighting these limitations, making it a valuable paradigm for improving model performance by emphasizing the need for accurate knowledge retrieval and better handling of absent knowledge."}

We'll see the impact of introducing these constraints through examples like the  Llama2-13B as the model used in the specific experiment.\n\nFirstly, introducing both logical constraints and relevant examples moves the micro-f1 score to much higher scores. Consider Llama2-13B, before training its behavior is presented in an example, which makes clear its already mature consistent response capabilities, [Types of logical constraints are usually considered are Coreferencse Relation, Sub-Event Relation, Causally Ordered Relation and Causally Unordered Relationship] ![Complete consistent response can be generated by simple ICL but demonstrating the model's errors whose answers are framed by 'X' like explaining coherence in two sentences prior and after like in exercise](image2 MKCED observation explanation)\n\nThis leads us to state that without logical constraints *the retrieval approaches could incur significant amount of irregularities* like missing inconsistencies, avoiding facts and interruption of proper event sequences noted by [6]. Similarly, after adding logical constraints Twenty-eight events out-of which twenty demonstrated the events along the logical instance have [6](The created dataset improved the performance to 26.4% at event relations extraction from Llama2-13B). Sometimes logical inconsistency will affect the micro-f1 scores, where synthetic datasets like LLM-LR can be included to provide the ground truth on the by evaluating the multi-hop logic reasoning strength. But finding apparent impact remains [10]. On the other extreme LBhas been shown to have better understanding on the practical reasoning examples: The iterative inclusion of logical constraints improves the individual evaluation and correct forecast with its rationales demonstrating boundless geometric growth of micro-values demonstrating [2].\n\nThe effect is inversely observed when examined more on Li scores(reference below image3,where abstedes is quantifying  it) Rewards tend to decrease when considering irrelevant logic due to unexpected outcomes showing either lower LI % as complicated computations require spawning of noisy logic. This can be the mapping of negative at cases example bunching of similar instances like arithmetic applied to physiological pressure checking iterative retrieval approach would make less sense and revert to zero.\n\nLastly, retrieval retrieval not only assigns the useful interactions but improper examples would yield inconsistent answers as proven by models [4][8].

As the number of demonstrations increases beyond 5, the performance improvement plateaus, highlighting the critical role of logical constraints in mitigating logical inconsistencies. For instance, using only 5 demonstrations with logical constraints performs better than using 10 demonstrations without logical constraints on the ****MAVEN-WEER**** dataset [2]. This demonstrates that explicit logical constraints are crucial for better performance this specific case.\n\nThe Left graph of the ablation study of ChatGPT comparisons illuminates the comparative efficiency of logical constraints: even with fewer demonstrations on MAVEN-ERE and Causal-TimeBank, logical constraints enhance the models' performance; for 5 demonstrations on MAVEN-ERE, logical constraints yield higher Micro-F1 scores, surpassing the results from 10 demonstrations without constraints. Adding logical constraints thus forms a stable enhancement to LLM instruction and helps these models reach higher levels of logical correctness [2].\n\n  ![Depending on the instruction using different steps and configuring a dataset with logical constraints, the models provide decision making](image2)\n\nMoreover, post-processing logically verifies the output of LLM ensures no logical conflicts, but often results in degraded performance, alongside lengthened operations and unpredictable semantics, which may diverge noticeably from ideal conditions. Due to randomness in processing, the quality is significantly impacted [8]. This part involves generating correct but often overly verbose or less useful information, resulting in possible logical inconsistencies over multiple iterations. The implementation of post-processing does eliminate logical conflicts but compromises to the overall quality of LLM outputs[5].\nWhile both logical constraints and post-processing address logical inconsistencies, the former introduces an effective and coherent approach without the pitfalls associated with post-processing randomness and quality degradation. Overall, logical constraints show to be the more effective method for preserving the logical coherence of LLM outputs [1]."}

These traditional metrics approximate MT quality by comparing the overlap of $n$-grams between a candidate hypothesis and one or more references, calculating the matching $n$-grams' number and proportion. Often, however, these metrics lack the ability to capture semantic congruity that extends beyond purely lexical similarity [1].\n\nSuggesting a deeper understanding, an $embedding$-based technique, generates soft-alignments. It gauges the semantic compatibility within a framework of embeddings, leading to scores that reflect deeper semantic congruence. While practical, it cannot perfectly compile all features reflected in human evaluation metrics like DA and MQM, thus producing a less-than-optimal correspondence between the scores and human evaluation criteria, setting a ceiling for the correlation [8].\n\n For the performance correlation with human judgments, COMET-RANK's inclusion of source language input significantly boosts the overall alignment with human evaluations. This method incorporates source language embeddings, which facilitates better comprehension and alignment with human judgements. During testing, COMET-RANK consistently outperforms the English-focused BLEURT in five out of seven language pairs [7], illustrated by:\n\n ![The COMET-RANK (en-cs; BLEU 0.660; etc.) effectively improves translation quality by capturing deeper semantic relationships, surpassing BLEU](image1).\n\nMoreover, Language models usually generate scores by comparing the candidate output text with a reference translation and quantifying its quality. In this paper, we introduce COMET, a novel neural framework designed for MT evaluation models that can serve as automatic metrics and be tailored and optimized for different human judgements of MT quality[3]. It trains efficiently and evaluates with high performance, excelling in both comparative ranking (DA) and quality estimation (QE) tasks. It thereby highlights that COMET-RANK typically outperforms BLEU in most language pairs, demonstrating the emerging trend of superior performance by COMET metrics, potentially due to its incorporation of source language data material from hexagonal experiences [4],[9],[10], when the following emphasize the trend:\n![](The graphs depict various metrics' performances, highlighting how COMET-RANK, MQM, and HTER consistently outperform BLEU and BLEURT. This trend reflects higher Kendall Tau values, indicative of better alignment with human evaluations as evaluated by these metrics[2][image1][image5].\n\nFurthermore, COMET-RANK shows remarkably more competitive performance in both directions of English-language translations, aligning more robustly with human judgments in most metrics [2], essentially when COMET-RANK surpasses much, when language pairs that don't include English as source or target are taken into account.\n\nMoreover, BLEU’s effectiveness notably declines when considering fewer top-performing systems, as shown by downward trends at the comma, These downward trends in Kendall Tau correlation associate a decline in the effectiveness of language metrics when the number compared decreases [image 2]. Note how visibility the yellow lines representing BLEURT perform below BLEU and fall further from COMET-RANK, demonstrating its consistently inferior performance across various top-performing systems. A conclusion for the clearest and direct response to the original query would be:\nIn evaluating machine translation quality, COMET-RANK consistently outperforms BLEU across various language pairs, capturing deeper semantic relationships and aligning better with human judgments, mostly."}

When comparing DyGIE's performance across various datasets, significant improvements over state-of-the-art models are evident.\n\nDyGIE's entity recognition and relation extraction capabilities are particularly notable [4]. For instance, on the ACE04 and ACE05 datasets, DyGIE achieves relative improvements of 7.1% and 7.0% for entity recognition, respectively, and 25.8% and 13.7% for relation extraction. These improvements underscore DyGIE's superior performance in extracting relevant information from textual data. ![High DyGIE improvements over baseline for both ACE04 and ACE05](image2)\n\nFor the SciERC dataset, DyGIE shows a 5.9% improvement in relation extraction and a 1.9% improvement in named-entity recognition (NER) [8]. These results highlight DyGIE's robustness and adaptability to different domains, including the scientific literature [across] datasets. Table 8 also indicates that in the ACE05-dataset, DyGIE shows the high F1 score of 88.4 and 63.2 for entity and relation respectively. DyGIE performs better than all other systems (Sanh et al 2019, Zhang et al 2017, Luan et al. 2018).\n\nThe impact of coreference and relation propagation on DyGIE's performance is significant [7]. Coreference propagation enhances the model's ability to recognize entities by leveraging contextual information from shared span representations. Relation propagation, on the other hand, improves the extraction of relationships between entities by addressing scenarios with multiple relations across different entities[image4]. The iterative process of coreference propagation has produced for the best performance in second round of iterations, indicating that the inclusion of coreference propagation optimizes as shown in FIG. 5 of the paper. The figure presents segmentation of coreference propagation and relpropagation. ![Coreference propagation improves performance with iterations in DyGIE](image5).\n\nRelation propagation significantly benefits both entity and relation extraction tasks. It is especially helpful in scenarios where sentences contain multiple relation instances across different entities, as seen in the ACE05 and SciERC datasets. By enhancing the contextualized representations, relation propagation allows DyGIE to handle complex relationships more effectively.\n\nAlthough the role of coreference propagation in relation extraction is not as straightforward, it is crucial for entity extraction. This is because sentences with multiple entities benefit from the contextual information provided by coreference propagation, especially in real-world scenarios where entities can overlap or relate in complex ways.\n\nAdditionally, DyGIE's dynamic span graph approach allows the system to handle relations between entities that extend beyond local contexts [2].\n\nThe improvements are highlighted in comparison to others as Miwa and Bansal 2016 and others' tree based lstm system is surpassed by DyGIE [9]. From here it became clear that both CorefProp and RelPropagation emphasizes the contextual understanding of the system, improving both entity and relation type tasks in DyGIE. But only once in all the iterations of ACE05 related corefprop did better than all the relprop variants. This is elaborated from FIG. 3a and 7 , that touches beyond and local optimization and shared representations for corefprop and relprop respectively.\n\nIt is evident that the inclusion of coreference and relation propagation in DyGIE significantly enhances its ability to extract entities and relations from text. These mechanisms allow the system to leverage broader context and improve its performance across various datasets.\n\nIn summary, the DyGIE system is notably successful in improving the relational understanding in both entity and relation knowledge extraction tasks across multiple datasets."}

These results are shown visually in `![data performance on  DyGIE on different different datasets](image3)`. Additionally, DyGIE shows a more modest $1.5\\%$ improvement for the biomedical dataset GENIA  [2].\n\nFor the ACE05 dataset, the coreference propagation (CorefProp) component mainly benefits entity extraction while appearing to hinder relation extraction to some degree. In contrast, relation propagation (RelProp) significantly improves both entity and relation extraction tasks. On the SciERC dataset, CorefProp has a smaller effect on entity extraction, while RelProp consistently improves both tasks [9].\n\nThe dynamic span graph approach of DyGIE allows the model to leverage broader contextual information. This is clearly illustrated in figure 4. The performance differences of CorefProp and RelProp components and the number of entities in a sentence can be seen from `![The effect of CorefProp and RelProp on relation scores](image3)`.\n\nThe DyGIE model's use of CorefProp and RelProp leads to improvements in the extraction tasks, which is evident from the performance metrics of different models is presented by `[the table](image4)`.

One of the fundamental aspects of DyGIE, distinguished in [2], is its dynamic span graph approach. This method improves interaction across tasks, empowering the system to benefit from a richer context. Among the various domains addressed by this model, the enhanced processing results are particularly evident in datasets with available coreference annotations, as seen in image4.\nIn ACE04-O and GENIA, which have coreference annotations—marked with a check in the coreference column—[5] DyGIE leverages this information to bolster its overall performance. The presence of relations and entities—7 entity types in both datasets and 5 entity types in GENIA—are well handled. This analysis illustrates  ACL provides the performance metrics and shows DyGIE outperforming benchmarks [image1], [image3], particularly in datasets where coreference is a salient feature. In the \"News\" domain, ACE04-O sees a marked improvement in entity recognition. Its 84.7 F1 score on ACE04-O far exceeds Wang and Lu’s 75.1 and Katiyar and Cardie's 72.7. In GENIA, achieving a near-best score of 76.2, setting it apart from the competitors yet again. For ACE05-O, it achieves an added edge due to dygie robust cross sentence context reasoning, as discussed in [10].\n\nThis trend in performance supports the assertion that coreference annotations are instrumental in the successful entity extraction by giving context to pronominal mentions resolved accurately.\n\n`![The DyGie model does have better performance on datasets with coreference annotations](image4)` dygie utilizes this cross-reference and context-sensitive approach, resulting in a more responsive model capable of critical adjustments. These results are further highlighted in Figure 6a, illustrating the impact of coreference propagation iterations. It suggests that the second iteration, marked by $N=2$, yields the best results[6], validating the significant influence of revelleant coreference annotations.\n\nThus, the presence of coreference annotations decisively enhances the DyGIE model's efficacy in entity recognition, especially in the \"News\" and \"Biomed\" domains."}

Consequently, an optimal solution for CorefProp would take two iterations as shown at the left graph. It facilitates akin major assumptions:  If we have a proper span for an entity, enclosing various related entities, CorefProp provides an efficient method of propagating confidences across the graph nodes, which would eventually increase our score. Scaffold entities which cannot be directly detached from text because of language nuisances or entity references. Ensures deep representation where it covers all possibilities focuses on multiple alternative orientations preventing from getting stuck with conventional simplifications.CorefProp can equitably be deployed to enhance the F1 scores for entity extraction especially in task where pronoun resolution becomes the major challenge, but it shows little benefits in the specific datasets such as the SciERC dataset where the pronoun labels are uniformly assigned and are of no additional benefits. Similarly, if we suppose that entities are uniformly marked, CorefProp may not help much, and propagation might hurt relation extraction; on dealing with ACE05, propagating happens through propagates and saliva interaction within the span graphs. Entity extraction achieves better performance in the second iteration but benefits of CorefProp extends to most categories. This interruption at the propagation process enhances the performance up-to some limit is supported by giving us varying information. For instance, for ACE05 data set,improves GPE/PER and PER/ORG mapping. ![Two iterations improves CorefProp](image5)\nThe number of iterations in RelProp, a procedure that derives connection confidences for relationships, Noticeably, kith variants of graph individuation is of significance on RelProp, due to interconnectivity of relations, such types are employed in domains where each of the entities in our dataset are highly interlinked like ACE05. As in figure below  Two iterations are best optimum for relation propagation in the relation extraction task for the left graph. Noticeably, the improvement in performance comes from leveraging the interlink structure of entities across sentences. By enhancing graph connectivity across entities in each sentence RelProp tends to improve the F1 scores for relation extraction. As more sentences are included the performance becomes better in comparison to baseline. ![Two iterations improves RelProp](image5)\n\nThe number of entities in a sentence also influences the relation F1 score, and we're seeing a drop in the performance of DyGIE with the increasing number of entities. However, this reduction is visible from the complexity involved dealing with multiple entities without any efficient compressing relational logic. RelProp attempts to mitigate this drop by increasing the entities share propagated through the span graph but in many instances, it's less required as shown from figures above the better way would be dygie without relation propagation\n![As the number of entities is increased within a sentence, the relation F1 score drops](image 4)\n\nIn conclusion, the optimal number of iterations for CorefProp is 2. In reciprocal, the optimal number of iterations for RelProp is 2, clearly showing the enhancement of the model's prediction capabilities for the relation extraction tasks. In addition, the presence of multiple entities is important and Crucial in improving relational accuracy as shown through iterations in RelProp however, larger number of entities causes a decline in F1 Scores for DyGIE if not used efficiently."}

In addition to its robust performance in known domains, TRADE showcases its versatility and transferability in zero-shot settings [3]. As evidenced in the hotshot domains, such as Taxi Zero-Shot Joint(60.58)[image3],TRADE's ability to generalize to unseen domains comes from its unique architecture, which allows it to share parameters across domains and apply a copy mechanism for prediction. This approach helps in overcoming the common issue of over-dependence on predefined domain ontologies [3][6].\n\nWhen it comes to zero-shot settings, TRADE demonstrates a notable ability to adapt to unseen domains and transfer knowledge from already trained domains without forgetting [3].

GEM, in particular, focuses on maintaining knowledge from previously learned domains by keeping a small number of samples and applying constraints to the gradient during learning, ensuring that new information does not override prior knowledge. This method [8].  GEM's strategy leads to significant performance improvements, as seen in model fine-tuned on the new attraction domain, where GEM achieves a joint accuracy of 34.73%, compared to naive fine-tuning's 29.39% [1]. This improvement indicates that preserving the ability to track learned domains helps in attaining better performance in new domains.\n\nOn the other hand, EWC uses an approximate Fisher information matrix as a regularizer during domain adaptation, protecting the model from forgetting previously learned domains, though the technique is less effective than GEM. EWC, which uses the diagonal of the Fisher information matrix as a regularizer, prevents catastrophic forgetting by preserving information implicitly [3]. However, comparing fine-tuning results, GEM consistently outperforms EWC, particularly in terms of catastrophic forgetting, as illustrated in image8. Which highlights GEM consistently tends to retain higher accuracy in both the original and new domains. Fine-tuning the TRADE model on new domain targets with GEM leads to performance degradation ranging from 21.69%  to 29.22% as compared to naive fine-tuning which leads to 38.38% in the domains, thus it achieves desired balance between maintaining past knowledge and acquiring new data [1,7,9].\n\nThis is evident in Table 3, where GEM clearly shows robustness when fine-tuned on a single domain, which is further demonstrated  in Table 3 where it is evident that GEM outperforms both naive and EWC fine-tuning in maintaining performance and avoiding catastrophic forgetting [6].\n\nThe similarity of slots can also affect the performance of these fine-tuning strategies. Slots with similar characteristics can aid in zero-shot learning, where the model correctly identifies new slot values that are transferable from other slots. This similarity can be visualized heatmap visualizing the cosine similarity,where similar values are learned together[5]. For example, in the restaurant domain, slots such as \"food\" — a unique slot in the hotel domain  — are tracked with higher accuracy [7], consequently transferred knowledge from overlapping slots helps the model while adapting the model to new domains.\n\nUnderstanding slot similarities, while considered advantageous as the slots that appear in more than one domain have knowledge transfer abilities. In case of uncertainties, parameter sharing becomes difficult without a domain ontology while  dealing with predefined slots. Such ambiguities can be countered by employing fine tuning models [4,6,8,10].\n\nIn summary, GEM is a more effective fine-tuning strategy compared to EWC in adapting to new domain data for the TRADE model. And slot similarity aids in recognizing new domain data and consequently improves the performance while fine-tuning."}

Optimizations essentially result in randomised performance, hence concluding that geographical supervision nlp models are ineffective in exploit-free examination [4][6]\n\nIn conclusion, the adversarial data configuration essentially transforms the BERT model to contain equal sensitivity to negative statistics for both labels, hence resulting in sheer randomness in its combative predictive assessments. Effectively, this aligns with the argument that argumentative comprehension of sophisticated learners like BERT constitutes predominantly of extrinsic cues and the hypothesis that feature prioritization does impact its learning outputs [9][6].\n![ BERT peak performance of 0.53](image4)\n![BERT Model on the ARCT Dataset](image5)"}

Risk-free interest rates are based on U.S. Treasury yields at the time of the grant, while expected volatilities are derived from both the historical volatility of the Company’s common stock and implied volatility from exchange-traded options [4].

This commitment is reflected in the regular inclusion of the issue in Board discussions, strategy reviews, and investments, as well as risk management and performance evaluations [3].\n\nThe Board is supported in these endeavors through committees. Particularly, the Sustainability Committee assists the Board with climate performance and governance oversight, while the Risk and Audit Committee and the Sustainability Committee work together to supervise climate-related risk management there is also a  training and development programme that involves them in briefings and developments sessions alongside site visits  where they are easily updated about the relevant issues [3],[4], ![There are different subjects discussed in the briefing sessions, including 'climate change', 'site management' and 'finance'].(image5)\n\nIn addition, the Board has laid out a structured process for the appointment and training of new Board members. Firstly, an approach that is continuous and rigorous is initiated. Suitable candidates are usually found through the combined efforts of in-house data collection and even external searches. [4].\n\n![Throughout the eight-step process, non-executive directors are effectively trained and assigned](image1)\n\nSpecifically highlighting aspects of climate-risk, governance, and oversight mechanisms, the Board works to manage portfolio demands, demand for commodities, decarbonisation costs, and emission reductions in line with the Paris Agreement goals [3], [7]. Through the Risk and Audit Committee, data validation practices and the background and competency check are regularly undertaken. The extensive mechanism ensures the director is well trained to consider the firm’s overall judgement and estimate [image3].\n\nDirector training includes evaluations, either through induction or through FY2021’s entire Director development program. Likewise, the directors are evaluated and assessed on their competence to perform their roles  ![Various activities and purposes related to \"Briefings and development sessions\" and \"Site visits.\" During FY2021, board development addressed a mix of subjects, including climate change, technical innovation, health policy and more.] ![The training and development program during FY2021.](image4)\n\nBHP continuously checks and investigates the effectiveness of the director's independence and their skills which are amplified by their interactions with the input of external advisers. The Board aligns its efforts, giving prominence to this comfort factor, to ensure that there is a continuing competence in the leadership to maintain industry standards on green house emissions and climate control  discussion and evaluation [8], [10].\n\nA good example of deeds or acts intended or set to perform would be Malcolm Broomhead, who's been on the Board for over a decade. In 2021, the Board expressed support for his re-election despite his long tenure, citing his long tenure and deep knowledge of the sector. Therefore, the Board has invested in Malcolm Broomhead based on the premise that his long tenure will enable him to act in the same tradition, which includes a structured competency and output measurement, to perform the role well.\n\nUltimately, BHP has effectively addressed climate change risks through Board-level accountability, robust disclosure processes, training and evaluation programs, and the involvement of director experience across varied sectors."}

This was primarily driven by a significant increase in commercial loans, particularly in the commercial and industrial loan portfolio. Those changes cause the fundamental changes in assets in the company's profile portfolio inward. One of the key drivers for the commercial loan increase was higher loan demand, which led to increased originations and loan draws, reflecting the company's expanding business and higher demand for capital. This flow of money through `floating/variable` [1], `floating interest rates` [image1] increases the investment and financial management challenges for the company, despite these payouts and `PPP` restating [1].\n\nMoreover, the decrease in consumer loans was mostly due to a decline in the residential mortgage – first lien portfolio led by loan paydowns.

This implies that there's a high level of investments and foreign collaborations}](image4)\n\nTable 3 shows a comparative detail of average loan balances earlier in this Report, reflecting a detailed insight into the structural changes in loan figures.  ![A table with detailed information regarding the breakdown between commercial and consumer loans during two different years, December 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020 is provided.](image2)\n\nPrimarily, it reflects that total loans outstanding changed streamingly increased $7,757 million, driven mainly by a $34,703 million rise in commercial loans. Commercial loan growth is attributed to elevated demands, higher draws, and increased originations within the commercial and industrial loan segment[1].\nFollowing this increase in commercial loans, depositors have seen significant reapriting, particularly in terms of noninterest-bearing demand deposits growing 13%, attributed to the rise in total deposits [2]. Additionally, the payoff of loans with fixed interest rates decreased by $5,040 million while floating/variable interest rates increased by $6,946 million, representing a potential hedge against interest rate fluctuation risks from consolidated deposit growth driven by non interest-bearing deposits[4].\nThis increase highlights that the lending strategy must be recognized not only for its commercial leverage indeed a high level of investments taking place  reflected by time deposits; $\\S551$ million are non-U.S. funds indicating a high level of foreign collaboration ![{The bulk of the deposited funds is non-U.S funds indicating a high level of foreign investment and collaboration. There may be a tax advantage associated with this foreign investment strategy}](image1)\n\nSimultaneously, while commercial loans increased, the private mortgages primarily went through loan paydowns have primarily went through loan paydowns due to the low-interest cycle enabling consumers' mortgage paydown ($ \\$17.8$  billion was transferred to LHFS primarily due to the sales in mortgage loans from GNMA securitization pools[1]).\nThen strong aggregate profitability drives management to lean towards higher demand environments, better profitability enhancing, or constructive portfolio management by allowing safe shifting from fixed-rate loans to floating rate loan, which not only improves the markets playing richer flexibility but variable interest rate exposure helps Film property Forecast fluctuating scenarios easier than locked fixed interest rates. This shift from fixed to floating is also significant because funding variable-interest loans with equity significantly strengthens the financial strength compared to fixed interest loans ![Interest rates appears to rise as the percentage allocated to most commercial and consumer loans significantly transitioned from a stability of fixed rates to more flexible floating rates](image2)\n\nConsiderably, this transition could also push the financial entity to have counterpart party risk associated with providing short-term loans but higher risk provides the opportunity to pursue more valuable investments. Deposits represent a greater risk than loans, which are more stable as they are cleared instantly against party risks, hence accounting for deposits over loans as collateral is potentially better given their reliability and security to cover losses[3].\n\nThus, the increase in commercial loans and the shift in interest rates from fixed to variable reflects strategic changes to manage risks in a fluctuating market while leveraging increased demand for commercial loans, deposits, and improvements in the economic outlook. This trend can be confirmed by deeper management that results in declines in time deposits from stability (deposits > loans) which reflects stability through action taken to manage deposits under conservative cap in higher demand months through time deposits reductions, such as brokered CDs, and interest-bearing deposits outside the U.S due to foreign investments constraints ![{As of december 2021, brokered CDs and non-U.S. interest-bearing deposits are devastatingly low and it is speculated that it is due to action taken by the local government to reduce lending level.}](image1) [8].\n\nOverall, time deposits in total represent *$5148 million*(combination of U.S and non-U.S time deposits) .   ![{Undoubtedly $5148 million is disconnected from productive utilization}](image3)\n![A table showing the loan and deposit behavior as of 2021](image5)\nTherefore, the increase in loans could also be driven by the need to lend out deposits over time needed to lend out over time to meet liquidity requirements and regulatory constraints[9]."}

Various extraordinary government actions and pandemic responses contributed to higher levels of client liquidity, which impacted loan demands [3].\n\nThe sharp decrease in total loans by 14% was particularly pronounced in Commercial and Industrial Loans, dropping by 16% compared to 2020, despite appetite of commercial banking remained largely unchanged and exhibit steady demand throughout 2020 and 2021 [image4]. One could suggest that some activities were  hampered by post Pandemic limitations, constraining their earning opportunities.\n\nThis trend was mirrored in the asset-based lending and leasing segments, where loan decreases by 21%[image4].\n\nHousing development was aligned with the overall trend, as residential and small business industries were significantly disrupted by various shutdowns in 2020's pandemic, causing home buyers hold off their purchases. For instance, postpandemic economy stimulated the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP): The flock to emergency lending platforms surged ahead as the amounts of Small Business period-end loan balances [8]\n\nMeanwhile, the total deposits (average and period-end) recorded year-over-year jumps, for both personal and consumer customers. This can generally be attributed to increased liquidity, driven by government-stimulus packages, payment deferral programs and savings 'precautionary' reactions resulting from individual uncertainty, even though investment spending was low [6].![\"Loans and deposits fluctuated due to macroeconomic conditions and government policies\"(image4)][image4]\n\nOverall, the fluctuations in total loans and deposits across different lines of business from 2020 to 2021 were predominantly driven by the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent government stimulus measures. These factors influenced both the demand for loans and the levels of client liquidity, contributing to the observed changes in the financial landscape.\n\n."}

This stands in contrast to the operational risk findings of image2`[2].\n\nOne of the largest contributing factors to the rise in credit risk treated as under these approaches was Investment securities which was mainly driven by market volatility[4].  ![Income in securities for a financial institution with the changes in various components](image2) The anticipation of potential market volatility led to a higher valuation of credit risk assets, translating into an increased credit risk RWA. This is further supported by the income in regulatory framework[8].\n\nAdditionally, the increase in `Equity Investments due to higher exposure and market value gains` [4].This increased credit risk leads to a higher level of credit risk RWA, which ultimately requires a higher level of capital to absorb potential losses. Moreover, the final rule generates changes in calculating these ratios for firms[7].These increases are in line with the regulatory requirement for firms to maintain higher capital levels to support greater risk exposures.\n\nCredit risk was not the only driver of this capital increase. Image 5 quantifies this phenomenon, showing that external TLAC has been steady year on year. Moreover, the regulatory structure moved towards higher levels high leverage. External TLAC as a percentage of RWA enabled firms to benefit from higher performance margins without increasing their risk exposure[7,9].\n\nOverall, these factors led to an increase in the total capital requirements for the financial institution, reflecting enhanced risk management and higher buffers, leading to a more robust financial position and better risk management[3,6]."}

Moreover, high dividend income, which increased 8.1% from 2019 to 2020, could partially offset lower investment income. For this situation, dividend income may vary from period to period due to changes in the investment portfolio [4].\n\nThere were several indicators which could indicate market recovery and improved business conditions, including significant returns from equity securities![The volatility increased from information presented  showing a decrease in the decline of investments from positive to negative -470 million,  amized in a positive money shows reassuring dividend values which might offset this risk](image)!\n\nIn conclusion, while the decrease in investment income poses a challenge, the company’s asset composition and financial practices indicate ongoing demands or sensitivity to market dynamics.

For a detailed breakdown,  ![The Company’s gross unrecognized tax benefits significantly increased from $S598$  million in 2018 to $S1,829$  million in 2020](image4).\n\nThis growth is largely due to the increasing unrecognized tax benefits from current period underlying causes, being increased from  $\\S487$  million of the year 2018’s fiscal  year to  $\\S512 million$ in 2019 and  $\\S416M$    (By tax positions.) in 2020.Gross increases  from current period grew in 2020.\n\nOn the other hand, there has been also some mitigations such as:\nQuestions of prior period: probation  of tax positions  and eventuality of settlements caused a reduction by  $\\$130M$  in 2020, reflecting a significant decrease.\n\nNext, to understand the impact of common share repurchases on the company's financial position during 2019 and 2020, we first note that the Board of Directors authorizes a significant share repurchase program, enabling up to 100 million shares to be repurchased [3s].During this period, the company strategically repurchased shares to optimize its capital structure and mitigate the dilutive effects of share-based awards.\n\nNoticing the following information from  ![Values from a table](image1), during the period 2019, 22 million shares were repurchased, making a cost of  $\\S5,500$  million, while contra 14 million shares were repurchased for  $\\S4,250$    million in 2020.

Notwithstanding such operational adjustments, the carrying amount data shows gradual increase over the year [image 4]. Notably both the assets were depreciated by different depreciation policies, leasehold improvements were depreciated by a lease term while the others were depreciated by a duration of 3 years [image 4].\n\nThe significant increase in the carrying amount of right-of-use assets from $138,403 to $150,464 was attributed to several factors including the addition of  new assets worth of $48,793, as well as re-measurement adjustments to the lease liabilities, which totaled $1,698, showed that the total re-measured assets increased by $2,491 [image 5]. At the same time, depreciation and impairment losses, which amounted to approximately  $(37,454`), were subtracted from the total assets thus decreasing the assets by $37,454.

This steep decline can be attributed to a notable de recognition of a deferred tax asset on distributed intellectual property, amounting to a significant $2,472 million in 2019 [image2].\nThis  derecogniton stemmed from a change in the deductibility of dividend income received by a U.S. stockholder from a foreign corporation due to new regulations issued by the United States Treasury Department in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 [6].\n\nOther significant developments include the benefit related to FDII, which stood at $381 million and  $419 million in 2020 and 2019 respectively.

Fluctuations in commodity prices directly affect BHP's financial metrics, including cash flows and asset values [5].\n\nOne of the key takeaways from BHP’s FY2021 report is the influence pricing has on its EBITDA. The company experienced an increase in underlying EBITDA for Nickel West, which rose by US$296 million to US$259 million. This hike can be attributed to higher prices and volumes, reduced maintenance costs, and lower contractor expenses [1].\n\nHowever, the positive impact was partially countered by unfavourable economic factors, including adverse exchange rate movements and elevated third-party concentrate purchase costs. These financial metrics highlight the critical role that nickel prices play in BHP's overall performance [5], [10]. ![A $US1 per pound increase in the nickel price impacts both profit after taxation and underlying EBITDA by $1 million.](image1)\n\nAs commodities, coal prices exhibited a different trajectory. Queensland Coal 2021 financial performance is indicative of the impact prices hav, its financials saw a decline in underlying EBITDA by US$1.3 billion to US$288 million. This significant drop was due to lower prices and volumes, with net price-linked costs alone contributing a decrease of US$0.7 billion [2][image5].\n\nIn the same report these trends are tracked across, the underlying EBITDA for Coal in FY2021 is tracked against FY2020 [image2]. BHP's financial health in the coal sector is delicate and influenced by volatile price movements.\n\nAs the assumptions in the annual reports reflect, these movements \"may affect the timing or the feasibility of the development of a particular project, the expansion of certain facilities or mines, or the continuation of existing assets\" [4].\n\nGiven these dynamics, it is clear that commodity prices exert a profound impact on BHP's financial health, underscoring a few key insights:\n\n- Changes in commodity prices notably influence the company's EBITDA and profit after taxation. Thermal coal and metallurgical coal priced per unit increase impacts EBITDA respectively by $13 and $35 million per unit price increase[image1].\n- The sensitivity to these price fluctuations amplifies during periods of significant financial contributions from both coal and nickel.  Queensland Coal is showing around $64 USD increase in cost per tonne while its revenue dropped $1,042  USD in FY2021 than previous one [1], [2],[image2], [image5].\n- BHP's financial performance in these segments hinges on strategic decisions and operational efficiencies to balance out the swelling and reducing volumes due to market volatility and profitability [1], [2], [3],.\n\nChanges in nickel's commodity prices impact BHP's financial results significantly with a notable increase in underlying EBITDA indicating a strong performance in FY2021. Despite the improving market conditions for nickel, BHP's operational efficiencies and volume have played a crucial role in keeping the profits."}

Notably, as of December 31, 2020, based on the results of the 2020 CCAR supervisory stress test, there is a stress capital buffer (SCB) that has been implemented by the Federal Reserve, which bank must comply with. This SCB of 2.5% ensures that the CET1 capital ratio under the Standardized approach must remain above 9.5% in order to avoid restrictions on capital distributions [8] [10].\n\nThe data across these periods illustrates significant fluctuation in asset values, showing an upward trend from 2019 to 2020.

To contextualize this figure, Chevron reported a substantial loss of $(5,561 (gas 5561)) million in 2020 and a net income of 2845 million  in 2019, as indicated in an internal Revenue Statement [5]. Several important factors and financial indicators help elucidate the reasons for these fluctuations.\n\nOne of the most notable improvements was the earnings from the company's international upstream segment. In 2021, this segment reported earnings of \\$8.5 billion, representing a significant increase from a loss of  \\$825 million in 2020 [6].\n\nThere were several contributing factors to this increase in the International  upstream segment. First, higher realizations amounting to  \\$7.6 billion, contributed significantly to the improvement. Additionally, the absence of 2020 impairments and write-offs, which totaled  \\$3.6 billion, and the absence of severance charges of  \\$290 million, also played a crucial role. However, these gains were partially offset by several factors, including higher tax charges, depreciation expenses, and lower sales volumes [6].\n\nFurthermore, in terms of U.S. operations, Chevron’s income before tax demonstrated substantial progress. The company transitioned from a U.S. loss of \\ \\$5.70 B in 2020 to an income of \\$9.67 billion in 2021 resulting in  a YOY Increase of  \\$15.37 billion [4].\nThis significant increase can be primarily attributed to higher upstream realizations, higher downstream margins, and the absence of 2020 impairments and write-offs this year which partly affected 2020 [4].\n\nConversely, the U.S. downstream segment experienced a negative impact. Its earnings amounted to  $2.4 billion in 2021, compared to a loss of  $571 million in 2020. This increase can be attributed to higher earnings, margin, and volume offset by higher operating expenses [8].\n\nChevron’s net income (loss) exhibited significant volatility, This volatility extends to comprehensive income as well. For 2021, Chevron reported a comprehensive income of  \\$17,412 million, while in 2020, it incurred a comprehensive loss of  $(8,104 )\nmillion [4], as depicted in other comprehensive income [image 4].\n\nTo further analyze the impact of various activities on the company’s equity and cash flows, the table detailing comprehensive statements of equity [image 1] and encompassing substantial details provides insightful information. The significant developments in 2021 reflect increased values in different equity components like retained earnings, treasury stock, and total equity, as driven by net income/loss and various other financial transactions. The numerical value of stockholder equity, at the end of December 31, 2021, was in excess of microglia graphically illustrated greater than that of the S and p 500 index [7].\n\nIn conclusion, Chevron Corporation's net income and comprehensive income significantly improved from 2020 to 2021, primarily driven by higher upstream realizations, increased downstream earnings, and the absence of previous impairments and write-offs. However, this progress was partially offset by higher operating expenses and tax charges. This situation contributes significantly to Chevron Corporation’s equity visibility and return on equity**! ![consolidated cash flow affected](image2)**"}

Based on the provided quotes, let’s analyze how these deferred tax assets and liabilities have changed between 2021 and 2022 and, furthermore, what impact this has on the company's financial position.\n\nBetween 2021 and 2022, there were notable changes in both deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities. From 2021 to 2022, the company's total deferred tax assets decreased from $4,564 to $4,091 [3]. Specifically, significant decreases occurred in the categories of \"Loss and other carryforwards\" (from $1,030 to $914) and \"Pension and other retiree benefits\" (from $1,476 to $740). Conversely, increases were observed in \"Capitalized research & development\" (from $358 to $646) and \"Lease liabilities\" (from $196 to $420). Overall, the reduction in deferred tax assets is considerable, as total deferred tax assets decreased by  nearly 473 million and will decrease the company's ability to offset future tax liabilities, which may have a negative effect on the company's financial position in the coming years  [Image 3].\n\nAdditionally, the company recognizes deferred tax liabilities, which represent future tax obligations. These liabilities increased from 8,503 to 9,288 in the current period from the previous period and the changes in deferred tax liabilities reflect the tax impact of  various events, such as depreciation and amortization expenses that result in higher tax expense in the future [image  5].\n\nThe changes in deferred tax assets are denoted in 1st line of deferred tax assets category from image 3 compared to liabilities in image 5 it shows the let the changes in deferred assets are quite more than the withdrawal of liabilities that means the company has a positive net operating loss carry said about $3,267 from April 2022 on its cash flow hedging.\nThe net operating loss carryover can also be recognized as the reasons for changes in deferred tax assets [Image4]. Although, these data point to slight lower impacts on the company as these may be readjusted based on certain events, such as progress in tax audits, court rulings or expired limitations, and these updates may highest vary upto 363 million dollars and these complying may directly to annual tax rate of the company.

Again, the operating profits within those 22 billion will actually not provide deferred taxes because the strategy is based on the current resource V.S equitization strategies [4].\n\nUnderstanding these changes is essential for assessing the company's financial health, as deferred tax assets and liabilities can significantly impact the overall tax burden and future cash flows. The changes reflect the company's adjustments in light of evolving financial and regulatory environments and foreseeable factors that affect a company's financial performance  [image 1]. Consequently, the net effect should additionally witness substantially high level positive tax surprises, audits and finally reconciliation of deferred tax assets [1, Image4].\n\nIn summary, the net operating loss carryforward and deferred tax liabilities have changed between 2021 and 2022 in the company's liability positions have favorable changes in their fairness and overall impacts are considered positive."}

Amazon utilizes a variety of resources, including Prime membership, AWS services, and a vast inventory turnover, all contributing to a swift operating cycle[3][5].\n\nFirstly, net sales are critical in financial analysis since they highlight the efficiency of generating cash. In 2016 and 2017 , Amazon reported saw a substantial surge[1][6][image1]. The Net product sales ($118,573million), and  Net service sales ($59,293 million) are presented in net sales values for 2017[image1].\nNext, consider the company’s current asset inventory, especially the cash and marketable securities as it allows Amazon to  maintain cash generation, which enhances the days payable outstanding. An increase in marketable securities reflects an ability to maintain high liquidity which arises from its cash management efficiency[image3].\nThe system will amount shows a trend of increase in accounts payable[image3], a technique commonly utilized by corporations to expand their operating cycles by prolonging the duration of account payable settlements. Given its comprehensive financial standing, this can be attributed to Amazon's substantial marketable securities.\n\nThe financial statements also show income tax provision[image1]. The IASB sets provisions that illustrate that to calculate the taxes a corporation is expected to pay in the future. This incorporates identifying the present value of future tax benefits and setting provisions against deferred tax assets from losses planning for income tax recovery.\nThe company enjoys an enviable financial standing, evidenced by consistent balance sheets, cash flows[7][8][image3][image5]. This showcases how Amazon fulfills its interests, providing the ability to settle accounts payable[4].\n\nFinally, the analysis includes the note of convertible debt and equity obligations under the heading \"Liabilities\". Amazon's accountants are liable for how long Amazon takes to settle accounts payable with suppliers. The equation for Days Payable Outstanding is:\n\n**DPO = (Accounts Payable × 365) / Cost of Goods Sold.**\n\nAccounting in Amazon allows the adjustment of its credit policies and this represents in financial statements ensuring the cash converting cycle has adequate inventories.\n\nAmazon has $41,433 million in accounts payable in 2017. The average inventory includes products sold to end customers and to third-party sellers[5][image1][image3], amounted to $41,433 million in 2017. The cost of goods sold was $141,792 million [8]. Using these figures:\n**DPO = ($41,433 million × 365) / $141,792 million =  104.44 days**\nTherefore, Amazon’s 2017 DPO is 104.44 days."}

As of now, the current peak hour consists of 25 train cars in the scenario of 5 train cars per hour by 5 [10]. Different scenarios cater to increasing train capacity and are outlined below.\n\nFirstly, using Metrolink's used cars can increase capacity by 5 trainers per hour; resulting in 30 trains per hour by 5 [9]. This is an upgrade not only in numbers but possibly also brings reliability and efficiency returns because this usage is a wise economic choice [5].\n\nElectrification represents another approach, with its own notable impact on train car requirements. Electrification emphasizes not just quantity, but quality—a potentially faster, more efficient operation, 6 trains per hour with 8 cars each train equals 48[5]. This shift to electrification could potentially resolve various environmental and operational challenges [3].\n\nNext, the solution of longer platforms involves modifying the infrastructure to accommodate more cars at any given time. This modification will also bring higher reliability, stability, and output, around 48 trains per hour thus trains are scheduled every 10-20mins[4].\n\nIncreasing frequency, especially with the incorporation of the High-Speed Rail (HSR), significantly intensifies the demands.

Though it will mitigate the problems related to the issue of inserviceable capacity[6] particularly, roadway with up to four or five lanes among those challenges. Having such a drastic increase by 64 trainers per hour will not only make up for the greatest benefit in time saved, but lower operational costs as well.\n\nJust as the various scenarios indicate the Caltrain's peak hour spine would vary across different means which most likely would not affect the solution due to the context of speaker simplicity from Caltrain's standpoint itself.\n\nThere is an overall picture of this solution given the current economical scenario of Caltrain’s peak hour outputs[!

F1 scores are sensitive to these hyperparameters, revealing the role they play. For instance, \\(\\alpha = 0.6\\) yields a peak F1 score of 84.67 for the Chinese dataset. On the other hand, for the QuoRef dataset in the English language, \\(\\alpha = 0.4\\) results in an optimal F1 score, indicating the nuanced effect based on corpus characteristics.\n\nThese patterns are consistent with text sources [8] **provided evidence on this.**\n\nThe optimal upper range of \\(\\alpha\\) for Chinese Onto4.0 begins with slight accuracy climbs, peaking at \\(\\alpha = 0.6\\), and then modestly tailing off. Meanwhile, for the English QuoRef dataset, the best performance happens mid-range, starting similarly and peaking at around \\(\\alpha = 0.4\\). **[8]**\n\nOutcomes demonstrating empirically substantial correlations affirm this principle. Any other tuning efforts impacting computational efficiency or misan attribution also need addressing within this context.\n\nTo conclude, the Tversky Index's improved balancing achieves greater returned result validation, thus peaking validation and undergone testing design significantly progresses anywhere within this condensed space-limiting boundaries parameters."}

At each layer, the method selects the top-nodes based on their cosine similarity to the query vector [image2]. The algorithm progressively becomes more granular, narrowing its search to ever-finer details [7,9]. This means that the Tree Traversal Retrieval method systematically selects the nodes recurrently, distributing information evenly and layer-by-layer. This can help present a broad overview and gradually zoom in on specific details as we climb down the tree resulting in the same ratio of thematic information to detail regardless of the query, creating consistency in the level of granularity for the retrieval. This structure can level down all layers of hierarchical information from varying thematic details and granular details.\n\nAdditionally, the tree traversal method modifies the specificity and range of the retrieved information by changing the depth $d$ and the number of nodes $k$ at each layer. This suggests that the Tree Traversal Retrieval approach is more rigid in its hierarchical progression and execution [7].\n\nIn contrast, the Collapsed Tree Retrieval method offers a different retrieval method. The process involves flattening the multi-layered tree into a single layer to evaluate nodes collectively. As a result, these differences provide the model with flexibility in retrieving granular information from different layers based on its relevance to the query, thus adapting better to complex reasoning tasks.\n\nComparing the results of the two approaches, the studies demonstrated the superior retrieval effectiveness of the Collapsed Tree Retrieval method, which performs better by greater flexibility in retrieval, while benchmarked against the Tree-based Traversal Retrieval approach [2,3,8].\n\nThe chart provided illustrates the overall performance difference between the two approaches for a specific context size of 2000; it shows a notable elevation in the collapsed tree curve over the tree traversal retrieval curve [image5\n]. ![Analysis of Tree Traversal and Tree Collapsed Retrievals in accuracy context across metadata.

In some scenarios, this does help.  On ACE05, coreference propagation is mainly beneficial for entities on SCEIE and it appears to hurt relation extraction. Relation propagation significantly benefits both entity and relation extraction in both domains [1].\n\nBoth methods of CorefProp and RelProp achieve their best performance on the second iteration, implying that a small number of interactions across sentences are efficient in capturing useful information.[1,6,9,10].\n\nNext, let’s look at how this manifests across different systems as the number of entities increases.\n![Relation extraction performance varies with entity count and performance of the different versions of the relation extraction systems](image 2)\nFrom this graph, it is clear that as the number of entities in a sentence rises, the performance of all systems decreases. This suggests that complexity increases is the performance decreases on both DyGIE (the blue line) and DyGIE-RelProp (the red line). Essentially, the importance of relation propagation lies in its ability to manage the increased sentence complexity introduced by a larger number of entities. While adding relation propagation does not entirely mitigate the decline in performance, it does help alleviate some of the difficulties posed by multiple entities [4, 8, 9, 10] .\n\nFurthermore, in tasks demonstrating overlapping entity extraction, multiple relation instances across different entities are prevalent, especially on ACE05 dataset, illustrating that a model benefitting from relation information propagated across sentences can be significantly more robust to complexities originating from multiple entity instances [3, 4, 7, 8]. In scenarios with a higher density of entities, relation propagation can assist in connecting these entities across varied contexts, hence improving their breadth and depth of understanding.\n\nIn conclusion, enhancing entity links helps manage complexity arising from multiple entities, thereby propelling model comprehension and performance."}

This helps RAPTOR provide a detailed, broader perspective rather than focusing on specific details, highlighting the importance of thematic understanding [5],as illustrated in Figure 4!. It visualizes how RAPTOR navigates through different layers of the hierarchical tree structure to retrieve information, integrating elements from both high-level summaries and specific details to ensure comprehensive retrieval [4].\n\n For the question \"How did Cinderella find a happy ending?,\" RAPTOR again focuses on hierarchical layers, but this time it incorporates lower-level details to provide a more precise answer.

This iterative process involves retrieving information, generating text, and then using the generated text to refine the next retrieval step. The goal is to progressively enrich the context from the knowledge base, making the generated response more accurate and relevant [5]. The process begins with a query, followed by retrieval, generation, and judgment, which may repeat until a set number of iterations or a satisfaction threshold is reached. The iterative approach is structured and methodical [5].\n\n![Iterative retrieval includes steps involving feedback and repetition.Note: Image image5](image5)\n\n**Recursive Retrieval**, on the other hand, focuses on refining the user query and breaking down complex problems into smaller, more manageable sub-problems.

The model doesn't treat the segments identically, as the source embedding was initially discounted during experiments. Nonetheless, incorporating combination features, such as $h\\odot s$ and $|h-s|$ contributed to better model performance[4].\n\nThe process begins with the input consisting of four distinct segments: the source (s), the reference (r), a “better” hypothesis (h+), and a “worse” one (h−). [9][image4] The first step involves independently encoding these segments using a pretrained cross-lingual encoder and subsequently passing them through a pooling layer. This layer is crucial for generating a sentence embedding for each segment, allowing the model to condense the information into a concise and usable format [6].\n\nFollowing this, all segments (source, reference, and both hypotheses) are then embedded into a single vector that's passed through our feed forward regressor. The entire system is then optimized by minimizing the distance between the “better” hypothesis and the “anchors” (s, r) utilizing a triplet margin loss function, ensuring a clear distinction that preserves semantic relevance while maximizing the differences between translations.\n\nThe translation ranking model's unique approach relies on training with specific datasets, especially significant on languages with diverse linguistic representations such as Gujarati. The dataset fairly mediates varying languages shown in [image1] With this, the COMET-RANK tag apparently played a more crucial role by excelling in many languages. Image2 shows the COMET-Rank consistently outperforming other metrics and thus indicating that its evaluations are based entirely on comparison with alignment  levels which further emphasizes the previously discussed pipeline[image2][image3].\n\nIn summary, the Translation Ranking model effectively processes its inputs by encoding each segment, pooling the embeddings, and then optimizing the embedding space to distinguish between better and worse hypotheses."}

The intrinsic dynamic nature of the genome is characterized by frequent structural genetic alterations, known as mutations, that often accompany DNA replication and RNA transcription. These mutations, when not repaired, can have severe consequences, such as cell death, dysfunction, apoptosis, or malignant transformation. If they occur in germ cells, they can be passed to offspring, causing inherited genetic diseases [1]. Various DNA repair mechanisms have evolved to counteract these mutations, ensuring that genetic integrity is maintained.\n\nThe pivotal role of the mitochondrial genome in generating ATP and performing essential metabolic and regulatory functions underscores the necessity for an efficient repair system [2]. Mitochondrial DNA repair systems, while lacking some of the protective mechanisms available to nuclear genes, include several repair pathways.

For image details this kind of task can be performed from both a visual prompt and the text prompt such as generating LaTeX code based on handwritten mathematical equations.\n\nGPT-4V's capability to generate visual outputs through code manifests prominently in its ability to produce visual markers and then generate outputs iteratively based on interpreting previous results[7]. This iterative pointing is especially useful in visual tasks that require multi-step reasoning, where the model needs to focus on different aspects of an image sequentially [3].\n\nIn practical cases, GPT-4V effectively handles inputs like these. For example, it can write Python code to recreate graphics and figures, such as converting a line graph with labels like \"Base,\" \"Large,\" and \"Huge\" into a new code-generated graph that closely mirrors the original [2]. Also it can generate tables. Image4 shows short and complex equations can be generated in tables and has some complexity [image4].

This allows the model to capture variations, such as morphological changes and capitalization patterns [1], within each word.

The progression in this period includes the broader usage of yearly and even monthly granularity datasets, such as the Google Ngrams (with 5-year granularity), Amazon Movie Reviews (with 1-year granularity), and Twitter data (with 1-month granularity) [10]. By celebrating the critical methodologies, such as \"word embeddings\" and the \"Time tensor with Random Indexing,\" these contributions provide a systematic approach to discerning subtle semantic changes. Increasing improvements, methodologies are developed as a product which are told us about notions, and varied corpora enable more sophisticated analyses. Building on these advancements, the field disrupted the idea of analyzing the Laws of Semantic Changes from new perspectives, achieving higher levels of accuracy, which aids in discovering the critical factors affecting semantic shifts in this period [9], including advanced works focusing on semantic relations between modern times and older texts [4].\nFinally, the analysis using the Gigaword corpus in 2017 highlighted the importance of \"Laws of semantic change,\" \"Local measures better for cultural shifts,\" and \"Joint learning across time spans.\" The entry of these methodologies portrays vastly advanced practices in studying semantic shifts in comparison to earlier milestones [9].\nThus, the development of critical methodologies and broadening the scope of recognized and accessible corpora are standard milestones within the span 2010-2017. The key milestone during 2010-2017 had not only brought noticeable advancement to the field but also opened the door to further dialogue and discovery about crucial factors influencing semantic shifts."}

Here, the collapsed tree method consistently outperforms the tree traversal method across various context lengths. This superiority is evident as the F1 score for the collapsed tree method peaks at 2000 tokens, which corresponds to retrieving the top 20 nodes [5][6][9][10]. Its retrieval details is as following.\nFirst, collapsed tree  Retrieval **starts with a query that is encoded and the tree is collapsed into a single layer** [5][6]. Nodes are retrieved in the collapsed tree\n\n retrieving nodes based on cosine similarity until reaching a threshold number of tokens. The steps for this method are outlined above [5]. Then, the retrieved context is combined with the query to produce an answer using an LLM [5][6]\n\nCollapsed Tree Retrieval  evaluated high granularity information retrieved by DPR [5][7][9]. In collapsed tree retrieval, a query is encoded into a vector. Visualized in **image5** RAPTOR selects nodes from different layers depending on the level of granularity required by the query**, whereas tree traversal is more rigid in its constant ratio of nodes between each layer.**[5]\nInstead of going layer by layer and providing a constant ratio of lower, middle, and higher leaf levels. RAPTOR’s tree-based retrieval allows it to choose nodes from different tree layers, [5][7][9].\n\nOn the other hand, the tree traversal method traverses the tree layer-by-layer, pruning and selecting the most relevant nodes at each level [1]. The algorithm’s steps are simple and  it starts with a query that is encoded into a vector [8]. The tree structure is traversed starting from the root **as shown in** and  the nodes are retrieved at each level**Is shown in image5 :**\nThen, the retrieved context is combined with the query to produce an answer using an LLM [8]\nHowever, this method which is evident in **image2  and image3**\n\n shows a steady increase but eventual plateau in F1 score with increasing context length, indicating limited ability to adapt to varying granularity of information retrieval. The issue of requiring cosine similarity search to be performed on all nodes in the tree is addressed by using more efficient fast k-nearest neighbor libraries, such as FAISS which can speed up or alleviate the bottleneck but can’t optimize for the conditional loss of information granularity but this can significantly speed up computation**. This improved efficiency allows the collapsed tree method to handle larger datasets. **then, the issue of require cosine similarity search to be performed on all nodes in the tree is alleviated**[3].\n\nAdditionally, the graph illustrates the performance of both methods across different context lengths demonstrates that the collapsed tree method achieves a better balance between retrieval efficiency and effectiveness, thus making it the preferred query method on experimental data [5][6]. **The different degrees of retrieval flexibility for Tree traversal and Collapsed tree approach is shown in image5 [5][7]**. The tree traversal retrieval can be used when the context retrieval dataset size is smaller than 2500 . However, it’s recommended to use collapsed tree retrieval with 2000 tokens for improved overall performance.\n\nCompiled from: ![The pellet shows a comparison between the two in terms of amounts of retrieved nodes. For the collapsed method, 2000 maximum tokens equates approximately to retrieval of top-20 nodes, and for the tree traversal, as a context window length approaches 2500, it might show similar retrieval efficiency. However, the superiority comes at an additional cost of computational performance trade-off which ultimately results in F1 score plateau on the tree traversal method. in terms of savings to computational resources  to interpret retrieval efficiency of different context length, the study shows that it typically shows the preference for collapsed tree oregon method than tree traversal in some activities. ![What is the difference between the two approaches to tree retrieval imperatively?(image5)]\n\n![The evaluation varies across the context length using two metrics, green for the collapsed tree and blue for the tree traversal, whose result shows that collapsed tree rendering the best F1 score from a context length of 0 to 2500.

For example, one notable collaboration involves Cmdr. Jonathan Forsberg, who, alongside a commercial entity, is exploring a novel mode of anchoring prosthetics [2]. A study found that “prosthetics can provide disabled persons with substantial compensation towards lost mobility, personal autonomy and motor control, enabling them to perform painless and coordinated movement of the affected limbs during various daily tasks” This effort aims to produce a potential product important for amputees, aligning with the NIH’s focus on improving healthcare technologies for public use. The goal is to effectively manage a wide range of discoveries; inventions and other intellectual properties.\n\nConcurrently liaisons with Duke University are also underway, focusing on evaluating the impact of population changes and land use on spreading malaria [2].  This is specifically important in parts of the developing world where malaria is prevalent, directly influencing the health of deployed military personnel by implementing improved methods of malaria prevention and treatment. Another malaria-focused initiative involves Lt. Vince Gerbasi, who is researching the identification of new antigens that could be exploited as vaccine candidates [2]. The picture, `[based study on identifying novel antigens and understanding the mechanisms of specific immune responses like CD8+ T cells and liver cells interaction against the malaria parasite(Pf pecptds)` shows the interaction between a CD8+ T cell and a liver cell, focusing on the immune response to the malaria infection. The Pf peptide is displayed for the Fc receptors and processed as part of MHC Class I molecules [5] This ongoing research may substantially enhance the current malaria vaccines available for public use.\n\nOne of the uniquely exciting findings in this area of practical application is the work on synthetic oxygen-carrying fluids that may mitigate tissue damage caused by traumatic injuries. Hence the potential of these specific ongoing collaborations is excellent.This project, led by Dr Bjorn Song, is aimed at lessening the damage tissues suffer and could lead to much improved outcomes for serious injuries. [2] This explores the potential health benefits of synthetised fluids to reduce tissue damage by preserving blood flow.`\n\nBy conducting in-theatre research, military personnel are ensuring that the laws that protect humans from harm are being upheld in environments of all kinds, and even adhere rigorously to scientific approval protocol irrespective of region or setting [3-4]. It implies that under these specific conditions, a high standard of scientific ethics will be consistently maintained by all parties. As such, research and adaptation are essential in these this combat-dominant environment, to the extent where active measures are undertaken to promote understanding of the major issues currently encountered, such as rickettsia diseases and the training of personnel in regions affected [5,7]\n\nThese joint projects involve both the military teams and  companies from both sectors [8] which lead to augmented exertion, further advances, and inventions.

According to [10], these included Electronic Medical Records, Bar Coded Medication Management, and Computerized Practitioner Order Entry (CPOE). The adoption of these systems showed some interesting trends throughout 2005 and 2006. On one hand, the adoption of Electronic Medical Records slightly increased from 61% in 2005 to 62% in 2006 ![In 2006, Electronic Medical Records showed a slight increase in adoption, jumping from 61% in 2005 to 62%](image1). While there was a slight increase in some categories, others saw a decline. For instance, Bar Coded Medication Management saw a drop from 58% in 2005 to 55% in 2006. One notable increase was in Digital Picture Archiving (PACS), which jumped from 26% in 2005 to 42% in 2006, serially showing a surge in standardization and digitalization initiatives within healthcare over these years. Moreover, the imbalance in adoption percentages[10] serves as an indicator of growing disparities in clinical settings and a greater need for equitable healthcare advancement.\n\nThe healthcare IT sector also faced several challenges in 2006, some of which were persistent from 2005, while others emerged or shifted in significance. The top concern in 2006 was internal breach of security, affecting 51% of responders, a slight decrease from 56% in 2005. This ongoing concern highlights the need for robust security measures to protect sensitive data. Additionally, concerns such as limits of existing technology reduced from 31% in 2005 to 24% in 2006, reflecting developments in IT and their integration into healthcare systems. `![In 2006, a significant reduction in in the limits of existing technology from 31% in 2005 to 24% in 2006 was recorded; this reflects the advancements in IT infrastructure and its better integration  with healthcare systems](image3)`. External breach of security, though lowering from 18% in 2005 to 12% in 2006, indicates that while being improved by advancements in threat detection and IT security, breach control is gradual at best. Smaller concerns include inadequate Business Continuity/Disaster Recovery Planning, High Patient and Physician turnovers and decreased levels of confidence and availability of data (although measures for the former may be improving), but the issue remained unchanged at 68%. ![Challenges faced regarding Healthcare IT implementation in 2005-2006](image4).\n\nThe current concerns and adoption levels suggest a need for continuous investment in training and education within the healthcare IT sector, to address issues and challenges particular to this year. Historical data from [7][9] shows similar trends 2006 data but from different perspectives. Healthcare providers and IT executives should focus on addressing the persistent challenges in implementation while leveraging the increasing prevalence of standard healthcare software in 2006.\n\nEvery year, healthcare is extending towards more inclusion of IT infrastructure, and in 2006 it is lagging behind businesses by a period of 10-15 years `[3]`."}

At this stage the appearance of all chromosomes can be illustrated with appropriate preparations that allow these chromosomes to be seen under the microscope[10] .Centriole pairs, which originate from centrosomes, are present at this stage and microtubules originate from the centriole pairs. (image5)\n\nSecondly, microtubule formation is crucial as a mitotic spindle is required to divide the chromosomes [7]. The spindle forms a complex network of filaments part of the mitotic apparatus also called the mitotic spindle fibers. Those microtubules organize and participate in cell division and separation of sister chromosome. Their action leads to the exact alignment of the chromosome along the central region called equator or metaphase[5].\n\nOnce the chromosomes are aligned at the metaphase plate, they tangle themselves and hook to pre-metaphasic microtubules. Here the homologos chromosomes are attached together by their centromeres. This is the stage where the sister chromatids form a tetra[a single chromosome set with fours chromatids due to duplication] [1].The microtubule growth and recombination lead to the chromatid alignment.\n\nChromosomes can assume two shape orientations: aligned in a straight line or at an angle (image5]) during metaphase, which reveals sister chromatid sister chromatid pairs and tetrad formations determining invaluable states. At this point, the homologous chromosomes pairs along it. Furthermore, within this phase regions where non-sister chromatids exchange genetic material by crossing over are visible. Here crossings are detrimental ensuring the next meiotic proliferation, contributing to genetic diversity in female and male alike toward ther male and female gametes .Before those events,telomere and other specialized structures are tightly packed with cohesin and transcription regulation just prior to the second anaphase(I) phase which allows and maintains the organization and integrity of sister chromatid by preventing fold formation or sister separation prior to that phase.\n\nIn summary, the key processes and features during Metaphase I of meiosis include  aligned  pairs of homologous chromosomes (image5),the marked exchange of genetic material between  four chromatids and the aligned cells at the metaphase plate, alongside the importance of microtubules organizing the mitotic cell division to allow segregation of chromoso"}

Prefabricated formwork involves the use of pre-engineered and precision-made components, typically equipped with metal frames covered with materials like steel, aluminum, or timber, to facilitate the construction process, making it more efficient. Prefabricated formwork is designed to enhance the ease of assembly, making the construction process faster and more efficient. [9]\n\nThe image illustrates metal frame structures constructed using manufacturing techniques that ensure a more efficient and safer alternative to traditional methods. These frames, covered and built, display a support structure for holding concrete in place during construction processes.  image4] Construction scenes involving \"gang forming\" reinforce the ease of assembly and reusability features of prefabricated formwork. [5] With gang forming, multiple form panels are moved as a single unit, indicating a larger structure built for big construction work. The subsequent crane hoisting and worker involvement emphasize its effectiveness and economic benefits. The image shows this streamlined work process.  image5]\n\nThere are also many options of sizes and shapes for the structures. They can be stand alone modulars to again finished structure.

The data indicates that overall growth in data continues to rise due to numerous users generating information continuously, including photos, emails, and instant messages, all correlated with the rapid growth of the number of people and devices networked [1]. This data explosion is driven by for example increasingly diverse data like mobile phone, GPS and IoT sensor data, which are collectively much larger than more traditional text and multimedia data [1].\n\nThis exponential growth translates directly to metrics in real-world data.  The number of Big Data companies and their categories has been expanding, highlighting the growing reliance on technologies designed to handle and analyze large amounts of data [3].\n\nOverview of growth metrics reveals the stark difference between growth in database systems and the smaller growth rate for the average organisation, which illustrates the differently sized outcomes of companies who choose to invest in scalable Big Data architecture. Specifically,exponential rate of 97% in corporate growth in comparison to the average organization experiencing a 50% growth in previously mentioned, the comparison highlights just how varied their respective growth trajectories have been [3]![a steep rise in database system growth compared to the average organization growth](image1) Image clearly describe the fact that there is a steep rise in database system growth compared to the average organisation growth. Data analytics systems’ jobs complexity grows with the number of users, making them need to be more robust for big data analysis [2]. Virtualisation and cloud have created a major growth opportunity by making the company and organisation digital. Vast amounts of data are becoming available for analysis and from a multitude of previously unconnected sources [4].\n  In 2015 alone, the overall global data volume increased by 7.9 exabytes per year, see ![data has grown exponentially, as reflected in the sharp rise from 2005 to 2015](image5).\nFurthermore, in 2011, the revenue of the pure-play vendors collectively in Big Data  has totalled $468 million.

Many companies have switched from batch processing to real-time as they feel they are becoming competitive [6]. The speed of the analysis has become critical because it directly correlates to the value the data holds, when you analyze your data faster, the more precise and valuable it becomes.\n\nThe key is to plainly state and integrate those separate distinct metrics rather than blindly moving forwards attempting to keep any and all data. The best strategies are data unification and diversification, which will eventually lead to the most beneficial outcomes, hence making data more reliable. Data movement raises the chances of data becoming less reliable see[2].\nIn summary, the growth rate of database systems is 97% while the typical organization's data growth stands at 50%."}

This involves setting up and configuing the workflows in our first module\n\nAuthors do mention, \"You will start by making various basic flat and clustered maps in Wikidata using SPARQL queries. Next, you will make some layered maps, where groups of items can be toggled on/off in the map\" which make learning ideas about basic flat and layered mapping of module 1 practical [9]\nWhile using Wikidata for our mapping-centric modules, We can also perform a focus on steps using Wikidata You can relate mapping lessons using practical and detailed examples of Wikidata values [5].\n\nPrerequisites play a critical role in ensuring a successful and comprehesnive understanding of Module 1 of the workshop which has expertknowledge through foundation mapped Wikidata creators."}

When we look at the word \"GESTALT\", various principles of Gestalt psychology become evident in its design. The Gestalt psychologists sought to understand the laws governing our ability to acquire and maintain meaningful perceptions. Gestalt psychology encompasses several key principles that govern how we perceive and interpret visual elements, many of which are illustrated in the word \"GESTALT\" [1].\n\n![Segregation, Closure, Proximity, Continuity, and Similarity help viewers perceive individual letters as part of a whole word](image1).\n\n1. **Segregation (Segregação)**: The letter \"G\" is depicted with a space that suggests the separation of distinct objects, supporting the idea that segmentation can enhance our ability to see each letter individually.\n2. **Closure (Fechamento)**: The letters \"G\" and \"E\" are designed in a way that they form a closed shape, even though part of their form is missing. Our perception fills in the gaps in this incomplete design,  helping us recognize the whole letter or the word ”GESTALT” [1,10]\n3. **Proximity (Proximidade)**: Individual letters like \"E\" demonstrate proximity by grouping together small adjacent squares. The fact that elements are arranged near one another reinforces that Gestalt psychology emphasizes our tendency to perceive nearby objects as a unit.\n4. **Similarity (Similhança)**: The design of the word ”GESTALT” highlights the Shared striped pattern of the letters \"T\" and \"A,\" encouraging us to group them as part of a whole, a concept that extends beyond these two letters to the rest of the word \"GESTALT\"\n5. **Prägnanz (Pregnância)**: Closely connected to the idea of simplicity and clarity, \"A\" in \"GESTALT\" exemplifies the law of Prägnanz, where our perception naturally gravitates towards the simplest and most coherent forms, reducing complex visual input. [3]\n\nIn the word \"GESTALT\", the principle **Unity (Unidade)** is evident in the use of patterns and colors across the entire word, creating a visually unified whole. This principle ensures that all parts of the word are perceived as belonging together, forming a cohesive visual unit [5].\n\nTogether, these principles help explain how we naturally interpret and structure visual elements in our environment, making the word \"GESTALT\" a classic example of how Gestalt psychology is applied. This manifests most directly in the visual representation as described [10]."}

The workshop is divided into three distinct modules, each with its own unique learning objectives.\n\nThe first **Module** focuses on the foundational skills needed to create basic and layered maps using Wikidata. Participants will start by learning how to generate simple, flat maps and then progress to more complex layered maps, which allow for toggling groups of items. The key here is understanding the use of geo-referenced (P625) items and SPARQL queries to extract and display the necessary geographic data. The goal is \"Understanding steps to make basic flat and layered maps in Wikidata\" [1]. Participants will grasp the essential techniques and tools to begin creating geographic visualizations based on Wikidata.\n\n![Understanding steps to make basic flat and layered maps in  Wikidata](image1)\n\nMeanwhile **Module 2** shifts the focus to embedding these maps within other Wikimedia projects, such as Wikipedia and Wikimedia Commons. This module delves into the broader applications of Wikidata-driven maps, now integrating with key Wikimedia platforms. Participants will explore various tools and techniques, including SPARQL, OpenStreetMap, GeoJSON, and the Mediawiki Maps. This module will educate participants on how to embed Wikidata-driven maps into Wikimedia projects. The module involves 2 different context: **Wikipedia** and **Wikimedia Commons** [7]. Understanding how to embed Wikidata-based maps in Wikimedia projects allows us to enhance the informational content of these platforms, using geographic data to provide enhanced context and understanding, and it assists with lessons involving \"Understanding how to embed Wikidata-driven maps in other Wikimedia projects\" [1].\n\n![Insights into embedding Wikidata-driven maps in Wikimedia projects, such as Wikipedia and Wikimedia Commons  examples](image4)\n\nBy the time participants reach **Module 3**, they will have developed the skills to create interactive, layered maps that can be used off-Wiki. This means embedding these maps in regular HTML pages, effectively making them available for use on various web pages beyond the confines of the Wiki environment. To achieve this, participants will use previously learned tools and techniques, as well as basic Python and Jupyter notebooks, in addition to other visualisation techniques  [9]. The more advanced skills learned in this module specifically target off-Wiki use, enabling participants to create interactive map visualizations outside of the Wikidata environment.\n\n![From Wikidata to Interactive Off-Wiki maps in three steps](image5)\n\nThe key learning objectives for each module in the Wikidata map-making workshop are tailored to progressively build the user’s proficiency in creating and deploying interactive, layered maps, making necessary tools to create interactive, layered maps outside of the Wikidata environment."}

The mindset of eliminating complexity in order to observe a reality in its most simple form is described as a principle of Gestalt psychology [9].generally seeing activities with family and friends tend to be our first valued element that eliminates complexity in the eye, followed by other similar unrelated activities like watching films and reading. ![In 2005, four activities: \"Reading,\" \"Eating out,\" \"Traveling,\" and \"Net surf\" activities were all grouped. This grouping emphasized by the allocation time and activity is very close](image3). This is the essence of gesture laws, which have a closer visual guidance on bringing out thoughts from the complicated realities to much understand simpler facts.\n\nHowever As we move to 2010,  there's slightly less value allocation time here for activities with family and friends: it's only 21%. ![Here a decrease from 35% can be observed in 2005. The slight reduced time allocated for friendship and family also continued similarly to the change over the years](image1). Also, with a significant increase in fitness and decreased net-use, it is clear that fitness is relatively highly valued and allocated more to the group. The law of goodness explains why people who perceive things with the same values or proportions are more likely clustered together [2, 5, 7, 8, 9]. This is particularly noticeable, as the grouping within the matrix diagram visually depicts the appearance of an organized and built-up pattern that emphasizes unity and conciseness [9].\n\nOne reason for this may be People are generally trying to adopt a healthier lifestyle by making time spent on fitness activities [image1]. As people age, they tend to allocate more time towards what they think would be a more hegemonic aspect of life and not losing out on building the core, connecting people around fitness and health. People hence settle for more focused time allocation between activities and fitness put at pride and making it the center point for the allocation of time does this job well. Damaging to activities with family and friends.\n\nAnother reason might be people may get value and weight considerably less on subjects that are far from core ideas hence leaving most of the routine activities with less time allocation. In other contexts these activities can also shown as part of recurrent events yet touching out of a more age-oriented approach however in later years these need to also be heavily timestamped with weight on the core values of the lifestyle [9].\n\nSo in conclusion, the amount of time spent with friends and family dropped by 14% from 2005 to 2010."}

By 2010, the percentage of those spending time with family and friends dropped to  21%. Conversely, the time spent watching films increased, closing in on the same level as the previous leader, making for 22 %.\nThis incremental growth from 20% in 2005 to 22% in 2010  shows that increasingly more people were **attracted to films**. Enhancing access to these films could positively enhance the educational participation. By contrast, the time  devoted to hobbies decreased markedly, going from 2% in 2005, to 4% in 2010 [image2]. The engagement of fitness increased,  which saw  a nearly fourfold decrease from 17% in 2005 to 5% in 2010.

Furthermore, the fact that click on lecture videos made a massive jump from 2,000 indicates a significant interest in self-study and continuous learning. This surge in educational activities suggests a shift in how people are valuing and participating in educational opportunities, which might be linked to the increasing trend of film and online media consumption.
