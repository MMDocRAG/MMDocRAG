The \"Avg\" column provides an average score across all the tasks for each approach.\n\nFor instance, the \"cloze\" approach achieves a score of 55.1 on CoLA and an average score of 80.9 across all tasks.](image1)\n\nDifferent modeling approaches, such as \"cloze,\" \"bilm,\" and their combination, show varied effectiveness. The \"cloze\" loss performs significantly better than the \"bilm\" loss, and combining the two does not improve performance over using \"cloze\" alone [4].\n\n![The table presents performance metrics of language models trained on different datasets and with varying amounts of training data.

The gains or losses are generally insignificant across all languages tested, suggesting that *a priori* alignment may not be necessary for bilingual translation tasks [7, 8]. For instance, when translating between Galician (GL) and English (EN), the unaligned BLEU score is 12.8, while the aligned score is 11.5, a decrease of 1.3. Similar minor variations are observed in other language pairs such as Portuguese to English (PT → EN), Azerbaijani to English (AZ → EN), Turkish to English (TR → EN), Belarusian to English (BE → EN), and Russian to English (RU → EN) [3].\n![Changes in BLEU scores when comparing unaligned and aligned word embeddings for various language pairs.](image3)\n\nHowever, in multilingual training scenarios, aligning word embeddings can be beneficial [2, 8]. Using a single encoder for multiple source languages, aligning word embeddings helps increase BLEU scores because it ensures the embeddings for different languages are in similar vector spaces. This setup allows the model to learn more efficiently, similar to training on a single language [2].\n![Evaluation metrics for different multilingual training and evaluation setups, showing improved scores with alignment.](image2)\nThis contrasts with the bilingual scenario where embedding alignment showed no significant benefits [7].\n\nIn summary, aligning word embeddings does not significantly impact BLEU scores in bilingual translation tasks but is helpful in multilingual scenarios.\n"}

The effect of pre-training is influenced by both the size of the training data and the similarity between the source and target languages.\n\nSpecifically, the gain from pre-training is most significant when the training data is limited, but not so limited that the system cannot be trained at all [12]. This \"sweet spot\" usually occurs when the baseline BLEU score is in the range of 3-4 [4]. As the training set size increases, the gain from pre-training diminishes.\n![Relationship between Training Set Size and BLEU Scores](image2)\n\nThe linguistic similarity between the source and target languages also plays a role. Pre-training tends to be more effective for more similar language pairs [3, 12].\n![Translation Datasets from Various Source Languages to Portuguese (PT), Categorized by Language Family](image1)\nFor example, when Portuguese (PT) is the target language, the improvements in BLEU scores from pre-training are higher for languages more closely related to Portuguese, like Spanish (ES) and French (FR), compared to more distant languages like Russian (RU) and Hebrew (HE) [1]. This supports the idea that semantic similarities between languages contribute to how effective to use of pre-trained embeddings.\n\nIn multilingual systems, aligning the embedding spaces of the source languages further enhances the benefits of pre-training [11, 12].\n\nIn conclusion, pre-training improves translation accuracy, especially with limited data and similar languages, while aligning embedding spaces further enhances multilingual systems.\n"}

Here's a detailed breakdown:\n\n**1. Adversarial Training Impact:**\n\nWhen models are trained on standard (\"Original\") data and then tested on adversarial distractors, the F1 score drops significantly (from 67.08 to 46.84) [4]. However, if the model is retrained using adversarial distractors, the F1 score improves substantially (to 60.10) on the adversarial distractors [4]. This indicates that adversarial training helps the model generalize better to challenging or misleading data.\n![Table showing F1 scores](image8)\n\n**2. Entity Type Filtering:**\n\nFiltering distractors based on entity type (e.g., person, location) during evaluation can further degrade the performance of a model trained on standard data (dropping to 40.73 F1) [1]. Adversarial training that includes entity type filtering helps to recover some of the performance loss (increasing to 58.42 F1) [1].\n![Table showing F1 scores with Type Filtering](image8)\n\n**3. Single-hop vs. Multi-hop:**\n\nSingle-hop models, despite their inability to reason across paragraphs, can achieve competitive performance on datasets like HOTPOTQA [11]. A single-hop BERT model achieved an F1 score of 67, comparable to state-of-the-art multi-hop models [6]. Many questions in multi-hop datasets can be answered using single-hop reasoning if they target specific entity types or if the necessary information is redundant [6].\n![F1 Scores for different models](image2)\n\n**4. Open-domain Setting:**\n\nIn an open-domain setting, where the model has to retrieve relevant paragraphs from a large collection, the performance of single-hop models drops significantly [8].\n![Single-hop model performance comparison](image7)\nStandard retrieval methods (like TF-IDF) are often insufficient for multi-hop questions, leading to lower F1 scores [8]. The addition of gold paragraphs substantially boosts performance, indicating the significant impact of retrieval quality on the overall F1 score [8].\n\nIn summary, adversarial training and entity type filtering significantly impact F1 scores, with adversarial training generally improving robustness. Single-hop models can achieve competitive results on supposedly multi-hop datasets, and retrieval quality is crucial in open-domain settings.\n"}

Noncash share-based compensation rose from $1,193 million in 2020 to $1,315 million in 2021 [6].\n*   **Changes in Operating Assets and Liabilities**: There was a decrease resulting from changes in operating assets and liabilities, primarily due to timing of amortization and payments related to film and television costs. There were also increases in accounts receivable and decreases in deferred revenue due to events such as the broadcast of Tokyo Olympics [9].\n*   **Interest and Tax Payments**: While interest payments remained relatively stable, income tax payments decreased from $3,183 million in 2020 to $2,628 million in 2021. The decrease of income tax payment is due to the tax deductions resulting from senior notes exchange [4, 6].\n* **Proceeds from Investments**: Increased from $190 million in 2020 to $1,246 million in 2021 [6]. The increase was primarily due to increased cash distributions received from equity method investments [3].\n![Net cash of operating activities increased in 2021](image6)\n\nIn summary, the net cash provided by operating activities increased from $24,737 million in 2020 to $29,146 million in 2021, primarily due to higher operating income, increased non-cash adjustments, a decrease in tax payments, and higher proceeds from investments.\n"}

In 1870, the population was only 130, but by 1880, it exploded to 8,267, and further to 14,096 in 1890 [1].\n![The table shows population data for various census years](image2)\nThis growth was fueled by several factors, including the Homestead Act of 1862, which granted 160 acres of land to settlers who resided on it and built a permanent structure, drawing many pioneers to Nebraska [5]. The completion of the Transcontinental Railroad also played a crucial role, transforming Nebraska into a booming agricultural state[5].\n\nThe influx of settlers was diverse, with people arriving from various states like Missouri, Iowa, Illinois, Ohio, and New England, as well as immigrants from Germany, Sweden, England, and Russia [2]. These ethnic groups formed distinct settlements, such as the Danish community around Kronborg [2, 12], which is clearly shown on the detailed county map.\n![The image shows a map highlighting Hamilton County in Nebraska and its communities.](image3)\nMany rural church complexes were built by these ethnic groups, like St. John's Lutheran Church.\n![The image shows a church building with a tall steeple topped by a cross.

The core difference lies in the number and function of their decoders:\n\n*   **Single-task Model (Figure 1a)**: This model has a single decoder. This decoder attends to the hidden states of the encoder [11]. The attention mechanism computes context vectors, which then inform the decoder states, leading to the output prediction via a softmax function.\n\n*   **Multitask Model (Figure 1b)**: In contrast, the multitask model features two separate decoders [12].

Here's a breakdown of each model shown in the image:\n\n1.  **(a) Single-task**:\n    -   This is the standard model where a single decoder attends to the states of an encoder.\n    -   The process follows this order: input sequence (`x_1 ... x_N`) is encoded into hidden states (`h_1 ... h_N`), an attention mechanism produces context vectors (`c_1 ... c_M`) which inform the decoder states (`s_1 ... s_M`), and a softmax function is applied for output prediction (`P(y_1 ... y_M)`).\n\n2.  **(b) Multitask**:\n    -   In this setup, the model possesses two decoders that both attend to the states of the same encoder.\n    -   Similarly, inputs are encoded into hidden states, and each decoder has its own attention mechanism, context vectors, and predictions.\n\n3.  **(c) Cascade** (referenced from Tu et al., 2017):\n    -   Here, the second decoder does not directly attend to the encoder states. Instead, it attends to the states of the first decoder.\n    -   This approach creates a sequential setup where the output of the first decoder informs the second decoder, resulting in a cascading attention.\n\n4.  **(d) Triangle**:\n    -   The innovative aspect of the triangle model is that the second decoder attends to both the encoder’s states and the first decoder’s states.\n    -   This dual-attention setup might allow for more nuanced and context-aware predictions, as the second decoder is directly influenced by both prior stages.\n\nEach model variation utilizes an attention mechanism to align and focus on different parts of input sequences, enhancing the performance of tasks like machine translation or summarization.](image6)\n\nIn summary, the multitask model differs from the single-task model by having two decoders, both attending to the same encoder, whereas the single-task model has only one decoder attending to the encoder.\n"}

The decoder attends to the output of the transformer encoder to refine its predictions.\n\n4. **Prediction Heads**: For each output embedding of the decoder, a shared feed forward network (FFN) predicts either the class and bounding box of a detected object or classifies it as “no object.” The predictions are visualized as bounding boxes with associated class labels overlaid on an image of birds, showing the model's capability to detect objects in the scene.](image5)\n\nThese input embeddings are crucial because the decoder is permutation-invariant, meaning the input embeddings must be distinct to produce different results [5]. The object queries are added to the input of each attention layer within the decoder [5]. The decoder processes these queries, along with the encoder memory, to produce a final set of predictions [11]. Each object query is transformed into an output embedding, which is then independently decoded into box coordinates and class labels by a feed-forward network [5].\n\nIn essence, object queries in DETR act as learned positional encodings that enable the model to attend to different parts of the image and make parallel predictions about the objects present.\n"}

Several Gestalt principles are evident in how we visually perceive elements, often grouping them based on certain characteristics.\n\nThe design of the word \"GESTALT\" itself, as illustrated in the image, exemplifies these principles:\n\n*   **Segregation:** The letter \"G\" is presented with a space, indicating separation or distinct objects [image2].\n\n*   **Closure:** The combination of \"G\" and \"E\" encourages viewers to perceive a closed shape, even though it's incomplete [image2]. Our minds tend to fill in visual gaps to see objects as whole [11]. An example of closure can be seen in geometric shapes.\n    ![Geometric shapes outlined with dashed lines](image1)\n\n*   **Proximity:** The letter \"E\" is formed by small rectangles grouped closely, creating a sense of unity [image2]. Objects near each other are perceived as belonging to a group [1].\n An visual example of proximity principle can be seen:\n    ![visual structure of dots arranged](image6)\n\n*   **Continuity:** The \"S\" follows a continuous contour line, suggesting a smooth, flowing pathway [image2, 3].\n\n*   **Similarity:** The letters \"T\" and \"A\" share a striped pattern, leading us to group them together based on visual similarity [image2, 10].\nAnother example of similarity principle is a checkerboard pattern circles:\n![circles arranged in six rows and six columns](image7)\n\n*   **Prägnanz (Simplicity):** The clarity of the \"A\" suggests our preference for seeing the simplest form [image2]. This aligns with the law of good gestalt, emphasizing conciseness [4].\n\n*   **Unity:** The consistent use of patterns and colors across the entire word suggests that all parts belong together, creating a unified whole [image2].\n\n![principles of Gestalt psychology](image2)\n\nIn summary, the design of the word 'GESTALT' manifests the Gestalt principles of segregation, closure, proximity, continuity, similarity, Prägnanz, and unity.\n"}
