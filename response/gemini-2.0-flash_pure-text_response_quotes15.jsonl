In terms of slot-level accuracy, DS-Picklist shows improvements over DS-Span, especially in slots like `hotel-type`, `attraction-name`, `hotel-internet`, and `hotel-parking` [4].  These slots benefit from the candidate-value lists used in DS-Picklist, as their values often have varied expressions not easily extracted from dialog context alone [4].  The detailed slot-level accuracy comparison highlights the strengths of DS-Picklist in categorical slots ![The table presents data about various \"Slot Names\" and their corresponding statistics under three categories: DS-Span, DS-DST, and DS-Picklist.](image3), while DS-DST also shows considerable improvement over DS-Span in these areas [6].  \n\nAlthough DS-DST is higher than DS-Span, in real scenarios, it may be nontrivial to have access to the full ontology [1].

Models with low sensitivity and word error rate are most robust [5]. The neutral backoff variant has the lowest sensitivity [4].\n\nFor closed vocabulary (word-only) models, the sensitivity values for Pass-Through, Background, and Neutral strategies are relatively close, as are the WER values, as shown in the left plot ![The left plot shows three data points representing Pass-through, Background, and Neutral strategies with sensitivity ranging from about 11.4 to 12.6, and WER ranging from 9.5 to 11.5.](image4).  However, open vocabulary models (char-only) show a wider range of sensitivity, particularly with the pass-through strategy, which has a much higher sensitivity compared to the background and neutral strategies, as indicated in the right plot ![The right plot shows three data points representing Pass-through, Background, and Neutral strategies with sensitivity ranging from about 10 to 30, and WER from 6.5 to 11.](image4).  This is because, for word+char, and word-piece models, the pass-through version is more sensitive than the background variant, as it passes words as is (and each combination is considered uniquely) [8].  However, for word-only models, pass-through is less sensitive as all the OOV character combinations are rendered identical [8].\n\nGenerally, sensitivity is the more dominant factor out of the two, as the error rates of the considered variants are reasonably low [10].  The neutral backoff variant consistently demonstrates low sensitivity across both closed and open vocabulary models, because it returns a fixed neutral word whenever the ScRNN predicts an UNK [4, 7]. The neutral backoff model is effective on 2-char attacks, but it hurts performance in the no attack setting, since it incorrectly modifies certain correctly spelled entity names [1].\n\nIn summary, open vocabulary models exhibit a greater range of sensitivity, especially with the pass-through strategy, while closed vocabulary models show more consistent sensitivity across different backoff strategies, and the neutral backoff strategy consistently demonstrates low sensitivity across both types of models.\n"}

The decrease in total loans was partially attributed to lower line utilization and continued high levels of client liquidity [3].\n\nConversely, total deposits increased due to higher levels of liquidity and lower investment spending, reflecting government stimulus programs and economic uncertainty related to the COVID-19 pandemic [4, 6]. This increase in deposits was also observed among consumer customers, who experienced higher savings due to stimulus and payment deferral programs [6]. The fluctuations in loan balances were further affected by specific actions, such as temporarily curtailing certain non-conforming residential mortgage originations [8].\n\nChanges in net interest income also played a role, with lower net interest income reflecting lower loan balances driven by weak demand and the lower interest rate environment [1]. However, this was partially offset by higher income from deposit balances and increased deposit-related fees due to higher treasury management fees and transaction volumes [1]. The financial data from different lines of business shows these changes from 2021, 2020 and 2019 ![Financial data table for different lines of business.](image1).\n\nTotal loans decreased, while total deposits increased due to various economic factors like decreased loan demand, government stimulus, and the COVID-19 pandemic.\n"}

A significant factor was the decrease in core merchandise categories [1, 5]. Specifically, fresh foods and foods and sundries were major drivers in this decline [5]. The implementation of a LIFO (Last-In, First-Out) charge for higher merchandise costs also negatively impacted the gross margin [5].

Conversely, declining gasoline prices would have the opposite effect. Changes in sales penetration and gross margins from warehouse ancillary and other businesses also had an impact [6]. Actions in countries like China and the United States affected merchandise costs due to tariffs [2]. The company's strategy of maintaining competitive pricing and absorbing cost increases, rather than passing them onto members, also negatively impacted gross margin [3].

The core idea is to combine the strengths of CLIP-based retrieval with the knowledge of MLLMs [9].\n\nThe first main component is the Multimodal Retriever. It addresses the challenge of efficiently encoding and storing a large volume of images and text embeddings for quick and accurate retrieval [8]. This retriever creates and stores multimodal embeddings [1], optimizing retrieval speed through index construction techniques [8]. As illustrated in the pipeline, the image encoder extracts image feature embeddings, which are then stored and indexed in the feature index, utilizing a memory ($\\mathcal{M}$) for external storage, and employing k-NN for image-image and image-text retrieval ![The RAR pipeline includes a multimodal retriever for feature extraction, indexing, and storage.](image3). To enhance retrieval speed, techniques like the HNSW algorithm are used to reduce dimensionality and create a more condensed index [7].\n\nFollowing retrieval, the ranking component refines the results. During the inference stage, an input image is encoded into embeddings, and the top-k categories are retrieved from memory based on similarity [3, 4]. MLLMs then rank these categories to make the final prediction [1]. This ranking process combines the internal knowledge of the MLLM with the retrieved information to provide a more accurate and contextually aware classification [4]. The prompt guides MLLMs to rank the retrieved candidate object categories based on similarity [5]. For object detection datasets, pre-processing steps like cropping and blurring are applied to focus the MLLMs' attention on the relevant objects within the image [3].\n![The RAR pipeline employs MLLMs to rank retrieved categories for final prediction.](image3)\n\nIn summary, the RAR pipeline consists of a multimodal retriever for efficient information retrieval and a ranking system using MLLMs to refine and finalize predictions, enhancing the accuracy and contextual awareness of image classification.\n"}

This paradigm uses SLMs to select the top N candidate labels, which are then reranked by LLMs to make the final decisions [5]. This approach reframes the task as a multi-choice question (MCQ) problem, where each candidate label is converted into a choice using pre-defined templates [5].\n\nThe prompts consist of instructions, demonstrations, and questions [6]. The prompt format converts the demo and sample to input context for LLMs [6].  The study also explores different prompt formats, including text prompts and code prompts [9].

In tree traversal, the process begins by selecting the top-k most relevant root nodes based on cosine similarity to the query embedding [7].  At each subsequent layer, children of the selected nodes are considered, and the top $k$ nodes are chosen based on their cosine similarity to the query vector, repeating this process until reaching the leaf nodes [7].  The text from all selected nodes is then concatenated to form the retrieved context [7]. By adjusting the depth $d$ and the number of nodes $k$ selected at each layer, tree traversal provides control over the specificity and breadth of the retrieved information, starting broadly and focusing on finer details [9].\n\nIn contrast, the collapsed tree approach simplifies the search by considering all nodes in the tree at once, flattening the multi-layered tree into a single layer for comparison [3].  This method offers greater flexibility by searching through all nodes simultaneously, retrieving information at the correct level of granularity for a given question [1]. Tests on the QASPER dataset indicate that the collapsed tree approach consistently performs better than tree traversal, likely because it can retrieve information at the most appropriate level of detail for a given question, as depicted in Figure 3 [1].  The collapsed tree method involves flattening the tree and retrieving nodes based on cosine similarity until a threshold number of tokens is reached ![The image is a graph comparing different querying methods based on the F1 score.](image5).\n\nIn summary, tree traversal navigates the tree layer by layer, whereas collapsed tree flattens the tree to consider all nodes simultaneously for retrieval.\n"}
