For the first time, more now say the government is doing not too well or not at all well in reducing the threat of terrorism (52%) than say the government is doing either very or fairly well (46%).\n\nTherefore, in 2015, 27% of Republicans believed that the government was doing very or fairly well in reducing the threat of terrorism.\n\nTo provide additional context, let's interleave this information with an image quote [3] that illustrates the line graph depicting approval ratings of U.S. Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama over time.\n\n![Public approval ratings of Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama's handling of the terrorism threat](image3)\n\nAs shown in the line graph, by 2015 (year denoted as '15'), public approval of the government's handling of the terrorism threat decreases significantly compared to earlier years, which aligns with the lower ratings recorded among Republicans discussed earlier. It is essential to note that this decline in approval ratings is not limited to Republicans but is observed across the political spectrum, as mentioned in text quote [9]."}

However, if we count the trains indirectly by multiplying the number of cars or carriages for images 2, 3, 4, 5, and 8, which seem to consist of multiple cars or carriages (albeit not clearly visible in some cases), we may end up overestimating the number of trains due to repeating carriages.\n\nIn conclusion, there is one clear, explicit train figure in the images provided, which is the single commuter train in image7 [7].

Noticeably, there are significant differences in trust levels regarding various international sources, including the World Health Organization (WHO) and the European Union (EU).\n\nA visualization of trust levels among different political groups for the WHO, EU, and the Chinese government can be found in the chart below (image1) [10]:\n\n- For the WHO, trust levels increase from Conservative Republicans (27%) to Liberal Democrats (86%), with a difference of +59%.\n- For the EU, trust levels increase from Conservative Republicans (49%) to Liberal Democrats (79%), with a difference of +30%.\n- For the Chinese government, trust progresses from Conservative Republicans (5%) to Liberal Democrats (21%), with a difference of +16%.\n\nMoving to the age division, as shown in the bar chart (image2), American adults ages 65 and older are 16 percentage points more likely than those under 30 to say China will have less global influence after the crisis [2]. However, the question specifically interests the difference in the lack of trust towards the WHO between older adults and postgraduates in terms of the EU.\n\nImportantly, the survey also reports that 20% of U.S. adults who have completed high school or less say they trust information from WHO, while 14% of postgraduates express a lack of trust in information from the EU about the coronavirus outbreak [4, 6]. Comparing these percentages, we find that people with postgraduate degrees are less likely to lack trust in information from the EU compared to those aged 65 and over who lack trust in the WHO. In short, there is about a 6 percentage point difference in the lack of trust (“More” or “A fair amount”) towards the WHO and EU between postgraduates and the age group 65 and older.\n\nTo summarize, while there is a discrepancy between age groups and trust in China's global influence after the coronavirus outbreak, the question was about the difference in the lack of trust towards the WHO and European Union between older adults and postgraduates. By examining the data, we find that postgraduates are less likely to lack trust in information from the EU compared to those aged 65 and over who lack trust in the WHO, with a difference of approximately 6 percentage points.\n\n![A difference of approximately 6 percentage points in lack of trust towards the WHO and EU between postgraduates and 65+ age group.](image2)\n\n![Chart showing trust levels among different political groups for the WHO (World Health Organization), EU (European Union), and the Chinese government.](image1)"}

Although the provided information doesn't directly break down genders for those who never listen to the radio, we can combine the data from image1 on wave III and image3 on radio listening habits.\n\nFirstly, let's take a look at the sample size from wave III provided in image1, which is 4,021 individuals. Now let's consider the radio listening habits from image3, where 46% of respondents never listened to the radio. To find out how many female respondents never listen to the radio, we'll need to know the gender distribution in wave III. Unfortunately, the data does not give explicit information about gender distribution for each radio listening category. However, image2 shows that the sample is relatively evenly divided between men and women, with around 50% for each gender.\n\nAssuming the gender distribution in wave III is similar to the one shown in image2, we can calculate an estimate of the number of female respondents who never listen to the radio. Let's denote the number of female respondents as F and the number of male respondents as M. We have:\n\nF + M = Sample size (4021)\nF ≈ 2010.5 (assuming 50% females)\nM ≈ 2010.5 (assuming 50% males)\n\nNow, we can find approximately the number of female respondents who never listen to the radio by multiplying the total number of female respondents by the proportion of people who never listen to the radio:\n\nNumber_of_female_respondents_not_listening_to_radio ≈ 2010.5 * 0.46 ≈ 929\n\nWhile the data does not allow for a precise calculation, with these assumptions, we can estimate that around 929 female respondents from wave III never listen to the radio in the recent half-year.\n\n![An estimated 929 female respondents in wave III never listened to the radio in recent half-year.](image3)"}

A graph (image2) illustrates this trend, with four lines representing different investment stages: Seed, First, Second, and Later.\n\n- **Seed** investments in the U.S. remained relatively stable around €2M throughout the years, with a slight decline by 2009.\n- The **First** investments started just above €2M in 2004, peaked around 2007, and then showed a decreasing trend to just above €2M by 2009.\n- **Second** investments began slightly above €4M in 2004, increased, peaking around 2006/2007, and then declined to below €4M by 2009.\n- **Later** investments started below €8M in 2004, peaked around 2007, and then saw a sharp decline, nearing €6M by 2009.\n\nAccording to the data [10], the peak of investment activities occurred around 2006-2007 and declined across all categories by 2009. This trend can partially be attributed to the fact that US VC industry lacks the required number of private investors (pension and endowment funds) [9], impacting the investment volume available.\n\nNow, let's compare these trends with Europe's median investments during the same period [5]. A similar line graph (image5) is available, showing the median European investments across different stages.\n\n- **Seed** investments in Europe increased slightly over the years, ranging between €1M-€3M.\n- **First** investments displayed more significant fluctuations, widening from €1-€3M in 2004 to €4-€6M in 2009.\n- **Second** and **Later** investments were relatively lower in comparison to the U.S., ranging between €3-€5M and €5-€8M, respectively.\n\nOverall, during the 2004-2009 period, investments in the U.S. were generally higher than in Europe for most investment stages, particularly during the peak years (2006-2007). Lower investment volumes and fewer private investors in Europe [9] might have contributed to this difference.\n\nNow, it is important to acknowledge that:\n\n> Visibility on European VC Funds for investors is highly limited and prejudiced by the poor quality of published industry fund statistics in Europe.

The U.S. investments were generally higher, though Europe demonstrated a growing trend with few peculiarities in some stages. However, the available data on European VC investments must be analyzed with a critical eye given the limitations and biases in the quality of published statistics.\n\n![Comparative Investment Trends](image5)"}

A narrow majority of Americans (54%) now say they are either very or somewhat confident in Trump to negotiate favorable trade agreements, marking the first area where a majority of respondents expressed a positive outlook. Notably, public confidence in Trump on most other key issues remains mixed, as cited in [9].\n\nTo better understand how political groups perceive Trump's handling of economic policy and ethical standards, we can examine the image described as image1.

This could be an indication of a broader dissatisfaction with his conduct and ethical standards as president.\n\nIn conclusion, the opinions among Republicans and Democrats have generally become more positive towards Trump's conduct since August 2017, but compared to the general public, a significant majority of Democrats remain critical of his behavior. Additionally, Trump's approval ratings are relatively lower compared to some of his predecessors, indicating that public sentiment regarding his ethical standards and conduct may not be entirely favorable.\n\n![Public opinion of Trump's conduct by political affiliation (image1)](image1)"}

Bush [ranging from 44% to 74%], Clinton [45% to 58%], Bush [59%], and Reagan [64% to 67%].\n\nText quote [1] provides evidence of the lower ethical standards ratings for the Trump administration, with 39% of poll respondents rating the ethical standards of Trump administration officials as excellent or good in comparison to 58% who say they are not good or poor.\n\nText quote [9] further corroborates this, stating that the Trump administration also gets low marks from the public for its ethical standards. The lower approval ratings for Trump's administration officials may be contributing to a negative public perception of Trump's job performance [2], as the two factors are connected.\n\nIt's noteworthy to mention that the differences in approval ratings are significant across demographic groups, as displayed in image2, with younger adults, those with higher education, and non-whites more likely to disapprove of the job Trump is doing [10]. These differences may also influence approval ratings of Trump administration officials' ethical standards.\n\nThe image4 highlights the differences in opinions among various political groups, underscoring the political divisions surrounding ethical standards within the Trump administration. Image5 shows a comparison of opinions among Republicans and Democrats, revealing a widening gap in approval ratings of Trump administration officials' ethical standards between the two parties from August 2017 to May 2018. In May 2018, among Republicans, there were more moderate positive opinions of the ethical standards compared to August 2017, while among Democrats, there was a more consistent negative view.\n\nIn summary, approval ratings of Trump's administration officials' ethical standards are lower compared to past administrations, and this low rating may be connected to public approval of Trump's job performance. Yet, it's also important to emphasize the significant differences in approval ratings across various demographic groups, which could contribute to the negative public perception of Trump's administration.\n\n![Comparison of U.S. presidents approval ratings over years](image1)\n![Demographics differences in ethical standards approval ratings](image2)\n![Opinions of Republican and Democratic parties](image3)\n![Comparison of opinions among different political groups](image4)\n![Comparison of opinions among Republicans and Democrats](image5)\n\nThe ethical standards of Trump administration officials are rated lower than those of past administrations, and this may relate to a negative public perception of Trump's job performance, as displayed by the lower approval ratings for the Trump administration's ethical standards and Trump's job approval ratings. This trend is consistent across various demographic groups, with significant differences in views of Trump's performance by age, education level, and race, further highlighting the politically divided opinions surrounding ethical standards within the Trump administration."}

However, the proportion is lower among those with at least a college degree. In fact, 31% of Americans with a college degree say \"high ethical standards\" does not describe either the Republican Party or the Democratic Party. [image4 - Gold bars labeled: College grad+, describes both parties: 17%]\n\nNow, let's examine political affiliations:\n\n[2] Among independents, 65% say the administration’s ethical standards are “not good” or “poor,” while 31% say they are “excellent” or “good.” This is substantially more negative compared to the opinions among independents who lean toward the GOP or Democrats. [image3 - Independents bar, not good or poor: 65%]\n\n[3] Interestingly, partisans are slightly less positive about their own party in views on whether it has high ethical standards. Majorities of Republicans (66%) and Democrats (64%) describe their party as having high ethical standards. [image3 - Total, Republicans bar, describes high ethical standards: 66%, Democrats bar, describes high ethical standards: 64%]\n\n[4] While a quarter of the public says “high ethical standards” does not describe neither the Republican Party nor the Democratic Party, this figure is considerably lower among Republicans (19%) and Democrats (18%). [image4 - Total, describes neither party: 25%]\n\n[10] It is also worth noting that independents are far more likely than partisans to say neither party has high ethical standards. About a third of independents say neither party has high ethical standards. [image3 - Independents bar, describes neither party: 34%]\n\nIn summary, the data suggests that both educational levels and political affiliations have a significant impact on perceptions of ethical standards and approval ratings. Individuals with higher education are less likely to perceive both parties as having high ethical standards, while opinion among independents tends to be more negative compared to partisans. Additionally, Republican and Democratic partisans tend to rate their own party as having high ethical standards, albeit with considerable variation among subgroups. Trump's approval ratings, indirectly, may also be influenced by these perceptions of ethical standards.\n\n![A comparison of political parties' ethical standards and policy ideas.](image1)\n![Disapproval and Approval Ratings across demographic groups.](image2)\n![Opinions among different political groups on ethical standards.](image3)\n![Perceptions of political parties across multiple attributes, including ethical standards.](image4)\n![Engagement with an unspecified subject among different demographic groups.](image5)"}

A somewhat smaller - but still wide - majority of Trump supporters say that his election makes them feel proud (74%). However, Clinton voters generally express feelings of unease, sadness, fear, and anger, not finding hope or pride in Trump's victory. [1], [7], [8]\n\nIn terms of expectations for Trump's first term, there is a divide between the two groups. On balance, voters are optimistic about Trump’s first term; 56% say it’s more likely that Trump will have a successful first term, while 39% say it’s more likely that he'll have an unsuccessful first term. These expectations are less positive than in 2008 following Obama's victory, but about the same as they were four years ago after Barack Obama’s reelection. However, according to [10], just 15% of Clinton supporters think Trump’s first term will be successful, while 76% think it will be unsuccessful.\n\nTo further visualize the emotional differences presented in the text quotes, [5] shows that Trump voters predominantly feel hopeful and proud (96% and 74%, respectively), while Clinton voters mostly feel uneasy (90%), sad (77%), scared (76%), and angry (62%). To compare Clinton voters' expectations for Trump's first term to their emotional reactions following his election, one can look at [5] again. Here, we can see that hopeful and proud feelings are significantly lower among Clinton voters, with only 7% and 1%, respectively, expressing those emotions post-election.

Moreover, only 15% of Clinton supporters think Trump's first term will be successful, while 76% believe it will be unsuccessful [4].\n\nOn the other hand, Trump voters are overwhelmingly confident about him as president, with 97% expecting him to have a successful first term, a figure comparable to the 92% of Obama voters who felt similarly about their candidate in 2008 [6]. Furthermore, a majority (58%) of Trump supporters are willing to give him a chance and see how he governs as president, despite reservations among Clinton voters [10].\n\nHowever, the data in image3 indicates that 39% of Clinton voters are unwilling to give Trump a chance, while 58% are willing to give him a chance and see how he governs [3].

This might suggest that Trump voters are more concerned about the Affordable Care Act, given their higher likelihood of advocating for repeal compared to Clinton voters [6]. Economy and jobs also ranked higher for Trump voters (15% and 10%, respectively) than Clinton voters (9% and 7%, respectively) [6].\n\nOn the other hand, environmental issues, climate change, and foreign policy were more of a priority for Clinton voters, at 6%, 6%, and 4%, respectively, compared to their absence or nearly absence among Trump voters [3]. Unifying the country, another significant priority for Clinton voters at 12%, was less of a concern for Trump voters, with only 5% expressing this desire [4].\n\nThese findings suggest that Trump voters have a more internally-focused outlook, prioritizing domestic issues such as health care, the economy, and jobs, as well as concerns related to immigration [6]. Clinton voters, on the other hand, exhibit a broader focus, emphasizing the need for unity, addressing environmental concerns, and engaging in foreign policy. The differing priorities may mirror the distinct views that each group has on Trump's leadership and its potential impact on the country.\n\n![Opinions on Trump's goals](image2)\n\nInterestingly, while a significant number of voters believe Trump's goals are not very clear, over 87% of Trump voters report having a good idea of where he wants to lead the country, as opposed to only 14% of Clinton voters [5]. This discrepancy further underscores the divide in perspectives between the two voter groups regarding Trump's leadership.\n\nIn addition, a substantial number of Clinton voters hope Trump will prioritize unifying the country and address the divisive behavior exhibited during his campaign [8]. Despite this, it appears that many voters, Clinton voters included, have a limited understanding of Trump's vision for the country, with an equal number of voters having a clear vision and perceiving his goals as unclear [9].\n\nOverall, the differing priorities between Trump and Clinton voters indicate a divergent view on the focus and direction of Trump's presidency. Understanding these differences might help foster greater understanding and empathy between the two political camps, encouraging collaborative efforts to address the challenges faced by the nation."}

Among Trump voters, 50% expect race relations to get better compared to 9% who expect them to get worse.

For example, among all voters, 78% of Obama's voters and 76% of McCain's voters believed Democratic leaders in Washington should work with Republicans, even at the risk of disappointing their supporters ([9]).\n\nFast-forward to 2016, the sentiment shifted dramatically. While a majority of all voters (59%) still believed Democratic leaders should work with President Trump, a significantly higher percentage (65%) of Democrats or those leaning Democratic felt differently, wanting Democratic leaders to stand up to Trump on important issues, even if less gets done in Washington ([1]) (image1).\n\nAnother stark difference is the perception of negativity in campaigns. In 2008, 54% of voters perceived more mudslinging compared to past elections, while in 2016, this perception reached a record high of 92% (image3).\n\nNotably, the sentiments towards appointing leaders from the opposing party also shifted. In 2008, 52% of Obama's voters and 69% of McCain's voters believed Obama should appoint Republicans to his cabinet (image4). By contrast, in 2016, relatively few Trump backers wanted him to appoint Democrats to key positions ([7]).\n\nHowever, it is important to note that Democratic voters are now more supportive of a more liberal direction ([2]), which could influence their stance on working with Trump. Conversely, a majority of Republican and Republican-leaning voters want Trump to work with Democratic leaders in Congress ([5]).\n\nIn summary, while 2008 voters generally felt more positive about the election and its outcome, and were more in favor of political leaders working together, the 2016 election was perceived as extraordinarily negative and marked by less discussion of issues compared to past campaigns ([1]). Despite this, a sizeable number of Democrats still feel their leaders should work with Trump, as long as they stand up for their supporters' interests ([4]). On the other hand, a majority of Republicans want Trump to work with Democratic leaders. This shift in attitudes between 2008 and 2016 is evident in the survey results across various aspects, as discussed above.\n\n![Voter opinions on Democratic leaders working with President Trump in 2016 and Republican leaders working with President Obama in 2008](image1)\n![Percentage of voters who believe \"should,\" \"should not,\" or \"doesn't matter\" regarding Democratic leaders standing up to President Trump as of November 2016](image2)\n![Change in perception of \"mudslinging\" in various election years](image3)\n![Percentage of voters who believe Barack Obama should appoint Republicans to serve in important positions in his administration](image4)"}

On the other hand, Clinton voters predominantly express feelings of \"Shocked\" and \"Disappointed\", indicating their disbelief and sadness over Trump's victory.\n\nThese emotions correlate with the overall perception of Trump's performance and mudslinging in the election, as demonstrated in [image1](image1). The line graph illustrates an increasing trend in the perception that there is more mudslinging in recent elections, with the 2016 election reaching a record high of 92%. This potentially contributed to the negative emotional reactions of many Clinton voters.\n\nInterestingly, other factors might also have influenced these emotions, as evidenced by [image4](image4). The table presents public grades for various entities related to a political context, revealing that only about a quarter of voters gave an A or B to Trump, the Republican Party, the press, and the pollsters. On the contrary, a higher percentage of voters (43%) gave an A or B to Clinton. This grade discrepancy could have affected the emotional response of voters.\n\nIt is also interesting to note [image2](image2), which shows that among all voters, the belief that something \"should\" happen is relatively high (55%), while the belief \"doesn't matter\" makes up a sizeable portion of opinions (33%). These findings suggest that voters feel accountable for the election's outcome to some extent, and their emotional reactions seem to reflect the difference between their expectations and the end result.\n\nLastly, [image5](image5) divulges the relative magnitude of various emotions felt among voters. \"Hopeful\" and \"Proud\" are the top responses for Trump voters, while Clinton voters tend to feel more \"Uneasy\", \"Sad\", and \"Scared\". The anger expressed by Clinton voters is less prevalent compared to other negative emotions.\n\nIn conclusion, the emotional reactions of Trump and Clinton voters following the 2016 election are characterized by a stark contrast, with Trump voters feeling predominantly hopeful and proud, while Clinton voters exhibit a range of negative emotions, including shock, disappointment, unease, sadness, and fear. These reactions are likely linked to the overall perception of Trump's performance and mudslinging in the election, as well as their evaluations of various political entities."}

Among Trump voters, approximately 40% expressed that they were not surprised by the election outcome, and 60% said they were surprised [9]. On the other hand, Clinton voters largely displayed surprise; only 12% were not surprised, whereas 87% expressed feeling surprised [9].\n\nRegarding expectations for a female president in their lifetime, a sizable majority of both Trump and Clinton voters (79%) still anticipate a female president will eventually be elected [1]. Interestingly, there are no significant differences in these opinions among men and women or between Clinton supporters and Trump backers [1].\n\nImage1 provides a visual representation of the level of surprise among various voter groups, including Trump and Clinton voters [1]. We can see that Clinton voters overwhelmingly express surprise (87%), while Trump voters show a more divided sentiment, with 40% not surprised and 60% surprised.\n\nIn conclusion, while Trump voters display a more diverse range of sentiments towards Trump's victory, a majority of both Trump and Clinton voters still expect a female president in their lifetime.

However, these opinions have become more polarized along partisan lines.\n\nImage 4, a line graph comparing perceptions over time regarding the encouragement of violence among followers of a religion versus other religions, sheds light on this polarization. It shows that the proportion of people who believe Islam is more likely to encourage violence among its believers, compared to other religions, has increased over time, reaching 45% in 2015. [4][5][9] Notably, this increase is particularly pronounced among Republicans, as evidenced in [5], where it is stated that about two-thirds of Republicans say Islam is more likely to encourage violence, little changed from September 2014.\n\nOn the other hand, the same graph indicates that the proportion of people who believe Islam is not more likely to encourage violence compared to other religions has decreased over time. This decrease is more apparent among Democrats, as indicated in [9], where it is stated that just 30% of Democrats say Islam is more likely to encourage violence than other religions, down from 42% in September 2014.\n\nImage 5, a chart comparing which political party—Democratic or Republican—people believe could do a better job on various issues, reveals that the Republican Party is perceived as stronger on issues related to terrorism. For example, on the question of handling the terrorist threat, 46% of people believe the Republican Party could do a better job, while only 34% believe the Democratic Party could do a better job. [5] This could suggest that people who are more likely to view Islam as a threat are also more likely to support Republican policies on terrorism.\n\nText Quote [6] supports this observation, indicating that growing partisan gaps in views of government efforts to combat terrorism can be observed across the political spectrum. Democrats are now the only partisan group in which a majority says the government is doing at least fairly well [6], suggesting that the Democratic Party is perceived as more effective in managing terrorism, while Republicans, who are more likely to perceive Islam as a threat, may have less confidence in the government's performance.\n\nIn summary, perceptions of Islam's encouragement of violence have varied significantly among different political affiliations, with Republicans being more likely to perceive Islam as a threat and less confident in the government's handling of terrorism.

Younger individuals (18-29) perceived the most scrutiny, with 80% stating there is additional scrutiny solely because of religion. In contrast, those aged 50+ perceived the least scrutiny, with 50% stating the same. This divide in perception correlates with the age-based differences in the perceived importance of terrorism as a national issue.\n\nPolitically, there are substantial contrasts between parties.

Conservative Republicans (57%) are the only major group in which a majority favors greater scrutiny of Muslims, as depicted in another bar chart[3]. Even within the Republican party, there are significant divisions, with conservative Republicans being more likely to favor scrutiny than moderate or liberal Republicans.\n\nThe perceived importance of terrorism as a national issue is another relevant factor. There are wide partisan divides on this question[4][5]. Republicans are roughly evenly divided regarding whether Muslims should face greater scrutiny, while clear majorities of independents and Democrats view such scrutiny negatively.

The political party affiliations in the U.S. and Germany may also influence these preferences as mentioned in [9]: Democrats in the U.S. are more likely to want greater cooperation with Germany than Republicans, and in Germany, supporters of CDU/CSU are more willing to want greater cooperation with the U.S. than those who support the Greens and the SPD."}

The trend is the opposite in Germany, where supporters of CDU/CSU are more willing to cooperate with the U.S., but skew towards closer ties with Russia in former East Germany [2] compared to former West Germany.\n\n![Age Gap between China and Germany](image2) Age also seems to play a role, as younger Americans are more inclined to prioritize closer relationships with China [10]. It's worth noting how this trend is not as prevalent in Germany, with older generations being more favorable towards their country over China.\n\n![Countries' Influence in the US and Germany](image3) Both countries favor increased influence from allies (e.g., the U.K., France, and Japan), but there's a marked difference between perceptions of Russia and China. Regarding Russia, conservatives in both countries lean towards reduced influence, while Democrats and Germans on the left tend to favor more. Interestingly, Americans show a more balanced view of China, whereas Germans are twice as likely to prefer a close relationship with the U.S. over China [8].\n\n![Cooperation Between Countries in the US and Germany](image5) Finally, when weighing the preference for cooperation between Germany and Russia or China, both nations show a preference for Germany. In the U.S, 61% prefer cooperation with Germany, while in Germany, 50% prefer the U.S. [5, 8]. However, it's important to note that there are substantial differences in party preferences within each country regarding their willingness to collaborate with Russia and China.\n\nIn conclusion, political party alignments and ideologies significantly influence the attitudes towards cooperation with other countries, both within the U.S. and Germany. Democrats and left-leaning Germans tend to favor closer ties with the U.S., the EU, and the UN, viewing Russia and China more skeptically. In contrast, conservatives and right-leaning individuals are more inclined to have closer ties with Russia and China or express a desire for reduced influence from international organizations [7]. This cooperation gap between political parties may shape the future relationship dynamics between the U.S., Germany, Russia, and China."}

Both Republicans and Democrats generally support increased defense spending, but Republicans are more likely to favor it, especially when compared to Democratic-leaning independents. However, support among Republicans has fallen by 14 percentage points between 2017 and 2019, as shown in `![Declining support among Republicans for increased defense spending in the U.S.](image5)`.\n\nData from image3 further illustrates the divide, as the political parties CDU/CSU (associated with the conservative view in Germany) and SPD (associated with a more moderate/left stance) show different opinions on defense spending increases. Support for increasing defense spending is highest among CDU/CSU supporters at 51%, while SPD supporters are in the middle at 41%. On the other hand, Greens (a left-wing party in Germany) show the least support for increased defense spending, with only 28% in favor, as per text quote [5].\n\nNow, let's focus on Germany. According to text quote [4], only about half of Germans see an importance of U.S. military bases for their country’s national security, while the other $45\\%$ disagree. `![Public opinion on the importance of U.S. military bases in Germany to German national security](image8)` further illustrates these differing views, demonstrating a significant partisan gap.\n\nYounger Germans, as seen in `![Changes in opinion by age group regarding the importance of U.S. military bases in Germany](image4)`, especially doubt the importance of American military bases in their country. While older Germans are more likely to consider the bases important to Germany’s defense, the majority of those aged 18 to 29 see U.S. military bases in Germany as not contributing to Germany’s national security.\n\nIn summary, political affiliations in the U.S. and Germany play a crucial role in shaping opinions on increasing defense spending. While support for increased defense spending exists in both countries, there are significant partisan differences. Overall opinions on the importance of U.S. military bases in Germany also vary considerably among political affiliations and age groups. Over time, we have seen fluctuations in opinions, particularly among Republicans in the U.S. and younger Germans."}

Roughly six-in-ten Republicans believe China’s international clout will diminish, while only $40\\%$ of Democrats share the same view. Age divides also emerge, with older Americans being 16 percentage points more likely than those under 30 to say China will have less global influence after the crisis (text quote [4]).\n\nRegarding the U.S., there are clear partisan gaps on the question of whether the U.S.’s international influence will be strengthened or weakened after the coronavirus outbreak. Republicans are about twice as likely as Democrats to believe the U.S.’s international influence will be strengthened, while Democrats are about four times more likely than Republicans to expect American influence to weaken after the outbreak (text quote [1]). There is also internal division among Democrats on this question, with liberal party supporters 20 percentage points more likely than conservatives and moderates within the party to foresee the decline of U.S. international influence (text quote [1]).\n\n![Comparing opinions: U.S., EU, and China](image2)\n\nWhen comparing opinions on the U.S., EU, and China, the chart indicates that half of Americans believe China’s influence will decline after the coronavirus outbreak, while the EU's influence is predicted to remain unaffected (text quote [2] and image2).\n\n![Differences in views based on age, race, and political affiliation](image4)\n\nInterestingly, education is also tied to views about how the pandemic will shape America’s role in international affairs.

On the topic of dealing with China, around 53% of Americans have \"Somewhat\" or \"Very\" confidence in Biden ([2]).\n\nNext, we turn to image 4, which is a bar chart outlining the perceived seriousness of multiple issues related to China. Here, we can see that a substantial majority of Americans – 65% – view cyberattacks from China as a very serious issue, while 52% consider China's growing military power as such. The U.S. trade deficit with China (43%) and the loss of U.S. jobs to China (53%) are also viewed as very serious problems by a significant portion of Americans ([9][8]).\n\nComparing the two observations pointed above, it is clear that Americans' confidence in Biden's ability to deal with China sits below the level of concern they express about various issues related to China. This suggests that while there is some level of confidence in the President's ability to handle the China-related challenges, the potential problems – such as cyberattacks and an increasing military power – are viewed as more pressing and concerning.\n\nTo visualize this relationship, let's interleave the quote and image data:\n\n> Americans have less faith in Biden to deal with China  than on other foreign policy issues [[1][2]](image1)\n>\n> _An image showing the percentages of people with varying levels of confidence in Biden’s ability to address global issues. Improving relationships with allies (67%) and dealing with terrorism, global climate change, making good decisions about the use of military force, international trade (all 59%) have higher combined confidence levels than dealing with China (53%)._\n\n> Americans express substantial concern when asked about eight specific issues in the U.S.- China relationship. About three-quarters or more say that each issue is at least somewhat serious [[9]]. Four problems stand out for being ones that half or more describe as very serious: cyber attacks from China, the loss of U.S. jobs to China, China’s growing military power, and China’s policies on human rights [[10]].\n>\n> _Another image highlighting American attitudes towards various priorities and concerns. When asked about the seriousness of different issues, protecting the jobs of American workers (85%) and dealing with global climate change (70%) rank higher than concerns about China (36%), reinforcing the notion that Americans have more concerns about China than confidence in Biden’s ability to address them (image2)._\n\nIn conclusion, Americans' confidence in Joe Biden's ability to effectively manage issues related to China does not match the level of concern they hold about cyberattacks, growing military power, the U.S. trade deficit, and the loss of jobs to China. This disarray underscores the complexities and nuances surrounding the China-U.S. relationship, and the challenges Biden faces as he navigates this landscape.\n\n![Americans are more concerned about cyberattacks, military power, trade deficit, and job loss related to China than their confidence in Biden's ability to effectively handle these issues](image4)"}

In contrast, 70% of Democrats and Democrat-leaning independents (Dem/Lean Dem) tend to prefer focusing on building stronger ties with China, with no significant difference observed across liberal or more moderate/conservative Democrats [6].\n\nHere's a summary of opinions by political groups:\n\n* Total: ~70% favor human rights over economic ties, 72% want U.S. to get tougher on China trade.\n* Rep/Lean Rep: 72% want U.S. to get tougher, ~60% prioritize human rights.\n  - Conservative Republicans: ~81% want U.S. to get tougher, ~59% prioritize human rights.\n* Dem/Lean Dem: 60% prioritize human rights, ~70% focus on building stronger ties with China.\n  - Liberal Democrats: 61% prioritize human rights, 37% focus on building stronger ties.\n  - Conservative/Moderate Democrats: 59% prioritize human rights, 38% focus on building stronger ties.\n\nIn brief, political affiliations in the U.S. hold varying views when it comes to balancing human rights and economic ties with China. While there is a sizable group that supports prioritizing human rights, political groups like Republicans and conservative Republicans tend to lean towards a tougher stance on China trade issues."}

Specifically, the bar chart detailed in image8 demonstrates a stronger preference towards limitation among Americans aged 65 and older (73%) compared to those aged 18 to 29 (37%). Adding to this, a large number of Americans without a college degree show support (64%) for limiting the number of Chinese students at American institutions, while those with a college degree or higher generally oppose such restrictions more frequently (52%) (Fig. 2).\n\nFIGURE 2: ([8]) By education level, Americans' perspectives on limiting Chinese students in the U.S.\n\nRepublicans also appear more likely to back restrictions on Chinese students studying in the U.S., as per data discussed in [3] and [6]. Although Democrats and Republican-leaning independents have more confidence in Chinese leader Xi, there remains a disjoint in perceptions concerning limiting Chinese students. While a third of Democrats show no confidence at all in Xi, the percentage for Republicans is significantly higher (50%) [4].\n\nIn summary, the evidence shows that opinions on limiting Chinese students in U.S. universities tend to be more prevalent among older Americans, those without a college degree, and Republicans – possibly stemming from the higher levels of mistrust and disdain for the Chinese leadership demonstrated by the latter group in the survey [1, 2, 3, 4].\n\nFIGURE 3: ([10]) Across age groups, older Americans are more likely to have no confidence in the Chinese president.

Specifically, 20% of Americans view human rights as a major problem with China, with 3% of those mentioning the genocide of Uyghurs in Xinjiang (image3). Furthermore, when considering what comes to mind when thinking of China, human rights concerns are frequently cited (image10).\n\nEconomic issues also play a crucial role in shaping Americans' perceptions of China.

Cyberattacks from China also concern a majority of Americans, with 65% viewing this as a serious issue in 2021, up from 58% in 2020 (image1).\n\nAnother significant concern is China's policy on human rights. Over half of Americans (50% in 2021) believe China is doing a bad job in this area, a 7-point increase from 2020 (image1). This view is backed by a bar chart (image4) where 20% of respondents identified human rights as a key issue, with a lack of freedoms being a major concern among them (9%).\n\nThe US-China trade deficit is also a cause for concern, although it's worth noting that opinion on this hasn't significantly changed over the observed period (image1).\n\n![Increasing concerns over China's growing military and technological power, cyberattacks, and human rights policies](image1)\n\nWhen it comes to dealing effectively with China, confidence is less than in other global issues (image2).

This is in contrast to other issues like improving relationships with allies (32% no confidence, 67% confidence) and dealing with the threat of terrorism (39% no confidence, 60% confidence).\n\nInterestingly, concerns about China have been growing among Republicans over time. In 2018, 39% of Republicans felt limiting China's power was a top priority, which increased to 63% in 2021 (image5). Similarly, the percentage of Republicans who feel \"cold\" toward China increased from 57% in 2018 to 79% in 2021 (image5).\n\nIn summary, Americans' key concerns regarding China revolve around military and technological power, cyberattacks, human rights, and the US-China trade deficit.

The optimism gap between Latinos and the general public has also widened since 2008, currently standing at 20 percentage points, the largest since the series began in 2004 [3].\n\n![Hispanic Demographic Shifts in Financial Optimism](image1)\n\nA closer analysis of the data from image1 reveals that the changes in Latinos’ financial optimism are significant across various demographic groups. For instance, the optimism level increased notably among Latinos ages 18 to 29 and 50 to 64 by 13 and 16 points respectively [5]. Moreover, both Latino men and women showed improvements in optimism by 11 and 18 percentage points, respectively [6].\n\nNow, let's look at how various Hispanic subgroups perceive their current economic well-being and compare it with the past. As shown in image2, a substantial portion of the surveyed Hispanics believe they are economically better off now than previously. This is reflected in the improvement experienced by all demographic groups, such as US-born individuals and foreign-born Hispanics, women, and those with advanced education. For example, 73% of female Hispanics indicated they were better off economically compared to a previous time [2].\n\nThe optimism regarding future financial prospects among Latinos has also been on the rise. As depicted in image3, compared to 2008, the expectation for improvement in family finances surged by 14 percentage points to 81% in 2015 [9]. This optimism is even more pronounced among certain age groups, with 90% of Hispanics between 18 and 29 expecting an improvement in their family's financial health [8]. Image4 further highlights this trend, indicating that the majority of people regardless of their current financial situation expect improvement in the near future.\n\nOverall, it is apparent that financial optimism among various Hispanic subgroups has experienced substantial improvements from 2008 to 2015. Although there are variations across subgroups in terms of optimism levels, optimism has consistently increased across the majority of demographic categories. Furthermore, the optimism levels of Latinos now generally outpace those of the general population.\n\n![Hispanics' Expectations on Changes in Financial Conditions](image4)"}

[image2] provides evidence that as financial circumstances improve, the optimism for future improvements increases. Among those with an excellent financial condition, 86% (45% + 41%) expect improvements, while among those with only fair and poor financial conditions, a less optimistic 54% (17% + 62% + 8% + 3%) expect improvements.\n\nIt's also interesting to observe the differences in expectations by educational attainment [image4 and 5]. Among those with at least some college experience, 69% expect their children to be better off financially, which is a lower percentage than high school graduates, who have a 79% expectation. [graph in image5] further demonstrates that after accounting for demographic factors, educational level remains a significant predictor of expectation for upward mobility.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that older Latinos, in comparison to their younger counterparts, tend to be more pessimistic about the financial futures of their children [image9]. Furthermore, those with only a high school education are more optimistic than those with some college education, which was unexpected [image5]. This suggests that there may be other factors, such as age or cultural influences, playing a role in financial expectations for the future generations.\n\nIn summary, better current financial situations generally correlate with increased optimism for financial improvements in the future. Equally significant is education level, as educational attainment is a robust predictor of expectations for upward mobility among Latinos. However, there are nuances in these findings, as age and cultural factors also appear to have an impact on the financial expectations of Hispanics for their children.\n\n[72%](image6) of Hispanics overall expect their children to be better off financially."}

Observing the [image5](image5), you can see that the unemployment rate for Hispanics has been consistently higher than that of non-Hispanics across the years from 2000 to 2015. Moreover, the unemployment rate for Hispanics experienced two peaks during the recession periods in 2008-2009 and 2015, with a high of 12.8% for Hispanics, whereas non-Hispanics had a maximum unemployment rate of 6.4%.\n\nIn contrast, the economic perceptions, as depicted in [image4](image4), show a different trend. Although both groups had lower economic perceptions in times of recession, such as around 2008, Hispanic opinions or attitudes show a tendency to be higher and have increased to a greater extent than the general public over the time period considered.\n\nNow, considering the impacts on income and wealth disparities:\n\n[image2](image2) shows median household income trends for Hispanic households versus all US households. In 2014, Hispanic households had a median income of $42,491, which is lower than the median income for all US households at $53,700 ([1]). Additionally, [image3](image3) indicates that only 5% of Hispanics felt less well off compared to a prior period, whereas 16% of the general public felt the same.\n\nOn the other hand, the data shows a larger percentage of Hispanics with lower or no personal financial ratings, such as those with less than a high school education and immigrant Latinos ([4]). Moreover, the Hispanic poverty rate of 23.6% in 2014 is significantly higher than the rate for all US households at 14.8% ([3]). In terms of wealth, Hispanic households continued to have a decline after the recession and had the largest percentage decline in their net worth through 2009 of any major racial or ethnic group ([3]).\n\nThe differences in unemployment rates and economic perceptions between Hispanics and non-Hispanics have contributed to the lingering income and wealth disparities faced by the Hispanic community. Although there is optimism among Hispanics regarding their children's financial futures (5), and a growing impact of the community on the nation's economy (10), more effort is needed to address the economic challenges faced by Hispanics to close the existing income and wealth gaps.\n\n![Hispanics have lower median household income compared to the overall U.S. population](image2)\n![A higher percentage of Hispanics feel better off compared to a prior period](image3)"}

Despite a decline in the unemployment rate from 5.8% in 2000 to 6.4% in 2015 for Hispanics [8, image5], this rate remains higher than the average for non-Hispanics, which decreased from 3.8% to 4.8% [5].\n\n2. **Income**\n\nThe median household income for Hispanic households was $42,500 in 2014 [2, image2 (left graph)], which is significantly lower than the median income for all U.S. households at $53,700 [6].\n\n3. **Poverty Rate**\n\nIn 2014, the poverty rate for Hispanic households stands at a substantial 23.6% [7], far higher than the poverty rate for all U.S. households at 14.8% [2, image2 (middle graph)].\n\n4. **Wealth**\n\nMedian household wealth for Hispanic households in 2013 was a stark $13,700, whereas all U.S. households had a median wealth of $81,400 [2, image2 (right graph)].

This calls for informed policies to help address these disparities and promote economic parity between Hispanics and non-Hispanics in the United States.\n\n![The image displays a line graph comparing unemployment rates between Hispanic and non-Hispanic households from 2000 to 2015.

In contrast, internet adoption among the general public leaped from 50% in 2000 to 86% in 2013 [image4].\n\nInterestingly, when seniors do go online, they demonstrate more persistent social connections than non-SNS users [10]. A pie chart illustrates the three main categories of online usage, with over twice as many seniors using social networking services (SNS) such as Facebook (27%) compared to those who do not use the internet at all (41%) [image2].\n\nLastly, it's essential to emphasize that some segments of the senior population have internet and broadband adoption rates not only at parity with the general public but, in some cases, surpassing it. These groups typically consist of older adults who possess higher levels of education and higher household incomes [6]. The table [image1] below showcases internet and broadband adoption rates for varying age groups, education levels, and household incomes among seniors.\n\nIn summary, seniors and the general adult population display distinct differences in device ownership, online activity, and internet adoption patterns. While overall internet and broadband adoption rates among seniors have been steadily increasing, they still lag behind the national averages, although significant discrepancies exist within the senior population across various demographic groups.\n\n![Older Adults Online and Broadband Adoption Rates (image1)](image1)"}

Age - Older adults under 75 have higher internet and broadband adoption rates compared to those aged 75 and above. For example, [8] highlights that younger seniors use the internet and broadband at rates approaching the general population, while adoption drops off dramatically around age 75 [3].\n2. Education - As shown in [1], affluent and well-educated seniors adopt the internet and broadband at substantially higher rates than those with lower levels of income and educational attainment. Similarly, [7] discusses that certain portions of the senior population have internet and broadband adoption rates that are equal to—or in some cases greater than—rates among the general public, particularly for younger, higher-income, and more highly educated seniors.\n3. Income - Similarly, [1] states that internet and broadband adoption rates among seniors are lower among those with lower income levels. This trend is further illustrated in the table from image5, which shows a progressive increase in internet and broadband adoption rates as household income increases.\n4. Comparison with the general adult population - The Pew Research Center's data [2] indicates that among all U.S. adults, 86% go online, compared to 59% of older adults who use the internet, and 47% of older adults who have broadband at home. These figures suggest that internet and broadband adoption among older adults remains below the national average.\n\n![Seniors' internet and broadband adoption rates significantly vary based on age, education, and income][5]\n\nIn summary, internet and broadband adoption rates among older adults vary based on age, education, and income.

This is evident in [image3], where the table indicates that 90% of seniors with an annual household income of $75,000 or more go online, and 82% have broadband at home. Comparatively, for seniors earning less than $30,000 annually, 39% go online and 25% have broadband at home.\n\nMoreover, [7] shows that college graduates have the highest internet and broadband adoption rates, with 87% of seniors with a college degree going online, and 76% being broadband adopters. On the other hand, those who have not attended college have lower rates, with 40% going online and just 27% having broadband at home [8].\n\n[4][![Trend of internet and broadband adoption among seniors over time](image4)]\n\nNotably, broadband adoption among older adults has more than doubled over a five-year period, as observed in [image4], which shows an upward trend from 19% in May 2008 to 47% in the current data. However, these rates are still well below the national average.\n\nIn terms of cell phone ownership, [4] informs us that 77% of seniors are now cell phone owners. While this lags behind the national average of 91%, it represents a significant increase from the 69% of seniors who owned a cell phone in April 2012. Although smartphone adoption is increasing, it has yet to catch on with the majority of seniors [10].\n\n[5][![Comparison of cell phone and smartphone ownership between all adults and seniors](image1)]\n\nAs explicit in [image1], the data indicates that only 18% of seniors are smartphone adopters, which is well below the national adoption rate of 55%.

The data suggests that income and education levels play a significant role in the adoption of these technologies among seniors. The highest levels of adoption are observed among wealthier, more educated, and younger seniors. Smartphone adoption, however, has yet to become widespread among most seniors, with only a small percentage owning them."}

[7]\n\nThe adoption of smartphones among older adults presents a more nuanced picture. While 77% of seniors now own cell phones, smartphones remain uncommon within the 65-and-older population. [4] [5] The ownership rate among seniors is significantly lower, ranging from 18% [9] to 35% among college graduates, and geographically distributed, with higher ownership rates among seniors in the younger age groups and those with higher household incomes.

However, these rates significantly decrease with increasing age and for those with low household incomes and less educational attainment [2][4].\n\nNow, let's dive into image2 ([2]) that supports this by giving a detailed breakdown of these factors:\n\n- As we can see, total internet usage among all seniors aged 65 and older is 59%, and broadband at home is 47%.\n- Broken down by age, internet usage dramatically decreases with age: 74% for seniors aged 65-69, 68% for those aged 70-74, 47% for those aged 75-79, and 37% for those aged 80+.\n- Interestingly, the data also shows that education plays a significant role. Internet usage among those with a college degree is 87%, while for those with a high school degree or less, it drops to 40%.\n- Lastly, income also appears to have an impact, with 90% of seniors in households with an annual income of $75,000 or more using the internet, compared to just 39% of those in households earning less than $30,000 per year.\n\nRegarding smartphone ownership, image5 ([5]) provides relevant information:\n\n- Overall, smartphone ownership among seniors is 18%, but the rate varies significantly with education:\n  - For seniors with a high school degree or less, the smartphone ownership rate is 10%, while college graduates have a smartphone ownership rate of 35%.\n- In terms of age, image6 ([6]) explains that a substantial majority of seniors own cellphones, but smartphones remain relatively rare within the 65-and-older population.\n- Moreover, image8 ([8]) shows that the smartphone ownership rate decreases substantially for seniors in their mid-70s and becomes nearly non-existent for seniors in their 80s and beyond, echoing the differences in internet usage trends by age.\n\nIn conclusion, internet usage and smartphone ownership among seniors tend to be higher for those with higher levels of income, education, and age. However, it's important to remember that digital divide still exists among older adults, particularly for those who are older, have lower household incomes, and have not attended college. These patterns in internet usage and smartphone adoption among seniors can help us better understand and address the digital divide in our society.\n\n![Internet usage and broadband adoption among seniors by age is shown in an table.](image2)"}

For instance, among seniors with an annual household income of $75,000 or more, 82% have a broadband connection at home, while only 25% of seniors with an annual household income of less than $30,000 have broadband at home (quoted in [4], [8], and [10]).\n\nCuriously, when we look at the table [2], we find that among seniors with some college education, 57% have broadband at home. This percentage is relatively lower compared to senior college graduates, which might suggest that the propensity to adopt home broadband improves as educational attainment increases.\n\nHowever, it's essential to note that the picture is not entirely clear, as factors like geographical location and access to affordable broadband services are also possible influencers. To tackle the digital divide among seniors fully, policymakers and technology companies might consider addressing issues related to access, affordability, and digital literacy in their strategic plans for expanding online services.\n\nTo better understand the broadband adoption landscape among seniors, consider the following summarized statistics:\n\n- College graduates have a higher likelihood of being broadband adopters (image1, [2]).\n- Higher household income is associated with a higher chances of having a broadband connection at home (image1, [4], [8], and [10]).\n- There is a suggested correlation between educational attainment, broadband adoption, and household income, but there may be other factors at play ([2], [4], [8], [10]).\n\nReferences:\n- [1] Internet and broadband adoption among seniors\n- [2]    College graduates —  $\\cdot87\\%$   of seniors with a college degree go online, and  $76\\%$   are broadband  adopters.\n- [4] trail members of the general population at a similar income level.

Those most familiar with the concept tend to express more enthusiasm (47%) but also substantial concerns (76%). In comparison, 4% and 47% of those with less or no awareness, respectively, express enthusiasm, while their worry rate is 14% and 69%, respectively.\n\n![ american automation awareness levels ](image3)\n\nNext, let's examine the outcomes Americans expect from a world in which machines can do many human jobs. The evaluation is skewed towards negative consequences, with 76% of respondents expecting increased economic inequality, and nearly two-thirds (64%) anticipating difficulty finding things to do with their lives.\n\nConversely, only 25% of Americans expect that the economy will create many new, better-paying human jobs. The following possible positive outcomes have fewer supporters: economy becoming more efficient (43%), people focusing less on work (42%), and jobs becoming more meaningful and appealing (40%).\n\n![ expected outcomes of automation ](image4)\n\nIn summary, higher levels of awareness about automation translate to increased enthusiasm, but also more concerns among Americans, possibly due to the predominant negative expectations towards the potential outcomes from widespread automation. It's essential to consider these findings when discussing the evolution of workforce automation with Americans.\n\n![ American attitudes towards automation ](image2)"}

Regarding the question of limiting machines to dangerous or unhealthy jobs, there is a high level of agreement across party lines. According to [6], a robust 85% of Americans favor this policy, with nearly half (47%) strongly in favor. This consensus is further reflected in the image5, where 47% strongly favor, and an additional 38% favor this policy [5].\n\n[image1]\n\nConnected to the issue of dangerous jobs, the opinion on a guaranteed universal income and national service program also shows partisan differences. Democrats are much more supportive than Republicans of both policies, as shown in image3. For instance, 77% of Democrats favor a universal income, compared with just 38% of Republicans [2]. Similarly, 66% of Democrats support a national service program, while 46% of Republicans do [3]. Nevertheless, both Democrats (60%) and Republicans (54%) generally agree that there should be limits on the number of jobs businesses can replace with robots or computers, although Republicans show slightly less support for this notion [4].\n\n[image3]\n\nIt's important to note that, despite these partisan differences, the American public as a whole shows strong support for limiting machines to dangerous and unhealthy jobs [6]. On the other hand, opinions are more divided on the role of government and businesses in supporting workers in the event of widespread job losses due to automation [9]. However, a substantial majority still supports policy solutions such as a universal basic income or national service program for displaced workers [10].\n\n[image5]\n\nIn conclusion, while there are differences in opinions between Democrats and Republicans on specific policies related to workforce automation, there is a high level of agreement on the need to limit machines to dangerous and unhealthy jobs. This shows that the concern for worker welfare and job safety transcends political boundaries and is a key issue in shaping public opinion on automation."}

Some  $65\\%$   of Democrats and Democratic-leaning  independents feel that the government would have an obligation to take care of workers who are  displaced by automation, even if that means higher taxes for others. Meanwhile, a nearly identical  share of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents   $(68\\%)$   feel that individuals should be  responsible for their own financial well-beings even if jobs are automated on a wide scale.\n\nThis quote shows that there is a substantial difference in beliefs about the government's obligation to assist workers who are displaced by automation, with Democratic-leaning individuals favoring government support, while Republicans believe in individual responsibility.\n\n![Obligation to care for displaced workers based on political affiliation](image4)\n\n> [4] Educational differences follow the opposite pattern on this question. Americans with varying levels  of educational attainment respond in broadly comparable ways on the question of whether the  government has an obligation to take care of workers who have been displaced by widespread  automation of jobs. But those with lower levels of educational attainment are far more supportive  of limiting the number of jobs that businesses can replace with machines.

Individuals with lower educational attainment are more supportive of government assistance and limits on automation.\n\n![Opinions on job automation limits by education level](image4)\n\nIn summary, political affiliation plays a significant role in shaping opinions about the government's obligation to assist displaced workers and implementing limits on automation. Generally, Democrats are more supportive of government assistance, while Republicans lean towards individual responsibility. On the other hand, educational level influences opinions regarding the government's obligation, with lower-educated individuals expressing greater support, but the opposite is true for limiting the number of jobs businesses can automate.\n\n![Influence of political affiliation and education level on opinions related to job displacement](image1)\n![Support for Limits on Automation by Education Level](image3)\n![Obligation to Care for Displaced Workers based on Political Affiliation and Education Level](image4)"}

A bar chart illustrates the public's views on whether programs can make decisions without human bias versus their expectation that they will always reflect designer bias (`![Public Perceptions of Bias-Free Decision-Making]({image1})`) [10]. As evident in the chart, older age groups are more skeptical about the unbiased capability of programs.\n\nThe survey also shows that when it comes to automated personal finance scores, 54% believe the system would be effective at helping businesses find new customers, but only 32% think it's fair for consumers to be judged in this way. This 22-percentage-point difference is the largest among the four different scenarios presented (`![Acceptability of Automated Personal Finance Scores]({image2})`) [8].\n\nThe table below compares the perceived effectiveness and fairness of different automated systems:\n\n1. **Automated personal finance score**\n   - Effective: 54%\n   - Fair: 32%\n   - Effective-fair difference: +22\n\n2. **Automated video analysis of job interviews**\n   - Effective: 39%\n   - Fair: 33%\n   - Effective-fair difference: +6\n\n3. **Automated resume screening of job applicants**\n   - Effective: 47%\n   - Fair: 43%\n   - Effective-fair difference: +4\n\n4. **Automated scoring of people up for parole**\n   - Effective: 49%\n   - Fair: 50%\n   - Effective-fair difference: -1 (`![Perceived Effectiveness and Fairness of Automated Systems]({image3})`) [4,5]\n\nThis difference in perception between effectiveness and fairness raises concerns regarding public trust in these systems. People generally find that while some programs may be effective in executing their designed tasks, they don't perceive them as fair to those being evaluated ([6],[7]).\n\nFurther analysis reveals that some systems, such as the personal finance score algorithm, are perceived as fairer by certain demographics. For instance, blacks and Hispanics are more likely than whites to find this concept fair to consumers (`![Demographic Differences in Perceived Fairness]({image4})`) [3]. However, other instances show that blacks express more concern about a parole scoring algorithm than their white and Hispanic counterparts.\n\nIn conclusion, perceptions of fairness and effectiveness differ across various automated systems used for decision-making, indicating significant concerns and skepticism among the public regarding the use of these tools. This discrepancy might imply limitations in public trust in these systems, as they are seen as effective but not necessarily fair ([1],[5],[6],[7])."}

For instance, 65% of Republicans believe Trump will be successful in the long run [3], and 76% of them consider the ethical standards of Trump's administration excellent or good [10]. On the other hand, 90% of Democrats view these ethical standards negatively [10]. Divergent opinions can also be seen in the popularity ratings, with Trump hovering around 39% approval, far lower than the 55% approval rating seen for George W.

As of January 2019, about two-thirds of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents (65%) [1] believe Trump will be a successful president in the long run, while a stark contrast is observed amongst Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents, where only 3% consider him successful. At this point in his third year, [image1] clearly shows that Trump's rank among his party supporters is comparable to George W. Bush's, whereas the views of Democrats are more negative towards Trump compared to their views of Bush, Obama, and Clinton at similar points.\n\n[2,3,4] As for the trend over time, the share of Americans who think it's too early to tell whether Trump will be successful is significantly lower than at comparable points for previous presidents (e.g., at 47% for Obama and 43% for Clinton) [4]. Additionally, party affiliation seems to play a crucial role in forming opinions about Trump's success, with partisans being more likely to offer views on Trump’s success than prior presidents [3].\n\n[5,6] Interestingly, an even larger share of Democrats (80%) think Trump will be an unsuccessful president, which coincides with low expectations for Trump’s legacy [5] [6], as about half (47%) think Trump will be unsuccessful in the long run compared to fewer (29%) who think he will be successful. Compared with his three most recent predecessors, far fewer people think it is “too early to tell” whether Trump will be successful or unsuccessful [9].\n\n[7] Discussing Trump's economic policies, positive views among Republicans and Republican-leaning independents have been accentuated since Trump’s election, with 75% rating economic conditions as excellent or good in January 2019 [7]. Partisan views of Trump’s economic policies have become more polarized since the fall of 2017, with a nearly eight-in-ten Republicans (79%) saying that his economic policies have improved conditions in the country [8].\n\nIn conclusion, perceptions of Trump's presidency among party affiliates differ significantly from previous presidents, with Trump enjoying high support from Republican-leaning individuals and low support from Democrats. However, the share of people who believe it is too early to tell whether Trump will be successful is lower than at comparable points for previous presidents.

From the text quote [1], we can observe that about 87% of Democrats view the U.S. response as less effective, while only 22% of Republicans hold this opinion. This divergence in opinions is presented visually in `image1`.\n\nsecondly, the trust in institutions and leaders varies across political lines. As shown in `image2`, hospitals and medical centers receive high trust ratings from both Democrats and Republicans. However, public health officials like the CDC receive significantly higher trust from Democrats compared to Republicans, with 72% and 53% of Democrats and Republicans, respectively, expressing their confidence.\n\nLastly, we can see that partisan opinions are consistently apart when it comes to perceptions of COVID-19 responses. For instance, `image3` indicates that there's a difference in opinions regarding significantly reducing coronavirus infections to reopen the economy and beliefs about the primary reasons for increased cases. These partisan differences are further showcased in `image4`, which illustrates fluctuating approval ratings for various entities and leaders.\n\nLast but not least, as time passes and the pandemic persists, trust and approval ratings have fluctuated. In particular, `image5` demonstrates a decline in approval ratings for public health officials, local and state elected officials, and Donald Trump, particularly among Republicans. On the other hand, Democrats' ratings for public health officials remained largely stable, although trust in Donald Trump remains very low.\n\nIn conclusion, partisan divides play a considerable role in shaping perceptions of COVID-19 response effectiveness and trust in institutions.

According to the data from the August 2022 survey, Latino registered voters identify with or lean toward the Democratic Party over the Republican Party by a nearly two-to-one margin (64% vs. 33%). This pattern is consistent with the findings from a 2021 Pew Research Center study, where substantial shares of Latino voters fell into groups with soft ties to the political parties [2]. However, the future party affiliation of Latino voters remains uncertain [3].\n\n![The Republican Party's share in the political landscape](image2)\n\nRegarding election issues, the economy remains the top issue for Latino voters, with 80% of them considering it very important in 2019 [5]. This significance has remained consistent, as shown in the August 2022 survey, where about $80\\👍\\%$ of Latino registered voters consider the economy a very important issue when deciding who to vote for in the upcoming congressional midterm elections. Other important issues include health care (71%), violent crime and education (70% each), and gun policy (66%) [10].\n\nNotably, abortion has risen in importance as a voting issue among Latino voters in recent months. This shift is likely due to the Supreme Court's decision to end the federal guarantee of a right to legal abortion in the United States [8]. In August, nearly six-in-ten Hispanic voters (57%) say the issue is very important, up from 42% in March [8].\n\nDemographic factors play a role in shaping Latino voters' preferences. The strength of Hispanic identity is linked to how Hispanic registered voters would vote. Most Hispanics who say being Hispanic is extremely or very important to how they think of themselves (60%) would vote for the Democratic candidate in their local congressional district. This highlight [7] is supported by the survey results [4], where we can see that Latino registered voters prefer the Democratic candidate over the Republican candidate by 53% to 28%.\n\n![Demographic factors influencing voting preferences](image5)\n\nThe image [image4] summarizes survey results about the preferences of different voter demographic groups towards Democratic or Republican candidates. Notably, among Latino registered voters, there is a clear preference for the Democratic candidate. Furthermore, the importance of being Latino to a voter's identity is linked to their political preferences, with those who consider their Latino identity to be extremely or very important being more likely to vote for the Democratic candidate [7].\n\nIn conclusion, Latino voters' party affiliation and important election issues have remained consistent over the years.

For instance, you'll see that 36% of all Latinos identify as Democrats, whereas 19% affiliate as Republicans. Inside these groups, we find differences based on education level, nativity, age, language dominance, and other factors.\n\nFurthermore, a significant share of Hispanics see a great deal of difference between what the two major parties stand for. [1]\n\nCompared with Democrats and independents, a larger proportion of Republicans believe there is a great deal of effort being made by their party to earn Latino votes. [3] Among Latino Republicans, 40% say the statement \"Republicans work hard to earn Latinos’ votes\" describes their views well. In contrast, about 70% of liberal Latino Democrats feel that the statement does not describe their views well. [7] These perspectives suggest a discernible contrast in the way different groups of Latinos view parties' efforts to court their votes.\n\n[image2] This chart reveals that a greater percentage of Republicans and conservatives, specifically among Republican leaners, perceive a great deal of difference in the parties' efforts to earn their vote compared to the overall Hispanic population and independents. Democrats, on the other hand, generally see fewer differences between the parties' outreach efforts.\n\nTied to this, Spanish speakers, immigrants, Catholics, and evangelicals tend to agree that Democrats work hard to earn their vote, while fewer believe Republicans make similar efforts. [2, 4, 9] Importantly, many elderly Latinos also hold this view. [4, 6]\n\n[image3 and image4] These bar charts show that significant disparities exist among various demographic groups in terms of assessment of political parties' efforts. For example, a higher percentage of Republicans ranks the perceived efforts of their party as \"extremely/very well,\" compared to the overall Latino population and Democrats. Interestingly, many Latino independents perceive efforts from both parties moderately well, suggesting potential opportunities for either party to gain their support.\n\nIn conclusion, perceptions of political parties' efforts to earn Latino votes differ significantly among various demographic groups.

Conversely, roughly a third of Latino Republicans and GOP leaners perceive the Democratic Party as caring about Latinos, compared to 21% of Latino Democrats and Democratic leaners [8].\n\nAnother indication of the disconnect is the perception of representation [6]. Noteworthy percentages of Hispanic partisans from both parties have at least a somewhat favorable view of the opposing party. [image4] demonstrates this, as approximately three-quarters of all Hispanics rate the Democratic Party positively on statements about caring about Latinos and working hard to earn their votes, while only about two-thirds say the same about the Republican Party. However, it is essential to take note that the Democratic Party has more favorable perceptions across the board.\n\nWhen we look at party affiliation trends [2][9][10], it's clear that Latino registered voters identify with or lean toward the Democratic Party over the Republican Party by a nearly two-to-one margin. Although opinions on the parties may change, the majority of Latino voters remain unsatisfied with the current state of the country and are dissatisfied with President Biden's performance [9].\n\nMoreover, the 2021 Pew Research Center study found substantial shares of Latino voters fell into groups with soft ties to the political parties [4]. This could potentially indicate a more nuanced outlook from Hispanic voters, with a substantial number of undecided or undetermined opinions regarding party affiliation.\n\nIn conclusion, the perceptions of the Democratic and Republican parties' efforts to engage with Latino voters differ significantly among different political affiliations. While there are substantial differences, it seems that the Democratic Party generally benefits from more favorable perceptions among Hispanics.

The study explores their views and party affiliations leading up to the midterm elections, providing valuable insights into the topic at hand [2].\n\nFrom the survey, it is evident that Latino registered voters identify with or lean toward the Democratic Party over the Republican Party by a nearly two-to-one margin (64% vs. 33%) [8].

This shows that although many Hispanics perceive only a fair amount of difference, there is still a substantial group that sees significant differences between the parties.\n\nTo tie this information together, while Latino party identification has shown little shift over the years, there is evidence suggesting that a significant portion of Hispanics recognize differences between the political parties. This awareness, combined with various important issues like the economy, healthcare, and education, could influence the way Latino voters decide in upcoming elections such as the 2022 congressional midterms (quote [3]).\n\nIn conclusion, although just a few Hispanics see a great deal of difference between the parties, this group could have a substantial impact on party affiliations in recent years. The evolving importance of issues such as the economy and healthcare may also play a pivotal role in determining how Hispanic voters cast their ballots.\n\n![Evolution of party differences among Hispanics based on political affiliation.](image1)\n![Comparative analysis of Democratic and Republican parties' affiliation over years 2019-2022.](image2)"}

However, it's worth noting that many women in STEM also value flexibility, which is crucial for maintaining a balance between work and family obligations, potentially addressing concerns about work-life balance."}

According to the text [1], [2], and [3], women are more likely to see discrimination in recruitment, hiring, and promotions as a major reason for the lack of gender diversity in STEM, with 48% of women in STEM jobs compared to 29% of men. The image1 provides further details, showing that discrimination in these areas is the third-highest reason for the underrepresentation of women, with 39% of women citing this as a major factor.\n\nFor blacks and Hispanics, the primary factors contributing to the underrepresentation in STEM, as stated in the text [4], [5], [6], [7], and [8], include a lack of access to quality education to prepare them for STEM fields, a lack of encouragement to pursue STEM from an early age, and the perception of discrimination in recruitment, hiring, and promotions. The image1 corroborates these findings, with limited access to quality education (42%) being the highest-ranked reason for underrepresentation for blacks and Hispanics, followed closely by lack of encouragement to pursue STEM (41%). In contrast, discrimination across races and ethnicities shows a significant difference, with 72% of blacks in STEM jobs citing discrimination as a major reason for underrepresentation, compared to 27% of whites and 28% of Asians [8].\n\nIn conclusion, while both women and racial/ethnic minority groups identify discrimination in recruitment, hiring, and promotions as a major deterrent in their representation in STEM jobs, executional differences in access to quality education and encouragement to pursue STEM from an early age contribute to disparities between women and racial/ethnic minority groups.\n\n![The major reasons for women's underrepresentation in STEM are discrimination in recruitment, hiring, and promotions, and a lack of encouragement to pursue STEM from an early age.](image1)\n![The major reasons for racial/ethnic minority groups' underrepresentation in STEM are a lack of access to quality education to prepare them for STEM fields, a lack of encouragement to pursue STEM from an early age, and the perception of discrimination in recruitment, hiring, and promotions.](image1)"}

Here's an image [7] showing the distribution of education levels among STEM and non-STEM employed individuals:\n\n![STEM and non-STEM employed individuals education levels](image2)\n\nSTEM workers are more likely than their non-STEM counterparts to hold a bachelor's degree (36% vs. 21%) and even more so a postgraduate degree (29% vs. 12%). Conversely, fewer non-STEM workers have a high school diploma or less (37%) compared to STEM workers (7%).\n\nNow, let's look at the type of employment sectors STEM workers predominantly work in. According to the data, most STEM workers (66%) work for a private, for-profit employer, while fewer work for not-for-profit (15%) or government (13%) organizations [8]. Here's an image [8] illustrating the distribution of employment types across STEM job categories:\n\n![Employment types across different sectors](image4)\n\nThe figures depicted in the image reveal that engineering, computer, and physical science STEM workers are particularly more likely to work in the private, for-profit sector. For instance, engineering and computer workers are employed by private companies at a rate of 82% and 77%, respectively.\n\nIn conclusion, among STEM-employed individuals, a majority hold higher levels of education compared to non-STEM employed individuals. Additionally, most STEM workers are predominantly employed in the private, for-profit sector. This suggests that there may be a relationship between education level and employment sector, with more highly educated individuals being more likely to work in STEM roles, especially in private companies.\n\n[1] [Provides information about the overall levels of education among STEM workers, with a focus on associate degrees or some college education.]\n[2] [Provides information about the locations where more highly educated STEM workers tend to work.]\n[3] [Highlights the education levels among college-educated workers in STEM occupations by ethnicity.]\n[4] [Indicates that STEM workers with associate degrees are three times more likely than their non-STEM counterparts to use skills and knowledge from their degree in their current job all the time.]\n[5] [Provides overall information about the data source and setting.]\n[6] [Mentions that about three-in-ten STEM workers have a postgraduate degree, but no additional information is provided.]\n[7] [Shows the detailed comparison of education levels among STEM and non-STEM employed individuals, with a focus on the higher percentage of individuals with bachelor's and postgraduate degrees in STEM professions.]\n[8] [Visualizes the employment types across various job categories, with a focus on the percentage distribution of STEM workers in different sectors.]\n[9] [Does not contain relevant information about the question.]\n[10] [Does not contain relevant information about the question.]"}

It shows that women, particularly those in male-dominated environments, often face more gender-related difficulties than their male counterparts.\n\nNext, let's look at the text quotes, focusing on racial representation and discrimination:\n\n1. [3] Black STEM employees are especially likely to say they have experienced discrimination at work.\n2. [4] Blacks and Hispanics are underrepresented in STEM occupations relative to their share in the U.S. workforce.\n3. [5] Black STEM workers are especially likely to say they have experienced discrimination at work because of their race or ethnicity.\n4. [7] The survey finds a higher share of blacks in STEM jobs report experiencing racial/ethnic workplace discrimination.\n5. [10] Blacks in STEM jobs are particularly likely to say there is too little attention to racial and ethnic diversity where they work.\n\nFrom the provided text quotes, it's evident that Black individuals in STEM jobs experience discrimination more frequently than their Asian and Hispanic counterparts. The data shows that black STEM employees are especially likely to report experiencing any of eight types of racial/ethnic discrimination, at a rate of 62%.\n\nComparing this to the gender-based discrimination, the text indicates that women in STEM jobs are more likely to say they have experienced workplace discrimination due to their gender, with 50% reporting any of eight forms of gender-related discrimination.\n\nIn summary, discrimination does differ among racial groups in STEM jobs, and the data shows black individuals experiencing it more frequently. However, it's essential to recognize that gender-based discrimination is also very prevalent in STEM fields, with women in STEM jobs disproportionately facing challenges compared to their male counterparts.\n\nTo visualize the racial disparities, you may find \"Racial Representation in STEM Field\" [4] image useful. As for the gender-based discrimination, the \"Women in STEM: Gender vs. Workplace\" [1] image provides a helpful illustration.\n\n![Women in STEM: Gender vs. Workplace](image1) helps to show the comparative prevalence of gender-related challenges faced by women in STEM jobs compared to men.\n![Racial Representation in STEM Field](image4) highlights the distribution of women across various job clusters within the STEM field, with engineering roles having the least female representation, around 14%. To illustrate differences in experiences of racial discrimination, it's necessary to consult text quotes, as no suitable image was provided.\n\nIn conclusion: Black individuals in STEM jobs report experiencing racial/ethnic workplace discrimination more frequently than other racial groups. Women in STEM jobs, specifically those in male-dominated environments, often face more gender-related difficulties than their male counterparts.

Among women in STEM, those working in majority-male settings are more likely to recognize gender inequities [1, 3, 8]. For instance, 78% of women in STEM jobs working in majority-male workplaces have experienced at least one form of gender-related discrimination, compared to 43% of those in majority-female workplaces [8].\n\n![Comparing Men and Women in STEM Jobs](image2)\n\nMoreover, the gender balance in the workplace plays a significant role in shaping women's experiences in STEM. Women in majority-male workplaces are also more likely to feel that they need to prove themselves to be respected by their coworkers and that their gender has been an impediment to their success [3, 7, 8]. The Pew Research Center survey also highlights that women working in majority-male workplaces are more likely to experience repeated, small slights at work and receive less support from senior leaders than men doing the same job [5, 9].\n\n![Gender Distribution in STEM Jobs](image3)\n\nNotably, the type of STEM job may also influence the experiences of workplace discrimination and gender inequities. For example, women in computer jobs and those with postgraduate degrees are more likely to have experienced gender discrimination [1, 6]. In addition, women in engineering jobs and other STEM fields with lower female representation face greater challenges [3].\n\n![Gender Discrimination and Workplace Characteristics](image4)\n\nIt is essential to address these disparities in male-dominated STEM workplaces, as the evidence suggests that gender balance can significantly impact women's experiences in the field [7]. As a result, fostering a more inclusive workplace culture and promoting gender diversity in STEM could help improve women's experiences, reduce discrimination, and promote gender equity in these industries."}

This can influence a sense of belonging and identity.\n\nConsider the image1, which presents a bar chart about connection to Hispanic heritage among self-identified Hispanics and non-Hispanics. The figure demonstrates that foreign-born Hispanics of all generations have a higher sense of connection to their heritage, with 82% feeling very or somewhat connected.

According to the data, foreign-born Hispanics prioritize their Hispanic background 28% of the time as an advantage, while 59% believe it hasn't made a difference and 12% see it as a disadvantage. In contrast, second-generation Hispanics are more inclined to view their Hispanic heritage as an advantage, considering it so in 52% of cases, with 42% seeing no impact and 5% perceiving it as a disadvantage. Lastly, third or higher generation Hispanics are least likely to see their Hispanic background as an advantage, with 24%, while 68% view it as having no impact, and 8% perceive it as a disadvantage.\n\nThe first key takeaway is that the sense of connection to Hispanic heritage decreases across generations, while views about the impact of Hispanic heritage on life also change, with fewer third or higher generation Hispanics perceiving it as an advantage.\n\nNow, let's focus on the experiences of discrimination and perceptions of racial identity. Selecting the textual quote [8], we learn that 39% of self-identified Hispanics say they have felt discriminated against because of their Hispanic or Latino background. This insight complements the information in image4, which examines how often different groups identify as Hispanic. Among self-identified Hispanics, the frequency of self-identifying as Hispanic decreases across generations, with only 46% of third or higher-generation Hispanics identifying often or sometimes as Hispanic or Latino.\n\nFor a more detailed look at racial identification, image5 presents a bar chart dividing racial identification into \"Hispanic or Latino,\" \"White,\" \"Black,\" and \"Other.\" Interestingly, foreign-born Hispanics are far more likely to identify as Hispanic or Latino (78%), while second-generation Hispanics report a slightly lower percentage (66%). Remarkably, the third or higher generation represents a significant drop, with only 46% of respondents identifying as Hispanic or Latino.\n\nIn summary, the analysis provided reveals that the sense of connection to their Hispanic heritage decreases across generations and is highest among foreign-born Hispanics. On the other hand, perceptions of being Hispanic as an advantage, disadvantage, or having no impact on life also change, with fewer third or higher generation Hispanics perceiving it as an advantage. Furthermore, experiences with discrimination are more prevalent among first and second-generation Hispanics than third and higher, but fewer of the third or higher generations identify as Hispanic or Latino. These findings underscore the complexity of perceptions of racial identity and the impact of Hispanic heritage among different generations of self-identified Hispanics.\n\n![Generations of self-identified Hispanics have decreasing connection to their Hispanic heritage.](image1)\n![Views regarding the impact of Hispanic heritage on life decrease across generations.](image2)\n![Frequency of self-identifying as Hispanic decreases across generations.](image4)\n![Racial identification patterns change across generations, with fewer third or higher generation Hispanics identifying as Hispanic or Latino.](image5)"}

This might suggest that a stronger connection to their heritage could potentially influence their perception of discrimination.\n\n![Perceptions of discrimination among self-identified Hispanics by generation.](image6)\n\nAs evidenced in image 6, 42% of foreign-born Hispanics report experiencing discrimination due to their Latino background, with 28% of them experiencing it often or sometimes. Conversely, 29% of third or higher generation Hispanics report experiencing the same levels of discrimination, with only 6% reporting experiencing it often or sometimes.\n\n![Distribution of responses to a survey question about the broadness of friend circles among self-identified Hispanics by generation.](image3)\n\nImage 3 shows that a smaller percentage of third or higher generation Hispanics claim that most or all of their friends are Hispanic or Latino (37%) compared to foreign-born Hispanics (77%). This indicates that the integration of third or higher generation Hispanics among non-Hispanic communities might influence the perception of discrimination, as they may have less exposure to their ethnic group.\n\n![Racial identification of self-identified Hispanics and non-Hispanics.](image4)\n\nIn Image 4, the racial identification of self-identified Hispanics and non-Hispanics is presented. The data shows that third or higher generation Hispanics are more likely to identify as white (25%) compared to foreign-born Hispanics (11%). This shift in identification might affect how they perceive discrimination, as they may be more likely to blend in with the non-Hispanic population.\n\n![Rates of identifying as Hispanic by generation.](image5)\n\nFinally, image 5 demonstrates that a smaller percentage of third or higher generation Hispanics often identify as Hispanic or Latino compared to foreign-born Hispanics (6% versus 8%, respectively). This decline in self-identification as Hispanic or Latino over generations further solidifies the idea that generational differences impact the perception of discrimination and racial identification.\n\nIn conclusion, as we've analyzed the data, it becomes evident that generational differences contribute to the perception of discrimination and racial identification among self-identified Hispanics. Specifically, foreign-born Hispanics report experiencing more discrimination, have a stronger connection to their ethnicity, and are less likely to identify as white compared to third or higher generations, who abide by this trend to a lesser extent."}

This mirrors the use pattern for country of origin terms, with the share that says they most often use the term \"American\" to describe themselves rising from just 7% among immigrants to 56% among the third generation or higher. By contrast, among immigrants, 65% say they are most often foreign born [1].\n\nAnother characteristic that reflects generational differences is the use of Spanish. The data in image4 shows that the share of self-identified Hispanics who speak Spanish declines as we move through the generations, with 92% of third or higher generation Hispanics not speaking Spanish, compared to 58% of foreign-born Hispanics. The data also shows that the share of Hispanics who have a Spanish last name also declines with each generation, with 92% of third or higher generation Hispanics not having a Spanish last name.\n\nOverall, as we move from the foreign-born generation to the third or higher generation, there is a clear trend of greater assimilation into American culture, as evidenced by the declining connection to country of origin, increased use of the term \"American\" to describe themselves, and decreased use of Spanish. This may be due in part to the fact that the third or higher generation was born in the U.S. and has grown up with a primarily American cultural experience.\n\n[image1]: A bar chart showing the generational status of self-identified Hispanics and their connections with their country of origin.\n[image4]: A chart comparing the self-identified Hispanics' preferences for speaking Spanish and having a Spanish last name across the three generations: foreign-born, second generation, and third or higher generation."}

This table shows that both Palo Alto University and Mountain View saw notable increases in their populations between the years 2012 and 2014. Palo Alto University's population increased by 38%, while Mountain View's population grew by 16%. This growth in population could contribute to the increase in weekday ridership in these areas.\n\nHowever, text quote [3] (\"Trains are crowded\") and quote [4] (\"Weneed to double Cal train rider ship from 60,000 to 120,000 daily trips by the next decade\") indicate that the current capacity issues on trains may not be able to accommodate this growth in ridership, especially with the additional populations in Mountain View and Palo Alto.\n\nIn [8], we find a potential solution to cope with this increase in ridership: transportation management associations (TMAs). TMAs offer various programs like transit passes, shuttles, carpool, carshare, and educational/marketing initiatives to manage traffic and parking demand. Collaborating with TMAs could help improve the capacity and efficiency of public transportation systems, including trains, as a means to accommodate higher ridership in Mountain View and Palo Alto.\n\nIt's essential to find ways to double the Cal train rider ship from 60,000 to 120,000 daily trips by the next decade, as stated in quote [4].

This suggests that the USA has a considerably higher energy consumption per person, which might translate to higher CO2 emissions per capita from energy use.\n\nImage 3 shows the distribution of global motor vehicle demand. The USA has a significant share in global motor vehicle demand and a high number of motor vehicles per 1,000 people, indicating a high automobile dependence for transportation. In comparison, both China and Germany have lower numbers of motor vehicles per 1,000 people, although China still represents a large share in global demand.\n\nCO2 emissions from transportation are a major concern, as stated in quote [4]. The transportation sector accounts for approximately 30% of CO2 emissions in industrialized economies, such as the USA, and about 20% worldwide. Therefore, higher automobile ownership and dependence could potentially contribute to increased CO2 emissions and a greater environmental impact.\n\nQuote [1] highlights the health risks associated with exposure to benzene, a known human carcinogen, in fuel. Additionally, quote [8] mentions that emissions from combustion vehicles can contain probable or known human carcinogens. Coupled with the disparities in motor vehicle ownership and energy consumption, this might imply that the USA, with its high automobile dependence and energy consumption, could face more severe environmental and health impacts in comparison to countries like China and Germany.\n\nHowever, quote [7] indicates that South Korea is the only nation with standards in place that are expected to have rising GHG emissions from passenger vehicles.

For instance, a retailer leveraging Wi-Fi to feed information into their point of sale (POS), customer relationship management (CRM), and loyalty systems ([4]) is likely to see greater benefits. As for an average retailer, Wi-Fi could contribute $57.2M in sales and $15.8M in EBITA increase in the Hospitality sector, $55.2M in sales and $21.4M in EBITA increase in General Merchandise, and $72.0M in sales and $26.1M in EBITA increase for Food, Drug, Convenience, Mass ([3]; [image3]).\n\nIn summary, Wi-Fi implementation can lead to significant increases in customer loyalty and sales across different sectors. However, the impact varies depending on the segment and the supporting systems in place. The Hospitality sector tends to exhibit the most substantial improvements, with General Merchandise seeing the next highest impact.\n\n![Increased customer and sales for different sectors (General Merchandise, Hospitality, and Food/Drug/Convenience/Mass) when Wi-Fi is added.](image3)"}

In terms of overall sentiment, 48% of respondents believe that employee access to Wi-Fi increases customer loyalty, with a corresponding 3.4% increase in sales. However, it's important to note that this impact varies significantly across different business segments. For example, in the General Merchandise sector, 53% of respondents reported an increase in customer loyalty, and sales increased by 4.3%. In contrast, sectors like Food, Drug, Convenience, Mass (FDCM) and Hospitality displayed less impressive figures, with only 11% and 61% of respondents positively impacted, respectively, and sales increases of 0.6% and 2.5%.\n\nNow, let's discuss the financial benefits for each sector. `image4` presents data regarding average increases in sales and EBITA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, and Amortization) after adding WiFi for both customers and associates across three sectors: General Merchandise, FDCM, and Hospitality. In the General Merchandise sector, the addition of WiFi resulted in a $55.2M increase in sales and a $21.4M increase in EBITA. For the FDCM sector, the corresponding figures were $72.0M in sales increase and $26.1M in EBITA increase. Lastly, in the Hospitality sector, WiFi resulted in a $57.2M increase in sales and a $15.8M increase in EBITA.\n\nTo provide a more holistic view of the financial benefits across all sectors, we can look at the analysis presented in `image5`, which shows average increases in sales and EBITA percentages after adding WiFi for customers and associates. Overall, there was a 3.4% increase in sales, along with a 17.3% increase in EBITA (from 5.5% to 6.4%). Diving deeper into individual sectors, the General Merchandise sector experienced the most significant increase, with a 6.5% increase in sales and a staggering 32.1% increase in EBITA. The FDCM sector, on the other hand, had a more modest 0.9% sales increase and a 5.8% increase in EBITA, while the Hospitality sector enjoyed a 5.2% sales increase and a 17.4% increase in EBITA.\n\nIn conclusion, the availability of employee Wi-Fi is generally associated with positive increases in customer loyalty and sales. However, the impact varies significantly across different business sectors, with the General Merchandise sector showing the most substantial improvements. The financial benefits of implementing Wi-Fi are noticeable, especially for the General Merchandise and Hospitality sectors, which reported considerable increases in both sales and EBITA percentages.\n\n![Employee Wi-Fi Impact on Customer Loyalty and Sales](image2)\n![Financial Impact of Wi-Fi Across Industries](image5)"}

This growth is closely tied to the expansion of e-commerce [3] and digital media.\n\n[image2] highlights the transformation of the e-commerce sector from an inventory-led model to a marketplace-driven one, with numerous acquisitions and the inclusion of new categories like furniture, jewelry, and homes. This growth has contributed to the overall increase in e-commerce sales from $3 billion in 2014 to $13 billion in 2018, as shown in [image1].\n\nThe rise in e-commerce has indirectly impacted the landscape for digital advertising, where advertising spend has increased over time, as noted in [8]. The circular arrow in [image2] suggests that infrastructure, demand, payments, investment, and talent are interconnected and integral to this growth.\n\n[image4] specifically depicts the shift in online retail payment methods, with a steady rise in electronic payment methods like debit cards, net banking, EMI, and third-party wallets, while the reliance on Cash on Delivery (COD) has decreased. This transition enables smoother and more convenient shopping experiences, potentially attracting a broader customer base and boosting online sales.\n\nLastly, [5] discusses the increasing digital payments penetration and the reduction of COD shipments. This trend aligns with the growth in online sales, as customers opt for digital payment methods, fostering the overall development of digital media and e-commerce. The progressive growth in digital media and e-commerce has thereby shaped the landscape for digital advertising and online sales.\n\nIn conclusion, the growth in digital media and e-commerce has played a crucial role in the expansion of digital advertising and online sales between 2014 and 2018, as demonstrated by the increasing digital Ad Spend, the shifting payment methods, and the growing e-commerce sales.

During the analyzed period, product eCommerce showed a significant increase in revenue from $3 billion in 2014 to $13 billion in 2018, while travel and others grew from $8 billion in 2014 to $30 billion in 2018, contributing to the rise in total eCommerce sales.\n\n![Distribution of online retail payment methods](image3) For the shift in payment methods used for online transactions, the **chart in image3** reveals that Cash on Delivery (COD) was dominant in 2013, accounting for 60% of transactions, but marked for a decrease to 50% by 2016. Meanwhile, EMI payments saw a significant increase, growing from 1% in 2013 to 5% in 2016, demonstrating a preference for installment payment options.\n\nThe **age distribution shown in image5** reveals that young adults aged 18-25 are the largest demographic segment, making up 35% of the online shoppers, followed by 26-35 years old, accounting for 55%. This indicates the increase in technology savviness and familiarity with eCommerce among the younger population, which further fuels growth in eCommerce sales.\n\nIn conclusion, the primary factors driving the growth in eCommerce sales from 2014 to 2018 are increasing digital payment penetration, infrastructure development, and rising smartphone usage.

These drivers have led to the evolution of the market, from a focus on discounting to an emphasis on customer experience, customer acquisition, and retention [3].\n\nRegarding the stages of evolution, the market has transitioned from inventory-led to a marketplace model, thanks to acquisitions and the addition of sectors like furniture, jewelry, and homes [7] (as illustrated in image4). The market is currently in a rapid-growth phase, reflecting expansions in infrastructure, demand, payments, investment, and talent [7] (also visualized in image4).\n\nAs for the dominant age group, the data suggests that individuals aged 18-35 constitute the majority of eCommerce users, with 35% falling under the age group of 18-25, 55% between 26-35, and only 2% belonging to the 45+ category [3] (illustrated in image3).

The increasing digital payments penetration, as discussed in [6], is leading to a reduction in the share of Cash on Delivery (COD) shipments [4][5], a traditional but slowly declining payment method [4]. Instead, there is an up tick in the popularity of Electronic Money Transfer (EMI) payments and third-party wallets [6], which are anticipated to account for 15% and 7% of online retail transactions, respectively, by 2016 [5].\n\nThe demographic trends further underscore these e-commerce opportunities. As depicted in image5, a larger percentage of the Indian population falls between 18-45 years of age, with an increasing proportion of users between 18-25 years (35%) and 26-35 years (55%). This aligns with the growing adoption of digital payments and mobile commerce (mentioned in [5]), suggesting that the younger demographic is more inclined towards online shopping and electronic payment methods.\n\nIn summary, the changing landscape of payment methods and the shift in consumer demographics are creating fertile ground for e-commerce opportunities in India.

According to the survey, only 45% of the respondents have access to a radio outside their homes, while 49% have a TV [4, 2]. On the other hand, 86% own a mobile phone [2]. This suggests that mobile phones are the most commonly owned device outside of the home [2].\n\nInterestingly, when it comes to radio listening habits, the picture shifts somewhat. The survey discovered that 76% of respondents listen to the radio via a radio set, and 40% use a mobile phone. However, since most people do not own a radio outside their homes, it indicates that they are probably using their mobile phones to listen to the radio [3].\n\nFurthermore, the survey breaks down radio listening habits by demographics. It revealed that 77% of respondents in rural areas use a radio and 39% use a mobile phone for listening, while in urban areas, 70% use a mobile phone and 49% use a radio [3]. Also, the percentage of people who never listen to the radio is higher for females (55.7%) than for males (37.1%) [4].\n\nIn conclusion, while mobile phones are the most common technology outside the home, the primary method for radio listening remains the traditional radio set, especially among those who have access to one. However, the survey revealed significant differences between rural and urban areas and between genders in terms of radio listening habits [3, 4].\n\n![Device Ownership Outside Home](image1)\n![Compared to Within Household](image1)\n![Radio Listening Habits](image3)\n![Radio Listening Habits by Demographics](image2)\n![Radio Listening Frequency](image4)"}

Roman Catholicism, and Buddhism were the second and third most widespread religions, making up 4.3% and 8.2% of the population, respectively. We can see that the religious composition does not directly correlate with the caste/ethnicity distribution [5, 8] we'll be discussing later.\n\n![Geographic Distribution of Population](image10)\n\nBased on the geographic distribution [9], we can see that the Central region had the highest population share, accounting for 36.5% of the total population. Meanwhile, the Eastern region was home to 21.9% of the population, while the Mid-Western, Western, and Far-Western regions accounted for 13.3%, 18.7%, and 9.6% of the population, respectively. This information can help us understand the regional context in which the caste/ethnicity distribution occurs.\n\nTo dive deeper into the caste/ethnicity distribution, let's group the castes/ethnicities into two broad categories: Madhesi and Non-Madhesi [5]. For clarity, here's an image that summarizes the caste/ethnicity composition as of September 2014 [8]:\n\n![Caste/Ethnicity Composition](image6)\n\nIt's important to note that the Chettri caste comprises the largest share among the non-Madhesi population (15.3%), followed by the Brahmin population (13.5%). Among the Madhesi population, the Yadav castes hold the largest share (16.9%), while the Tharu and Terai populations account for 14.8% and 13.8% of the total population, respectively.\n\nIn summary, while there is no direct correlation between religious composition and population distribution by caste/ethnicity in Nepal as of September 2014, understanding the regional distribution can help us understand the context in which these populations exist.

Additionally, as more users are actively engaging in social media and shopping online, businesses can exploit these trends by capitalizing on e-commerce platforms, specifically for apparel, shoes, and bags.\n\nCiting the text quote [6], mobile devices account for 36% of the average Indonesian's media consumption, making it an essential channel for influencing customer decisions. This aligns with the data presented in `image5`, where apparel is the most purchased item both offline and online.\n\nLastly, referring to the text quote [9], some e-commerce websites in Indonesia recorded substantial growth in mobile sales, with sites like Tokobagus/OLx and Rakuten experiencing impressive growth rates. This further emphasizes the potential for success in mobile business ventures targeting young and entrepreneurial internet users in Indonesia.\n\nTo summarize, the demographics of mobile internet users in Indonesia, particularly the high percentage of young adults and entrepreneurs, are closely related to their mobile content preferences. The trends show that there are significant business opportunities in the areas of mobile gaming, entertainment, apps, and e-commerce, specifically apparel, shoes, and bags.\n\n[![Mobile Internet Demographics and Content Preferences](image3)](image3)\n[![Mobile Content Preferences](image2)](image2)\n[![Potential Business Opportunities](image4)](image4)\n[![Mobile vs. Online Shopping Preferences](image5)](image5)\n\nAnswer: Potential business opportunities in Indonesia lie in mobile gaming, entertainment, apps, and e-commerce, particularly targeting young users and entrepreneurs interested in apparel, shoes, and bags. Mobile content, such as games and apps, are the most downloaded mobile content, while social media, general information, and shopping are popular activities.

In the bar chart [image5], we can see that for Rock music, the dominance of albums (Orange bar) in driving overall catalog activity (Total Activity, represented by green bars) is high at 63%, while song sales (Purple bars) have a slightly higher share at 68%. In contrast, for Pop music, the importance of streams (Red bars) outweighs album sales and song sales when it comes to driving overall catalog activity, with a share of 58%. Both R&B/Hip-Hop and Country music show a mix of album sales (Orange bars), song sales (Purple bars), and streams (Red bars) contributing to their overall catalog activity, with slightly higher shares allocated to streams than album sales.\n\nSo, in terms of the question \"How do the catalog shares of different music formats differ across genres?\", Rock music tends to rely more on albums and song sales, while Pop music predominantly drives its catalog through streaming.\n\nRegarding which albums have the highest on-demand audio stream share, we may refer to the ranked table [image2], which lists total sales, including on-demand audio streams, for various albums. To identify albums with the highest share of on-demand audio streams, we will look for the highest percentage values in the \"On-Demand Audio Stream Share\" column. It is important to note that this column reflects the percentage of sales attributed to on-demand audio streams compared to the album's total sales, not the percentage within the entire dataset of albums.\n\nFrom the table, we can observe that Nicki Minaj and Maroon 5 have the highest percentages in the \"On-Demand Audio Stream Share\" column, with values of 18% and 48%, respectively. Furthermore, [image2] also highlights the highest percentages for \"Song Sales Share\" and \"Album Share\" for specific albums. For instance, Maroon 5 has a high \"Song Sales Share\" of 48%, indicating a high percentage of sales attributed to their individual songs.\n\nIn conclusion, when considering the catalog shares of different music formats across genres, we can observe that Rock music tends to rely more on albums and song sales, while Pop music dominates through streaming. With regards to the albums with the highest on-demand audio stream share, Maroon 5 has a high \"On-Demand Audio Stream Share\" of 48% in [image2], indicating that their music attracts a considerable number of streams relative to their total sales."}

Approximately 30% of Rock music is streamed, 21% of R&B/Hip-Hop, and 17% of Pop music. This preference for streaming is reflected in the total activity share, with streaming accounting for 70%, 58%, and 57% of the total activity in Rock, R&B/Hip-Hop, and Pop, respectively ([image1](image1), [image5](image5)).\n\n![Music Genres Share of Total Activity](image2)\n\nAs for album sales, Rock music leads with Album Sales % at 37%, followed by R&B/Hip-Hop (18%) and Pop (19%).

[10] states that \"Rock is the biggest genre, but R&B/Hip-Hop and Pop are also strong in 2015.\" Looking at the bar chart in [4], which compares catalog shares across different music formats for each genre, we can see that rock, as the strongest genre, has a higher percentage of activity in all formats: albums, song sales, and streams. However, the catalog share of streams for rock is significantly higher (82%) compared to the streaming share in R&B/Hip-Hop (61%).\n\nTo further support this observation, let's examine [1], which indicates that \"Streaming has become the leading format overall and in most genres.\" In the first place, this quote underscores the growing importance of streaming in the music industry, making it a key factor when comparing music consumption across genres like rock and R&B/Hip-Hop.\n\nTo put this into perspective, let's refer to the genre distribution of music streams across different formats, as depicted in the bar chart in image1. The shares of streams for rock, R&B/Hip-Hop, and Pop are 23%, 26%, and 23%, respectively. R&B/Hip-Hop's relatively higher streaming share, as compared to rock, may suggest a leaning towards streaming platforms among R&B/Hip-Hop fans.\n\nIn a nutshell, the difference in consumption format shares between rock and R&B/Hip-Hop genres indicates a stronger emphasis on streaming among R&B/Hip-Hop fans, who also seem to spend more on club events, live DJs, and music festivals (as mentioned in [7]). Conversely, rock fans tend to have a more balanced consumption portfolio across formats, with a higher overall catalog share in all format types. These trends can offer valuable insights into the spending habits and preferences of consumers in different music genres.\n\nNow, let's complete this interleaved response with the image description and citation:\n\n**![Streaming leads in both Rock and R&B/Hip-Hop genres, indicating preference for streaming platforms among R&B/Hip-Hop fans](image1)**\n\nI hope this interleaved answer helps clarify the differences in music consumption formats across rock and R&B/Hip-Hop genres!

The image1 supports this claim by showing that streaming is the largest share (70%) of total music activity. However, album sales still play a significant role, as seen in image2, with the share of total music sales for albums (Physical Albums, Digital Albums, and Track Equivalent Albums) being 54% combined across all genres. The Rock genre, in particular, has the highest percentage of albums sales (67%) within the total activity according to image3.\n\nSecond, the distribution of streams versus sales varies significantly across genres. Rock is driven by both catalog (82%) and current songs, while Pop is primarily driven by current songs (58%) in terms of streams. This suggests that Rock listeners enjoy a combination of old favorites and new releases, while Pop listeners are more likely to stream recent music.\n\nThird, the image4 shows that Rock is the most popular genre with a 30% share of total activity. R&B/Hip-Hop and Pop follow closely, with 21% and 17% shares, respectively. This indicates that Rock, R&B/Hip-Hop, and Pop represent the majority of the music industry.\n\nIf we consider the implications of these trends, it's important to recognize that the music industry is shifting from album sales to streaming. This shift may have several consequences, such as an increased focus on creating catchy, streaming-friendly music, and adapting music distribution and promotion strategies. Record companies may also pay more attention to artists who can consistently produce popular songs, regardless of their total discography.\n\nIn conclusion, the trends in streaming and album sales vary significantly across music genres. While streaming is becoming the primary revenue source for the music industry, album sales still play a crucial role, particularly in the Rock genre. This shifting landscape may have crucial implications on the music industry, such as a greater emphasis on streaming-friendly music and the consideration of artists' streaming performance over their entire discography.\n\n![The visual comparison shows a shift from album sales to streaming across various music genres, with Rock being the largest genre and Streaming having the largest share of total activity.](image1)\n![Share of total music sales across different genres, with Rock, Pop, R&B/Hip-Hop, and Country having the highest shares combined.](image2)"}

The revenue grew from $8.32 billion in 2011 to a staggering $45.37 billion in 2015, as shown in `[image1]`.\n\nSimultaneously, the number of apps in the Google Play Store significantly increased by more than 50% last year. As of 2015, Google Play had over 1.6 million available apps, compared to just 1.5 million for Apple's App Store [9]. `[image2]` presents a comparison of the number of apps available in both stores, with the Google Play Store overtaking the Apple App Store in 2014 and maintaining a slight lead in 2015.\n\nIt's worth noting that the increasing number of apps available in the Google Play Store seems to follow the general trend of growing revenue in the mobile apps market from 2011 to 2015. The more apps available, the more opportunities for users to spend on app sales, in-app purchases, and advertising, thereby driving up the overall revenue in the mobile apps market.\n\nHowever, it's important to remember that other factors like operating system market share, app quality, and user engagement also play a crucial role in driving mobile app revenue. For example, Android's dominance in the global OS market with a market share of 82.8% in Q2 2015 [3] may have contributed to the growing revenue in the mobile apps market, as Android devices have a larger user base.\n\nIn conclusion, the trends in the number of mobile apps available in different app stores seem to positively relate to the revenue trends in the mobile app industry from 2011 to 2015.

However, in deeper layers, the trend reverses, and `S_{pq}` becomes the more significant information flow [8].\n\nMore specifically, when comparing the two mean significance values (`S_{wp}` and `S_{pq}`) directly, the results on the SST-2 dataset show that `S_{wp}` decreases as the layer number increases, while `S_{pq}` increases significantly [10]. On the AGNews dataset, `S_{pq}` reaches a value of 1 early on and remains stable, while `S_{wp}` has fluctuations and generally lower values [12].\n\nIt is essential to note that the overall trend changes from shallow to deep layers. In shallow layers, the information flow from the text part to label words dominates. But in deep layers, the information flow from label words to the targeted position becomes more significant.\n\nBased on the provided evidence, the mean significance of information flow from the text part to label words is not always greater than the mean significance of information flow from label words to the target position.

This high correlation indicates that ICL makes errors in categories with similar label anchors [1].\n\n[5] We avoid directly analyzing the output labels of the model because it was previously indicated that ICL has poor probability calibration (Zhao et al., 2021) [5]. By employing our defined degree of confusion, `Confusionij`, we can mitigate the effects of insufficient probability calibration and get a more accurate representation of the model's degree of confusion for various categories [5].\n\nSince the confusion of Abbreviation is not explicitly mentioned in the text, we need to rely on the analysis of other categories and infer its relationship with Abbreviation. Looking at the most confusing categories for Description and Entity, we can draw an assumption that Abbreviation is one of the categories most likely to be confused with Entity or Description that are directly mentioned in the text.\n\nNow, let's look at the image quotes:\n\n`image1` shows a confusion matrix visualizing classification results for different categories, including Abbreviation. The matrix demonstrates how often the predicted class fits the true label, based on a color gradient scale [image1]. This image helps confirm the explanation found in the texts.\n\nOur answer: Based on both text and image evidence, the most confusing category for Abbreviation seems to be either Entity or Description, as the confusion matrix shows that these categories are the most challenging for the ICL model.\n\nTo further support this analysis, we can consider the content of `image3`, showing multiple confusion matrices corresponding to different values of M. Since we discussed that ICL has difficulties with categories with similar label anchors (such as Entity-Abbreviation and Description-Abbreviation), evaluating various M values could help us gain more insight into the most confusing categories for Abbreviation. However, I cannot directly access those images in the text, so I encourage you to look at `image3` to reinforce our conclusion.\n\nTo tie everything together in a more concise and clear manner:\n\n[1] The proposed approximation prediction confusion matrix `Confusion` identified Description-Entity and Entity-Abbreviation as the most confusing categories.\n\n`![Abbreviation can be confusing with Entity or Description.](image1)`\n\nOur answer: Based on the evidence provided, it appears that the most confusing category for Abbreviation is either Entity or Description."}

By comparing the performance of these methods in both datasets, we notice that our method outperforms others like VAAL, Margin, Entropy, and Consistency, which appear to have a worse label diversity.\n\nMoreover, image4 shows a similar trend for a blood cells dataset, where the Ours strategy selects more data from minority classes like mucus and mucosa while maintaining the distribution of major classes, while other strategies like VAAL have a preference for major classes (muscle in this case).\n\nFinally, from text quote [8], the hypothesis is that the label diversity of a query is an important criterion to determine the importance of the annotation. The hypothesis suggests that enforcing a uniform distribution using ground truth or exploiting the pseudo-labels generated by K-means clustering can reduce the redundancy in the selection of majority classes and increase diversity by including data of minority classes. This implication supports the claim that VAAL and other strategies may yield worse label diversity.\n\nIn summary, based on the evidence provided, it appears that the VAAL strategy generally yields the worst label diversity in comparison to our method and other dominant querying strategies across various datasets.\n\n![The image depicts various querying strategies, with VAAL (Variational Adversarial Active Learning) appearing to have a preference for selecting data in the majority classes and ignoring the minority classes, ultimately yielding poor label diversity.](image1)"}

However, in deeper layers, `$S_{p q}$` becomes the dominant one.

It is evident from the last row of the table that using learned positional encodings at the attention in both encoder and decoder (denoted as `learnt` in the `encoder` and `decoder` columns) leads to the highest AP score of 40.6.\n\n2. [7] presents a study on encodings and their impact on AP. Removing spatial positional encodings and passing only output positional encodings at the input results in an AP drop of 7.8 compared to the baseline. Furthermore, passing fixed sine spatial positional encodings and output encodings at input once, as in the original transformer, causes a 1.4 AP drop. However, using learned spatial encodings in the attentions gives similar results.

[6]). Table 3 (top half) shows reasons for refuted claims, and it includes \"incorrect calculation results\" (41.7%), \"incorrect approximation words\" (33.33%), and cases where \"the claim is partially right\" (10.0%). These results emphasize the complexity of scientific claims and the need for a comprehensive understanding of the data (ref. [4]). According to the image5, the lack of either open-domain or closed-domain knowledge is also a common challenge (25.0% and 15.0%, respectively). Furthermore, the claim may lack sufficient evidence (33.3%), contain vague pronouns, omit specific information, or refer to another table (ref. [9]).\n\n**Citations:**\n- [1]\n- [2]\n- [4]\n- [6]\n- [8]\n- [9]\n- [10]\n- `![The table lists functions related to data analysis tasks](image1)`\n- `![An example from a dataset called S CI T AB with a reasoning graph](image2)`\n- `![Distribution of reasoning steps in SCI TAB](image4)`\n- `![Refuted and NEI Reasons in SCI TAB](image5)`\n\nIn conclusion, the SciTAB dataset presents challenging claims requiring diverse reasoning steps, including basic lookup, comparison, and numerical reasoning. Common challenges include incorrect calculations, insufficient evidence, and the lack of domain-specific knowledge. By understanding these elements, we can develop more effective strategies for addressing the complexities in real-world scientific fact-checking."}

Grounding errors: Occurs when the program incorrectly associates data with the respective cells in the table, accounting for 50% of the errors.\n2. Ambiguity errors: Arises when the claim contains ambiguous expressions that the program fails to represent, accounting for 22% of the errors.\n3. Calculation errors: Involves incorrect floating point arithmetic calculation in Python, leading to inaccurate results, accounting for 20% of the errors.\n4. Program errors: Encompasses mistakes such as incorrect or missing arguments/variables, and erroneous operations, accounting for 8% of the errors.\n\nNow, let's interleave that with the distribution of reasoning steps in the ScITab dataset as shown in image3:\n\n- Red bars indicate \"shallow\" claims, which involve 1–2 reasoning steps: 6% have 1 reasoning step, and 8% have 2 reasoning steps.\n- Blue bars represent \"deep\" claims, which have 3 or more reasoning steps: The distribution is as follows: 15% for 3 steps, 18% for 4 steps, 20% for 5 steps, 15% for 6 steps, 7% for 7 steps, 5% for 8 steps, 3% for 9 steps, 2% for 10 steps, and 1% for 11 steps.\n\nGiven these distributions and the primary error types, it's evident that the complexities in ScITab's reasoning types contribute to the challenges posed by the ambiguous nature of scientific claims and accurate referencing of specific cells, particularly for deep claims. To further illustrate, image2 shows the main reasons for refuted and NEI (Not Enough Information) claims, reinforcing the association between common error types and reasoning types in ScITab dataset. For example, \"The claim does not have enough matching evidence\" (33.3%), a primary NEI reason, can be related to grounding and ambiguity errors, which are hard to handle in deep claims due to their complex reasoning steps."}

However, to better understand the zero-shot and in-context performance, let's refer to image4 titled \"Large Language Models Performance Comparison\".\n\nIn the zero-shot setting, table-based LLMs like FLAN-T5-XL achieve 38.05 for the 3-class setting, which is an improvement of +4.72 compared to random guessing. In comparison, models like GPT-4 show higher performance, as can be seen in the confusion matrices for InstructGPT and GPT-4 presented in image3.\n\nIn the in-context setting, models like FLAN-T5 may perform even better, as they are provided with examples as demonstrations. Unfortunately, specific results for in-context performance were not provided in the text quotes, but you can refer to the \"In-context results\" section in Table 4 for further details.\n\nTo summarize, the primary reasons for refuted claims in the SciTab dataset involve incorrect calculations, approximation words, and partially correct claims. Various large language models have shown promising performance in fact-checking these claims in zero-shot settings. However, further improvement and in-depth analysis, especially in the in-context setting, are necessary to achieve human-like performance.\n\n![Primary reasons for refuted claims in SciTab dataset](image1)"}
{"q_id": 340, "model": "Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3_llm", "in_tok": 3432, "out_tok": 478, "total_tok": 3910, "response": " To address the user's question, we will investigate the primary reasons for refuted and NEI claims in ScITaB and analyze their impact on model performance in zero-shot 3-class classification. Let's interleave text and image responses to facilitate understanding.\n\nFirstly, let's focus on refuted claims. From the text quote [8], we find that the majority of refuted claims in ScITaB contain distinct error types, such as incorrect calculation results (41.7%), incorrect approximation words (33.3%), and claims being partially right (10.0%). These mistakes often stem from grounding errors (50%) and ambiguity errors (22%), as shown in image1.\n\nNow, let's move on to NEI claims. According to text quote [3], the most common features for NEI claims are insufficient evidence in the table (33.3%) and the absence of background knowledge (25.0%), as per image4 under the \"NEI Reasons\" section.\n\nThe diversity of refuted claims in ScITaB is greater compared to other datasets like Sci-Fact, as explained in text quote [8]. This may present a challenge for models as they have to deal with a wider range of complexities and ambiguities, like \"claims containing approximation words\" or \"claims being partially right.\"\n\nRegarding model performance, as illustrated in image2, both InstructGPT and GPT-4 struggle to accurately predict the NEI class, with relatively high percentages of NEI claims being incorrectly classified as 'Supported' or 'Refuted.' This difficulty arises because distinguishing NEI from 'refuted' claims can be challenging both for models and even for human annotators, as noted in text quote [10].\n\nOverall, the primary reasons for refuted and NEI claims in ScITaB, such as calculation errors, insufficient evidence, and ambiguity issues, impact the performance of models in zero-shot 3-class classification by causing difficulties in accurately predicting the NEI class.\n\n![Refuted and NEI claim types in ScITaB](image4)"}
{"q_id": 341, "model": "Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3_llm", "in_tok": 3700, "out_tok": 509, "total_tok": 4209, "response": " To compare the performance of InstructGPT and GPT-4 on the zero-shot 3-class classification task and analyze the types of errors contributing to their performance differences, let's first examine their performance.\n\n[1] In the context of the SCITAB dataset, both InstructGPT and GPT-4 show some challenges, as their results are only marginally superior to random guessing. GPT-4 achieves a macro- $F_{1}$  score of 64.80, while InstructGPT's score is not provided, but we suspect it would be lower considering the difficulties faced by open source LLMs [6].\n\n![Performance Comparison](_images1)\n\nBoth models struggle with the NEI class [10], and they exhibit different types of errors. InstructGPT tends to be \"less confident,\" often classifying supported and refuted claims as NEI, whereas GPT-4 exhibits overconfidence, incorrectly categorizing NEI claims as either supported or refuted [10].\n\nNow let's explore the types of errors that affect their performance. Both models seem to struggle with grounding errors and ambiguity errors [9]. Grounding errors occur when the program incorrectly associates data with respective cells in the table, while ambiguity errors happen due to the ambiguous nature of scientific claims [9]. These difficulties underscore the complexities and unique challenges of our dataset.\n\n![Error Types](_images2)\n\nFurther analysis reveals that grounding errors are the most prevalent issue, accounting for 50% of errors. Ambiguity errors follow closely with 22% [4]. These findings contribute to the performance differences between InstructGPT and GPT-4, as GPT-4's limited ability to deal with ambiguous claims [5] leads to a higher number of errors and lower performance on the NEI class [10].\n\nIn concluding, both InstructGPT and GPT-4 face challenges in the zero-shot 3-class classification task on our SCITABdataset. Their performance differences stem primarily from errors related to grounding and ambiguity in scientific claims [9]. Addressing these challenges is essential for improving large language models' performance on scientific fact-checking tasks.\n\n![Challenges and Solutions](_images5)"}

This suggests that both models have difficulty distinguishing whether a claim is \"verifiable\" [6].\n\nNow, let's examine the confusion matrices for InstructGPT and GPT-4 under the zero-shot 3-class setting [image2]. The confusion matrices illustrate the percentage distribution across prediction labels versus the actual gold labels.\n\n* **InstructGPT**: The model often produces false positives, especially predicting NEI when the actual label is Supported or Refuted. This supports the notion of \"less confident\" behavior.\n* **GPT-4**: GPT-4, on the other hand, shows overconfidence by predicting multiple labels as Supported or Refuted when the actual label is NEI.\n\nThese differences suggest that both InstructGPT and GPT-4 have accuracy and error tendencies that primarily revolve around their difficulty in correctly predicting the NEI class. This issue persists even in zero-shot 3-class classification tasks, highlighting the challenges they face when confronted with ambiguous claims that require disambiguation [4].\n\nIn summary, the performance of InstructGPT and GPT-4 shows that they both struggle with distinguishing between 'refuted' and 'NEI' claims, suggesting a need for further research to address their limitations in ambiguous claim disambiguation and table-based reasoning.\n\n![InstructGPT and GPT-4 struggle with distinguishing between 'refuted' and 'NEI' claims, showing a need for further research](image5)"}

According to the confusion matrices, both InstructGPT and GPT-4 exhibit difficulty in predicting the NEI class correctly. InstructGPT tends to classify more supported and refuted claims as NEI (see image5), indicating a lower confidence in making a firm decision when the claim information is not clearly verifiable. On the other hand, GPT-4 tends to over-confidently categorize NEI claims as either supported or refuted (see image5). This can be seen as GPT-4's inclination to provide definitive answers, even when the provided data does not fully support it.\n\nTo further understand these challenges, we can consider the types of errors that exist in S CI T AB ([3]). The Table 5 mentioned in the text shows different types of errors that the generated Python programs encounter during the verification process, classified into four categories: Grounding errors, Ambiguity errors, Calculation errors, and Program errors. In our dataset, Grounding errors and Ambiguity errors present unique challenges for both InstructGPT and GPT-4, making it harder for these models to accurately reference the specific cells to which a claim refers or handle ambiguous scientific claims, respectively ([3]). These challenges likely contribute to the difficulties the models face in accurately classifying NEI claims.\n\nIn summary, the main challenges faced by InstructGPT and GPT-4 in accurately classifying NEI claims in the zero-shot 3-class classification task are the occurrence of Grounding errors and Ambiguity errors, as these difficulties make it harder for these models to accurately reference the specific cells to which a claim refers or handle ambiguous scientific claims, respectively. These challenges differ between the two models in terms of the degree of over- or under-confidence they display when categorizing NEI claims.\n\n![Challenges in NEI claim classification include Grounding and Ambiguity errors, impacting model confidence and overall performance.](image5)"}

Correctness, however, starts high and slightly decreases, suggesting a higher tolerance for inaccurate retrieved knowledge compared to the need for precise and complete knowledge. This underscores the importance of improving retrieval accuracy to enhance the models' ability to generate high-quality answers with accurate citations."}

This is evident from the higher Micro-F1 values observed when models are provided with logical constraints (w. lc) compared to without (w/o. lc).\n\n2. **Effect of Demonstration Samples**: As the number of demonstrations increases, there is an initial significant improvement in performance, but the gains become less substantial for larger numbers of demonstrations. This can be seen in the graphs (images 4 and 7) where the performance curves flatten out for larger sample sizes.\n\n3. **Performance Comparison Across Models**: Models like Vicuna-13B-PT and Llama2-13B-PT show better performance when using logical constraints, especially on the MAVEN-ERE dataset. The best results are achieved with CoT and logical constraints configuration.\n\nIn summary, the integration of logical constraints is beneficial for improving the logical consistency and overall performance of different models on MAVEN-ERE and Causal-TimeBank datasets. Additionally, demonstration samples positively influence model performance but yield diminishing returns as the number of samples increases."}

You can observe that the model with post-processing generally achieves the lowest logical inconsistency (LI) in most cases for both datasets.\n\nFor example, for Vicuna-13B-PT on MAVEN-ERE, two conditions yield an LI of 0%: 1) under the post-processing method, and 2) with all logical constraints. However, the Micro-F1 (%) score is higher for the logical constraints condition (18.0%). Similarly, on Causal-TimeBank, the best Micro-F1 score is obtained with all logical constraints, while the lowest LI is obtained with post-processing (12.1%).\n\nLooking at the performance of Llama2-13B-PT on both datasets, the highest Micro-F1 scores can be found in the CoT with logical constraints condition. However, the lowest LI is again obtained with the post-processing method on both MAVEN-ERE (0%) and Causal-TimeBank (0%).\n\nNow, let's consider Image 1, which provides a comparison of model performance on MAVEN-ERE and Causal-TimeBank datasets. You can observe that, across all models (Turbo, Davinci, GPT-4, Vicuna, and Llama2), the models that employ logical constraints show improved performance and lower logical inconsistency (LI) compared to those without logical constraints.\n\nLastly, Image 5 demonstrates an ablation study for ChatGPT, emphasizing the impact of logical constraints on the performance and consistency of LLMs during iterative retrieval. The left graph shows the performance (Micro-F1 score) of MAVEN-ERE and Causal-TimeBank with and without logical constraints as the number of demonstration samples increases. As the number of demonstration samples increases, performance improves, but the impact of logical constraints becomes more apparent as the samples increase. The right graph shows how the logical inconsistency (LI) changes over multiple iterations for MAVEN-ERE and Causal-TimeBank datasets. You can observe that the logical inconsistency decreases as the number of iterations increases, especially in the case of MAVEN-ERE.\n\nIn conclusion, the results presented in the images and text demonstrate that both logical constraints and post-processing can help reduce logical inconsistency in LLMs across different tasks and datasets. However, post-processing generally tends to result in lower logical inconsistency, while logical constraints may lead to improved performance in some cases, especially when more demonstration samples are available.\n\n![Comparing the effectiveness of logical constraints and post-processing on LLMs for different datasets and conditions.

Metrics for this aspect consist of Accuracy [10], BLEU [10, 165], and ROUGE/ROUGE-L [10, 165].\n\n3. **Answer Relevance**: This aspect checks if the generated response is contextually relevant to the user's question. Metrics to evaluate this aspect are Accuracy [10], EM [10], and R-Rate [18] (a metric from RECALL framework).\n\n4. **Noise Robustness**: This aspect assesses the system's ability to handle noise or contradictory information in the retrieved content. Metrics for this aspect are Accuracy [2], Recall [2], and Precision [2].\n\n5. **Negative Rejection**: This aspect evaluates the system's ability to reject irrelevant or harmful information. Metrics for this aspect include Accuracy [2] and EM [2].\n\n6. **Information Integration**: This aspect examines the system's ability to integrate multiple pieces of information to provide a coherent response. Metrics for this aspect are Accuracy [10], MRR [10], and ROUGE/ROUGE-L [10, 105].\n\n7. **Counterfactual Robustness**: This aspect evaluates the system's ability to generate correct responses despite misleading or contradictory information in the retrieved content. Metrics for this aspect are Accuracy [10] and ROUGE/ROUGE-L [10].\n\nIt's important to note that specific quantitative metrics can differ among evaluation frameworks like CRUD [167-169], RGB [10], RECALL [18], RAGAS [164], ARES [165], and TruLens [8].\n\n![Overview of evaluation aspects and metrics for RAG](image1)\n\nThe visualized table in image1 demonstrates how various evaluation metrics are relevant to different aspects, helping to demonstrate the nuances of the metrics and aspects used across frameworks."}

It emphasizes enhancing retrieval quality by using pre-retrieval and post-retrieval strategies. For instance, Advanced RAG refines its indexing techniques through the use of a sliding window approach, fine-grained segmentation, and the incorporation of metadata ([1]). This leads to more effective retrieval, addressing one of the main limitations of Naive RAG.\n\nNow, let's consider the Modular RAG:\n\n![Modular RAG improves upon the Naive & Advanced RAG by introducing specialized components to enhance retrieval capabilities and process adaptability.](image6)\n\nThe `image6` illustrates the Modular RAG architecture, which offers more extensive adaptability and versatility compared to earlier RAG paradigms.

Naive RAG (Left):\n   - The Naive RAG framework involves three main steps: indexing, retrieval, and generation.\n   - A user query is processed by indexing documents, then retrieving information, followed by a prompt to a frozen language model to generate output.\n\n2. Advanced RAG (Middle):\n   - The Advanced RAG builds on Naive RAG, adding optimization strategies in pre-retrieval and post-retrieval stages.\n   - These enhancements include query routing, rewriting, expansion, reranking, summarization, fusion, and more, to improve the overall performance.\n\n3. Modular RAG (Right):\n   - The Modular RAG framework enhances flexibility by adding various specific functional modules.\n   - It includes iterative and adaptive processes like routing, searching, retrieving, reading, predicting, rewriting, reranking, demonstrating, and fusion. This allows for non-sequential methods such as iterative retrieval and adaptive approaches.\n\nNow, let's tie these differences to query processing and document retrieval:\n\n- Naive RAG process documents and queries in a straightforward manner without any additional pre- or post-processing, while primarily relying on the language model's capabilities for generating output.\n\n- Advanced RAG approaches document retrieval and query processing by optimizing the steps preceding and following the generation phase with techniques such as query expansion, reranking, and reranking.\n\n- Modular RAG, on the other hand, introduces various specialized components, providing innovative strategies for improving query processing and document retrieval. For example, the Modular RAG strategy employs the Search module for similarity searches, refines the retriever through fine-tuning, utilizes restructured RAG modules, and embraces adaptive and non-sequential approaches.\n\nIn summary, the key difference between the Naive, Advanced, and Modular RAG frameworks lies in the diversity and adaptability of their strategies for handling document retrieval and query processing, with the Modular RAG framework offering greater flexibility to non-sequential methods and adaptive approaches.\n\n![These three frameworks depict varying approaches for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) frameworks, with Modular RAG offering a more flexible and adaptable approach compared to Naive and Advanced RAG.](image1)"}

You can observe that RAPTOR's tree-based retrieval allows it to select nodes from various layers matching the question's detail level, often providing more relevant and comprehensive information for downstream tasks than DPR [7].\n\nAccording to the controlled comparison on the QASPER dataset, as shown in Table 3, RAPTOR consistently outperforms DPR and tree traversal across all three language models: GPT-3, GPT-4, and UnifiedQA [2, 9]. The performance benefits are reflected in F-1 Match scores, which are higher for RAPTOR compared to DPR and tree traversal. This is considered unsurprising because RAPTOR's higher-level summary nodes are capable of synthesizing information across various sections of the retrieval corpora, allowing it to outperform methods that can only extract the top-k most similar raw chunks of text, which may not contain the correct response in isolation [2].\n\nRegarding the collapsed tree retrieval approach's performance on the QASPER dataset, the collapsed tree (green line) performs better than tree traversal (blue line) in terms of F1 score when evaluated over different context lengths, as shown in image3 [10]. The best results are obtained when the context length is approximately 2000 tokens, which equates to retrieving the top-20 nodes [3]. In this case, the collapsed tree retrieval method emerges as the preferred approach for the QASPER dataset, owing to its flexibility that enables it to retrieve information at the correct level of granularity for a given question [10].\n\nAlthough the question specifically asks for performance evaluation on the QASPER dataset, it's essential to also consider other metrics and datasets when comparing the methods. For instance, between the collapsed tree and tree traversal, when tested against DPR, the collapsed tree method also performs better on the Narrative QA dataset, compared to the tree traversal method [4].\n\nIn conclusion, when comparing RAPTOR's collapsed tree retrieval method, tree traversal, and RAPTOR with DPR on the QASPER dataset, the collapsed tree retrieval method generally outperforms the other methods.

SnapNTell performs significantly better than other methods on the SnapNTell dataset, showing an 8.88% win rate against the manually annotated ground truth.\n\nThirdly, as noted in ([1]) and [4], Kendall's τ, a measure of the correspondence between two rankings, reveals that both ROUGE and BLEURT scores are more indicative in distinguishing the differences among various models, aligning closely with human judgment. Additionally, Table 4 (not provided) indicates that these two metrics are particularly significant in evaluating model performance.

For instance, in document classification using the MAG dataset ([5]), SPECTER achieved an F1 score of 86.4, surpassing the best baseline by approximately 2.3 points (±1.5 points). In citation prediction, SPECTER exceeds virtually all other baselines, with nDCG scores notably better than Citeomatic, as shown in image4 ( compare the 'CITE' row for SPECTER and Citeomatic).\n\nIn terms of topic clustering visualization, image2 shows a comparison of SPECTER and SciBERT's clustering patterns for different academic disciplines. The plots depict how each model groups documents based on their semantic similarities. Visual comparison indicates that SPECTER’s clustering seems to be more compact, with more distinct academic discipline groupings. Quantitatively, using DBScan clustering algorithm, SPECTER demonstrates an improvement over SciBERT in homogeneity and completeness values ([6]). Thus, SPECTER shows a better ability to separate topics using the projected embeddings.\n\nIn summary, based on the provided evidence, SPECTER performs better in document classification and citation prediction tasks compared to other models, with a visual advantage in topic clustering compared to SciBERT.\n\n`![SPECTER demonstrates better performance in document classification and citation prediction tasks and also shows a better ability to separate topics in topic clustering visualizations compared to SciBERT.](image2)`"}

SPECTER, our model, excels in multiple aspects, especially in classification tasks and citation prediction. For instance, in document classification, SPECTER achieves an F1 score of 84.2, which is the highest among the compared models. Similarly, in citation prediction tasks like Cite and Co-Cite, SPECTER outperforms most models, with MAP scores of 83.8 and 94.8, respectively.\n\nAnd what about the effects of including additional metadata such as venue and author? A study on ablation indicates that the addition of authors as input actually hurts performance, while the addition of venues slightly decreases it, except on document classification [text quote 3]. This suggests that while venue information might have some correlation with paper topics, author names might not be as effective in inferring document-level relatedness due to their sparsity in the corpus or suboptimal tokenization.\n\nLastly, here's a brief overview of the SPECTER model [image2]. It utilizes a Transformer model initialized with SciBERT, a BERT-based model pre-trained on scientific text data. The model takes a query paper, a related paper, and an unrelated paper as inputs, and computes a triplet loss to learn the embeddings.\n\nIn conclusion, SPECTER demonstrates superior performance across various tasks compared to other models, but the inclusion of additional metadata such as author and venue has mixed effects, with author having a slight negative impact and venue a slight positive impact, except on document classification.\n\n![Comparative performance of SPECTER and other models](image4)"}

For example, in CLS, USR, CITE, REC, and All, the SciBERT models have lower scores than SPECTER. This indicates that SPECTER's embeddings, which are based on a Transformer language model pretrained on citations, might be more effective for academic-related tasks than SciBERT fine-tuned on various end tasks.\n\nAn interesting insight can be drawn from visualizing the embeddings of SPECTER and SciBERT, as shown in image2. The clustering patterns for both models indicate that they group documents based on their semantic similarities. However, the position and clustering of the colored points in the SPECTER plot give insight into its ability to distinguish between different academic disciplines.

The baseline models, BERT and XLNet, achieved MRPC F1 scores of 88.0 and 89.2, respectively, and QQP F1 scores of 91.3 and 91.8, respectively (image5).\n\nAs we introduced enhancements like FL, DL, and DSC, the models' performance varied across datasets:\n\n- For BERT, adding the FL enhancement led to minor improvements in both MRPC and QQP datasets. The DL enhancement offered further performance gains over the FL version ([9]). However, the DSC enhancement produced the most substantial improvements, demonstrating the highest F1 scores in both MRPC and QQP datasets, as compared to the baseline models ([5], image5).\n\n- The performance of XLNet followed a similar trend, with the addition of FL, DL, and DSC enhancements yielding increasing F1 scores in both MRPC and QQP datasets. Similarly, the DSC variation led to the highest F1 scores for both datasets, once again showcasing the most significant improvements compared to the baseline models ([9], image5).\n\nRegarding the Sentiment Analysis tasks - SST-2 and SST-5 (image1), the performance of BERT+CE (Celossal Embedding) was the highest among the models listed for both SST-2 and SST-5 datasets. Interestingly, the Dice loss (DSC) improvement was not pronounced in this task compared to its performance on paraphrase identification tasks.\n\nIn question answering tasks across SQuAD v1.1, SQuAD v2.0, and QuoRef datasets (image4), both BERT and XLNet models exhibited strong performance. However, enhancing their respective models with FL, DL, and DSC yielded incremental gains in EM and F1 scores in all datasets. BERT+DSC showed the highest scores among BERT variations, while XLNet+DSC performed the best overall.\n\nOverall, drawing insights from these comparisons, it's evident that the DSC enhancement delivers the most substantial improvements in F1 scores, particularly in paraphrase identification tasks.

Removing negative examples leads to a further drop in performance, as demonstrated in the -negative row. Interestingly, incorporating both positive and negative examples results in the highest performance among all the configurations.\n\nNow, let's look at the effect of data augmentation techniques across various sentiment analysis and named entity recognition (NER) tasks by exploring Table 8 [6]. The table presents the results for BERT models fine-tuned with different objectives, including cross-entropy (CE), Dynamic Loss (DL), and Dynamic Softmax Cross-Entropy (DSC) on a SST-2 and SST-5 sentiment analysis dataset.

To address this issue more effectively, strategies such as dynamic weight adjusting strategies [8] are proposed that help deemphasize over-confident examples and focus on hard-negative examples during training.\n\nTo corroborate this, Table 3 [10] presents the experimental results on Chinese datasets where the proposed DSC loss outperforms the best baseline results by a large margin, providing SOTA performances on three datasets. Focal loss and the traditional dice loss show inconsistent performance across these datasets, confirming that neither approach is universally robust for resolving the data imbalance issue.\n\nIn conclusion, data augmentation techniques have varying impacts on the performance of BERT models, and their effectiveness greatly depends on the specific task and the dataset's characteristics, particularly its level of imbalance. Utilizing more advanced strategies, such as dynamic weight adjusting, can help overcome the limitations of traditional data augmentation tactics and achieve better overall performance."}

By analyzing textual quotes [1], [3], [4], [5], and image quotes [image3] and [image5], we can deduce the following:\n\nFirstly, we observe that the DS-Picklist model surpasses both DS-DST and DS-Span in terms of joint accuracy. For instance, as shown in image4, DS-Picklist achieves a joint accuracy of 53.30%, which is significantly higher than DS-DST's 51.21% and DS-Span's unspecified joint accuracy.\n\nRegarding slot accuracy, DS-Picklist again takes the lead, achieving an average accuracy of 97.40%, as indicated in image5. Although DS-DST and DS-Span perform well in slot accuracy, DS-Picklist improves upon them with a higher average accuracy. It is worth noting that certain slot types, such as `hotel-type`, `attraction-type`, and `hotel-parking`, show noticeable differences in accuracy between DS-Picklist and the other models ([4]). These slots usually have different expressions and cannot be extracted from the dialog context, which decreases the performance of span-based methods like DS-Span. However, DS-Picklist can predict directly from the candidate-value lists, leading to better performance for these slot types.\n\nIn conclusion, the DS-Picklist model consistently outperforms DS-DST and DS-Span in terms of joint accuracy and slot accuracy across various slot types. This superiority comes from the strong interactions between slots and dialog context, as stated in quote [2].\n\n![A model that selects directly from candidate-value lists leads to improved performance on slot types with different expressions.][image3][image5]"}

Additionally, stacking architectures like ELMo proved effective in achieving new state-of-the-art performance levels for named entity recognition and parsing tasks, according to [6]."}

When comparing the CNN Large model and BERT_LARGE, we find that BERT_LARGE generally exhibits better performance across most tasks. To be more specific, on the CoLA task, BERT_LARGE achieves a Matthews correlation coefficient of around 60.5 compared to CNN Large's 51.1. On the MRPC task, BERT_LARGE achieves an F1 score of 88.3 compared to CNN Large's 83.2. It's important to note that performance differences may vary from task to task, but overall, BERT_LARGE generally yields more impressive results.\n\nImage1 illustrates the relationship between the amount of Common Crawl data used for pretraining and the average GLUE score achieved. As the amount of pretraining data (measured in tokens) increases, the average GLUE score also increases, indicating a positive correlation between the amount of pretraining data and performance on the GLUE benchmark. This relationship suggests that increasing training data size could lead to better average GLUE scores, and consequently, improved performance on several NLP tasks.\n\nIn the context of the CNN Large and BERT_LARGE models, both are pretrained using large amounts of Common Crawl data, but BERT_LARGE is pretrained on a larger dataset. The results presented in image3, and the relationship shown in image1, support the idea that bigger training data sizes lead to better performance.\n\nIn summary, BERT_LARGE performs better than CNN Large across most NLP tasks, and the increasing size of the training data can lead to higher average GLUE scores, which translate into better performance on several NLP tasks.\n\n![Comparing performance of CNN Large and BERT_LARGE across NLP tasks](image3).\n![The relationship between pretraining data size and average GLUE score](image1)."}

It mentions that more training data continues to improve performance, [10] the figure suggests the same, showing that more training data can significantly increase accuracy when the same hyper-parameters settings are used on Common Crawl data using the CNN base architecture for 600K updates.\n\nImage quote 1 presents a table with performance metrics of language models trained on different datasets and with varying amounts of training data. The datasets used are labeled as \"ccrawl,\" \"news crawl,\" \"BWiki - sent,\" and \"BWiki - blck.\" For each dataset and size, several evaluation metrics are listed, including GLUE tasks, such as SST-2, MRPC, STS-B, QQP, MNLI-m, QNLI, and RTE. Different models have been trained on increasing amounts of data, with better performance observed as the training data amount increases.\n\nIn summary, both text and image quotes indicate that a larger amount of training data generally boosts the GLUE score across different datasets. The analysis suggests that more data typically leads to better performance, and models seem to benefit specifically from training on larger Common Crawl data [10]. The table in image quote 1 also demonstrates that different datasets have varying degrees of effectiveness for specific tasks. For instance, News Crawl performs less well than Common Crawl on MRPC even though it contains newswire data [4]. Also, more News Crawl data is most beneficial for CoLA and STS-B [4].

In [4], the authors propose a method to learn orthogonal transformations that convert the word embeddings of multiple languages to a single space, which aligns the embedding spaces. They observe that the BLEU scores of ES, FR, and IT generally follow this hypothesis, but see larger accuracy gains when moving to very different languages, such as RU and HE, as indicated in [5].\n\nNow, let's consider the image quotes. Image 3 shows a comparison of unaligned and aligned embeddings for various language pairs, including Portuguese (PT). Unfortunately, the image doesn't provide a clear answer as to whether alignment always improves BLEU scores or not. However, we can observe that in the case of PT → EN, the unaligned score is slightly better than the aligned score (-0.2 difference).\n\nImage 4 illustrates the relationship between training set size and BLEU scores, as well as the improvement gained by using pre-trained models. The graphs suggest that the gain from pre-training is more significant at smaller training set sizes and decreases as the training set size increases, but they do not explicitly show the impact of alignment.\n\nLastly, image 5 provides a table related to translation datasets from various source languages to Portuguese, categorized by language family. Although the table doesn't directly discuss the impact of alignment, it demonstrates improvements in the BLEU scores when using pre-trained embeddings, with HE → PT showing the most significant improvement (+8.9). As discussed earlier, aligning the word embeddings helps to increase the BLEU scores in the case of more different languages, such as HE and RU.\n\nIn conclusion, while the provided evidence suggests that alignment of word embeddings can potentially help improve BLEU scores, especially for more different languages, there might not always be a clear benefit. In some specific language pairs, like PT → EN, unaligned embeddings may even outperform the aligned ones in terms of BLEU scores."}

The table in image1 presents datasets from different source languages to Portuguese (PT), categorized by language family. The gains vary across language pairs, with some like Spanish (ES) and French (FR) seeing gains of +7.0 and +5.7, respectively, whereas others like Hebrew (HE) see an improvement of +8.9. This suggests that pre-training affects translation accuracy differently across language pairs, with the extent of improvement influenced by the similarity between the source and target languages.\n\nSecondly, we have evidence that training set size also plays a role in the effectiveness of pre-training ([8], [9]). The graphs in image5 show that using pre-training techniques can result in higher BLEU scores, especially when the training data is limited. As training set size increases, the gain from pre-training tends to decrease. This implies that there is a sweet-spot where word embeddings are most effective, where there is very little training data but not so little that the system cannot be trained at all ([4]).\n\nLastly, the research shows that the gain from pre-training of embeddings may be larger when the source and target languages are more similar ([10]). For instance, the translations from `GL` to `EN` (Galician to English) show one of the largest increases in quantitative numbers ([7]), indicating that pre-training not only helps the model to capture rarer vocabulary but also generates sentences that are more grammat-ically well-formed. This is intuitive, as semantic distinctions or polysemy will likely manifest themselves in more similar ways across more similar languages.\n\nTo sum up, pre-training affects translation accuracy across different language pairs, and both training set size and language similarity play a role in this effect. Pre-training can result in higher BLEU scores, especially when the training data is limited, and the extent of improvement is influenced by the similarity between the source and target languages."}
{"q_id": 425, "model": "Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3_llm", "in_tok": 2960, "out_tok": 666, "total_tok": 3626, "response": " To address the question, we will interleave the relevant text and image quotes, discussing aligning word embeddings and their impact on translation performance as well as the observed differences in F-measure scores for target words based on their frequency.\n\nFirst, let's examine the purpose of word embeddings alignment, as highlighted in quote [3]:\n\n>Until now, we have been using embeddings that have been trained independently in the source and target languages, and as a result there will not necessarily be a direct correspondence between the embedding spaces in both languages. However, we can postulate that having consistent embedding spaces across the two languages may be beneficial, as it would allow the NMT system to more easily learn correspondences between the source and target.\n\n[image1](image3) demonstrates an observation showing that alignment makes a noticeable improvement over the base or standard metric (bi) for all test cases, with the highest improvement seen in the GL + PT language pair (22.4 compared to 17.5). This indicates that alignment of embedding spaces indeed benefits the translation performance across various languages.\n\nSince alignment of word embeddings aims to put the word embeddings of the two source languages in similar vector spaces, as detailed in quote [7], pre-trained and aligned embeddings may perform better when the source and target languages are similar. This claim is corroborated by the results in [image5], which shows that the gains in each translation pair are roughly in order of their similarity. The GL / PT pair showing the largest gains, reinforcing the benefits of aligning embeddings for more similar languages.\n\nMoving on to the second part of the question, we can observe the effect of pre-training on F-measure scores for target words based on their frequency in the training corpus. According to quote [8], pre-training manages to improve the accuracy of translation for the entire vocabulary, but particularly for words that are of low frequency in the training corpus.\n\nThis trend is confirmed by [image2], which compares \"std\" (without pre-training) and \"pre\" (with pre-training) F-measures for different frequency ranges. As shown, pre-training often outperforms \"std\" in higher frequency ranges. However, it significantly helps with words that are less frequent in the training corpus, making it particularly useful for low-resource languages.\n\nIn conclusion, aligning word embeddings affects translation performance positively and benefits the NMT system by allowing it to learn correspondences between the source and target languages more easily. Moreover, pre-training is found particularly helpful for low-resource scenarios, where it improves the accuracy of translation for the entire vocabulary, but particularly for words that are of low frequency in the training corpus.\n\n![The alignment of word embeddings improves translation performance across various languages and is particularly effective for low-resource scenarios, particularly benefiting low-frequency words.](image3) ![F-measure scores for target words based on their frequency in the training corpus show that pre-training outperforms the baseline, especially in higher frequency ranges and low-resource scenarios.](image2)"}

However, if we remove R-GCN (GloVe w/o R-GCN), the performance drops by 8.0 points, highlighting the impact of R-GCN on model performance. [image2](![Performance Comparison of Different Models](image2.png))\n\n2. **Relation types**: In quote [9], removing all relation types (No relation types) shows only marginal improvements with respect to ELMo alone (No R-GCN), suggesting that a GCN operating over a naive entity graph would not add much to this task.\n\nNext, let's examine the impact of removing specific types of relations:\n\n1. **DOC-BASED**: Quote [1] suggests that models make better use of DOC-BASED connections than MATCH or COREF connections. Without connecting mentions within the same document (DOC-BASED), we remove important information since the model is unaware they appear closely in the document.\n\n2. **MATCH**: Quote [1] also implies that coreference links and complement edges seem to play a more marginal role, as removing MATCH connections only causes a minimal impact on performance.\n\n3. **COREF**: Quote [1] shows that our Entity-GCN seems to gain little advantage using the coreference system, and removing it might even lead to performance degradation on the test set (surprisingly).\n\n4. **COMPLEMENT**: Quote [5] indicates that when edges are not predetermined but predicted, performance drops below 'No R-GCN,' suggesting that the model cannot learn these dependencies on its own.\n\nIn summary, the removal of R-GCN, relation types, and specific relation types like MATCH and COREF leads to performance decreases under both unmasked and masked conditions. Some relations, like DOC-BASED, seem to have more significant effects on the model's performance.

It is not surprising as coreferred mentions are labeled with the same identifier in the masked version, even if their original surface forms did not match (Welbl et al. (2018) used WIKIPEDIA links for masking). Indeed, in the masked version, an entity is always referred to via the same unique surface form (e.g., MASK1) within and across documents. In the unmasked setting, on the other hand, mentions to an entity may differ (e.g., \"US\" vs \"United States\") and they might not be retrieved by the coreference system we are employing, making the unmasked setting harder.\n\nWhile text quote [9] highlights the impact of the R-GCN component:\n\n> The first important observation is that replacing ELMo by GloVe (GloVe with R-GCN in Table 3) still yields a competitive system that ranks far above baselines from (Welbl et al. , 2018) and even above the Coref-GRU of Dhingra et al. (2018), in terms of accuracy on (unmasked) validation set. The second important observation is that if we then remove R-GCN (GloVe w/o R-GCN in Ta- ble 3), we lose 8.0 points. That is, the R-GCN component pushes the model to perform above Coref-GRU still without accessing context, but rather by updating mention representations based on their relation to other ones.\n\nNow, let's interweave this context with the relevant image. `image2` shows a table comparing different models or configurations, including those with and without R-GCN. Specifically, rows 9 and 10 in this table corresponds to our text quotes, `GloVe with R-GCN` and `GloVe w/o R-GCN`. From this visual evidence, we can observe that the R-GCN component significantly improves performance in the unmasked setting (loss of 8.0 points as mentioned in the text quote [9]).\n\nIn conclusion, the inclusion of coreference information positively impacts the performance of Entity-GCN models, particularly in the unmasked setting, as context clues provided by coreference links help the model better assign mentions to entities. The performance drop in the version without coreference (GloVe w/o R-GCN) demonstrates this impact.\n\n![Comparison of models with and without R-GCN (GloVe with R-GCN vs GloVe w/o R-GCN) impact on the unmasked accuracy.](image2)"}

The DyGIE system exhibits the highest Entity F1 score across all datasets, indicating its superiority in extracting entities compared to other systems.\n\nRegarding the impact of coreference and relation propagation on the entity extraction task, **[image4]** reveals that DyGIE achieves the highest F1 score for entities. However, when we ablate the coreference propagation layer, the performance slightly improves on entities (DyGIE without CorefProp). This suggests that coreference propagation might be beneficial but has a minor impact on the overall performance of entity extraction.\n\nAs for the relation extraction task, **[image3]** shows that DyGIE without CorefProp achieves the highest F1 score. This implies that neglecting coreference propagation can lead to better results in the relation extraction task, with an F1 score of 60.2 when compared to 58.4 for DyGIE.\n\nIn contrast, when it comes to the relationship between the number of entities in a sentence and the performance of relation extraction systems, **[image1]** shows that the DyGIE system generally outperforms \"DyGIE-RelProp\" (which includes relation propagation) as the number of entities increases.

For ACE04-O, DyGIE achieved an F1 score of 84.7 compared to 75.1 by Wang and Lu (2018), and 72.7 by Katiyar and Cardie (2018).

Even for the GENIA dataset, DyGIE obtained the highest F1 score of 76.2.\n\nNow, let's discuss how coreference (CorefProp) and relation (RelProp) propagation components impact the performance across configurations.\n\n[2] According to [2], DyGIE went beyond the state of the art for ACE04-O and ACE05-O by $11.6\\%$ and $11.3\\%$, respectively. However, the addition of the coreference propagation layer was beneficial for overlapping entity recognition but less effective for relation extraction, as stated in [9].\n\n![Performance of Entity and Relation Extraction with CorefProp and RelProp](image2)\n\nIn image2, we can observe the impact of CorefProp and RelProp processes on entity and relation extraction tasks across several iterations. For both entities and relations, the highest F1 scores are achieved at two iterations. However, coreference propagation appears to have a more noticeable effect on entity extraction, while relation propagation shows a more significant benefit in both entities and relations tasks.\n\nNow, let's examine the performance of DyGIE, DyGIE without coreference propagation (−CorefProp) and DyGIE without relation propagation (−RelProp) regarding entity and relation extraction on different datasets, as presented in [4] and [8]:\n\n**Entity Task:**\n\n- DyGIE: F1 = 68.2\n- DyGIE without CorefProp (−CorefProp): F1 = 68.0\n- DyGIE without RelProp (−RelProp): F1 = 67.5\n- Base: F1 = 68.1\n\n**Relation Task:**\n\n- DyGIE: F1 = 42.0\n- DyGIE without CorefProp (−CorefProp): F1 = 41.2\n- DyGIE without RelProp (−RelProp): F1 = 40.4\n- Base: F1 = 39.5\n\nAlthough the base model has slightly better F1 scores in the relation extraction task, DyGIE still performs better overall and achieves the highest F1 scores in the entity extraction task (bold numbers in [4] and [8]). The coreference propagation layer helps in entity extraction, but it seems to be less effective for relation extraction, as mentioned in [9].\n\nIn conclusion, DyGIE outperforms other methods in entity recognition across various datasets and achieved state-of-the-art results on relation extraction tasks as well. The coreference propagation layer contributes to the superior performance on entity recognition, while the relation propagation layer has a more significant effect on both entity and relation extraction tasks.

[4] (Figure 3b) reveals a similar trend for relation propagation in the relation extraction task: the highest F1 score is achieved at the second iteration ($M=2$).\n\nSo we can conclude that for CorefProp and RelProp, the number of iterations significantly impacts both entity and relation extraction F1 scores, with the second iteration generally yielding the best results.\n\nNow, let's move to the impact of the number of entities in a sentence on relation F1 score, as depicted in image4. Although both systems, DyGIE and DyGIE-RelProp, showed decreasing performance with an increase in the number of entities, DyGIE generally outperformed DyGIE-RelProp throughout the categories.

The figures shown [(Figure 3a and 3b)](image5) indicate that both CorefProp and RelProp achieve their best F1 scores at the second iteration ($N=2$ and $M=2$).\n\nMoving on to the image quotes, [image1] provides a comparison of various systems on different datasets. Interestingly, the DyGIE system exhibits the highest Entity F1 score across all datasets, showcasing its overall effectiveness in entity extraction. However, the provided information about the systems doesn't contain any breakdown based on the number of entities in a sentence. Nonetheless, the textual evidence [3] suggests that there are a large number of sentences with multiple relation instances across different entities in both ACE05 and Sci-ERC, making DyGIE an ideal choice for scenarios with more entities.\n\nFor a more detailed visualization of how both CorefProp and RelProp affect the F1 scores for varying numbers of entities in a sentence, let's refer to the graphs from [image3]. Key observations from the graph include:\n\n- For sentences with 2 entities, both systems perform similarly with high F1 scores.\n- As the number of entities in the sentence increases, the performance of both systems decreases.\n- \"DyGIE\" (represented by a blue line with circle markers) generally outperforms \"DyGIE-RelProp\" (represented by a red line with square markers) across all categories.\n- Despite the decrease in performance with more entities, the addition of \"relation propagation\" (in \"DyGIE-RelProp\") attempts to address this decline, although not as effectively as \"DyGIE\" without relation propagation.\n\nIn summary, the iterations of both CorefProp and RelProp have significant positive effects on F1 scores for entity and relation extraction tasks.

SWEM outperforms CNN on most datasets in cases of text classification, sentence-classification, and topic prediction tasks.\n2. CNN is relatively less parameter-efficient, requiring more computation on larger subspace dimensions. However, when the subspace size is large on CNN, it can achieve higher accuracy on some datasets like Yelp P.\n3.

It is stated that our work is the first attempt to incorporate knowledge from document-level corpus for training aspect-level sentiment classifiers [1]. The proposed approaches leverage pretraining and multi-task learning for transferring knowledge from document-level to aspect-level training [4][8].\n\nThe effects of these approaches are demonstrated using various models to evaluate their performance on four datasets, D1, D2, D3, and D4, in terms of accuracy and macro-F1 scores [6]. The image provided here (image2) shows the performance across different model settings, where the first row represents the LSTM only model, and subsequent rows depict the performance of models with varying components, including embeddings, output layer, LSTM, or none of these components [2].\n\nWhen observing the trends across different datasets, it's noticed that including components like LSTM and embedding layers performs better than models without them [7]. However, it's noteworthy that transferring the embedding layer is particularly helpful on datasets D3 and D4, which have a small number of neutral entries and an unbalanced label distribution [7].\n\nTo further understand the effect of varying the percentage of document-level training examples, the authors of this work used a method called \"PRET + MULT\" and plotted the accuracy and macro-F1 scores against the percentage of document examples in the training set (image3). The graphs indicate that the accuracy and macro-F1 scores on all four datasets tend to improve as the percentage of document-level training examples increases [5].\n\nTherefore, in conclusion, the inclusion of components like LSTM, embedding, and document-level knowledge in the model positively affects its performance across different datasets. Also, the performance improves when increasing the number of document-level training examples, as shown in image3."}

On the restaurant subset, TRADE's joint performance [$65.35\\%$](image1#joint-multiwoz-only-restaurant), significantly surpasses other models, including MDBT, GLAD, GCE, and SpanPtr (for more details, refer to [Table 2](image1)).\n\nNext, let's discuss the domain adaptation scenarios utilizing different fine-tuning strategies. In fine-tuning the TRADE model with GEM, the performance on the original four domains remains high while slightly decreasing. For instance, the performance drop on the hotel domain from [$58.98\\%$]([1]) to [$53.54$]([9]) on joint accuracy is only [$-5.44\\%$]([9]). Meanwhile, naive fine-tuning significantly deteriorates the tracking ability, dropping joint goal accuracy to [$36.08\\%$]([9]) on the hotel domain, which is a [$-22.9\\%$]([9]) decrease compared to the original performance. [Figure 5(a) and (b)](image2) demonstrate the effectiveness of knowledge transferring from other domains seen during training to track slots in hotel and restaurant domains during zero-shot scenarios.\n\n[Table 3](image3) illustrates the evaluation results on four domains and fine-tuning on a new domain. The TRADE model achieves better performance than training from scratch on the new domain when fine-tuning using the GEM method. For example, after fine-tuning with only [$1\\%$]([8]) of Train domain data, TRADE achieves [$59.83\\%$]([8]) joint accuracy, outperforming the performance of training from scratch, which achieves [$44.24\\%$]([8]) using the same amount of new-domain data.

Moreover, it exhibits effective domain adaptation capabilities when fine-tuning using the GEM strategy, maintaining high performance on the original domains while improving performance on new domains.\n\n![The TRADE model performs better on MultiWOZ and its restaurant subset compared to other models, and it effectively adapts to new domains using GEM fine-tuning.](image1)"}

[1] demonstrates that fine-tuning TRADE with GEM outperforms naive fine-tuning in the attraction domain, achieving a joint accuracy of $34.73\\%$. EWC also shows an improvement, but not as significant as GEM. This implies that strategies like GEM and EWC can help in adapting the model to new domain data compared to a naive approach. [5] echoes this finding, stating that fine-tuning TRADE with GEM maintains higher performance on the original four domains after finetuning, even when dropping in joint accuracy to 53.54% on the hotel domain (-5.44%) compared to naive fine-tuning, which deteriorates in joint accuracy significantly (-22.9%).\n\n[6] provides further evidence, stating that pre-training followed by fine-tuning outperforms training from scratch on the single domain. In particular, GEM outperforms naive and EWC fine-tuning in terms of catastrophic forgetting, as seen in Table 3. [9] corroborates these results, showing that GEM outperforms Naive and EWC fine-tuning in terms of catastrophic forgetting on the four domains after finetuning on 1% new domain data.\n\nNow, let's discuss the impact of slot similarities on performance. [4] mentions several models, such as Lei et al. (2018) and Xu and Hu (2018), that require a predefined domain ontology. These models were only evaluated on single-domain settings (DSTC2). This suggests that models may perform better when slot similarities exist between domains, as the learning process may be transferable.\n\nHowever, image4 suggests that certain slots, like \"restaurant-name\" and \"hotel-name,\" have higher error rates compared to others. This might indicate that slot similarities are not always beneficial, as certain slots may require unique training and adaptation strategies. Image5, on the other hand, shows that embeddings for similar slots, such as destination and departure or price range and stars, have high cosine similarity. This means that these pairs typically have related or shared attributes in the context of the dataset, which may aid in model performance.\n\nTo summarize, fine-tuning strategies like GEM and EWC comparatively perform better in adapting the model to new domain data compared to a naive approach. Additionally, slot similarities play a role in determining model performance, with similar embeddings likely aiding the learning process, but not always ensuring low error rates for certain slots.\n\n![Comparing Fine-tuning Strategies](image3)\n![Slot Similarities and Error Rates](image4)\n![Cosine Similarity Between Embeddings](image5)"}

According to the research presented, genders are generally translated more accurately when the role assignments adhere to stereotypes. This phenomenon is observed consistently across multiple systems, as demonstrated by the performance metrics provided in [1] and the visual representation in image3.\n\n On average, systems perform better when translating pro-stereotypical roles, such as a female nurse, compared to anti-stereotypical roles, like a male receptionist. Table 4 in [7] further illustrates this trend, showing the gender prediction accuracy of Google Translate when translating between Spanish, Russian, and Ukrainian, with stereotypical roles resulting in higher accuracy.\n\n Image1 presents data from three datasets (Winogender, WinoBias, and WinoMT) across three gender categories (Male, Female, and Neutral). It shows that all systems perform relatively equally in terms of accuracy for gender-neutral entities. However, there is a noticeable bias when it comes to translating male and female entities, particularly in the WinoBias dataset (3168 entries in total, see image1).\n\n It's essential to highlight that the effects of gender bias in translation vary across languages. For instance, German shows better overall translation accuracy compared to other languages in [8] (see also image2). However, even in German, the system still maintains a bias towards pro-stereotypical roles as demonstrated in image3.\n\n In summary, machine translation systems often struggle with gender bias and accuracy in translation, particularly when it comes to anti-stereotypical roles or non-stereotypical languages such as Arabic. Furthermore, it's important to note that the accuracy of translation for gender-neutral entities doesn't seem to be significantly affected by gender bias.\n\n ![Comparison of accuracy and gender bias across MT systems and languages](image3)\n ![Accuracy and error metrics for different translation services and languages](image2)\n ![Google Translate's gender translation accuracy comparison between stereotypical and non-stereotypical roles in various languages](image3)"}

This metric shows that all tested systems have a signiﬁcant and consistently better performance when presented with pro-stereotypical assignments (e.g., a female nurse), while their performance deteriorates when translating anti-stereotypical roles (e.g., a male receptionist).\n\nThis quote indicates that translations tend to have better accuracy (i.e., higher F1 score) when the gender roles are stereotypical instead of anti-stereotypical. Now, let's explore the visual evidence:\n\n![Google Translate's performance on gender translation (source: Figure 2)](image1)\n\nThis bar chart represents the accuracy of Google Translate in translating gender roles for different languages: Spanish (ES), French (FR), Italian (IT), Russian (RU), Ukrainian (UK), Hebrew (HE), Arabic (AR), and German (DE). The chart shows that translating stereotypical gender roles has a higher accuracy consistently across all tested languages compared to non-stereotypical gender roles.\n\nInterestingly, the authors of the study mention that they initially observed this stereotype-based bias in Google Translate. However, when they artificially introduced stereotypical adjectives such as \"handsome\" and \"pretty\" to the input text, they observed improvement in the translation performance on stereotypical roles in some languages, specifically reducing gender bias in Spanish, Russian, and Ukrainian as shown in Table 4 (provided in the text quote [8]):\n\n[6] Table 4: Performance of Google Translate on Spanish, Russian, and Ukranian gender prediction accuracy (  $\\%$  correct) on the original WinoMT corpus, versus a mod- iﬁed version of the dataset where we add stereotypical gender adjectives (see Section  3.3 ).\n\nIn summary, based on the text and image evidence, it can be concluded that applying stereotype-based adjustments, such as using stereotypical gender adjectives, in machine translation can impact gender bias accuracy positively by reducing gender bias across different languages, specifically in Spanish, Russian, and Ukrainian. Keep in mind this method is impractical as a general debiasing scheme, as it assumes oracle coreference resolution.\n\nHere's the conclusion in a more direct and concise sentence:\nApplying stereotype-based adjustments, such as using stereotypical gender adjectives, in machine translation can lead to a reduction of gender bias in translation on Spanish, Russian, and Ukrainian languages.\n\n![Reduction of gender bias in Spanish, Russian, and Ukranian translation through stereotype-based adjustments](image6) We are not actually presenting an image for this conclusion, but we would make an image showcasing a decrease in the gender bias for the mentioned languages in a visual manner if we have the ability to produce one."}

The maximum test performance of BERT dropped from 0.533 (Original dataset) to 0.518 (Adversarial dataset).\n\nNow, we'll delve into the relevant text quotes. The authors of the study mentioned [3] have created an Adversarial dataset to eliminate the major problem of statistical cues over labels in ARCT. They achieve this by adding a copy of each data point with the claim negated and the label inverted, thereby mirroring the distributions of cues around both labels. This, in turn, eliminates the signal. On this adversarial dataset, all models perform randomly, with BERT achieving a maximum test set accuracy of 53%.\n\nBased on the evidence from both text and image sources, it can be inferred that the Adversarial data setup significantly affects the performance of BERT models on the ARCT dataset. The results indicate that BERT's performance is not based on its ability to comprehend arguments but rather its exploitation of spurious statistical cues in the dataset. The Adversarial dataset provides a more robust evaluation of argument comprehension, as all models, including BERT, perform randomly on this dataset, resulting in essential random accuracy.\n\nIn conclusion, the Adversarial dataset will help in providing a more accurate and reliable evaluation of argument comprehension when used in future work on the ARCT dataset.

This is attributed to the iterative latent interactions in the BiDAF architecture, which are of increased importance for our task where information is distributed across documents.\n- [4] shows that TF-IDF, a baseline method, performs better than random for WIKIHOP but is not strong overall. However, it performs worse than random for MEDHOP due to the absence of co-mention of an interacting drug pair within any single document.\n- [5] demonstrates improvement in both BiDAF and FastQA models when presented with only the relevant documents in the gold chain, which supports the theory that these models are capable of identifying the answer when few or no plausible false candidates are mentioned.

On the other hand, FastQA shows relatively lower performance, with scores ranging from 35.8 to 38.0 for WIKIHOP and 23.1 to 30.6 for MEDHOP.\n\nIt is important to note that these scores presumably represent the accuracy of the models in answering the questions correctly. A higher score indicates better performance, which means BiDAF generally performs better than FastQA according to these results.\n\nHere's a simple summary of the comparison between the two models across the WIKIHOP and MEDHOP datasets under different test conditions:\n\n- BiDAF outperforms FastQA on both the WIKIHOP and MEDHOP datasets in terms of accuracy, with scores ranging from 44.6 to 59.8 for WIKIHOP and 33.7 to 42.9 for MEDHOP.\n\nNow let's see how BiDAF and FastQA perform in the \"gold chain\" setup, where only relevant documents are considered, which may provide additional insights about their performance in a scenario more closely resembling the ideal conditions for the models.\n\nTo investigate this, I'll refer to image3, which showcases the \"gold chain\" performance of the models for both datasets. I'll present only the results for the BiDAF and FastQA models for better clarity:\n\n- **WikiHop:**\n  - BiDAF: Test (57.9) and Test* (63.4)\n  - FastQA: Test (44.5) and Test* (53.5)\n\n- **MedHop:**\n  - BiDAF: Test (86.4) and Test* (89.8)\n  - FastQA: Test (54.6) and Test* (59.2)\n\nAgain, higher scores mean better performance.

For instance, for language pairs like fi-en (Finnish to English) and kk-en (Kazakh to English), YiSi-1_srl metric showed the highest correlation with DA human assessments (0.947 and 0.863, respectively).\n\nFurthermore, for language pairs not involving English, Table 5, [1], shows that the YiSi metrics achieve the highest correlations for several language pairs and is not significantly outperformed by any other metrics, as pointed out in [2]. For example, for the de-en (German to English) and en-de (English to German) pairs, YiSi-1_srl achieves a correlation of 0.947 and 0.936, respectively.\n\nImage3, [3], offers a visual representation of human evaluation results (using the ΔARR metric) for different language pairs involving English (en) being translated into other languages.

These metrics seem to achieve the highest correlations in several language pairs and often outperform other metrics.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the information, interleaved with relevant image quotes:\n\n[1] Note that the penalization of ties makes our evaluation asymmetric, dependent on whether the metric predicted `$<$` or `$>$` (See [image5]). It is now important to interpret the meaning of the comparison identically for humans and metrics. For error metrics, we thus reverse the sign of the metric score prior to the comparison with human scores: higher scores have to indicate better translation quality. In WMT19, the original authors did this for CharacTER (See [image2]).\n\n[2] In system-level evaluation, the series of YiSi metrics achieve the highest correlations in several language pairs and it is not significantly outperformed by any other metrics (denoted as a “win” in the following) for almost all language pairs (See [image5] and Table 4).\n\n[3] Metrics and QE systems such as BERTr, ESIM, YiSi that perform well at judging our best systems often use more semantic features compared to our n-gram/char-gram based baselines. Future metrics may want to explore a) whether semantic features such as contextual word embeddings are achieving semantic understanding and b) whether semantic understanding is the true source of a metric’s performance gains (See [3]).\n\n[5] The results confirm the observation from the last year, namely metrics based on word or sentence-level embeddings ( YiSi and ESIM ), achieve the highest performance (See [image1], Table 4, and Table 8).\n\nIn summary, it appears that YiSi, ESIM, and CHRF are consistently well-performing evaluation metrics across various language pairs, both when translating into and out of English. Furthermore, these metrics are likely utilizing semantic features to achieve better performance (See [3]).\n\nTo visualize the significance of these metrics, we can refer to [image3] and [image4]: The metrics compared include various evaluation metrics such as Yisi-1, chrF, BLEU, BERT, ESIM, and others, illustrating which metrics perform better in assessing translations between specific language pairs (See [image3]). [Image4] shows a series of heatmaps representing system-level metric significance test results for direct assessment (DA) human evaluation of machine translation metrics. Green cells indicate a statistically significant improvement in correlation with human assessment for the metric in the row over the metric in the column, determined using Williams' test, providing more insight into which metrics outperform others in a statistically significant way."}

This significant risk could have a considerable impact on the income statement, statement of comprehensive income, balance sheet, and cash flow statement for Novo Nordisk. To mitigate this risk, the company uses financial instruments, such as forward exchange contracts and currency options, to hedge forecast transactions, assets, and liabilities [9]. cash flow hedges were also implemented to manage the foreign exchange risk, which could have an impact on financial income or expenses within the next 12 months [6].\n\nWith respect to cash flow hedges for 2020, under a hypothetical 5% increase or decrease in certain currencies against EUR and DKK, the impact on \"Other comprehensive income\" would be slightly different, as outlined in ${image3}$. For instance, if there's a 5% increase in the specific currencies, \"Other comprehensive income\" would be negatively impacted by around 1,893 DKK million, while \"Income statement\" would see a positive impact of approximately 299 DKK million. Conversely, under a 5% decrease, the \"Other comprehensive income\" would be positively impacted by the same amount (1,893 million DKK), while the \"Income statement\" would experience a negative impact of the same amount (299 million DKK). Thus, Notwithstanding the fluctuations in exchange rates, the net impact on the comprehensive income is about 1,594 DKK million ([1,893] + [299] = 1,594 and [-1,893] + [-299] = 1,594).\n\n![Financial data in DKK million for the years 2020 and 2019](${image2}$) This table shows the financial data in DKK million for various categories (Exchange rate adjustments, Cash flow hedges, Tax and other items, and Total) over multiple years, including 2020.

This increase can be attributed to factors such as additional lease agreements, lease renewals, or extension of existing leases.

The program, as amended, allows Berkshire to repurchase its Class A and Class B shares if the repurchase price is below the intrinsic value, conservatively determined. In 2021, Berkshire paid $\\S27.1$ billion to repurchase shares of its Class A and B common stock [4].\n\nNow, let's delve into the net earnings across different segments. Note, these figures exclude earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests and are after deducting income taxes [1].\n\nFrom 2019 to 2021, the insurance underwriting sector generated after-tax earnings of $\\S325$ million, $\\S657$ million, and $\\S728$ million, respectively [2]. This increase in earnings could be attributed to improved productivity in 2021 and reduced losses for prior accident years under property and casualty contracts.

We can use the data from image1 to calculate total operating expenses in 2018, which are $\\$47$ million. By subtracting that from the net income of $\\$157$ million, we find that the estimated total revenues for 2018 are approximately $\\$211$ million (157 - 47).\n   - To estimate total revenues for the missing years, we'll continue to use the 5% increase assumption:\n      - In 2019, the estimated total revenues would be approximately $\\$218.41$ million ($\\$211$ million * 1.05).\n      - In 2020, the estimated total revenues would be approximately $\\$228.31$ million ($\\$218.41$ million * 1.05).\n\nNow, let's embed the relevant data from image1 and the calculated values for 2019 and 2020 into a cohesive interleaved text-image response:\n\n> To answer your question, let's first look at Amberjack's financial performance visualized in this table [`![Amberjack's financial performance over the years](image1)`]:\n>\n> - In 2018, Amberjack's total revenues, operating income, and net income were approximately $\\$$204$, $\\$$154$, and $\\$157$ million, respectively.\n> - Moving on to 2019, despite not having explicit data for all metrics, we can estimate that total revenues, operating income, and net income were approximately $\\$$218.41$, $\\$$162.7$, and $\\$170.57$ million, respectively, based on the 5% increase assumption.\n> - For 2020, the estimated total revenues, operating income, and net income are approximately $\\$$228.31$, $\\$$170.57$, and $\\$180.5 million, respectively, assuming the same trend.\n>\n> Please note that these estimated figures are based on the given assumptions and could differ from actual results.

This decrease in net discrete tax benefits led to an increase in the effective tax rate.\n\nRegarding overall compensation expenses, text quote [9] shows that compensation expenses increased by $11% from 2019 to 2020, reaching $20,854 million. Combined with the increase in the effective tax rate, it indicates that the overall compensation expenses have grown significantly from 2019 to 2020, with both factors contributing to the increase.\n\nTo summarize, the effective tax rate increased from 18.3% in 2019 to 22.5% in 2020, primarily due to a lower net discrete tax benefit in 2020 compared to 2019.

For card member receivables, there's no direct quote regarding the change in reserve for credit losses for 2021, but in text quote [4], we see that for 2020, there was a $\\S2.5$   billion reserve build in the prior year. Since no reserve build is mentioned in the 2021 quote, it can be inferred that the reserve for card member receivables decreased from 2020 to 2021.\n\nNow, let's compare these changes with the changes in network volumes and card member spending during the same period.\n\nIn image 4, we find that network volumes, total billed business, and consumer and commercial billed businesses show increases for 2021 but decreases for 2020. However, the changes in card member loans and receivables are not directly comparable with network volumes as they represent different financial aspects. Regarding card member spending, text quote [9] shows that total revenues net of interest expense increased 17 percent year-over-year in 2021, which implies an increase in card member spending.\n\nIn summary, while card member loans reserve for credit losses decreased and card member receivables reserve for credit losses possibly decreased from 2020 to 2021, the changes in network volumes and card member spending during the same period show a mixed picture, with network volumes and card member spending increasing in 2021 but decreasing in 2020.\n\nTo further illustrate the changes in card member loans and receivables, let's refer to text quote [1], which states that the card member loans reserve for credit losses increased for the year ended December 31, 2020, and text quote [7], which states that the card member loans reserve for credit losses decreased for the year ended December 31, 2021.\n\n![Card Member Loans Reserve Changes](image5)\n\nIn text quote [2], we see that card member receivables reserve for credit losses increased for the year ended December 31, 2020.

Regarding comprehensive income, we can find the information from image4: in 2020, comprehensive income was $\\S4,626.4$ million, while in 2019, it was $\\S6,152.2$ million.\n\nIn other words, net income decreased from 2019 to 2020 by approximately $\\S1.3$ billion, while comprehensive income decreased by approximately $\\S485.8$ million.\n\nFactors contributing to these changes can be broken down as follows:\n\n1. **Net Income**: The decrease in net income was likely due to the impact of COVID-19, as mentioned in text quote [9]. This led to a reduction in operating earnings and, consequently, a lower net income.\n\n2. **Comprehensive Income**: The decrease in comprehensive income can be attributed to several factors:\n   - **Foreign currency translation adjustments**: In 2020, a gain of $\\S46.0$ million was recognized, compared to a loss of $\\S127.5$ million in 2019.

This shows an increase in the total property, plant, and equipment value from 2019 to 2020.\n\nNow, let's consider image2, which presents a breakdown of asset categories and their recorded values. The total asset values before depreciation for December 31, 2020, was $17,864 million, whereas for December 31, 2019, it was $14,130 million. After applying accumulated depreciation, the total net value of assets for December 31, 2020, was $12,747 million, while for December 31, 2019, it was $10,396 million.\n\nAmong these assets, the portion that is closely related to solar energy systems is not explicitly mentioned in the image or the provided text quotes. However, from text quote [10], we can see that solar energy systems, net, consisted of various components. The relevant components from image2 are machinery, equipment, vehicles, and office furniture, tooling, leasehold improvements, land and buildings, computer equipment, hardware, and software, and construction in progress.\n\nTo calculate the total net value of solar energy systems and property, plant, and equipment combined, we can compare the value of relevant components from image2 between 2019 and 2020 and subtract the accumulated depreciation for each year from the respective net value. Since solar energy systems may not be separately listed in the table, we can only approximate the value by summing the relevant components and considering their potential overlap with assets related to solar energy systems.\n\nThe total net value of relevant components for December 31, 2020, is:\n\nMachinery, equipment, vehicles, and office furniture: $8,493 (since the nature of these assets isn't explicitly stated, they might include solar energy systems)\nTooling: $1,811\nLeasehold improvements: $1,421\nLand and buildings: $3,662\nComputer equipment, hardware, and software: $856\nConstruction in progress: $1,621\n\nThe total net value of relevant components for December 31, 2019, is:\n\nMachinery, equipment, vehicles, and office furniture: $7,167\nTooling: $1,493\nLeasehold improvements: $1,087\nLand and buildings: $3,024\nComputer equipment, hardware, and software: $595\nConstruction in progress: $764\n\nAdding accumulated depreciation for 2020: $(5,117)\nAdding accumulated depreciation for 2019: $(3,734)\n\nNow, let's calculate the net value of relevant components for December 31, 2020, after applying accumulated depreciation:\n\nNet value in 2020 = Total value - Accumulated depreciation = 8493 + 1811 + 1421 + 3662 + 856 + 1621 - 5117 = $\\S8,628$ million\nNet value in 2019 = Total value - Accumulated depreciation = 7167 + 1493 + 1087 + 3024 + 595 + 764 - 3734 = $\\S7,946$ million\n\nThe difference between the net values from 2019 to 2020 is:\n\n$\\S8,628$ million (2020) - $\\S7,946$ million (2019) = $\\S682$ million\n\nHowever, it's important to note that this calculation is an approximation due to the lack of specific information about solar energy systems in the provided data.\n\nIn conclusion, the total net value of solar energy systems and property, plant, and equipment changed from $\\S7,946$ million in 2019 to approximately $\\S8,682$ million in 2020, as per our approximation based on the given information.\n\n![The total net value of solar energy systems and property, plant, and equipment changed from approximately $\\S7,946$ million in 2019 to $\\S8,682$ million in 2020.](image2)"}

The highest revenue growth was observed in PBNA, with a substantial increase of approximately 14% [6]. [image4](image4)\n  - Regionally, Europe and AMESA showcased the most significant improvements, with both regions experiencing approximately 7% increase in net revenue [6]. The least growth was observed in APAC, with no change in net revenue over the same period [6].\n\n* **Operating Profit**\n  - Across all divisions, operating profit increased from 2018 to 2020, with PBNA leading the growth, followed by LatAm, Europe, and FLNA [6]. Although APAC and QFNA exhibited a decrease in operating profit, their contributions to the total operating profit were relatively small [6]. [image4]\n\nThis growth in net revenue and operating profit can be attributed to various factors, such as productivity savings, favorable pricing, and increased sales volumes. However, it is essential to consider the distribution of beverage and food/snack categories in each division to draw a more accurate conclusion.\n\n[image3] shows the percentage distribution of beverage and food/snack categories across various regions and PepsiCo. In 2020, PBNA, which experienced the most substantial growth in net revenue and operating profit, had the highest beverage %, followed by Europe and AMESA [3]. This suggests that the growing demand for beverages in these regions contributed to the expansion in net revenue and operating profit for PBNA.\n\nSimilarly, the growth in net revenue and operating profit for Latin America and Europe can be partly attributed to their increased focus on beverages, as seen in the higher percentage of beverage sales in these regions [3]. On the other hand, APAC and QFNA, which experienced a decrease in operating profit, had the lowest percentage of beverage sales among all divisions [3]. This could be an indicator of the potential challenges faced by these divisions, such as distribution challenges and consumer preferences.\n\nIn conclusion, the analysis of changes in net revenue and operating profit across divisions from 2018 to 2020 reveals a correlation between the growth and the distribution of beverage and food/snack categories. Divisions that increased their focus on beverages, such as PBNA, LatAm, and Europe, demonstrated significant improvements in their operating profit and net revenue [6][3]. Conversely, divisions with a smaller share of beverage sales (APAC and QFNA) experienced a decrease in operating profit. To maintain and further grow its market share, PepsiCo should continue to focus on regions with a higher demand for beverages and develop strategies to boost its growth in other regions with a lower focus on beverages (APAC and QFNA).\n\n![An analysis of net revenue and operating profit growth across divisions shows a correlation with the distribution of beverage and food categories.](image4)"}

Determine the current portion and long-term obligations (excluding interest) for both capital and finance lease obligations.\n2. Calculate the interest adjustment (imputed interest) for both types of obligations.\n3. Find the present value of net minimum lease payments for each type of obligation using the calculated values.\n4. Sum up the current portion, long-term obligations (excluding interest), interest adjustment, and present value of net minimum lease payments to get the total obligations for each type (capital and finance leases).\n5. Combine the total capital and finance lease obligations to get the total long-term capital and finance lease obligations.\n\n_![Combined long-term capital and finance lease obligations](image5) shows the total long-term obligations in the consolidated balance sheet of the company._"}

This indicates that the company has taken on more derivative financial instruments during this period.\n- Cash flow changes due to working capital changes (as seen in image 5) decreased from 3,388 million DKK in 2019 to 4,353 million DKK in 2020. This suggests that the company experienced a greater net outflow of cash due to changes in working capital in 2020 compared to 2019.\n\nOverall, derivative financial instruments play a role in the company's financial management strategy, with the increased use of these instruments altering the company's financial risk profile. The changes in working capital required more cash outflows in 2020, impacting the company's financial statements."}

The changes in shareholders' equity might be influenced by a combination of factors such as net income, other comprehensive income, share repurchases, tax benefits, and changes in valuation allowances, as suggested across text quotes [1], [3], [4], [6], [7], and [10]. However, more detailed analysis is required to comprehensively understand the trends and relationships between these components and shareholders' equity changes.\n\nOur direct answer to your question:\n\nAccenture's comprehensive income (including Net Income and Other Comprehensive Income) showed improvement from fiscal 2018 to 2020, while other comprehensive income components fluctuated but settled positively in 2020, as compared to the negative range in 2019.

Using cost reduction and the Toyota Production System (TPS), Toyota reinforces the profit structure and secures funds for technology investments, particularly in electrification.\n\n![Toyota's financial performance](image1)\nIn alignment with the financial strategy, the diagram assesses Toyota’s performance based on financial metrics and stock volatility, demonstrating an increased consolidated operating income and improved stability.\n\nIn relation to climate scenarios, Toyota uses tools like the $2^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ or $1.5^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ to analyze potential future impacts on society [5].

This suggests growth in revenue during this period, which might be due to successful product launches or acquisitions such as Tableau (image2).\n\nAs for the unearned revenue, it increased from $6,995 million in 2019 to $8,564 million in 2020. The increase in unearned revenue is partially offset by a higher amount of revenue recognized ratably over time and at a point in time. This might indicate a shift in revenue recognition strategy or an expansion of contract terms during the period leading to fiscal 2020.\n\nThe implications of these changes could potentially affect Salesforce's cash flow and financial position since unearned revenue will be recognized as revenue in future periods, while increased total revenue may contribute to higher profits and a stronger financial position. However, it is essential to consider other variables impacting Salesforce's financial performance for a more comprehensive understanding of these changes."}

Here's a summary of the changes:\n\n**Deferred Tax Assets:**\n\nThe total Deferred Tax Assets for 2022 is $4,091, while for 2021, it is $4,564. Comparing the two years, we observe a decrease of $473 in Deferred Tax Assets.\n\n![{Decrease in Deferred Tax Assets: $473 between 2021 and 2022}](image1)\n\nKey categories contributing to this decrease include:\n\n1. **Stock-based compensation**: A decrease from $386 (2021) to $386 (2022) doesn't significantly contribute to the change, as the values are the same for both years.\n\n2. **Other**: There's a decrease from $878 (2021) to $717 (2022). Although it results in a decrease, it doesn't constitute the primary driver of the change as the decline is offset by an increase in other categories as well.\n\nRegarding the primary categories contributing to these changes, looking at the provided image may not yield conclusive results as the table does not show detailed entries or figures within the given snippet. However, it is evident that changes in the categories of **Loss and other carryforwards**, **Pension and other retiree benefits**, **Capitalized research & development**, **Accrued marketing and promotion**, and **Valuation allowances** impacted the overall change in Deferred Tax Assets. To get a more accurate understanding, a thorough examination of the complete table or additional sources is required.\n\nTo find out the primary categories contributing to the changes in Deferred Tax Liabilities, we need to examine more details from the text quotes provided.

This surge in operating cash flow is visibly represented in image2, where the net cash provided by operating activities in 2020 is $18.2 billion, an increase of $3.4 billion compared to 2019.\n\nSecondly, the net cash used in investing activities decreased by $23.9 billion in 2020, mainly due to a decrease in net cash used for acquisitions, partially offset by a decrease in cash provided by net non-operating finance receivables [9]. In image2, the net cash used in investing activities is shown to be $(3.0) billion in 2020, a significant decrease from $(26.9) billion in 2019.\n\nLastly, the net cash used in financing activities increased by $18.7 billion in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily driven by changes in financing activities [8]. This increase in financing activities is not shown directly in image2 but can be inferred by comparing the net cash provided by financing activities between the two years.\n\nIn summary, the financial adjustments and cash flow activities led to an increase in operating cash flow, a decrease in cash used in investing activities, and an increase in cash used in financing activities, resulting in a net change in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash of $5.4 billion in 2020 compared to a decrease of $3.3 billion in 2019.\n\n![IBM's Operating Cash Flow Increase in 2020](image2)\n![IBM's Investing Activities Cash Flow Decrease in 2020](image2)"}

In the bar chart `![Revenue changes by segment](image1)`, you can observe that total restaurant margins decreased by 13% in 2020, partially due to sales declines in the International Operated Markets segment.\n\n[2] revised text: On the other hand, the U.S. segment showed positive sales growth, but the increase was more than offset by support provided for marketing through incentives to franchisees, free Thank You Meals served across the country, and other initiatives [9]. These efforts were reflected in the incremental marketing contributions, RMHC commitments, renewed brand communications, and strategic technology investments [3].\n\n[3] The table `![Financial data for Franchised and Company-operated sectors](image2)` shows the financial data for each sector. Total Selling, General & Administrative Expenses increased by 14% in 2020 (excluding currency translation), as stated in [3]. These expenses include, for instance, costs related to protective equipment, signage, and employee-related costs incurred due to the pandemic [10].\n\nIn conclusion, the significant drop in the International Operated Markets segment's revenues and relatively higher marketing expenses in the U.S., as well as other pandemic-related costs, were the main contributing factors to the overall decrease in total revenues and restaurant margins from 2019 to 2020. `![Financial data for Selling, General & Administrative Expenses](image3)` provides a detailed breakdown for different segments according to these factors."}

Meanwhile, the increase in operating expenses is primarily coming from the NBCUniversal and Sky segments as well, but the change is not as substantial as the increase in revenue.\n\n![Comcast Revenue and Operating Expenses Contributions](image4)\n\nAs a concise conclusion, the growth in Comcast's consolidated revenue from 2020 to 2021 was primarily due to increases in the NBCUniversal and Sky segments. Meanwhile, the operating expenses experienced moderate incremental growth in line with revenue increases, primarily in the NBCUniversal and Sky segments.\n\nTo further clarify the changes in Comcast's operating expenses, there is a waterfall chart illustrating the contributions from different business segments, which can be found as `![ Changes in Comcast's Operating Expenses ](image5)`."}

It's essential to note that this growth rate is for the entire year, which might not directly correspond to the quarterly growth mentioned in text quote [4].\n\nHowever, the image quotes help us interpret the growth better.

This enhancement is attributed to a general boost in various sectors, such as FICC, Equities, and Global Liquidity and Cash Management, which all registered increased revenues year over year [1, 3]. However, some segments, such as Securities Services and Global Trade and Receivables Finance, experienced a decrease in revenue during the same period [3].\n\nOn the other hand, **Corporate Centre** saw a significant improvement in both NOI and PBT. The NOI moved from $(722) million in 2019 to $(-401) million in 2020, representing a 44% reduction [10]. The profit before tax (PBT) increased by 42%, from $(144) million in 2018 to $1,311 million in 2020 [4]. This brisk jump can be linked to a better balance sheet and liquidity position, which helped the group support customers during periods of government-imposed restrictions and their subsequent easement [3].\n\nComparing the performance of the Corporate Centre and the Global Banking and Markets segments, the Global Banking and Markets segment still experienced a higher level of net operating income volatility despite the overall positive trend.

These contractual arrangements may not be as effective as direct ownership in providing us with control over the VIEs. For example, the VIEs and their respective shareholders could breach their contractual arrangements with us by, among other things, failing to conduct their operations in an acceptable manner or taking other actions that are detrimental to our interests. The revenues contributed by the VIEs and their subsidiaries constituted substantially all of our revenues in 2019, 2020, and 2021.\n\nFrom the provided text quote [2], it is evident that the VIEs and their consolidated subsidiaries contributed substantially all of the company's revenues in 2019, 2020, and 2021, but the exact revenues for both years 2020 and 2021 are not explicitly given.\n\nNow, let's see the total assets of the VIE and its consolidated subsidiaries:\n\n[1] The recognized revenue-producing assets held by the Group’s VIEs include intangible assets acquired through business combination, prepaid content royalties, and domain names and servers. The balances of these assets as at December 31, 2020, and 2021, were included in the line of “Total non-current assets” in the table above.\n[3] As at December 31, 2020, and 2021, the total assets of Group's VIEs mainly consisted of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, prepayments, deposits, and other current assets, intangible assets, and land use right, as applicable.\n\nFrom the provided text quotes [1] and [3], it can be inferred that the VIEs' total assets consist of a combination of current and non-current assets.

The company also has an Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP) and The Procter & Gamble Profit Sharing Trust to fund retiree benefits [4]. The total stock-based expense increased from $558 million in 2020 to $540 million in 2021 and further decreased to $528 million in 2022 [6]. This slight decrease suggests a slightly lower investment in stock-based compensation in 2022 compared to the previous two years.\n\nMoving to net earnings per share (EPS), the text quotes reveal that EPS increased in 2022 from $5.81 to $6.00, despite a slight dip from $5.81 to $5.50 between 2020 and 2021 [7, 9]. Thus, the EPS has increased overall from 2020 to 2022, indicating improvement in financial performance.\n\nNow, let's analyze the image4 which summarizes the Procter & Gamble's financial data for the years ended June 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020. The consolidated net earnings increased from $13,027 million in 2020 to $14,306 million in 2021 and further to $14,793 million in 2022 [4]. The diluted net earnings per share also followed a similar upward trend, increasing from $4.96 in 2020 to $5.50 in 2021 and finally to $5.81 in 2022 [9].\n\nTaking a closer look at image3, we can see that although the total stock-based compensation expense decreased from 2020 to 2022, the income tax benefit remained fairly stable [3]. This suggests that the tax benefits from stock-based compensation were comparatively less significant in 2022 than in 2020, affecting the overall net earnings but maintaining growth, as seen in image4.\n\nIn summary, although Procter & Gamble's stock-based compensation expense slightly decreased from 2020 to 2022, the company has been investing in these programs to compensate key managers and directors, reflecting its commitment to employee retention and incentivization. The overall net earnings per share and net earnings have grown between 2020 and 2022, demonstrating an improvement in Procter & Gamble's financial trends during these years. However, the tax benefits from stock-based compensation have somewhat contributed less to the overall net income in 2022 compared to 2020, despite the slight decrease in the total expense.\n\n![Procter & Gamble's financial trend shows net earnings per share and net earnings growing between 2020 and 2022, but tax benefits from stock-based compensation have contributed less in 2022 compared to 2020](image4)"}

Other Comprehensive (Loss) Income: A decrease from $(140) million in 2019 to $(50) million in 2021.\n\nSince shareholders' equity components like retained earnings have an impact on the comprehensive income, and we observed changes in these components, we can anticipate a related impact on the comprehensive income.\n\nTo confirm this, let's add the net income and the other comprehensive income over the three years:\n\n1. 2019: $6,759 million (net income) + $(140) million (other comprehensive income) = $6,619 million (comprehensive income)\n2. 2020: $3,135 million (net income) + $(158) million (other comprehensive income) = $2,977 million (comprehensive income)\n3. 2021: $8,060 million (net income) + $(50) million (other comprehensive income) = $8,010 million (comprehensive income)\n\nOverall, the comprehensive income has experienced an increase from 2019 to 2021, despite the changes in shareholders' equity components. The increase in net income from 2019 to 2021 has played a significant role in this positive trend, offsetting the impact of changes in shareholders' equity.\n\nHere's the interleaved text and image response:\n\nFirst, let's break down the changes in shareholders' equity as shown in [image2]:\n\n1. Preferred Shares: No significant changes.\n2. Common Shares: Decreased slightly from 805 million in 2020 to 761 million in 2021.\n3. Additional Paid-in Capital: Decreased from $161 million in 2020 to $153 million in 2021.\n4. Retained Earnings: Decreased from $11,881 million in 2020 to $11,495 million in 2021.\n\n![Total Shareholders' Equity decreased slightly from 2020 to 2021, mostly due to the decrease in Retained Earnings.](image2)\n\nNow, let's explore the comprehensive income changes from 2019 to 2021, using data from [image5]:\n\n1. Net Income: Increased from $6,759 million in 2019 to $8,060 million in 2021.\n2. Other Comprehensive (Loss) Income: Decreased from $(140) million in 2019 to $(50) million in 2021.\n\n![Comprehensive Income has experienced an increase from 2019 to 2021, driven by an increase in Net Income offsetting the impact of changes in shareholders' equity.](image5)\n\nIn conclusion, although there were changes in shareholders' equity from 2019 to 2021, these changes have not significantly impacted the comprehensive income, as the positive trend in net income has outweighed the impact of changes in shareholders' equity components.\n\n![How did the changes in shareholders' equity impact the comprehensive income of the company from 2019 to 2021? Although shareholders' equity changes had some influence, the positive trend in net income from 2019 to 2021 overshadowed the impact of changes in equity components on the comprehensive income.](image4)"}

However, at the end of the year, after considering inflows, outflows, market impact, and the sale of WFAM, the balance dropped to $(587.1) billion [9]. Therefore, the AUM decreased from December 31, 2020, to December 31, 2021. The actual amount decreased can be calculated as follows:\n\n  - Balance at the start of December 31, 2021: $603.0 billion\n  - Balance at the end of December 31, 2021: $(587.1) billion\n  - Decrease in AUM: $(603.0 - 587.1 = $15.9 billion)\n\n### Changes in AFS Securities\n\nImage4 presents financial data comparing December 31, 2021, with December 31, 2020, for both available-for-sale and held-to-maturity securities.

The difference shows a decrease in AFS securities net unrealized gains between the two dates of $(3,078) million.\n- While the fair value of AFS securities at December 31, 2021, was $177,244 million [10], it was $220,392 million at December 31, 2020 [10]. The difference shows a decrease in AFS securities fair value of $(43,148) million between the two dates.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe table from image1 shows a decrease in WFAM assets under management (AUM) from December 31, 2020, to December 31, 2021, with a decrease of $15.9 billion. Various factors contributed to this decrease, including outflows, market impact, and the sale of WFAM.\n\nThe table described in image4 reveals a decrease in AFS securities amortized cost, net, net unrealized gains, and fair value from December 31, 2020, to December 31, 2021. The differences in these figures show a decrease in AFS securities of $(40,070) million in amortized cost, net, $(3,078) million in net unrealized gains, and $(43,148) million in fair value between the two dates, respectively.\n\n![Decrease in AUM and AFS Securities between December 31, 2020, and December 31, 2021.](image1),[image4]\n\nThe user question asked for changes in WFAM assets under management and available-for-sale securities between December 31, 2020, and December 31, 2021.

On the other hand, commercial loans increased, particularly in the commercial and industrial loan portfolio.\n\nThese changes in the loan portfolio had an impact on Wells Fargo's financial strategy. The decrease in residential mortgage loans may indicate a shift in the strategy towards commercial lending, as commercial loans increased significantly. This change could potentially provide more revenue due to the higher interest rates associated with commercial loans, as shown in [Table 10](https://i.imgur.com/A99F7pN.png).\n\n![Table 10 highlights the increase in commercial loans from 2020 to 2021](image10)\n\nAnother important aspect to consider is the sale of Wells Fargo Asset Management (WFAM), which closed on November 1, 2021. [Table 5](https://i.imgur.com/b44jUub.png) and [image 5](https://i.imgur.com/5VuUxfo.png) illustrate the movements in WFAM assets under management (AUM) from 2019 to 2021. The sale of WFAM led to a substantial decrease in WFAM AUM, which was one of the largest categories in the total assets as shown in [Table 3](https://i.imgur.com/A99F7pN.png). The sale impacted the total assets significantly, as confirmed by the figures in [Table 3](https://i.imgur.com/A99F7pN.png) and [image 3](https://i.imgur.com/E6CClB5.png).\n\nThe sale of WFAM may have been part of Wells Fargo's strategy to focus on core banking businesses while transforming its asset management capabilities. After the sale, the asset management business was moved out from the Wealth and Investment Management operating segment to the Corporate segment, as mentioned in [text quote 6](#6).\n\nIn summary, the decrease in residential mortgage loans and the increase in commercial loans, along with the sale of WFAM, had an impact on Wells Fargo's financial strategy in 2021. These changes might have helped the bank diversify its revenue sources and focus on core banking businesses. Nevertheless, to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the financial strategy, further analysis is required, particularly regarding the changes in interest rate risk, liquidity management, and overall financial results in 2021 compared to 2020."}

The increase in deposit figures could suggest an effective deposit mobilization strategy, potentially to accommodate higher loan demand.\n\nOn the other hand, total loans increased by 1.04% from $887,637 million in 2020 to $895,394 million in 2021, with most of the growth occurring in commercial loans (1.4% increase), as shown in **image5**. The increase in commercial loans could be linked to a pickup in business activity, or a successful expansion of commercial lending operations, indicating a growth-oriented strategy.\n\nIn contrast, consumer loans decreased by 3.02%, primarily due to a decline in the residential mortgage – first lien portfolio, as detailed in [1]. This decrease may suggest a focus on commercial lending while reducing exposure to consumer lending, or an intent to redirect resources towards other areas of the business.\n\nAnother potential insight from these changes is the reduction in time deposits and interest-bearing deposits in non-U.S. offices, as mentioned in [10]. This move may be aimed at optimizing the balance sheet and managing under the asset cap, or a shift towards a domestic-focused strategy.\n\nIn summary, based on the data provided, it appears that the financial entity implemented a strategy emphasizing growth in commercial lending, while potentially scaling back on consumer lending and optimizing deposit structures to accommodate these changes and manage under asset constraints. For a more detailed understanding, it would be beneficial to further analyze the accompanying reports to evaluate the impact of these changes on the financial entity's net interest income, risk management, and overall performance.\n\n`![Loans and deposits increased and decreased as per the provided data] (image5)`"}

This decline was primarily due to lower income from short-term investments and fixed maturity securities. Image5 further supports this, as it shows a decrease in both interest income and the total net investment income from 2020 to 2021.\n\nTo elaborate on the reasons for this decline, it's noted in text quote [2] that low short-term interest rates during 2020 and 2021 resulted in significantly lower interest income. This is further proven in image4, which shows a decrease in the carrying value of corporate bonds and an increase in unrealized losses, indicating unfavorable investment performance in these instruments.\n\nTherefore, the decline in net investment income from 2020 to 2021 can be attributed to the reduction in short-term interest rates and the resulting lower interest income from short-term investments and fixed maturity securities.\n\n![The decline in net investment income from 2020 to 2021 was mainly due to a reduction in short-term interest rates, leading to lower interest income from short-term investments and fixed maturity securities.](image5)\n\nRegarding asset allocations, the text quote [1] indicates a decrease in corporate interest and other after-tax earnings, which may suggest a potential shift towards more conservative asset allocations, such as increased investments in cash and cash equivalents, as observed in image1.

Additionally, it appears that the asset allocations reflected an attempt to adjust for these changing market conditions, taking on more conservative investments and shifting funds toward U.S. Treasury, U.S. government, and foreign government investments.

In 2021, the company's total Adjusted EBIT increased significantly, from €2,248 million in 2020 to €3,142 million in 2021. A careful examination of the segments reveals that Varian contributed positively to this growth, as its Adjusted EBIT was €221 million in 2021(since Varian was acquired in the middle of 2021). Comparatively, Varian's Adjusted EBIT was not applicable in 2020.\n\nAdditionally, the Adjusted EBIT Margin for Varian was 17.0% in 2021, which helped boost the total Adjusted EBIT Margin from 15.5% in 2020 to 17.4% in 2021.\n\nOn the other hand, let's examine the financial assets (image5). The \"Other assets\" category increased from €295 million in 2020 to €460 million in 2021, which likely includes assets related to the acquisition of Varian.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that the acquisition of Varian also affected Siemens Healthineers' liabilities. In the provided financial data (image1), the liabilities to the Siemens Group from financing activities increased significantly from  €2,982 million in 2020 to €11,708 million in 2021, with a substantial portion attributed to the financing of the acquisition of Varian.\n\n![Financial data shows liabilities to Siemens Group from financing activities increased significantly due to the acquisition of Varian](image1)\n\nIn summary, the acquisition of Varian positively influenced Siemens Healthineers' Adjusted EBIT in 2021, due to the strong margin development in Diagnostics, which was driven by high demand for rapid COVID-19 antigen tests. However, the acquisition also resulted in an increase in liabilities to Siemens Healthineers from financing activities, as the Siemens Group provided loans with various maturities totaling $\\tocols10.0$ billion for the financing of the acquisition of Varian. Thus, although the acquisition boosted Adjusted EBIT, it also increased the company's overall indebtedness.\n\nThe financial data highlights that the acquisition of Varian played a crucial role in the financial performance of Siemens Healthineers in 2021, contributing positively to Adjusted EBIT, but also increasing liabilities.\n\nFor further information regarding the acquisition, please refer to Note 3 - Acquisitions in the notes to the consolidated financial statements."}

As per the provided quotes, the commercial risk-based and fee-based businesses experienced a decrease ([10]). However, total revenues increased as each segment reported revenue growth ([4]). This suggests that despite a decrease in the number of individuals served through the commercial businesses, there were growth in other segments that offset the decrease.\n\n![Individuals Served by UnitedHealthcare Segments](image4)\n\nThis image illustrates the revenue growth across different UnitedHealthcare segments from 2018 to 2020. Although the fee-based and risk-based commercial business experienced a decline, we can see that this decrease was overshadowed by the growth in other segments like UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement and UnitedHealthcare Community & State.\n\nBased on the evidence, it appears that the causes of the changes in the number of individuals served by UnitedHealthcare stem primarily from factors influencing the commercial risk-based and fee-based businesses, like increased unemployment and related attrition ([10]). These broader economic factors were likely accompanied by adjustments within other segments to maintain or grow revenues, as indicated by the overall increase in total revenues ([4]). The ultimate impact of such changes continues to evolve and remains uncertain, as highlighted in quote [7]."}

In general, the total equity decreased from RMB 51,055 million in 2020 to RMB 50,487 million in 2021. This can be attributed to the decrease in retained earnings and other reserves, partially offset by an increase in additional paid-in capital.\n\nBeginning with the equity as of December 31, 2020, (image3) we see RMB 52,245 million, which is the total equity attributable to equity holders of the company. By the end of 2021, total equity had decreased to RMB 50,487 million (image1). This decrease can be traced to the following major transactions as presented in the changes in equity statement (image3):\n\n1. **Retained Earnings**: This amount decreased from RMB 14,194 million to RMB 12,101 million due to dividends paid out to shareholders and changes in profit for the year.\n2. **Other Reserves**: Other reserves saw a decrease from RMB 3,726 million to RMB 3,565 million, due to a few key factors including changes in comprehensive income, cash dividends, and share award expenses.\n3. **Additional Paid-in Capital**: An increase from RMB 36,238 million to RMB 36,467 million was observed, as a result of additional investments made during the year.\n4. **Non-controlling Interests**: These rose from RMB 738 million to RMB 805 million, indicating a greater presence of non-controlling interests in the company.\n\nIn terms of changes in assets and liabilities (image2), we can see that the total assets decreased from RMB 68,273 million (2020) to RMB 67,254 million (2021). This was primarily due to a decrease in cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, as well as a reduction in investments accounted for using equity method.\n\nLastly, during the years 2019-2021, various cash flows appeared in the statement of cash flows (image4), showing how cash was generated and used for different activities.

This increase was primarily due to a rise in advertising and direct-to-consumer revenue, as mentioned in quote [10].\n\nHowever, the company experienced a decline in customer relationships over this period. While the number of customer relationships was relatively stable in 2019 and 2020, it saw a decrease of 198 in 2021, as shown in `[image1](image1)`. This decline might have negatively impacted the company's revenue, but the overall increase indicates that other factors outweighed this loss.\n\nLooking at the financial breakdown, it's clear that the increasing revenue was not enough to cover the escalating operating costs and expenses.

Sitting Fees: Max. 30,000 per meeting (for attending meetings of the Board and committee meetings, as per [text8]), but from the provided tables, there are no specified sitting fees for the independent directors.\n2. Commission: Maximum 1% of the net profits with the approval of members (as per [text8]), but this is only paid to non-executive directors (as per [text7]).\n\nAs we can see, the remuneration structure for the CEOMD and independent directors is quite different. The CEOMD's remuneration includes a base salary, perquisites, commission (variable component), and other allowances. In contrast, independent directors are not typically compensated with commission. Instead, their remuneration mainly consists of sitting fees for attending meetings and possibly other allowances depending on the internal policies of the company (not specified in the provided text). It is essential to note that the exact remuneration for the independent directors, other than sitting fees, is not provided in the information given.\n\nTo better visualize and compare the remuneration details of the CEOMD and independent directors, the table below consolidates the relevant data:\n\n| **Category**       | **CEOMD**           | **Independent Directors**  |\n| -------------------|--------------------|---------------------------- |\n| Gross Salary       | Salary + Perquisites + Other Allowances | Not specified* |\n| Stock Option       | Not listed         | Not listed                  |\n| Sweat Equity       | Not listed         | Not listed                  |\n| Commission         | Rajesh Gopinathan: 1,000.00<br>N Ganapathy Subramaniam: 700.00    | - (only for non-executive directors; as per [text8])|\n| Other Allowances   | Rajesh Gopinathyan: 72.82<br>N Ganapathy Subramaniam: 166.51    | Not specified*            |\n\n\\* Not specified in the provided text\n\nOverall, the remuneration of the CEOMD (Rajesh Gopinathan and N Ganapathy Subramaniam) is significantly higher than that of the independent directors. The main differences lie in the inclusion of commission and other allowances in the total remuneration for the CEOMD, unlike the independent directors' remuneration comprising only sitting fees (and possibly other allowances) without commission."}

Total Loans: A significant decrease in total loans was noted for 2021, dropping by approximately 14% from 2020 levels ($\\ -30,199 million).\n\n2. Home Lending Loans: The decrease in Home Lending loans was partially due to the temporary suspension of home equity originations and non-conforming residential mortgage originations in 2020, as well as a decline in Small Business period-end loan balances due to Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans.\n\n3. Commercial and Industrial Loans: A decrease of 16% was observed in Commercial and Industrial loans, from 2020 to 2021.\n\n4.

These changes suggest that, while the institution saw growth in credit risk exposures, it also strengthened its External TLAC on an absolute basis, which could positively impact its overall capital structure. However, the decrease in External TLAC as a percentage of RWA might be a concern as it could be an indicator of weakening capital structure, but more analysis is required to draw definitive conclusions."}

Although it does not specify the segment of HSBC that corresponds to the given profit data, the table does indicate a decrease of $5,302 million in profit before tax for 2020 compared to 2019. Nevertheless, we advisably mention our assumption that this decrease could be partially attributed to the commercial banking segment, since other regions like Asia performed remarkably well.\n\nTo further investigate the impact on HSBC's Commercial Banking profit before tax, a more focused search for available information about this segment's performance is recommended.\n\n![Decrease in HSBC's reported profit before tax by about $5.3 billion compared to 2019](image5)"}

This downturn in net interest income primarily resulted from a more substantial decrease in interest income outpacing the decrease in interest expenses.\n\n`Image1`, which provides financial data for Deposits, Consumer Lending, and Total Consumer Banking, supports this trend as it shows a general decline in net income figures from 2019 to 2020 for Deposits and Consumer Lending.\n\n`Image2` illustrates the organizational structure of Bank of America, consisting of five main divisions: Consumer Banking, Global Wealth & Investment Management, Global Banking, Global Markets, and All Other. The decrease in net interest income may be partly attributed to the Consumer Banking division, which saw a reduction in net interest income due to lower rates and other factors such as the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic (as mentioned in quote [8]).\n\nOn the other hand, the decrease in interest expenses was also significant, amounting to $5,627 million. This decline might be related to the reduction in financial instruments, such as interests in loans and federal funds purchased (as shown in `image4`).\n\nIn summary, the significant decrease in net interest income and the more moderate decrease in interest expenses from 2019 to 2020 compared to 2018 to 2019 indicate challenging conditions for the Bank of America's Consumer Banking division.\n\n![The table in image4 shows a notable downturn in net interest income and a more moderate decrease in interest expenses for the Bank of America from 2019 to 2020 compared to 2018 to 2019, suggesting challenging conditions for the Consumer Banking division.](image4)"}

Specifically, the table under image2 shows that pre-tax net investment income decreased by 5.0% from $5,949 million in 2020 to $5,649 million in 2021.\n\n![Asset Composition](image4)\n\nAs for the asset composition, let's focus on the investment categories that make up the majority of the assets. In image4, we can see that the investments in U.S. Treasury, U.S. government corporations and agencies, foreign governments, and corporate bonds account for most of the holdings.\n\nThe table shows that the carrying value of investments in U.S. Treasury, U.S. government corporations and agencies, and corporate bonds have slightly increased in 2021 compared to 2020. However, the unrealized gains/losses for corporate bonds have noticeably risen.\n\nRegarding the implications of these changes, the declining net investment income in 2021, as compared to 2020, could result in lower profits for the insurance business. This decrease might be due to several factors, such as the ongoing economic uncertainty brought about by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, changes in interest rates, or shifts in the investing strategy of the insurance company.\n\nThe changes in asset composition, specifically the increase in unrealized gains for corporate bonds, indicate that the insurance company may be moving towards riskier investment strategies to try and compensate for the decreasing net investment income. This could present a mixed bag of opportunities and risks depending on the performance of those corporate bonds moving forward.\n\nIt is important to note that the user question asked about the insurance business, but the descriptive text and the image quotations provided were primarily about the railroad business. Therefore, the given response mainly addresses the changes in the net investment income and asset composition for the insurance business, provided that the information in image2 (net investment income data) is indeed related to the insurance business, and image 4 (asset composition data) depicts a more general asset breakdown rather than specific to the insurance business. For a more accurate response, it would be helpful to have information about the insurance business specifically."}

The table provides a summary of the financial performance of both Upstream and Downstream operations, as well as other financial impacts:\n\n1. **Upstream Operations:**\n   - United States: The upstream earnings significantly improved from a loss of $1.6 billion in 2020 to $7.3 billion in 2021.\n   - International: The international upstream earnings also improved notably, from a loss of $825 million in 2020 to $8.5 billion in 2021.\n\n2. **Downstream Operations:**\n   - United States: The US downstream earnings improved from a loss of $571 million in 2020 to $2.4 billion in 2021.\n   - International: The international downstream earned $525 million in 2021, compared with $618 million in 2020 ([see text quote 2]).\n\nThus, we can see that both Upstream and Downstream operations showed improvements in financial performance from 2020 to 2021. These improvements contributed to Chevron's overall net income which surged from a loss of $5.543 billion in 2020 to $15.625 billion in 2021 ([see image2]).\n\nIn summary, Chevron's upstream and downstream operations improved their financial performance during the years 2019 to 2021, resulting in a notable improvement in the overall net income for the corporation.\n\n![Chevron's upstream and downstream operations improved their financial performance, contributing to increased overall net income.](image1)"}

From the provided information, it's clear that these contracts are sensitive to changes in the equity markets, but not significantly so as the intrinsic value is near zero and the recorded liability at fair value is approximately $99 million as of December 31, 2021. However, we can observe changes in fair values of interest rate sensitive instruments like fixed maturity investments, loans, and finance receivables based on interest rate fluctuations [3]. According to image2, the fair value of these instruments may increase or decrease significantly in response to changes in interest rates. For instance, a 300 bp increase in interest rates can decrease the fair value of equity securities by approximately 8% (from $10,864 to $9,319).\n\nNow we will discuss the differences in non-U.S. denominated debt effects on net earnings between 2020 and 2021 [8]. The data shows that changes in foreign currency exchange rates resulted in pre-tax gains of $1.3 billion in 2021, compared to pre-tax losses of $1.0 billion in 2020. It's also worth noting that the net liabilities under certain reinsurance contracts included in net earnings were $58 in 2021, while they were $(163) in 2020 [2]. Conversely, foreign currency translation included in other comprehensive income was $(1,021) in 2021, while it was $1,264 in 2020 [2]. The variations in foreign currency translation and non-U.S. denominated debt effects on net earnings indicate that changes in foreign currency exchange rates can have a significant impact on Berkshire Hathaway's earnings.\n\nTo conclude, changes in interest rates mainly affect the fair value of interest rate-sensitive instruments like fixed maturity investments, loans, and finance receivables, while changes in foreign currency exchange rates can impact various items on Berkshire Hathaway's balance sheet, such as non-U.S. denominated debt and foreign currency translation, ultimately influencing net earnings.\n\n![Berkshire's sensitivity to interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates (images2 and 3) shows the impact of these factors on various assets and liabilities of the company.](image2) and [image3]\n\nThe fair value of equity index put option contracts is relatively insensitive to changes in interest rates, but sensitive to changes in equity markets, while non-U.S. denominated debt effects on net earningsshow significant differences between 2020 and 2021, with changes in foreign currency exchange rates driving these variations."}

In the image3, we can see that Nestlé operates in various countries in the Americas (AMS), including Mexico, the United States, and Canada, among others. Should any events affecting raw materials and manufacturing occur in these countries (like strikes or natural disasters), it would potentially lead to supply issues for Nestlé [2.3].\n\nHowever, Nestlé has put measures in place to handle such events.

This includes central corporate services such as tax, legal, IT, corporate communications, human resources, accounting, financial services, and treasury.\n\n[5] The  change in equity for Siemens Healthineers AG from fiscal year 2020 to 2021 is significant, with a €2,641 million increase being the result of offsetting developments. This change is primarily due to a capital increase in March 2021, where subscribed capital rose by €53 million, and capital reserves by €2,284 million. The dividend distributed for fiscal year 2020 decreased unappropriated net income by €856 million, but this negative effect was more than offset by net income for the year, resulting in an increase in unappropriated net income of €497 million overall.\n\n[8] The balance sheet for Siemens Healthineers AG as of September 30, 2021, shows an increase in total current assets (€10,824 million) and total non-current assets (€31,338 million) compared to September 30, 2020 (€10,268 million and €14,827 million, respectively). Total current liabilities (€10,065 million) and total non-current liabilities (€15,758 million) also increased from their 2020 levels (€7,289 million and €5,294 million, respectively). The total equity attributable increased from €12,498 million in 2020 to €16,321 million in 2021, with a slight increase in non-controlling interests from €13 million in 2020 to €18 million in 2021.\n\n[9] The improvement in net financial income by €436 million for fiscal year 2021 is primary- larly attributable to higher income from equity investments. Other components like the profit transfer from Siemens Healthcare GmbH and equity investment income in connection with Siemens Healthineers Beteiligungen GmbH & Co. KG also contributed positively to this increase.\n\n![Increase in equity for Siemens Healthineers AG](image5)\n\n![Changes in balance sheet components for Siemens Healthineers AG](image2)\n\nIn summary, the key differences in the comprehensive income and balance sheet components of Siemens Healthineers AG between fiscal years 2020 and 2021 include:\n\n1. Decrease in support services from Siemens Group by €30 million\n2. Significant increase in equity due to a capital increase and an increase in net income\n3. Increase in both current and non-current assets, as well as current and non-current liabilities\n4.

The given figure for product development costs for 2019 is $998 million (as mentioned in image4). We also learned from image5 that total assets (excluding intangible assets) for 2019 were $17,845 million.\n\nNow, let's calculate the R&D to total assets ratio for Activision Blizzard in FY 2019:\n\n1. First, find the total R&D expenses (product development costs): $998 million\n2. From the total assets in image5, subtract intangible assets and goodwill (as R&D to these assets wouldn't be sensible): $17,845 - $531 (intangible assets) - $9,764 (goodwill) = $7,550 million\n3. Finally, divide the total R&D expenses by the adjusted total assets to get the ratio: $998 million / $7,550 million = approximately 0.132 or 13.2%\n\nIn conclusion, the approximate R&D to assets ratio for Activision Blizzard in FY 2019 is 13.2%, given the provided evidence.\n\n![The R&D to total assets ratio for Activision Blizzard in FY 2019 is approximately 13.2% found by analyzing the provided quotes and images.](image5)"}

However, pre-tax income took a Hit due to the acquisition and ongoing investments in key strategic areas.\n\nIn conclusion, the external gross profit and pre-tax income for Cloud & Cognitive Software in 2019 were significantly higher than those for Global Business Services. The financial results for GBS were mainly driven by growth in Consulting services and offset by declines in other components such as Application Management and Global Process Services. For CCS, the gross profit margin decrease was due to acquisition-related costs, while the pre-tax income decrease was due to the Red Hat acquisition and ongoing investments in strategic areas."}

The shipment volume for Cigarettes decreased by 11.8% from 2019 to 2020, while the shipment volume for Heated Tobacco Units increased by 50.8% during the same period. However, the total shipment volume showed a decline of 11.6%.\n\n![Latin America and Canada Shipment Volume Changes](image3)\n\nNow, moving on to the overall financial performance, we can see changes in key financial metrics from 2019 to 2020 as shown in `image4`. Net revenues had a significant decrease of 22.9%, but operating income experienced a positive change of 100%, with improvements in various factors such as price, volume/mix, and cost/other.\n\n![Financial Performance](image4)\n\nHowever, it is essential to consider that the PMI's shipment volumes might be affected by distributor inventory movements, estimated total industry/market volumes, and certain market-specific factors that can significantly distort reported volume disclosures, as mentioned in quote [4].\n\nFor a more detailed comparison of net cash provided by operating activities, investing activities, and financing activities, look at the bar charts in `image5`. Although there was a slight decrease in net cash provided by operating activities, the net cash used in investing activities considerably dropped from 2019 to 2020.\n\n![Financial Cash Flows](image5)\n\nLastly, it is crucial to note that various factors affected PMI's financial performance in Latin America and Canada, such as lower total market shares, lower total markets, lower market shares due to adult smoker down-trading following price increases, and the impact of the pandemic on adult smoker consumption patterns, as mentioned in quotes [2] and [10].\n\nIn conclusion, decreasing shipment volumes of Cigarettes and overall shipment volumes, along with volatile market conditions due to the pandemic, contributed to the decreased net revenues in Latin America and Canada from 2019 to 2020. Nevertheless, improved operating income and reduced net cash used in investing activities helped compensate for some of the financial impact."}

Let's interleave the discussion using the relevant evidence.\n\nFirst, let's consider the impact of share-based compensation [1, 4, 5, 11]:\n\nIn the text quote [1], we find mention of share-based compensation as part of the estimates and assumptions required for the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements. The image4 provides further details, showing that share-based compensation expenses amounted to `$1,197,806` for the fiscal year 2020.\n\nShare-based compensation is recorded as an expense, reducing Accenture plc's net income. However, it also increases Restricted Share Units and Additional Paid-in Capital. One essential part to note is that Restricted Share Units are calculated as part of Shareholders' Equity [1, 10]. So, while share-based compensation initially decreases net income, it ultimately contributes to the growth in shareholders' equity.\n\nMoving on to cash flows from operating activities using the image2:\n\nCash flows from operating activities include:\n- Net income: `$5,185,313` for the fiscal year 2020 [2, 4, 9]\n- Adjustments for depreciation, amortization, share-based compensation, and other expenses\n- Changes in assets and liabilities\n\nFor share-based compensation, the initial impact on cash flow is negative since it reduces net income. However, the eventual cash outflow occurs when the restored restricted share units are settled, which is typically over a more extended period [6].\n\nTherefore, share-based compensation directly impacts the shareholders' equity and indirectly affects cash flow through changes in net income. It increases shareholders' equity by increasing Restricted Share Units and Additional Paid-in Capital, but reduces cash flow by decreasing net income until the restored share units are settled.\n\nIn conclusion, answering the user's question: Share-based compensation increases Accenture plc's shareholders' equity by contributing to the growth of Restricted Share Units and Additional Paid-in Capital in the Consolidated Financial Statements [1, 4, 5, 10]. Meanwhile, the impact on cash flow from operating activities is indirect and negative through the reduction of net income, although the actual cash outflow occurs when the settled restricted share units are released [6].\n\n![Accenture's share-based compensation increases Restricted Share Units and Additional Paid-in Capital, growing shareholders' equity](image4)"}

This remarkable boost can be primarily attributed to the issuance of new shares in March 2021 for financing the acquisition of Varian, resulting in an increased issued capital of €1,128 million (2021) compared to €1,075 million in 2020. The capital reserve also expanded significantly from €13,476 million in 2020 to €15,818 million in 2021, thanks to the capital increase and related effects from transaction costs and taxes.\n\n![Siemens Healthineers' Current Liabilities comparison for 2020 and 2021](image3)\n\nThe current liabilities of Siemens Healthineers showed an increase from €1,198 million in 2020 to €2,016 million in 2021. The primary drivers behind this surge were greater other current financial liabilities (€263 million in 2021 vs. €93 million in 2020) and increased current provisions (€356 million in 2021 vs. €270 million in 2020).\n\n![Siemens Healthineers' Non-Current Liabilities comparison for 2020 and 2021](image4)\n\nWhile current liabilities grew significantly, non-current liabilities displayed a more moderate increase, soaring from €969 million in 2020 to €2,686 million in 2021. The main drivers were larger deferred tax liabilities (€2,082 million in 2021 vs. €470 million in 2020) and increased other liabilities (€435 million in 2021 vs. €345 million in 2020).\n\nIn summary, Siemens Healthineers' liabilities and equity experienced robust growth from 2020 to 2021. This increase was mainly attributed to the issuance of new shares to fund the acquisition of Varian, leading to a sizable expansion in both issued capital and capital reserve. In addition, current liabilities increased markedly due to more other current financial liabilities and increased current provisions, while non-current liabilities saw steady growth due to larger deferred tax liabilities and other liabilities."}

This decrease in total assets is reflected in the entity's comprehensive income, which showed a net loss of $\\mathbb{S}1$ million in 2021 due to changes in derivatives [1]. The decrease in total assets also corresponds to the net decrease in cash and cash equivalents as shown in the cash flows statement for the company [2]. The changes in assets are related to the entity's comprehensive income as they impact the entity's financial position, which is ultimately captured in the balance sheet and affects the earnings per share [5]."}

However, over the course of 2020, the gross unrecognized tax benefits decreased to $1,829 million due to factors such as gross increases, prior year tax positions, settlements, and statute of limitations lapses [image4].\n\nRegarding the impact of common share repurchases on the Company's financial position, the table presented in [image1] signifies that the Company repurchased 14 million common shares in 2020 at an average price per share of $300.58, with an aggregate cost of $4,250 million. In contrast, the Company repurchased 22 million shares in 2019 at an average price per share of $245.97, resulting in an aggregate cost of $5,500 million.

These leases have a duration of up to 10 years and once commenced will result in an increase in lease liabilities and right-of-use assets, on a total basis, of approximately $\\S9{,}000{,}000$ .\n[5] The table shows a financial summary related to assets under AASB 16 for the year 2020...The user question is: How did the carrying amounts of leasehold improvements, hardware and software, and right-of-use assets change between the beginning and end of the fiscal year 2020, and what factors contributed to these changes?\n\nBy summarizing the information in these quotes, we can see that, with the execution of new leases with a duration of up to 10 years, the Group expected an increase in both lease liabilities and right-of-use assets, amounting to approximately $\\S9{,}000{,}000$.\n\nNow, let's look at relevant details from the image [5]:\n\n**Cost**\n- Initial Balance (1 July 2019): None\n- Right-of-use asset recognition on AASB 16 application: $\\S138{,}403$\n- Additions: $\\S48{,}793$\n- **Total cost at 28 June 2020:** $\\S187{,}139$\n\n**Accumulated Depreciation and Impairment Losses**\n- Initial Balance (1 July 2019): None\n- Depreciation and impairment charges for the year: $($\\S37{,}454$ )\n- **Total accumulated depreciation and impairment losses at 28 June 2020:** $($\\S36{,}675$ )\n\n**Carrying Amounts**\n- At 1 July 2019: $\\S138{,}403$\n- At 28 June 2020: $\\S150{,}464$\n\nFrom the **Cost** section of the image [5], we can see the Group recognized a right-of-use asset on the application of AASB 16 with an initial balance of $\\S138{,}403$. Additionally, the Group made additions in the year amounting to $\\S48{,}793$, resulting in a total cost at 28 June 2020 of $\\S187{,}139$.\n\nFrom the **Accumulated Depreciation and Impairment Losses** section of the image [5], we can see the Group incurred depreciation and impairment charges for the year amounting to $($\\S37{,}454$ ). This resulted in a total accumulated depreciation and impairment losses of $($\\S36{,}675$ ) at 28 June 2020.\n\nFinally, **Carrying Amounts** show the initial balance (1 July 2019) as $\\S138{,}403$, and the balance at 28 June 2020 as $\\S150{,}464$.\n\nIn summary, the carrying amounts of right-of-use assets increased between the beginning and end of the fiscal year 2020 due to the recognition of right-of-use assets on the application of AASB 16 and additions made during the year. This increase was partially offset by the depreciation and impairment charges incurred during the year. The table [4] suggests that leasehold improvements, hardware, and software also saw increases, but specific details are missing.

This increase was due to the recognition of right-of-use assets following the application of AASB 16 ([5]) and additions made during the year ([5]). Partially offsetting this increase were depreciation and impairment charges incurred during the year ([5]). Unfortunately, data for leasehold improvements, hardware, and software is missing, requiring further analysis for a comprehensive understanding of the changes to these assets."}

However, it is important to note that the exact change in the net interest spread is not provided in the information given in image2.\n\n**Main contributing factors:**\n\nSeveral factors contributed to the changes in net interest income and net interest expense:\n1. **Interest-bearing deposits and other short-term investments**: The decrease in interest income from these sources amounted to $1,464 million from 2019 to 2020, mainly due to lower interest rates.\n2. **Time deposits and federal funds**: There were significant decreases in these categories, especially between 2019 to 2020, which led to a reduction in interest income.\n3. **Debt Securities and Loans and Leases**: The decrease in interest income from U.S. commercial loans was the most significant out of all the categories mentioned in the image2 description.\n4. **Interest-bearing deposits, U.S. and non-U.S.**: Both categories saw consistent decreases in interest expense, which contributed to the overall decline in interest expense.\n5. **Loans and Federal Funds Purchased**: Significant reductions in expenses in this category played a notable role in the decrease in interest expense.\n\nIn summary, the changes in net interest income and net interest expense from 2019 to 2020 primarily resulted from reduced interest rates, increased deposits, and reallocation of excess deposits into securities. The net interest spread likely decreased due to the downturn in net interest income outpacing the decrease in interest expenses.\n\n![Bank of America's net interest income and expense changes affected the net interest spread. The primary factors contributing to this change were lower interest rates leading to decreased income from interest-bearing deposits, time deposits, and debt securities.](image2)"}

The adjustments for amortization of intangible assets were as follows:\n\n- Under Gross Profit, the adjustments added **3,419** million US dollars to the core results.\n- Under Operating Income, the adjustments added **3,528** million US dollars to the core results.\n\n[![2021 Gross Profit and Operating Income adjustments - Amortization of intangible assets](image5)](image5)\n\nTo get a clearer picture of the impact on core operating income, we need to determine the adjustments to arrive at core operating income.

For simplicity, let's calculate only the adjustments related to the amortization of intangible assets in the sections mentioned above:\n\n`3,419 (Gross Profit) + 3,528 (Operating Income) = 6,947`\n\nHowever, it's important to note that other items such as costs associated with selling, general and administration, research and development, and other expense also have an impact on core operating income. Nevertheless, the estimated impact of the amortization of intangible assets on the core operating income can be calculated as follows:\n\n`15,215 (Core results) - 6,947 (Adjustments related to amortization of intangible assets) = 8,268`\n\nIn the year **2021**, the amortization of intangible assets contributed `6,947` million US dollars to the adjustments, which reduced the core operating income by around `6,947` million US dollars.\n\nIn conclusion:\n- In the year **2020**, the amortization of intangible assets reduced the core operating income by around `4,144` million US dollars.\n- In the year **2021**, the amortization of intangible assets contributed a total of `6,947` million US dollars to the adjustments, which reduced the core operating income by around `6,947` million US dollars.\n\n[1]: image1"}

According to [image1], the consolidated operating profit for 2021 was $\\$$6,878 million, compared to $\\$$4,553 million in 2020. Thus, the consolidated operating profit increased significantly from 2020 to 2021.\n\nFor the ME&T segment, we can refer to the data presented in [image1]. However, it doesn't explicitly state the operating profit for both years. Instead, it mentions the profit as a percent of total sales. We can find the operating profit using [3], which states that the ME&T contributed $\\$$6 billion in free cash flow in 2021, and suggest that we assume free cash flow is approximately eqautal to operating profit. Based on this, the ME&T operating profit could be roughly:\n\n- **2020 ME&T Operating Profit:** (Consolidated operating profit in 2020 * ME&T profit percentage of consolidated sales) = (4,553 * 13.7%) ≈ $\\$$613 million\n- **2021 ME&T Operating Profit:** (Consolidated operating profit in 2021 * ME&T profit percentage of consolidated sales) = (6,878 * 13.7%) ≈ $\\$$915 million\n\nIt's worth noting that these estimates may not be entirely accurate because free cash flow and operating profit do not always have a direct, one-to-one relationship. However, this provides a comparative measure for our purposes.\n\nNext, let's compare the net cash provided by operating activities. Referring to [image2], the net cash provided by operating activities for the consolidated data in 2021 was $\\$$7,200 million, while in 2020, it was $\\$$(98) million (note that the image shows a decrease, but the actual number provided in [8] shows an increase compared to 2020). If we consider only the ME&T operations, it's mentioned in [7] that ME&T had positive operating cash flow in both 2021 and 2020 (specific numbers are not given, though). This information allows us to conclude that the ME&T generated more net cash from operating activities in 2021 than in 2020.\n\nOverall, the consolidated operating profit increased significantly from 2020 to 2021, and it seems that the ME&T operating profit also increased during the same period, although exact numbers are not available.

Assuming free cash flow is approximately equal to operating profit, the estimated operating profit for ME&T in Q4 2020 would be around $\\$$3,044 million, and for Q4 2021, it would be $\\$$2,979 million.\n\n![Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities for Consolidated and ME&T](image2)\n\nFrom [image2], we can see that the net cash provided by operating activities for the consolidated data in 2021 was $\\$$7,200 million, while in 2020, it was $\\$$(98) million. For the ME&T operations, the data in [7] tells us that it had positive operating cash flow in both 2021 and 2020, but specific numbers are not provided. Overall, it seems that the ME&T generated more net cash from operating activities in 2021 compared to 2020.\n\nIn summary, the consolidated operating profit increased significantly from 2020 to 2021, and it looks like the ME&T operating profit may have also increased during the same period. Additionally, the consolidated and ME&T segments both generated more net cash from operating activities in 2021 compared to 2020."}

The total cost of repurchases also increased, from  $\\$$5,500 million in 2019 to  $\\$$4,250 million in 2020.\n\nSimultaneously, the Company's gross unrecognized tax benefits significantly increased from  $\\$$1,056 million in 2019 to  $\\$$1,423 million at the beginning of 2020 [3]. Over the year, they saw gross increases of  $\\$$416 million from current year tax positions and  $\\$$120 million from prior year tax positions [3], with a smaller decrease of  $\\$$130 million from prior year tax positions settlements. As a result, the gross unrecognized tax benefits ended the year 2020 at  $\\$$1,829 million [3].\n\nThis growth in unrecognized tax benefits didn't have an immediate impact on the Company's financial position, as no U.S. deferred taxes have been recorded for the undistributed earnings from non-U.S. subsidiaries [9]. However, the Company believes it is reasonably possible that their liability for these unrecognized tax benefits will decrease in the next twelve months by  $\\$$39 million as a result of audit settlements and the expiration of statutes of limitations [10].\n\nIn conclusion, the Company's gross unrecognized tax benefits increased significantly between 2019 and 2020, while its common share repurchases also increased but at a lower rate. This growth in unrecognized tax benefits could potentially decrease in the upcoming months due to anticipated audit settlements and statute of limitations expirations.\n\n![Growth in Gross Unrecognized Tax Benefits and Common Share Repurchases](image3)\n![Common Share Repurchases Over Two Years](image1)"}

This increase is primarily due to higher sales volume, driven by higher end-user demand for equipment and services and the impact from changes in dealer inventories, along with favorable price realization [10].\n\n![Profit or loss by segment for the 4th quarter of 2021 and 2020](image2)\n\nImage 2 presents the profit or loss by segment for the fourth quarter of 2021 and 2020. It reveals that the \"Machinery, Energy & Transportation\" segment had a total of $1,475 million in 2021, indicating a 13% increase from 2020. The \"Financial Products Segment\" also experienced a 27% rise, with $248 million in 2021 compared to $195 million in 2020 [2].\n\n![Financial data for different segments and regions for Q4 2021 and Q4 2020](image3)\n\nImage 3 provides additional insights into the regional variations of sales and revenues within the Machinery, Energy & Transportation and Financial Products segments. North America saw an impressive 29% increase in sales due to the impact from changes in dealer inventories, higher end-user demand for services, and favorable price realization. In contrast, dealers decreased inventories during Q4 2020, compared to remaining about flat during Q4 2021. The same trend can be observed in the Construction Industries segment [4] and [5].\n\n![Comparing consolidated operating profit for Q4 2020 and Q4 2021](image4)\n\nThe chart [4] illustrates the factors contributing to the rise in operating profit for the fourth quarter of 2021. Higher manufacturing costs and selling, general, and administrative (SG&A) expenses were more than offset by higher sales volume, favorable price realization, and net restructuring income due to a gain on the sale of a facility. Labor costs did increase due to increased headcount and investments aligned with the company’s strategy for profitable growth [6] and [7].\n\nIn conclusion, the significant growth in sales volume and operating profit for Caterpillar's fourth quarter of 2021, as compared to the same period in 2020, can be attributed to increased end-user demand for equipment and services, favorable price realization, as well as changes in dealer inventories across various regions. Furthermore, the strategic investments in labor and acquisitions also had a positive impact on overall profitability."}

In [10], it is mentioned that the Company performs impairment testing of its indefinite-lived intangible assets annually, including PepsiCo Beverages North America’s (PBNA) reacquired and acquired franchise rights. This is essential context to understand as it sets up the non-GAAP measures mentioned in the images and possible explanations for changes in those measures.\n\n2. **Image Quotes**: image1 provides a table comparing various segments between 2020 and 2019. From this table, we can see that:\n   - The 'Organic % Change, Non-GAAP Measure' for PBNA was 2% in 2020, whereas it was not explicitly provided for 2019.\n   - The 'Reported % Change, GAAP Measure' for PBNA was 4% in 2020, and it was not explicitly provided for 2019. However, comparing the 2020 Organic measure and the GAAP measure, we can infer that PBNA grew organically by 2%, but its GAAP-measured growth was 4%.\n\nWhile image4 shows differences between GAAP and non-GAAP measures for different years, it doesn't provide a 2020 vs 2019 comparison for PBNA.\n\nHowever, based on the available data from image1, we can determine that:\n\n- PBNA experienced a 4% growth in GAAP measures, and a 2% organic growth in non-GAAP measures from 2019 to 2020.\n\nNow let's consider factors affecting those changes:\n  - From [5], we find that PBNA did not recognize any impairment charges for goodwill in each of the years ended December 26, 2020, December 28, 2019, and December 29, 2018, but there was an impairment charge of $\\S41$ million related to a coconut water brand in PBNA in 2020. This could help explain some discrepancies between the GAAP and non-GAAP measures but does not conclusively explain the differences in growth rates between the two measures.\n  - [8] explains that the non-GAAP measure, 'effective net pricing,' reflects the year-over-year impact of pricing actions and sales incentive activities, mix from varying products, and package sizes. This could be one factor that affects the differences between GAAP and non-GAAP growth rates for PBNA.\n  - Acquisitions and divestitures can also have an impact on both GAAP and non-GAAP growth rates, as seen in image1. However, the impact of acquisitions/divestitures on PBNA was -2% in 2020, as indicated in the table. This means that the PBNA segment saw a contraction in growth due to acquisitions/divestitures.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the available information, we can determine that:\n- In 2020 compared to 2019, PBNA experienced a 4% growth in GAAP measures and a 2% organic growth in non-GAAP measures.\n- Factors that could have affected the discrepancies between GAAP and non-GAAP measures are pricing actions, sales incentive activities, mix from varying products, and package sizes (effective net pricing), and potentially, some ancillary effects from the impairment charge on the coconut water brand in PBNA.\n\n![PBNA saw a 4% increase in GAAP growth and a 2% organic growth in non-GAAP growth from 2019 to 2020, with factors like pricing actions, sales incentive activities, and mix from varying products potentially affecting the disparity between the two measures.](image1)"}

Net cash used in investing activities decreased from 2019 to 2020 [9]\n\nNow, let's interpret these changes based on the financial statements available:\n\n- The increase in net cash used in financing activities is due primarily to higher payments to noncontrolling interests and higher dividends paid, partially offset by debt activity. [4, 6]\n- In operating activities, while net cash provided slightly decreased, excluding unfavorable currency movements, it increased due to higher net earnings and lower working capital requirements, offset by higher cash payments for asset impairment and exit costs. [10]\n- In investing activities, the decrease is due to lower capital expenditures and lower cash collateral posted for derivatives, partially offset by the reduction of cash resulting from deconsolidation of RBH. [9]\n\nThe combined effect of these changes can be observed in the overall cash balance at the end of the year. Here's an interleaved analysis of the impact:\n\n![The cash balance increased due to an increase in operating cash flow, despite a slight decrease in net cash provided by operating activities when currency movements are accounted for, and a decrease in investing and financing activities.)(image4)\n\nIn conclusion, the changes in net cash from operating, investing, and financing activities from 2019 to 2020 led to an overall increase in the cash balance at the end of 2020, despite a slight decrease in net cash provided by operating activities when currency movements are accounted for. The increase in cash balance is due to an increase in operating cash flow, partially offset by decreases in financing and investing activities."}

Toyota sets its operating income target based on sustainable growth [8]. The framework clarifies that the evaluation result should be based on the degree of attainment of the consolidated operating income set in 2011 for Toyota's sustainable growth.\n\nvolatility-of-toyota-s-share-price\nPixel 4: Volatility of Toyota's share price\n\nSecondly, the volatility of Toyota's share price [2, 3, image3] is also accounted for, with a 50% evaluation weight. This indicator helps shareholders and investors assess Toyota's corporate value.\n\nConsolidated remuneration for executives is derived from these performance factors and individual performance evaluations [1, 3, 4]. The total amount of remuneration is further broken down into fixed and performance-linked remuneration [10]. Fixed remuneration is set based on job responsibilities and the remuneration standard of each executive's home country. Performance-based remuneration, on the other hand, is linked to consolidated operating income, the volatility of Toyota's share price, and individual performance [1, 3].\n\n![Remuneration details for directors and audit & supervisory board members](image4)\nPixel 5: Remuneration details for directors and audit & supervisory board members\n\nIn the case of directors and audit & supervisory board members, fixed remuneration is supplemented by bonuses, share-based compensation, and other components.

The increase in dividend per share [image5] and the consistent payout ratio [image5] demonstrate this dedication. Additionally, the total shareholder return [image5] incorporates both dividends and share repurchases, suggesting a holistic approach to returning value to shareholders.\n\nIn conclusion, Toyota's executive remuneration evaluation mirrors both business performance and shareholder value indicators. The assessment framework considers consolidated operating income and the volatility of Toyota's share price, ensuring the executive remuneration is contingent on these important factors. Executive remuneration is then broken down into fixed and performance-linked components, providing incentives for increased performance and shareholder value. Toyota's financial data further supports this dynamic, as increasing dividends, maintaining a consistent payout ratio, and returning value through share repurchases reflect their commitment to shareholders."}

This suggests that the amortisation charge for the Right of Use assets should reflect changes in lease liabilities, as both are directly related.\n\n[5] The Group has recognized the lease liabilities arising from rental renegotiations linked to COVID-19 in the consolidated income statement for the years 2021 and 2020, amounting to €203 million and €317 million, respectively. This indicates that changes in lease liabilities likely affected the amortisation of Right of Use assets as well.\n\n Image response:\n image3 is relevant as it illustrates a breakdown of the Group's assets and liabilities between 01/01/2021 and 31/01/2022, providing some context for the changes in liabilities that influenced amortisation of Right of Use assets.\n\n `![Change in lease liabilities and Right of Use assets](image3)`\n\n [2] With this context in mind, let's now look at the specific changes in amortisation charges for both Right of Use and lease liabilities, as mentioned in quotes [9] and [5]:\n\n According to the detail provided in [9], the amortisation charge for Right of Use assets was €1,454 in 2021 and €1,532 in 2020. This shows a decrease of €78 in amortisation charge for Right of Use assets from 2020 to 2021.\n\n Quote [5] indicates the lease liabilities for 2021 and 2020 were €317 million and €203 million, respectively. This reveals an increase of €114 million in lease liabilities from 2020 to 2021, which should translate into a corresponding increase in the amortisation charge for Right of Use assets, as previously mentioned in [9]. However, the provided data shows a decrease in amortisation charge for Right of Use assets. There might be additional factors at play that have offset the increase in lease liabilities and contributed to the decrease in Right of Use amortisation charges.\n\n In conclusion:\n [4] The amortisation charge for Right of Use assets decreased by €78 from 2020 to 2021. Although lease liabilities increased by €114 million during the same period, the amortisation charge for Right of Use assets decreased, which suggests the presence of other influencing factors that merit further investigation.\n\n `![Amortisation charge for Right of Use assets and lease liabilities](image5)`"}

This upward trend can be partly attributed to the following factors:\n\n1. **Foreign Currency Translation Adjustments**: The 2020 figure reveals a substantial gain of $2,918 million, compared to a loss of $75 million in 2019 and a loss of $632 million in 2018.\n\n2. **Pension and Postretirement Plan Benefit Adjustments**: This component also improved in 2020 with a loss of $147 million, compared to losses of $90 million in 2019 and $13 million in 2018.\n\n3. **Cash flow hedge adjustments**: This item posted a decrease in 2020 with a loss of $72 million, compared to a loss of $113 million in 2019; however, it was a gain in 2018.\n\n4. **Other comprehensive income (loss), net of income taxes**: The 2020 figure shows an improvement at $2,700 million, compared to a loss of $277 million in 2019 and a loss of $646 million in 2018. The decrease in losses for 2020, notably in unrealized gain (loss) on available-for-sale securities, contributed to the improvement.\n\nIn summary, the substantial growth in comprehensive income for Danaher Corporation from 2018 to 2020 can be attributed to favorable foreign currency translation adjustments, a decrease in losses for pension and postretirement plan benefits, and a decrease in cash flow hedge adjustments losses."}

The table shows that in 2021, changes in financial assumptions had a negative impact on the defined benefit obligation, amounting to €26 million, whereas in 2020, it was positive, resulting in an €72 million increase. This implies that, from 2020 to 2021, there was a deterioration in the defined benefit obligation due to changes in financial assumptions.\n\nFor plan assets, we can examine image2, which shows the breakdown of plan assets for the years 2020 and 2021. Although not explicitly stated in the given quotes, the change in the assets' composition or values from 2020 to 2021 might have influenced the overall impact on the plan assets due to the changes in financial assumptions.\n\nTo summarize: Changes in financial assumptions had a significant impact on both the defined benefit obligation and plan assets from 2020 to 2021, with a more negative effect on the defined benefit obligation (€26 million) compared to the positive impact on the defined benefit obligation in 2020 (€72 million).

[We reference Text Quote [5] to understand these RWA categories better.]\n\nFrom Image Quote [3], the changes in various components of Credit Risk RWA are provided, resulting in a total increase of $44,382 million (Standardized) and $56,003 million (Advanced) from December 31, 2019, to December 31, 2020.\n\nSince the risk-based TLAC buffer is a percentage of total RWA, let us first calculate the total RWA for both years, taking into account the changes in RWA categories:\n\nYear 2019 RWA (Standardized): $342,684 million (Initial balance from Image Quote [3]) + $44,382 million (Increase in Credit Risk RWA, Standardized) = $387,066 million\nYear 2020 RWA (Standardized): $228,927 million (Initial balance from Image Quote [3]) + $56,003 million (Increase in Credit Risk RWA, Advanced) = $284,930 million\n\nNow, let's calculate the risk-based TLAC buffer for both years:\n\nYear 2019 Risk-based TLAC buffer (Standardized): 2.5% + our Method 1 G-SIB surcharge + CCyB (if any)\nConsidering we don't have specific data for the user company, let us assume a Method 1 G-SIB surcharge of 0.625% and CCyB of 0.5% for both years.\nYear 2019 Risk-based TLAC buffer (Standardized) = 2.5% + 0.625% + 0.5% = 3.625% of total RWA (Year 2019 RWA = $342,684 million)\n\nYear 2020 Risk-based TLAC buffer (Standardized): 2.5% + 0.625% + 0.5% = 3.625% of total RWA (Year 2020 RWA = $284,930 million)\n\nFrom the calculation, we can see that the risk-based TLAC buffer remains approximately the same from 2019 to 2020, even though the RWA has increased significantly. This increase in RWA doesn't directly affect the External TLAC as a percentage of RWA because the risk-based TLAC buffer is not a percentage of RWA but rather a fixed percentage (3.625%) of the total RWA.\n\nHowever, it's essential to note that this specific example is based on assumptions regarding the Method 1 G-SIB surcharge and CCyB. For a more accurate analysis, specific data regarding the user company's surcharges and CCyB would be needed.\n\nIn conclusion, even though the changes in various components of RWA affected the total RWA, the impact on External TLAC as a percentage of Risk-Weighted Assets from 2019 to 2020 was minimal due to the nature of the risk-based TLAC buffer as a fixed percentage of total RWA.\n\n![Increase in RWA had minimal impact on External TLAC as a % of RWA from 2019 to 2020 due to the fixed percentage nature of risk-based TLAC buffer.](image5)"}

In 2018, franchised margins were $9,039 million, and company-operated margins were $1,747 million. In 2019, these figures increased to $9,455 million and $1,660 million respectively. However, in 2020, a significant decrease was observed in both categories, with franchised margins decreasing to $8,519 million and company-operated margins dropping to $1,158 million.\n\nThis trend suggests a shift in the revenue composition of McDonald's, with franchised margins representing a larger share and company-operated margins showing a decline in 2020 compared to previous years.\n\n![Percentage Changes in Revenue for Macdonald's Segments](image5)\n\nThe table [5] presents percentage changes for different market segments for the years 2020 and 2019, providing a more detailed view of the revenue growth developments for McDonald's U.S. and International Operated Markets segments.\n\n- **U.S.**: The U.S. segment showed a revenue growth rate of 0% in 2020, as compared to a 5% growth in 2019.

Excluding currency translation, the revenue decline was more pronounced at (14)% for 2020 and 8% for 2019.\n\nThe decreased revenue growth for the International Operated Markets segment in 2020 compared to 2019 can be attributed to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, as mentioned in quote [1].

Additional costs incurred on the leased solar energy systems, including labor and overhead, are recorded within solar energy systems under construction.\n\nFrom quote [5], we can see that the total gross property, plant, and equipment under finance leases increased from $\\$2.08$ billion in 2019 to $\\$2.28$ billion in 2020. This increase in gross value is mainly due to the addition of new assets, such as solar energy systems and other properties, but without the impact of accumulated depreciation.\n\nAccumulated depreciation is the total amount of depreciation expense that has been recognized over the life of the assets, and it reduces the gross value of the assets to their net value. In our case, the accumulated depreciation increased from $\\$483$ million in 2019 to $\\$816$ million in 2020, which means that the depreciation expense for the solar energy systems and other properties under finance leases was higher in 2020 compared to 2019.\n\nSo, as a result, the net value (gross value minus accumulated depreciation) of property, plant, and equipment under finance leases decreased from $\\$1.597$ billion (= $\\$2.08$ billion - $\\$483$ million) in 2019 to $\\$1.464$ billion (= $\\$2.28$ billion - $\\$816$ million) in 2020.\n\n![The graph shows the gross value, accumulated depreciation, and net value of property, plant, and equipment under finance leases for the years 2019 and 2020.

Sales of milk products were valued at 10,433 (first column), representing 91.6% of the total sales.\n2. Sales of ice cream were valued at 2,835 (first column), accounting for 8.4% of the total sales.\n\nParticular sales figures by zone are not directly available in this image. However, we can infer the sales of milk products and ice cream for each zone based on the information from text quotes [2], [4], [6], [7], [8], [9], and [10].\n\nFor instance:\n1. Zone AMS, as mentioned in text quote [2], reported sales in the U.S. and Canada totaling CHF 24,763 for milk products and ice cream. However, it doesn't give detailed breakdowns for these two categories.\n2. Zone EMENA, as described in text quote [6] and [9], did not make any direct mentions of ice cream sales. Given the rare mention of ice cream, it might be safe to assume that its sales contribution is relatively smaller compared to milk products.\n\nUnfortunately, the text quotes do not provide the sales figures of milk products and ice cream for each zone separately. I recommend evaluating the provided text quotes and using them to further infer the sales and operating profits for milk products and ice cream across different zones.\n\nFor the operating profits, let's take a look at text quote [5], which detailed the Zone’s underlying trading operating profit margin increased by 40 basis points. However, it does not provide specific figures for milk products and ice cream. As for the text quotes [1] and [4], they did mention that trading operating profit margins for their respective zones increased. But, they do not provide any figures related directly to milk products and ice cream.\n\nIn summary, this information suggests that the sales of milk products are generally higher than that of ice cream across all zones, even though specific figures by zone for each category are not available. Operating profit margins have increased for various zones but do not offer specifics for milk products and ice cream. To gain more details, one should refer to further reports and focus on the available information in text and image quotes that directly address milk products and ice cream sales for each zone.\n\n![Comparison of Milk Products and Ice Cream Sales Across Zones](image1)"}

This is primarily due to the decline in interest expense, leading to a broader net interest income (NII) margin (measured by the difference between net interest income and interest expense), which favors the organization’s profitability. Additionally, other factors like net fee income, net income from financial instruments, net insurance premium income, other operating income, and changes in expense categories (e.g., operating expenses, impairment of goodwill, and taxes) might have also contributed to the overall profitability improvement but need further examination.\n\n![The changes in net interest income and interest expense from 2019 to 2020 led to a narrower net interest margin, resulting in an overall improvement of the organization's profitability, as shown in the following table.](image2)"}

These increases were partially offset by lower compensation associated with carried interest.\n\nWe can observe from this text quote that in 2020, total recognized compensation expenses reached $\\S20,854$ million, which represents an $11\\%$ increase from the prior year.\n\nNow, let me interleave image [3] to help visualize the trend over the years 2018, 2019, and 2020:\n\n- **Deferred cash-based awards:**\n  - 2020: $\\mathbf{1,263}$ million\n  - 2019: $\\mathbf{1,233}$ million\n  - 2018: $\\mathbf{1,174}$ million\n\nThe chart shows that the total recognized compensation expenses increased from 2018 to 2019 and continued to increase in 2020. Between 2018 and 2020, the compensation expenses rose by approximately $\\mathbf{99}$ million, which aligns with the $11\\%$ increase mentioned in text quote [5].\n\nNext, we will use image [5] to examine the distribution of the compensation expenses across different business segments in 2020:\n\n- **Institutional Securities:** $\\mathbf{851}$ million\n- **Wealth Management:** $\\mathbf{1,000}$ million\n- **Investment Management:** $\\mathbf{268}$ million\n\nCombining these figures, the total recognized compensation expense in 2020 was $\\mathbf{2,119}$ million — the same as what we found in text quote [5].

For a better comparison, let's focus on the changes in deferred tax assets that are related to the uncertain tax positions.\n\n Text quote [6] provides a breakdown of stock compensation, which includes the \"Excess tax benefit for stock compensation,\" amongst other items. In 2020, the excess tax benefit for stock compensation was $\\$2$ million. However, we don't have the 2019 value for this item in the provided quotes. Thus, we can't compare this component between 2019 and 2020.\n\nText quote [8] shows that valuation allowances decreased $\\$1$ million in 2020.

In 2020, the total deferred tax assets (before valuation allowance) were $\\$645$ million, and the liabilities for uncertain tax positions were $\\S89$ million. Subtracting the liabilities from the assets gives us the deferred tax assets related to uncertain tax positions, which is $\\$556$ million in 2020.\n\nSimilarly, in 2019, the total deferred tax assets (before valuation allowance) were $\\$662$ million, and the liabilities for uncertain tax positions were $\\S303$ million. Subtracting the liabilities from the assets gives us the deferred tax assets related to uncertain tax positions, which is $\\$359$ million in 2019.\n\nTo clarify, the changes in deferred tax assets related to uncertain tax positions between 2019 and 2020 were approximately $\\$197$ million. Compared with the total deferred tax assets (before valuation allowance), this represents a decrease of approximately $\\$47$ million between 2019 and 2020.\n\nIn summary, the changes in tax positions and related components had a significant impact on the net deferred tax asset between 2019 and 2020. Specifically, the decrease in the deferred tax assets related to uncertain tax positions was around $\\$197$ million, as compared to the total deferred tax assets (before valuation allowance), this represented a decrease of approximately $\\$47$ million between 2019 and 2020.\n\n![Net Deferred Tax Asset Changes](image2)"}

However, the company's focus on research and development, as discussed in [3], could possibly account for the high general and administrative expenses, since a large portion of those costs includes salaries for research and development personnel and related expenses.\n\n![The following table displays the cost of revenues for the years 2019, 2020, and 2021:](image2)\n\nOne key aspect to consider is the cost of revenues, which primarily involves service costs.

This change could be related to external costs the company has had to bear (e.g., third-party service providers) as a result of its growth and expansion.\n\n![The following table provides a breakdown of our operating expenses for the years 2019, 2020, and 2021.](image3)\n\nOverall, the company's financial management exhibits a focus on managing selling and marketing expenses while maintaining general and administrative expenses.

These indicators can offer valuable insights about consumer behavior.\n\n[3] Average loans increased $\\S14.9$ billion to $\\S310.4$ billion primarily driven by an increase in residential mortgages and PPP loans, partially offset by a decline in credit cards. This suggests that during the period, consumers were more inclined to secure home loans or PPP loans, while a decrease in credit card loans was observed.\n\n[4] At December 31, 2020, 97 percent of the credit card portfolio was managed in Consumer Banking, with the remainder in GWIM. Outstandings in the credit card portfolio decreased $\\S18.9$ billion to $\\Updownarrow78.7$ billion due to lower retail spending and higher payments. This decrease shows that consumers may have reduced their credit card usage during the year.\n\nIn terms of home equity, [9] the home equity portfolio decreased $\\S5.9$ billion in 2020 primarily due to paydowns outpacing new originations and draws on existing lines. People might have been focusing on paying down their existing home equity loans, indicating improved financial stability or reduced confidence in property market growth.\n\nMoving on to image2, we can observe that:\n\n- The gross interest yield for total credit card decreased from 10.76% in 2019 to 10.27% in 2020. Lower yields suggest decreased spending on credit cards or lower interest rates.\n- The risk-adjusted margin also experienced a decrease, from 8.28% in 2019 to 9.16% in 2020, indicating lower profits for credit card operations.\n- The number of new accounts decreased from 4,320 in 2019 to 2,505 in 2020, indicating fewer consumers opening credit cards during the year.\n- Purchase volumes declined from $\\S277,852$ in 2019 to $\\S251,599$ in 2020, suggesting overall reduced spending on credit cards.\n\nIn summary, the total credit card and home equity metrics show a noticeable change between 2019 and 2020. The decline in credit card metrics and home equity suggests consumers might have been more cautious with their spending and borrowing during the year, potentially driven by low retail spending, increased payments, and the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on consumer behavior."}

Here's a breakdown of the content:\n\n...\n\n6. **Net Income:**\n   - Net income is $\\$7,264$  million for 2020, $\\$7,842$   million for 2019, and $\\$8,394$   million for 2018.\n\nComparing net income numbers from the textual and visual evidence, it can be deduced that net income slightly decreased from 2018 to 2019, and then lowered further in 2020.\n\nRegarding Comprehensive Income, we can find a clear demonstration in image1:\n\nimage1 is described as: The table displays financial data for the years 2020, 2019, and 2018. Here's a breakdown:\n\n...\n\n- **Comprehensive Income:**\n   - 2020: $\\$6,807$\n   - 2019: $\\$8,083$\n   - 2018: $\\$8,313$\n\nFrom this information, it's evident that Comprehensive Income increased from 2018 to 2019 and then decreased slightly in 2020.\n\nIn summary, the combined analysis of text and image evidence shows that the company's Comprehensive Income experienced a decrease from 2018 to 2020, while Net Income gradually decreased from 2018 to 2020. This trend suggests potential financial challenges faced by the company over the years in question, which aligns with the general economic downturn during the same period. More detailed analysis would be required to fully understand the causes and potential implications of these changes on the company's financial performance and future prospects.\n\n![The table demonstrates a decrease in net income and comprehensive income from 2018 to 2020.](image5)"}

On October 12, 2021, an additional $10.0 billion authorization was announced, bringing the total repurchase authority to $40.0 billion. Since September 26, 2021, the company repurchased and retired 5.4 million shares of common stock for $703 million, as per text quote [4].\n\nNow, let's look at the image quote discussing the stock repurchase program and dividends for the years 2021 and 2020 (image2). From the data shown, it is apparent that the company repurchased fewer shares in 2021 compared to 2020 (24 versus 31 shares), but the average price paid per share increased from $141.17 in 2021 to $79.32 in 2020. The total amount spent on stock repurchases in 2021 was $6,374, significantly higher than the $5,332 spent in 2020.\n\nMoving on to the financial data comparing the fiscal years ending September 26, 2021, and September 27, 2020 (image1), we can find the information related to changes in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities (Assets and Liabilities section). As mentioned in the text quotes, the net increase in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities was primarily due to various factors, including cash outflows related to share repurchases. According to the image, the increase in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities from 2020 to 2021 was $1,165 million.\n\nIn summation, the company's cash and stock repurchase activities increased from 2020 to 2021, with the company spending more on stock repurchases and experiencing an increase in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities."}

The capital expenditures decreased in 2020, as shown in [3], primarily due to lower reinvestment in existing restaurants as a result of COVID-19. This is further corroborated in [4], where we can see that McDonald's owned approximately 55% of the land and 80% of the buildings for restaurants in its consolidated markets.\n\n![McDonald's Capital Expenditures as a Percentage of Total Assets](image8)\n\nIn [8], we can find that total assets increased by $\\S5.1$ billion or 11% in 2020.

Other categories seem to have stayed relatively consistent. However, keep in mind that this is an estimation as we do not have explicit evidence for CMB's complaint categories in 2020.\n\nIn 2020, the private bank (mentioned in text quote [9]) revealed that administration, servicing issues, and complaints linked to product and performance as well as advice and suitability were higher than in the previous year.

To do that, we can refer to the same quotes, but particularly focus on the segment net revenues for each segment, i.e., Activision, Blizzard, and King:\n\n- Activision: [1] mentions a decrease in 2019 as compared to 2018, so we'll use 2018 numbers. The net deferred revenues recognized from Activision were $3,729 million.\n- Blizzard: [3] mentions an increase in 2019, so we can't use 2018 numbers to compare; however, we can find that in 2018, the net deferred revenues recognized from Blizzard were $2,527 million.\n- King: The specific net revenues for King were not provided in the text quotes, but we can observe that, in 2018, the total segment net revenues for Activision Blizzard were $7,262 million (as mentioned earlier), and by subtracting the net revenues for Activision ($3,729 million) and Blizzard ($2,527 million), we find that King had segment net revenues of $(305) million in 2018.\n\nIn summary, the total segment net revenue for Activision Blizzard in 2018 was $7,262 million, with Activision contributing $3,729 million, Blizzard contributing $2,527 million, and King contributing $(305) million.\n\n![Activision Blizzard's segment net revenues in 2018](image2)\n\nIn addition to the text analysis, the table provided in image2 gives a summary of the segment net revenues for Activision Blizzard in 2018.

Comparing these amounts, the valuation allowance increased by $\\S100$ from 2021 to 2022.\n\nTo determine its impact on net deferred tax assets, we need to understand that deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated based on deferred tax benefits and liabilities. The valuation allowance is created when the company believes that deferred tax assets may not be realized in the future. In this case, the higher valuation allowance in 2022 indicates a lower expectation of realizing deferred tax assets, which could reduce the net deferred tax assets (although it won't directly affect the effective tax rate, as mentioned in quote [4]). However, without further information about the specific deferred tax assets and the amount of unrealized tax benefits, we can't provide a precise calculation of the impact on net deferred tax assets.\n\nIn terms of visualizing this information, we don't have specific data that matches the provided images.

In LATAM, contributing factors could be tax increases, pandemic-related restrictions, and down-trading to cheaper brands produced by local manufacturers. The increase in HTU sales in both regions may be due to their perceived lower risk compared to traditional cigarettes and increasing global market penetration.

Since we know the U.S. downstream earnings incorporates such revenue, we can consider the increase in revenue from 2020 to 2021 as one of the positive factors offsetting the effects of lower margins on refined product sales and higher operating expenses.\n\nTo summarize, the earnings of the U.S. downstream segment changed from a loss of $\\\\S571$ million in 2020 to earnings of $\\\\S2.4$ billion in 2021 due to a combination of increased revenue and positive contributions from 50%-owned CPChem and higher sales volumes, partially offset by factors like lower margins on refined product sales and higher operating expenses.\n\n![The table in image 2 shows an increase in revenue between 2020 and 2021, indicating a positive contribution to the change in U.S. downstream earnings.](image2)\n\nFor further insights, you might want to check the \"Consolidated Statement of Income\" section on pages 39 and 40 of the company’s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of variances between 2020 and 2919, and look into the reasons for lower margins on refined product sales and higher operating expenses in 2021."}

Factors contributing to this improvement may include higher sales volumes, lower spending levels due to the pandemic, cost savings from productivity initiatives, and the impact of foreign currency exchange rates in 2020. However, keep in mind that this increase in operating profit as a percentage of sales does not necessarily mean that the absolute operating profit also increased. The actual increase in operating profit can only be determined by comparing the absolute operating profit figures between the years.\n\n![Operating profit increased from 19.0% in 2018 to 19.4% in 2020, indicating improved efficiency in translating sales into operating profit.](image4)"}

The first quote states net gains recognized during fiscal 2020 were primarily driven by unrealized gains recognized on privately held equity securities of $\\S208$  million and unrealized gains recognized on publicly traded securities of $\\S138$  million [1], while the net unrealized gains recognized in fiscal 2020 for strategic investments still held as of January 31, 2020 were $\\S290$  million [10].\n\nIn [1], the combined gain on strategic investments for privately and publicly held securities in fiscal 2020 was $\\S346$  million ($\\S208$  + $\\S138$), while in [10], the net unrealized gains for strategic investments still held at the end of fiscal 2020 was $\\S290$  million. This suggests a change of $\\S56$  million (346 - 290 = 56) from 2019 to 2020, however, it's essential to note that the exact fiscal year is not specified for the net unrealized gains in [10], but it seems reasonable to assume it refers to fiscal 2020.\n\nRegarding 'Other expense,' we have information on it in [4], [6] and [8]. In [6], the company recognized stock-based expense related to its equity plans for employees and non-employee directors of $\\S1.8$  billion in fiscal 2020 [6], and as of January 31, 2020, the aggregate stock compensation remaining to be recognized to costs and expenses was approximately $\\S4.0$  billion [6].

Unfortunately, there is no direct evidence to compare the 'Other expense' of the two fiscal years from the provided text or image quotes. The changes in other financial items like employee-related costs, transaction costs, and stock-based expense might provide indirect insight into why the overall 'Other expense' changed, but concrete comparisons are not evident in the given information.\n\n`Here's a direct answer to your question: The 'Gains on strategic investments, net' decreased by $\\S56$  million from fiscal year 2019 to 2020.

However, India, Japan, and South Korea show changes in the number of stores in 2022 compared to 2021.\n\nNow, let's discuss possible reasons for these changes:\n\n1. **Covid-19 pandemic**: [10] states that the pandemic heavily affected the majority of markets where Inditex operated in 2020. The company absorbed 578 stores in 2021 [4], which might have been a part of the strategy to mitigate the pandemic's impact on stores.\n\n2. **Store optimization and streamlining**: Inditex continued optimizing stores in 2021, with 226 openings and 130 refurbishments [4], including 57 enlargements. The streamlining of stores was focused on stores at the end of their useful life, especially those in the younger formats, aiming to recuperate sales in local stores and online. This strategy might contribute to the differences in the number of stores across some regions.\n\n3. **Acquisitions and expansion**: Inditex may have made some acquisitions or expanded its presence into new markets in 2022, which could explain an increase in the number of stores in some regions. However, no text quote discusses acquisitions happening during 2022.

The audit opinion clearly states that the financial statements present the financial position of UnitedHealth Group fairly in all material respects, conforming to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP).\n\n![UnitedHealth Group's Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income spanning three years] (image3)\n\nAccording to the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income, UnitedHealth Group's net earnings for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018 were $15,769 million, $14,239 million, and $12,382 million, respectively. There was an increase in net earnings from 2018 to 2019, followed by another increase from 2019 to 2020, demonstrating a positive trend in the company's financial performance over the three-year period.\n\nThe primary factors influencing changes in net earnings for UnitedHealth Group during this period can be found in the detailed financial data presented in [image2]. Premium revenues, which is the primary source of revenue for the company, significantly increased from $178,087 million in 2018 to $201,478 million in 2020. While operating costs, such as medical costs, also increased, they grew at a slower pace than premium revenues, contributing to the year-over-year increase in net earnings.\n\n![UnitedHealth Group's Annual Revenue, Operating Costs, and Earnings Breakdown] (image2)\n\n![UnitedHealth Group's Comprehensive Income Overview] (image3)\n\nIn addition to net earnings, the company also reports comprehensive income, which incorporates other comprehensive (loss) income [1]. The comprehensive income for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018 were $15,167 million, $14,421 million, and $10,469 million, respectively. Comparing the comprehensive income figures to net earnings reveals that there is a minor disparity between the two, primarily due to the effect of unrealized gains or losses on investment securities, foreign currency translation, and reclassification adjustments [image3].\n\nIn summary, UnitedHealth Group's net earnings and comprehensive income have increased from 2018 to 2020. The main factors contributing to these increases include growth in premium revenues and effective management of operating costs, as well as gains on investment securities, foreign currency translation, and reclassification adjustments. These factors combined have driven the company's financial performance over the three-year period."}

[4] Interest and fees on loans and certain investment income is directly attributable to the segment in which it is reported. Interest expense represents an allocated funding cost based on a combination of segment funding requirements and internal funding rates. This paragraph hints that changes in loan balances might have affected the net interest yield.\n\n[8] Marketing and business development expense is included in each segment based on the actual expenses incurred. Global brand advertising is primarily allocated to the segments based on the relative levels of revenue. Rewards and Card Member services expenses are included in each segment based on the actual expenses incurred. This suggests that marketing efforts could have indirectly influenced the revolving loan balances.\n\n[4] Interest income decreased, primarily due to a decline in the interest yield on average Card Member loans driven by higher paydown rates on revolving loan balances. This confirms that the interest yield on average Card Member loans has decreased, which is the main concern in your question.\n\nTo provide a visual context, let's review the data from image4:\n\n[Image4 Conclusion]\nThis table shows that the net interest yield on average Card Member loans decreased from 11.1% in 2019 to 10.7% in 2020 and further to 10.2% in 2021.\n\n![Table showing net interest yield on average Card Member loans from 2019-2021](image4)\n\nThe major factors influencing this change were likely the higher paydown rates on revolving loan balances [4] and, to a lesser extent, changes in the overall funding costs [1]. It is also possible that marketing efforts might have indirectly contributed to the change in loan balances [8]. Nonetheless, without additional context, it is difficult to determine the exact impact of marketing efforts on loan balances."}

For Prolia, the deceleration of demand during 2020 affected the timing of patients receiving their doses and stalled the diagnosis of osteoporosis in new patients. As a result, historical demand patterns may continue to be impacted by the pandemic for both products.\n\nMoreover, ENBREL faced biosimilar competition, which negatively impacted its net selling price and unit demand, while Prolia's sales increased due to favorable changes in inventory and net selling price.\n\nIn conclusion, the sales performance of ENBREL and Prolia changed over the years, with ENBREL experiencing a decrease, and Prolia seeing an increase.

In 2018, the net cash used in investing activities was $222 million [6, reference 4].\n\nThis amount includes all investing activities, such as acquisitions and other investments, but we are interested in the capital expenditure for PP&E. Since no detailed breakdown is provided for the components of investing activities, we cannot determine the exact amount spent on PP&E. However, we can see that the net cash used in investing activities excludes this figure, so the capital expenditure for PP&E would be a positive amount larger than $222 million.\n\nAlternatively, we can find an estimate of capital expenditure in the income statement provided in Image5. The section \"Research, Development, and Related Expenses\" includes costs related to improving or modifying manufacturing processes (e.g., pollution control devices). These expenses are indicative of capital improvements, so we can use them as an indirect measure for capital expenditures [8, reference 3].\n\nSince this expense constituted approximately 63% of 3M's capital spending in 2018, let's take the Research, Development, and Related Expenses amount for 2018 ($1,821 million) and multiply it by 1.63 (the inverse of 0.63) to estimate the total capital expenditure amount.\n\n1,821 million * 1.63 ≈  $2,933 million\n\nThis estimate may not be precise due to differences in the nature of the expenses categorized under Research, Development, and Related Expenses and the capital expenditure for PP&E.

In response to the question about the income tax paid in 2020 by Lovisa Holdings, we can refer to quote [5] which mentions the net cash from operating activities for the financial year, but not directly states the income tax paid. However, quote [5] does show the Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) for the financial year, which can be used to infer the income tax paid.\n\n2. To compute the income taxes paid, we first need to calculate the Earnings Before Tax (EBT) by subtracting the finance expenses from the EBIT. Click `![2020 Earnings Before Tax](image3)` to get the EBT for the year 2020 (ignoring the impairment charges as they are non-cash items).\n\n3. The income tax expense is typically computed as taxes owed depending on the effective tax rate, which varies based on many factors such as jurisdictions and exemptions. However, we can find the income tax expense in the financial statement in quote [5]. Unfortunately, this expense only includes the tax deduction that part of the dividend faced due to its deferral. If we need to find the actual income tax expense for the whole year, we would require further information such as the taxable income and tax rates.\n\n4. However, as asked, the income tax paid in 2020 can be indirectly found from the deferred dividend tax deduction mentioned in quote [5]; the net cash from operating activities number subtracted from the deferred tax liabilities (given in `![Income Tax Liabilities on 28 June 2020](image1)`) gives -$3,893,000, representing the tax deduction due to the deferral of the dividend. To find the income tax paid in the year, we would have to calculate the income tax expense for the whole year, which we do not have enough information to do.\n\n**Conclusion**: The information asked is not directly provided in the financial statements. Indirectly, the income tax paid can be inferred but would require further calculations and assumptions, which is beyond the scope of the provided quotes."}

Net interest yield on a fully taxable-equivalent (FTE) basis decreased 53 basis points (bps) to 1.90 percent for 2020. The decrease in net interest income was primarily driven by lower interest rates, partially offset by reduced deposit and funding costs, the deployment of excess deposits into securities and an additional day of interest accrual. Assuming continued economic improvement and based on the forward interest rate curve as of January 19, 2021, when we announced quarterly and annual results for the periods ended December 31, 2020, we expect net interest income to be higher in the second half of 2021 as compared to both the second half of 2020 and the first half of 2021. For more information on net interest yield and the FTE basis, see Supplemental Financial Data on page 54, and for more information on interest rate risk management, see Interest Rate Risk Management for the Banking Book on page 105.\n\nFrom the excerpt above, it's clear that net interest income had a decrease from 2019 to 2020, specifically by $\\S5.5$ billion. Furthermore, the decrease was primarily attributed to lower interest rates.

Quote [4] explains the different categories of fees: Audit Fees, Audit-related Fees, and Other Fees.\n\nUnfortunately, we don't have specific data on Audit-related Fees for all years in the text quotes. For a comprehensive comparison of total service fees, we can use the information in quotes [1], [4], and [10] to gather the fees for Audit Fees, Other Fees, and service costs.\n\nIn 2019, the Audit Fees were [9] (amount not provided), Other Fees were [4] RMB 2,690, and service costs were RMB 16,761 million according to [10]. To find the total service fees for 2019, we can sum up these figures: RMB (16,761 + 2,690) = RMB 19,451\n\nIn 2020, the Audit Fees were RMB 16,000 (not specified in the quotes but assumed to be the same as 2019), Other Fees were RMB 880 (from [4]), and service costs were RMB 17,478 million (from [10]). The total service fees for 2020 would be RMB (16,000 + 880 + 17,478) = RMB 34,566\n\nIn 2021, the Audit Fees were RMB 17,500, Other Fees were RMB 1,800 (from [4]), and service costs increased to RMB 18,992 million (from [10]). The total service fees for 2021 would be RMB (17,500 + 1,800 + 18,992) = RMB 37,492\n\nSo, the total service fees increased from RMB 19,451 in 2019 to 34,566 in 2020 and then to RMB 37,492 in 2021.

Calculate the total Current Liabilities for 31/01/2022 (excluding trade and other payables). This gives us 8,030 (Total Current Liabilities) - Lease liability (1,562) - Income tax payable (211) - Other financial liabilities (22). This equals 6,255.\n2. Subtract the total Current Liabilities for 31/01/2021 (excluding trade and other payables), which gives us 6,338 (Total Current Liabilities) - (Lease liability for 31/01/2021 + Income tax payable for 31/01/2021 + Other financial liabilities for 31/01/2021). This equals 6,139.\n3.

The STI comprises a bonus ([3], image2), while the LTI is composed of Stock-Settled Appreciation Rights (S-SARs) and Restricted Stock Units (RSUs) ([3], image3).\n\nNow, for the difference in bonus remuneration:\n\nThe bonus for the Board of Directors (BoD), specifically the Chairman (C), is in the form of blocked non-voting equity securities/shares for 10 years ([4], [5]). In contrast, the bonuses for the Corporate Executive Committee (CEC) are in cash form for other members, while the Chairman of the Corporate Executive Committee receives blocked non-voting equity securities/shares similar to the BoD ([5], image4).\n\nFurthermore, image1 illustrates three options for the distribution of LTI components (S-SARs and RSUs). While it does not specify whom these options are for, we can infer that the bonuses for the BoD and CEC might be determined based on these distribution options, although more specific information is needed to confirm this.\n\nIn summary, the main difference in bonus remuneration is that the bonuses for the Board of Directors, including the Chairman, are in blocked non-voting equity securities/shares for 10 years, while the bonuses for the Corporate Executive Committee are in cash or possibly blocked non-voting equity securities/shares based on chosen distribution options (image1).\n\nTo facilitate better visual understanding, consider the following image citation:\n\n![The Bonus remuneration for the Board of Directors is delivered as blocked non-voting equity securities/shares, whereas Corporate Executive Committee bonuses are in cash form or potentially blocked non-voting equity securities/shares based on chosen distribution options](image4)"}

Since the question asks for the distribution of workforce, we can infer that the total workforce count is approximately 345,900 + 10,500 + 18,900 = **365,300** employees, but the breakdown of these numbers into wholly owned, less-than-wholly owned, and complementary categories is not explicitly provided.\n\nFor the interleaved response, let me supply some relevant information and a summary image that may help contextualize IBM's total workforce numbers:\n\n> IBM employs a global workforce of highly skilled professionals with a focus on cloud, AI, quantum computing, cybersecurity, and industry-specific solutions ([1]). The company attracts, develops, engages, and retains talent through its transformation and learning initiatives, hiring over 30,000 individuals in 2020 alone ([3]). However, the specific distribution of workforce across wholly owned, less-than-wholly owned, and complementary subsidiary categories remains unclear from the given information.\n\nTo illustrate this information, I'll provide the following figure:\n\n![IBM Total Workforce; Approx. 365,300 Employees, Global Presence] (image5)\n\nDespite not having exact data on the specific distribution of IBM's workforce, we can infer that it employs approximately 365,300 individuals worldwide."}

Unfortunately, we don't have the stock prices for these years in the provided text or images. To find the market cap, we would need the stock prices on both December 31, 2020, and December 31, 2018.\n\nTo illustrate the market cap calculation with available data, let's assume a closing stock price for 2019 of $30.00 (from [image3]). We can calculate the market capitalization for that year:\n\n* Market cap in 2019: 9,443 million (total shares) × $30.00 (stock price) = $\\textbf{283,290,000,000}$.\n\nNow, let's compare the market capitalization for 2018 and 2019, since the data for 2020 is not available:\n\n* Market cap in 2018: 10,237 million (total shares) × ?

This shows an improvement in this area from 2020 to 2021, as the gain in 2021 was higher than the losses in 2020.\n\nTo further understand this, let's refer to image2, which shows the breakdown of Comprehensive Income for the years 2021, 2020, and 2019. You can see that the figure for \"Currency translation adjustments, net of deferred taxes\" is a loss of $(664) in 2021, compared to gains of $\\S1,213 in 2020. This further strengthens our observation that there was an improvement in currency translation adjustments from 2020 to 2021.\n\nNow, to understand the effect on comprehensive income, it's important to note that comprehensive income is the sum of a company's net income and other comprehensive income items (such as currency translation adjustments). From the information provided, we can see an increase in comprehensive income from 2020 to 2021, as the gains in 2021 were higher than the losses in 2020. In particular:\n\n- Comprehensive income in 2020 was $\\S11,598$.\n- The gain from currency translation adjustments in 2021 was $\\S760$ million.\n- Comprehensive income in 2021 can be approximated as $\\S11,598 + \\S760 = \\$12,358$.\n\nThis shows that the change in currency translation adjustments from 2020 to 2021 had a positive effect on Comcast's comprehensive income, increasing it by approximately $\\$760$ million.\n\n[![Currency translation adjustments improved, affecting comprehensive income](image2)](image2)"}

Craig Jelinek, President, Chief Executive Officer and Director of the Company, certify, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. Section 1350, as adopted pursuant to Section 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, that:\n[6] In connection with the Annual Report of Costco Wholesale Corporation (the Company) on Form 10-K for the year ended August 29, 2021, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the Report), I, Richard A. Galanti, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Director of the Company, certify, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. Section 1350, as adopted pursuant to Section 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, that:\n\nFirst, we can see that both W. Craig Jelinek and Richard A. Galanti are executive officers at Costco. Looking at the text quote [5], W. Craig Jelinek's age is not explicitly mentioned, but considering that Richard A. Galanti, who has been an executive officer since 1993 [6], is 65 according to a separate image quote [image5], it is relatively safe to assume that W. Craig Jelinek is older than Richard A. Galanti, as he has been an executive officer since 1995 and is listed as President and CEO [1, 9].\n\nNow, referring to the relevant image quote [image5], we can see the details of several Costco executives, including their positions, years they became executive officers, and ages. Since we've established that W. Craig Jelinek is older, we should be able to find the youngest executive officer in the list. From the table, we can see that Yoram Rubanenko (Executive Vice President, Northeast and Southeast Regions) became an executive officer in 2021, and his age is 57. As there are no other executives in the table with a younger age, it can be concluded that Yoram Rubanenko is the youngest executive officer at Costco.\n\nTo tie it all together, here's the interleaved response:\n\nAfter taking a closer look at the provided text and image quotes, we can conclude that the youngest executive officer at Costco is Yoram Rubanenko, who took on his role as Executive Vice President, Northeast and Southeast Regions in 2021 [image5] and is 57 years old [same as image5].\n\n![Yoram Rubanenko, the youngest executive officer at Costco, is 57 years old and works as the Executive Vice President, Northeast and Southeast Regions.](image5)"}

If necessary, changes are recognized in the period in which the estimate is revised [10]. Despite the uncertainties inherent in Novo Nordisk's business activities, management considers the key accounting estimates, including US sales deductions and provisions for sales rebates, to be reasonable and appropriate based on currently available information [10]. However, the actual amounts may differ from the amounts estimated as more detailed information becomes available [10].\n\nOverall, the high estimation risk associated with US sales deductions and provisions for sales rebates warrants careful attention and ongoing assessment by management as Novo Nordisk continues to navigate the dynamic US healthcare environment."}

Notably, growth in net sales has been strong in some regions like the Rest of Europe and Americas, while non-current assets have increased in all regions but decreased slightly in Asia and the rest of the world. The growth in net sales can be attributed to strong consumer demand and the positive impact of online sales, while the increase in non-current assets indicates investments in assets to support business expansion."}

This information can be visually observed in image4, where the total for August 28, 2022, in Section 4, which represents net income per common share, is $\\S43,519$.\n\nComparing this to August 29, 2021 (the previous year), the total in Section 4 from image4 was $\\S41,190$. A calculation reveals this amount represents $\\mathbb{S}11.19$ per diluted share, a decrease compared to the next fiscal year.\n\nFurthermore, the text quote [1] mentions net income for 2021 was $\\S5.8$ billion, or $\\mathbb{S}13.14$ per diluted share. This is consistent with the data from image4 for August 29, 2021.\n\nOverall, Costco's net income per common share increased from $\\mathbb{S}11.19$ in 2021 to $\\mathbb{S}13.14$ in 2022, representing an approximate 17% increase. For a visual reference, you can see the graph comparing cumulative total shareholder return in image9, which shows the general upward trend in Costco's performance over the three years.\n\n`![Costco's net income per common share increased by approximately 17% over the three years ending August 2022.](image9)`"}

In 2020, net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble were $\\S13,027$ million. In the subsequent year, 2021, this figure increased to $\\S14,306$ million. However, it's worth noting a more substantial increase in 2022 with net earnings of $\\S14,742$ million. This demonstrates a positive trend in Procter & Gamble's net earnings attributable to the company over these three years.\n\nIn [this table (image5) summarizing the balance sheet], the corresponding net earnings for the years 2022 and 2021 are $\\S14,742$ million and $\\S14,306$ million, respectively, which align with the graphical representation seen in image1. This further supports the calculation result, confirming that Procter & Gamble's Net Earnings Attributable to the company have indeed increased from 2020 to 2022.\n\nIn summary, Procter & Gamble's Net Earnings Attributable to the company increased from $\\S13,027$ million in 2020 to $\\S14,306$ million in 2021, and further to $\\S14,742$ million in 2022.

This decrease is primarily due to a decrease in Retained Earnings, which went from $11,881 million in 2020 to $11,495 million in 2021. This suggests that the company's earnings were lower or there were increases in expenses or payouts to shareholders in 2021 compared to 2020.\n\n![Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) Breakdown](image4)\n\nThe Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) also shows a significant decrease, from $(2,895) million in 2020 to $(2,945) million in 2021. This decrease is attributed to a higher net unrealized pension and other postretirement benefits in 2021 compared to 2020, and a lower net unrealized debt securities gain in 2021 compared to 2020.\n\nIn summary, the changes in shareholders' equity between 2020 and 2021, especially with regards to retained earnings and other comprehensive income, indicate a decrease in the company's overall equity position. This decrease suggests that the company's earnings have either reduced or that there have been increases in expenses or payouts to shareholders, resulting in a lower net income. The decrease in the Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) is due to changes in the components that make up this figure."}

According to quote [9], the Group’s net cash flow from operating activities, adjusted to remove the impact of AASB 16, was ₵$48.6m for the financial year ended June 2020.\n\n`![The net cash flow from operating activities is visualized as a credit balance in the consolidated cash flow statement, depicting an inflow of cash for the company.] (image5)`\n\nRegarding changes in retained earnings, quote [3] indicates that retained earnings are profits that have been retained in the company rather than distributed as dividends. With the inflow of cash from operating activities, the company records a net increase in its retained earnings, thereby contributing to the increase in total equity over the period.\n\nIn image3, we can see that the component \"Retained Earnings\" under Total Equity increases from $43,352 to $58,368 between July 2018 to June 2020. This increase confirms the contribution of cash flows from operating activities and changes in retained earnings towards the growth in the company's total equity.\n\nTo summarize, the cash flow from operating activities and changes in retained earnings positively affected the total equity from July 2018 to June 2020.

However, subsequent quotes [2] and [6] do provide some insight.\n\n[2] mentions the company’s after-tax ROIC from continuing operations, which is a metric that management believes measures the capital-allocation effectiveness over time. The marginal company-operated margins can be approximated from the ROIC by calculating the difference between the operating income (from the table in [2]) and accounting for the corresponding tax rate. Using this method, we can see that the company-operated margins in 2018 were approximately 20%, in 2019 were 19.2%, and in 2020 were 14.9%.\n\n[6] presents the operating margin percent, which is the operating income as a percent of total revenues. Excluding certain items, the operating margin in 2020 was 36.7%, in 2019 was 42.8%, and a comparison between these figures suggests that there was a decrease in company-operated margins from 2019 to 2020.\n\nRegarding the impact of currency translation on company-operated margins, [2] shows the currency translation benefits or costs for the different components of margins (company-operated, franchised, selling, general & administrative expenses, and operating income). However, it's not straightforward to isolate the impact on company-operated margins specifically.\n\nNow, let's consider the image quotes to find the relevant information. In [image1], we see that the company-operated margins for the years 2018, 2019, and 2020 are 1,747, 1,660, and 1,158, respectively. As the text quotes and [image1] both indicate a decrease in company-operated margins from 2019 to 2020, it is likely that the currency translation impact was insignificant compared to other factors causing the reduction in margins.\n\nIn summary, the company-operated margins decreased from 2018 to 2020, as shown by both text quotes [2] and [6] and image [image1]. It appears that the currency translation impact was not the primary factor contributing to the decrease in company-operated margins.\n\n![Decrease in company-operated margins](image1)"}

Additionally, the expected cost is primarily due to changes in assumptions causing higher interest cost in 2022 as a result of higher discount rates at year-end 2021 [9] and lower expected return on plan assets in 2022 [9].

Here's a summary:\n\n[3] During fiscal 2015, revenue in APAC remained stable compared to fiscal 2014 while revenue in the Americas and EMEA increased...\n\n[5] Revenue in APAC remained stable during fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 due to an increase in Digital Marketing revenue offset by a decrease in Digital Media revenue...\n\n[9] Revenue in APAC decreased during fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 primarily as a result of decreases in Digital Media revenue due to slower adoption of Creative Cloud in Japan compared to other countries...\n\n[10] During fiscal 2014, the U.S. Dollar strengthened against the Japanese Yen and other Asian currencies causing revenue in APAC measured in U.S. Dollar equivalents to decrease compared to fiscal 2013...\n\nAn important point to consider is that the information for fiscal 2015 presented in text quote [3] does not provide a numerical percentage change in revenue for APAC as compared to fiscal 2013. Instead, this quote discusses the overall trend and mentions that the APAC region remained stable during fiscal 2015 relative to fiscal 2014.\n\nHowever, we can determine the percentage change in revenue for APAC from fiscal year 2013 to 2014 using text quote [9]. Here's a summary of the data:\n\n- **Revenue in APAC FY 2013:** $791.6 million (19% of total revenue)\n- **Revenue in APAC FY 2014:** $652.8 million (16% of total revenue)\n\nTo find the percentage change, we can follow the steps:\n\n1. Calculate the difference in revenue: $791.6 - $652.8 = $138.8 million\n2. Divide the difference by the initial revenue value: $138.8 / $791.6 = 0.176966150187053\n3. Multiply by 100 to get the percentage: 0.176966150187053 * 100 = -18.06%\n\nThe reason the percentage is negative indicates a decrease in revenue. We can conclude that the revenue in APAC for fiscal year 2014 decreased by 18.06% as compared to fiscal year 2013.\n\nAs for the percentage change in revenue for APAC from fiscal year 2014 to 2015, we don't have direct information from the text or images to calculate this precisely. However, we can infer that since the APAC region remained relatively stable during fiscal 2015, compared to fiscal 2014, the percentage change from fiscal year 2014 to 2015 would likely be smaller than the decrease from fiscal year 2013 to 2014 we calculated above.\n\nNow, let's provide the interleaved answer including both text and image quotes (citations are included in parentheses):\n\n![Total revenue for each fiscal year](image2)\n\nThe APAC region (Asia-Pacific) displayed a decrease in revenue during fiscal year 2014 compared to fiscal year 2013. In fiscal year 2013, APAC contributed 19% of the total revenue with $791.6 million. Whereas, in fiscal year 2014, APAC's contribution fell to 16% of the total revenue with $652.8 million, marking a 18.06% decrease in revenue.\n\nWhile the data for fiscal year 2015 in the text quote [3] does not provide a percentage change for the APAC region, it does indicate that the APAC revenue remained stable during fiscal year 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014.\n\n![Revenue changes over three fiscal years for each segment](image5)\n\nIt's worth noting that text quote [10] discusses an increase in the U.S. Dollar against the Japanese Yen, which could have affected the APAC region's revenue in fiscal year 2014. However, the exact impact on the APAC region's revenue in fiscal year 2014 is not explicitly specified in the provided text quotes.\n\nImage reference:\n[image2]\n[image3]\n[image4]\n[image5]"}

However, for users ages 65 and older, amusement (30%) and anger (24%) are encountered with more comparable frequency.\n\n[5] When asked about six emotions that users might experience due to the content they see on social media, the largest share of users ( 88%) say they see content on these sites that makes them feel amused.\n\nBased on the information provided, it appears that amusement is the most frequent emotion encountered on social media, followed by anger. To find out the 4th most popular emotion, let's consider the other emotions presented in the quotes: connectedness, inspiration, depression, and loneliness.\n\n[2] Amusement, anger, connectedness, and inspiration top the emotions users frequently feel when using social media.\n[7] Around half (54%) of social media users say they typically see an equal mix of people being kind or supportive and people being mean or bullying.\n[8] When asked about six different emotions that they might experience due to the content they see on social media, the largest share of users ( 88%) say they see content on these sites that makes them feel amused.\n\nFrom these quotes, it seems that connectedness, inspiration, depression, and loneliness are less frequent emotions for social media users compared to amusement and anger.\n\n[6] Identical shares of users across a range of age groups say they frequently encounter content on social media that makes them feel angry. However, younger adults are more likely to frequently encounter content making them feel lonely.\n\nThis suggests that for older users, anger might be the 4th most popular emotion. However, without specific data on the exact percentages for the 4th most popular emotion, it is challenging to provide a precise figure.\n\nNow, let's move on to the interleaved response featuring related images:\n\nHere's a bar chart (image1) summarizing the emotions users frequently and sometimes experience on social media, as well as their overall net frequencies:\n\n- **Amused**: Frequently 44 (NET: 88%)\n- **Angry**: Frequently 25 (NET: 71%)\n- **Connected**: Frequently 21 (NET: 71%)\n- <**Inspired**: Frequently 16 (NET: 69%)> (This emotion appears to be less frequent compared to amusement, anger, and connectedness)\n- **Depressed**: Frequently 13 (NET: 49%)\n- **Lonely**: Frequently 7 (NET: 31%)\n\nAs we can see from the chart, anger is the 4th most popular emotion (overall net score of 71%), behind amusement (overall net score of 88%), connectedness (overall net score of 71%), and inspiration (overall net score of 69%). However, if we focus on just the older users, anger might be even more frequently experienced compared to inspiration and depression. To back this up, further analysis would be needed to confirm the exact rankings for different age groups.\n\n![{The chart displays the four most common emotions experienced on social media (Amused, Angry, Connected, Inspired), with the ranking of Anger in the 4th position (overall net score of 71%) among these four emotions.}](image1)"}

Queens and Manhattan accounted for three-quarters of the City’s net gain in residential capacity, with increases of 2.8% and 2.3%, respectively.\n\n[3] The rezonings studied resulted in a net increase in residential development capacity citywide. Even though upzoned lots were primarily located near transit stations, the overall impact was consistent with the City’s stated goal. Upzoned lots near transit gained about 181 million square feet of residential capacity, while downzoned lots near transit lost only about 89 million square feet of capacity. As a result, rezoned lots near transit accounted for a majority of the citywide net increase in capacity. Moreover, if we exclude the Hudson Yards rezoning, the rezonings actually resulted in a small net decrease in residential development capacity in areas further away from rail stations.\n\n[5] Between 2003 and 2007, the City rezoned approximately 18% of the City’s total lot area. Of the 188,000 lots that were included in a City-initiated rezoning action, almost 63% were subject to a contextual-only rezoning, 23% were downzoned, and 14% were upzoned.\n\nFrom this evidence, it is clear that Queens experienced the highest percentage change in residential capacity due to rezonings from 2003 to 2007. Queens witnessed a net gain of 2.8% in residential capacity, and it accounted for a significant portion (approximately 75%) of the City’s net gain in residential capacity.\n\nEvidence Citation:\n[1] The capacity added by the rezonings var- ied a great deal among the boroughs. As  Table A shows, Queens and Manhattan  accounted for three-quarters of the City’s  net gain in residential capacity.\n\n[3] Even though most downzoned lots were  located near transit stations, the overall  impact of the rezonings we studied appears  consistent with the City’s stated goal,  because the upzonings near transit added  much more capacity than the down zoning s  near rail stations took away.\n\n[5] We estimate changes in residential develop- ment capacity at the lot level. Accordingly,  all estimates of capacity changes for the City,  community districts, boroughs and other  geographic areas, including area within and  beyond a half mile walking distance from rail  transit, are aggregations of lot-level data.\n\nTo further illustrate this, we have a relevant image [3] that reports changes in residential development capacity by borough.\n\n![The highest percentage change in residential capacity occurred in Queens.](image3)\n\nIn conclusion, Queens experienced the highest percentage change in residential capacity due to rezonings from 2003 to 2007, with a net gain of 2.8% in residential capacity."}

To answer the question, we need to find the country with the highest energy consumption per capita and compare it to the world average.\n\nThe USA is the country with the highest energy consumption per capita, with a consumption of 8080 kg oil equivalent, significantly higher than the world average of 1446 kg oil equivalent.\n\n> The USA, as evidenced by the bar chart (image2), is the country with the highest per capita energy consumption, approximately five times the world average.\n>\n> ![The USA has the highest per capita energy consumption](image2)\n\nIn addition, it's important to note that the transportation sector contributes significantly to carbon emissions in the industrialized economies, amounting to 30.0 % of CO2 emissions according to the presented chart ([8]). Therefore, reducing energy use and carbon emissions from the transportation sector is crucial in mitigating the global climate crisis.\n\nAsthmatics, who are more sensitive to air pollution, make up 150 million people worldwide and their numbers are increasing ([1]). It's also worth mentioning that the transportation sector is a significant source of air pollution, contributing to the ill-effects of air pollution on asthma sufferers.

Initially, the county's population surged, growing from 130 in 1870 to a peak of 14,096 in 1890 [5]. However, after this peak, the population began to decline slowly, dropping to 9,403 by the year 2000 [10].\n\nHistorically, two major acts of the mid-1800s—the Transcontinental Railroad Act and the Homestead Act—had a significant impact on the population growth [9]. The Union Pacific Railroad transformed Nebraska from a thinly populated corridor into a booming agricultural state [9]. The Homestead Act, which offered 160 acres of land for those who built a permanent structure and resided on it for five years, attracted numerous settlers to the state [9].\n\n![St. John's Lutheran Church in Kronborg](image1) Over time, these settlers formed various ethnic groups, each establishing their unique culture within the county. For instance, the Kronborg area became a flourishing Danish culture [10]. The Swedes settled in Hordville and the surroundings, while the Russian Germans expanded westward from Henderson [York County] into Hamilton County [10].\n\n![Chaffee's grave marker](image2) Agriculture also played a crucial role in population trends, with corn dominating the agricultural economy. However, farming methods and the agricultural landscape have dramatically changed due to mechanization [4]. The number of farms has steadily declined since its peak in 1900, while the number of acres per farm has increased [4].\n\n![Population data from 1870 to 2000](image3) In summary, the population trends in Hamilton County, Nebraska were heavily influenced by historical factors such as the implementation of major acts, agricultural changes, and the influx of settlers from various ethnic groups."}

There has also been a more modest decline in this view among Democrats.\n\nThis quote reveals a decrease in the number of Republicans favoring increased defense spending in Europe by 14 percentage points, contrasted with a smaller decline among Democrats.\n\nTo visualize this change, let's look at image2, which shows a line graph comparing the views of \"Republican/Lean Rep\" and \"Democrat/Lean Dem\" over the period of 2017 to 2019. Contrary to the text quote, the graph incorporates data for both age groups and demonstrates a decline in the desire for increased defense spending by both Republicans/Lean Rep (from 62 in 2017 to 48 in 2019) and Democrats/Lean Dem (from 34 in 2017 to 28 in 2019). A possible explanation for this discrepancy might be due to the distinction between \"Republicans\" and \"Republicans and Republican-leaning independents\" in the text quote.\n\n![Decline in defense spending views among Republicans and Democrats](image2)\n\nIn conclusion, views on increased defense spending in Europe among both Republicans and Democrats have shown a decline between 2017 and 2019, albeit a more substantial decline for Republicans than Democrats. However, comparing the numbers directly from the graph and the text quote may not match exactly due to the focus on party affiliations in the text quote versus the distinction between the two parties and their leanings in the graph."}

This shift correlates with the decline in the overall approval rating, with a larger portion of the decline coming from Republicans.\n\n![Comparison of Approvals Among Republicans and Democrats for Public Health Officials Response (image3 under point 1)](image3)\n\nFrom the image description, it is clear that the approval rating for public health officials, such as those at the CDC, dropped considerably among Republicans from March to August. In contrast, the approval rating for Democrats stayed relatively constant during the same period.\n\nNow, to provide a more comprehensive view, consider image4, which shows that at the beginning of August, there was still a significant gap in approval ratings for public health officials between Democrats and Republicans compared to other institutions like hospitals, local elected officials, state elected officials, and even Donald Trump.\n\n![Trust and Confidence Among Political Groups (image4)](image4)\n\nIn conclusion, the approval ratings for public health officials, such as those at the CDC, dropped significantly among Republicans from March to August.

In contrast, third or higher generation Hispanics show a lower connection with their heritage (44%), along with a 37% claim of having all or most Hispanic friends [7]. This observation supports the user's question, showing that older generational Hispanics tend to have more Hispanic friends.\n\n![Perceptions of Neighborhood Composition by Generation](image2)\n\nAdditionally, [2] points out that the foreign-born and second-generation Hispanics are more likely to live in communities where their neighbors share their heritage, which may contribute to a larger social circle of Hispanic friends. In contrast, the third or higher generation is less likely to reside in largely Latino neighborhoods (30%) compared to the foreign-born (41%) and second-generation (41%) groups. Although not directly answering the question about friendship, this living arrangement can influence the opportunity for developing friendships with individuals of the same heritage.\n\nIn summary, the answer to your question lies in the generational differences among self-identified Hispanics as they affect the likelihood of having Hispanic friends. Older generations, particularly the foreign-born, and the second generation are more likely to have all or most Hispanic friends and reside in communities with a high percentage of Hispanics ([2] and [7]). As the generation progresses, the connections with ancestral national origins become weaker ([3]), which reduces the chances of having a larger Hispanic circle of friends. Overall, these trends present a varying picture of friendship patterns and a possible change in the Hispanic identity among generations.\n\n[1]: Foreign-born Hispanics most likely to say they have Hispanic friends\n[2]: Among self-identified Latinos, the foreign born and the second generation are most likely to say that all or most of their neighbors share their heritage.\n[3]: Connections with ancestral national origins decline as immigrant roots become more distant.\n[7]: The composition of networks of friends varies widely across immigrant generations."}

Around 23% of older adults [1] experience difficulties in reading compared to only 16% of all adults. Similarly, 29% of older adults [8] have a disability, handicap, or chronic disease that limits their participation in daily activities, while this occurs in 18% of all adults [image1].\n\nThese physical health conditions significantly impact technology use among older adults [3, 9].

This suggests that a larger portion of historical music from these genres is being consumed via streaming platforms.\n\nNow, let's look at the genre share of total streams [image2]. Here, Pop has a slightly higher streams percentage (23%), while Country has a slightly lower percentage (12%). However, the difference between the two is not substantial.\n\nThis discrepancy between the catalog share of streams (from the bar graph in image1) and the genre share of total streams (from the bar chart in image2) indicates that while Country and R&B/Hip-Hop may have a higher catalog share of streams, the overall proportion of total streams within these genres is relatively smaller compared to Pop.\n\nIn terms of market dynamics, this could mean that while a larger percentage of historical music from Country and R&B/Hip-Hop is consumed via streaming platforms, the overall streaming market for these genres is not as dominant as that for Pop. But, it's also important to note that other genres such as Rock and Dance/Electronic also have substantial streaming market shares [image2].\n\n![Different genres have varying catalog shares of streams, but Pop has a larger proportion in overall total streams.](image1)\n![Country and R&B/Hip-Hop have higher catalog shares of streams compared to Pop, but lower shares in overall total streams.](image2)\n\nIn conclusion, the catalog share of streams is higher for Country and R&B/Hip-Hop compared to Pop, indicating a stronger streaming presence for these genres' historical music. However, Pop has a larger proportion in overall total streams, reflecting a relatively more dominant streaming market for this genre.

Image3 similarly shows the distribution of women in math jobs around the 46% line.\n\nPhysical science jobs, as mentioned in text quote [8], have an approximate share of women around 39%.

The text quote [2] highlights that optimism about future economic prospects has risen faster among Latinos than in the population as a whole, with a 14-point increase in the share of Latinos who expect their family finances to improve \"a lot\" or \"some\" in the coming year. `![Latinos showed the largest increase in optimism among all demographic groups, as shown below.](image1)`\n\n`image2` illustrates the situation more vividly. It reveals that among Latinos who had completed some college, optimism has increased by a substantial 20 percentage points. This impact is greater than for those with a high school diploma (${\\bf +9}$) or less education (${{\\bf +{\\bf 11}}}$). We can infer that the increase is more notable among younger and male Latinos, as the distribution of optimism among Latinos in the image suggests.\n\nTherefore, it can be confirmed that Latinos showed the largest increase in financial optimism from 2008 to 2015, and this increase was predominantly among those who have completed some college or more education._"}

In contrast, for the extremely low-resource languages, the gains are either quite small (A Z  and B E ) or very large, as in G L  which achieves a gain of up to 11 BLEU points. This finding is interesting in that it indicates that word embeddings may be particularly useful to bootstrap models that are on the threshold of being able to produce reasonable translations, as is the case for G L  in our experiments.\n[4] For all three languages the gain in BLEU score demonstrates a similar trend to that found in G L  in the previous section: the gain is highest when the baseline system is poor but not too poor, usually with a baseline BLEU score in the range of 3-4. This suggests that at least a moderately effective system is necessary before pre-training takes effect, but once there is enough data to capture the basic characteristics of the language, pre-training can be highly effective.\n[5] Finally, it is of interest to consider pre-training in multilingual translation systems that share an encoder or decoder between multiple languages (Johnson et al. ,  2016 ;  Firat et al. ,  2016 ), which is another promising way to use additional data (this time from another language) as a way to improve NMT. Speciﬁcally, we train a model using our pairs of similar low-resource and higher-resource languages, and test on only the low-resource language. For those three pairs, the similarity of G L /P T  is the highest while B E /R U  is the lowest.\n[6] The results in Table  2  clearly demonstrate that pre-training the word embeddings in the source and/or target languages helps to increase the BLEU scores to some degree. Comparing the second and third columns, we can see the increase is much more significant with pre-trained source language embeddings.

In particular, when comparing \"unaligned\" and \"aligned\" categories in image1, we can see that pre-training has a positive impact on BLEU scores for G L \\{Galician\\}, TR \\{Turkish\\}, and RU \\{Russian\\} language pairs. Additionally, the table in image4 demonstrates that using pre-trained embeddings (pre) generally leads to higher BLEU scores for all language pairs compared to the standard process (std).\n\nCombining the ideas presented in the text and image quotes, it can be concluded that pre-training has a positive impact on BLEU scores for various language pairs (Galician, Portuguese, Azerbaijani, Turkish, Belarusian, and Russian), especially when the starting point (baseline system) is not very effective and the data is limited. This advantage persists even in multilingual translation systems when sharing an encoder or decoder between multiple languages.\n\n![Improvement in BLEU scores with pre-training](image1)"}

[6]\n\nThe significance of these seismic events, according to the text, lies in their locality and recurrence, as well as the fact that they were not accompanied by the typical manifestations of earthquakes. Instead, they appear to be localized and limited events, with varying intensity and physical effects on the surrounding area. [6][9]\n\nThe presence of breccia gashes, as depicted in the diagram [3], further supports the theory that these localized shocks may be linked to specific geological structures and processes. These gashes, found in the cliffs of Marsden, are filled with irregular fragments of rock and cemented together, causing the disruption in the layered formation of the cliff. The text suggests that these formations might be the result of earthquake action on the rock at an early period. [8]\n\nAdditionally, it is worth mentioning that there is some less definite evidence of similar shocks occurring in or near Sunderland about eleven years prior to the events recorded in the table.

The remaining cases (10.3%) had no agreement.\n- Chameleon vs. GPT-4V+: 35.4% of cases had all three annotators agree, and 55.2% had two annotators agree.

However, there is still a considerable percentage (10-13%) of cases where there is no agreement among the annotators. This suggests that while there is consistent agreement on Chameleon's performance in many cases, inter-annotator reliability for Chameleon's performance evaluation may have some limitations, as there are still cases where the annotators disagree.\n\nIn summary, based on the provided data, it can be concluded that while annotator agreement levels for Chameleon's performance are generally high, there is still a certain amount of disagreement among annotators in some cases. This suggests that, while the evaluations provide useful insights into Chameleon's performance, improvements in inter-annotator reliability may be beneficial.\n\n![Chameleon versus other models' annotator agreement levels in relative evaluations](image2)"}

For instance, on the SST-2 dataset, the anchor re-weighting method achieves a higher accuracy of 90.07, compared to the vanilla ICL's 61.28 for 1-shot per class.

In addition, we can observe that the performance varies a lot as  $\\alpha$   changes in distinct datasets, which shows that the hyperparameters  $\\alpha,\\beta$   acturally play an important role in TI.\n\nNow, let's review the image evidence [1] that presents an extensive table showcasing the F1 scores for various $\\alpha$ values on the Chinese OntoNotes4.0 and English QuoRef datasets:\n\n- **For $\\alpha = 0.1$:**\n  - Chinese Onto4.0: 80.13\n  - English QuoRef: 63.23\n\n- **For $\\alpha = 0.2$:**\n  - Chinese Onto4.0: 81.17\n  - English QuoRef: 63.45\n\n- **For $\\alpha = 0.3$:**\n  - Chinese Onto4.0: 84.22\n  - English QuoRef: 65.88\n\n- **For $\\alpha = 0.4$:**\n    - Chinese Onto4.0: 84.52\n    - English QuoRef: **68.44** (bolded for highlighting the optimal value)\n\n- ...\n\nThe table clearly indicates that the optimal $\\alpha$ value for the Chinese OntoNotes4.0 dataset is 0.6, with the highest F1 score of 84.67. On the other hand, the optimal $\\alpha$ value for the English QuoRef dataset is 0.4, with the highest F1 score of 68.44.\n\nIn summary:\nThe parameter $\\alpha$ significantly influences the F1 score on both the Chinese OntoNotes4.0 and English QuoRef datasets. For the Chinese OntoNotes4.0 dataset, the optimal $\\alpha$ value is 0.6, yielding the highest F1 score of 84.67. Meanwhile, on the English QuoRef dataset, the optimal $\\alpha$ value is 0.4, resulting in the highest F1 score of 68.44.\n\n![Table comparing F1 scores for Chinese OntoNotes4.0 and English QuoRef datasets with different alpha values](image1)\n\nFor more insight into other datasets and models, refer to the Tversky Index quote [8] and explore other relevant quotes provided in the context.

It consists of a recurrent encoder, an attention mechanism, and a recurrent decoder. The decoder only attends to the states of the encoder.\n\n**Multitask model (Figure 1b):** This model is a variation of the single-task model, but it jointly models two output sequences using a shared encoder, separate attentions, and separate decoders. The decoders are independent, each attending to the states of the encoder alone, rather than having shared attention.\n\nIn terms of decoder attention, the key difference is that the single-task model has only one decoder with attention mechanisms, while the multitask model has separate decoders for each output sequence, each with its own attention mechanisms that attend to the states of the shared encoder. This means the multitask model is processing two tasks simultaneously using the same encoder, but with separate attentions and decoders for each task, which could lead to more specialized representations for each task compared to the single-task model.\n\n![Multitask and Single-task models comparison](image2)\n\nHere's the image that might help visualize the attention mechanisms in both models:\n\n* **Single-task model**: The attention mechanism directly aligns the decoder with the encoder states.\n* **Multitask model**: Each decoder has its own attention mechanism, aligning independently with the encoder states.\n\nIn the multitask model, the decoders might focus on different aspects of the input sequence, depending on the task, whereas in the single-task model, the attention mechanism focuses on the whole input sequence for a single task. This could potentially improve the performance on the specified tasks for the multitask model, as it allows for more specialized representation of the input for each task.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that this comparison only considers the decoder attention mechanism. The multitask model also introduces the sharing of encoder representations, which could have additional impacts on the overall performance of the model.

We conduct experiments on the two widely-used datasets: MRPC ( Dolan and Brockett ,  2005 ) and QQP. F1 score is reported for comparison. We use BERT ( Devlin et al. ,  2018 ) and XLNet ( Yang et al. ,  2019 ) as baselines.\n\nWe then find the results for the MRPC dataset in the next text quote [1]:\n\n> Results Table  7  shows the results. We ﬁnd that replacing the training objective with DSC introduces performance boost for both settings, $+0.58$  for MRPC and   $+0.73$   for QQP.\n\nTo better understand the performance boost obtained by BERT+DSC on the MRPC task, let’s examine the table found in `image1`. Table 7 of the research presents the performance metrics of several variations of the BERT model on different data points. Here’s the breakdown of the table relevant to your question (I’ve highlighted the important part):\n\n- **Columns**:\n  1. **Original**: Performance of the basic versions without any added effects.\n  2. **+ Positive**: Performance results when positive elements are added.\n  3. **+ Negative**: Performance outcomes when negative elements are introduced.\n  4. **- Negative**: Performance when negative elements are removed.\n  5. **+ Positive & Negative**: Performance with both positive and negative elements added.\n\n- **Rows**:\n  1. **BERT**: Shows baseline performance for each of the configurations.\n  2. **BERT+DSC**: Performance of BERT with an enhancement labeled \"DSC\".\n\nWe can see that the \"Original\" row corresponds to the basic versions without any added effects on the MRPC dataset (for positive and negative elements). By directly comparing the \"Original\" transformation to \"BERT+DSC,\" we see that the BERT model achieves a $+0.58$ increase in F1 score when the training objective is replaced with DSC on the MRPC dataset.\n\nIn short, the answer to your question is: BERT+DSC achieved a performance boost of $+0.58$ for the MRPC task.

Each character in a word is not explicitly represented as such in this system; instead, the characters are the basic input units.\n\nBefore being input to the LSTM layers, each character is transformed into a dense vector space (character embedding). This embedded representation captures useful information about the characters in the sentence.\n\nEach set of character embeddings is then processed through bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. This allows the system to capture contextual information at the character level by processing the sequence from both directions (forward and backward).\n\nAfter processing the character embeddings through LSTM, the outputs are combined to form word-level representations. These word-level representations, along with any added features, are then passed through another sentence-level Bi-LSTM, and the final tags are predicted using a final softmax or a Conditional Random Field (CRF) layer.

To do this, it receives input as a tuple $\\chi=(s,h^{+},h^{-},r)$; where $h^{+}$ denotes an hypothesis that was ranked higher than another hypothesis $h^{-}$. The input is then passed through a cross-lingual encoder and a pooling layer to obtain a sentence embedding for each segment in the $\\chi$.

Consequently, the triplet margin loss in Figure 2 helps optimize the resulting embedding space to minimize the distance between the \"better\" hypothesis and the \"anchors\" (source and reference), effectively focusing on finding semantically close embedded representations for similar sentences while keeping dissimilar sentences apart.\n\nHere's how you can cite this intertwined response:\nThe Translation Ranking model [2] employs a cross-lingual encoder, pooling layer, and triplet margin loss (described in Figure 1) to compare hypotheses based on their distance in an embedding space to the source and reference.

Unlike self-correction where only the model itself iteratively refines outputs, external models or tools provide additional insights and capabilities to improve the quality of the generated text.\n\nExample use cases include:\n- Knowledge bases, trained models, code interpreters, and search enginesprovide factual evidence or correctness probing, allowing the model to generate more accurate outputs on specific topics or tasks.\n- Trained models offer grammar, style, and coherence suggestions, enhancing the language model's narrative quality and readability.\n- Program executors can validate and correct code generation tasks or mathematical reasoning, ensuring the generated output is functionally accurate.\n\nSo, the post-hoc correction with external feedback strategy aims to refine outputs by incorporating a variety of complementary tools and sources of expertise to supplement the capabilities of the language model. This integration enriches model performance in a wide range of tasks and refines outputs by mitigating human bias and potential errors in the AI model."}

These are standard transformer decoder blocks labeled as `Block_1` to `Block_N`. At the top of the diagram, there's a gray block labeled `comb`, representing a combination mechanism.

This is especially true for tasks that label each token, such as NER, as this allows the model to access the full context, including the token itself.\n\nThe purpose of the combination (comb) layers in Figure 2 is to integrate the outputs from the two parallel sequences of decoder blocks (the green and blue sequences) by using a standard multi-head self-attention module. This process allows the model to capture and consider information from both the left and right context while predicting the center token.

The text quote mentions that removing the LSTM layer results in a drop in performance, as seen in the accuracies and Macro-F1 scores for \"Without LSTM\" setting on D3: 80.27% Acc., 68.02 Macro-F1. Now, let's focus on the impact of removing the output layer specifically.\n\nIn the table provided, the settings that exclude the output layer are marked as \"Without output layer.\" On D3, we can find that the accuracy is 80. without any external knowledge might still be able to learn some neutral-related features on D1 but it is very hard to learn from D3 and D4. [7] This suggests that the removal of the output layer slightly affects the performance on D3 in terms of accuracy (80. compared to the initial 80.95% with LSTM only).\n\nAs for Macro-F1 scores, the text quote does not provide a comparison between the \"Without output layer\" setting and the initial LSTM only approach on D3. However, the \"Without output layer\" setting still achieves a fairly good Macro-F1 score of 68. on D3, demonstrating that the absence of the output layer still allows the model to capture some sentiment patterns.\n\nIn summary, the removal of the output layer slightly reduces the accuracy on D3 and affects the Macro-F1 score to some extent, but the model is still able to capture sentiment patterns on D3 to a certain degree. Combining this information with the image quotes will provide a comprehensive and visual perspective on the performance of the model in different settings.\n\n![Impact of removing output layer on D3](image2)\nThe impact of removing the output layer for the D3 dataset is shown in this table. As we can see, the setting \"Without output layer\" (gray diamonds) receives a decrease in accuracy compared to the LSTM only setting (green line graphs).

While the number of entity types for each dataset isn't explicitly stated, we can infer their number from [3] and [8] that mention the SciERC dataset defines scientific term types and relation types specially designed for AI domain knowledge graph construction. This implies SciERC contains a lesser count of generic entity types compared to the others.\n\nOn the other hand, the image4 and image3 quotes present tables showing the number of entity types for each dataset. From these tables, GENIA has the least number of entity types among ACE04-O, ACE05-O, and GENIA, and SciERC is not included since those tables do not contain it. However, in [7], it is mentioned that the SciERC dataset doesn't have relation annotations, and since [3] states that their relation extraction task is performed on datasets that provide relations, SciERC might not be considered for evaluation.\n\nRegarding the coreference resolution, table [9] says that all four data sets are annotated with entity and relation labels, but only a small fraction of entities have text spans that overlap. However, the user question specifically asks for coreference resolution (not just overlapping entities), so we need to look further.\n\nFrom the text quote [4], it's clear that the ACE2004 and ACE2005 datasets follow the same annotation scheme as Michael A. Boland et al., OntoNotes 2.0: A Multilingual annotated corpus for NLP Research, Pradhan et al., 2012, which contains significant more documents with coreference annotations. Image2, quote [3], also indicates that ACE04-O and ACE05-O have coreference annotations available. Regarding GENIA, text quote [6] mentions that OntoNotes is used to train the parameters for the auxiliary corefer- ence task since the domain and mention span annotations in the ACE datasets are very similar to those of OntoNotes. As a result, it can be inferred that GENIA also has coreference annotations since it is trained using OntoNotes.\n\nHence, the datasets with the most entity types are ACE2004, ACE2005, and GENIA. Among these datasets, ACE04-O and ACE05-O have coreference resolution.\n\n![Three datasets have coreference annotations: ACE04-O, ACE05-O, and GENIA](image3)\n\n![Dataset GENIA has significant more documents with coreference annotations](image4)"}

[ 47 ] use an auto regressive model that predicts the output sequence one element at a time....\n\n...The **object queries** are learnt positional encodings that we refer to as  object queries , and similarly to the encoder, we add them to the input of each attention layer. The    $N$   object queries are transformed into an output embedding by the decoder.\n\n![DETR Uses Object QueriesDecoder Process](image3)\n\n[...] The **decoder** attends to the output of the transformer encoder to refine its predictions. For each output embedding of the decoder, a **shared feed forward network** (FFN) predicts either the class and bounding box of a detected object or classifies it as “no object.” The predictions are visualized as bounding boxes with associated class labels overlaid on an image of birds, showing the model's capability to detect objects in the scene.\n\nIn essence, DETR's decoder utilizes a fixed small set of learned positional embeddings, also known as object queries, during the prediction phase. The decoder attends to the comprehensive 2D representation created by the transformer encoder and refines predictions based on these object queries. The object queries are transformed into output embeddings, which are then used to generate the final set of predictions, including classifications and bounding boxes."}

Nevertheless, the BPE Large model's faster training time could be an advantage for quicker model development and deployment.\n\nFurthermore, as stated in [10], performance gains are possible by jointly pretraining both directions of a large language-model-inspired self-attention cloze model. The model's performance on various NLP tasks is shown in [4]. The results indicate that the BERT_LARGE model has the best performance among all models, notably high on CoLA, QNLI, and RTE. Although the BPE Large model has a faster training time, the BERT_LARGE model might still offer better overall performance.\n\nIn summary, the BPE Large model offers a faster training time compared to the CNN Base and CNN Large models, but it might still be worth considering other factors, such as model performance, before making a final decision."}

However, it does not provide a direct correlation between the number of entities and relation extraction performance.\n\n2. Image 2 compares the performance of relation extraction for the DyGIE and DyGIE-RelProp systems as a function of the number of entities in a sentence.

Image 3 provides performance metrics for different models, including DyGIE, on the relation extraction task. While the table does not directly show the effect of the number of entities on performance, it suggests that the base model without any propagation has a higher F1 score for relation extraction compared to DyGIE with relation propagation.\n\nNow, let us analyze the provided evidence related to relation propagation:\n\n1. [1] mentions that relation propagation significantly benefits both entity and relation extraction in both domains, ACE05 and SciEERC. However, it does not provide a clear implication of using relation propagation.\n\n2. [7] explains the mechanism of relation propagation, which involves defining a beam consisting of entity spans that are likely to be involved in a relation. Each edge in the relation graph has a tensor capturing scores of each relation type, and the relation update vector is computed by aggregating neighboring span representations on the relation graph.\n\n3. While image 1 does not directly show the impact of relation propagation, it does highlight the superior performance of the DyGIE system compared to other systems on entity recognition and relation extraction tasks across multiple datasets. However, it does not specifically address the effect of relation propagation alone.\n\n4. Images 2 and 5 show that DyGIE performs better than its counterpart with relation propagation (DyGIE-RelProp) on both entity and relation extraction tasks. These graphs indicate that the iterative process of relation propagation may have a decreasing impact on performance as the number of entities increases.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the provided evidence, it appears that while relation propagation can be beneficial for both entity and relation extraction, particularly in scenarios with multiple relation instances across different entities, improving the performance of relation extraction as the number of entities increases might present a challenge. The evidence seems to suggest that using targeted approaches tailored for sentences with more entities could potentially address this issue. It is also worth mentioning that the base model without any propagation tends to perform relatively better on the relation extraction task compared to the model with relation propagation."}

This prevents the model from producing bigrams that commonly occur in many questions, such as \"do you\" and \"what is\". To fix this, they introduce an extra setting, $z \\ = \\ 10\\ (b o o s t).$, where extrep bigram is not used for weighted decoding during beam search, but it is used to rerank the candidates after beam search. This setting allows the model to produce necessary question-asking bigrams, yielding a 99.54% question-asking rate. However, this comes at the cost of slightly increased external bigram repetition (see Appendix F ).\n\nFrom the provided image quotes [image4], we can see a line graph that demonstrates how different methods control the frequency of question-asking in generated text. The graph shows that the Question-controlled CT method significantly increases the percentage of questions as the control level increases, approaching near 100% at higher levels. However, when repetition control is added to the Question-controlled CT method, the percentage of questions is more gradual and does not reach as high as the original Question-controlled CT method.\n\nIn conclusion, the presence of repetition control affects the frequency of question-asking in generated text by limiting the bigrams that commonly occur in many questions. As a result, the question-asking rate is decreased. However, using extra settings, such as the $z \\ = \\ 10\\ (b o o s t).$ setting, can help increase the question-asking rate, although it may come at the cost of increased external bigram repetition."}

It aims to improve context from the knowledge base at each step by iterating a specified number of times or until a threshold is met. This iterative process allows the system to generate more accurate and relevant responses as it refines the information gathered during each cycle.\n\n2. **Recursive Retrieval (Middle):**\n   ![Recursive Retrieval continues to refine the user query by breaking down complex problems into sub-problems.](image5)\n   In contrast, recursive retrieval processes continuously solve complex problems by decomposing them into smaller, manageable sub-problems. This involves gradually refining the user query and dividing the problem into sub-problems to provide more focused and appropriate responses. The key difference between iterative and recursive retrieval is that recursive retrieval restructures the problem representation rather than simply cycling through the knowledge base.\n\n3. **Adaptive Retrieval (Right):**\n   ![Adaptive Retrieval allows the RAG system to autonomously decide when external knowledge retrieval is needed.](image5)\n   Adaptive retrieval sets the RAG system apart by enabling it to determine when external knowledge retrieval is necessary. Instead of relying on a fixed number of iterations or thresholds to trigger retrieval, the adaptive retrieval process can autonomously decide when and how often to retrieve external information. This is achieved by using special tokens that signal when the system needs to stop retrieval and generation or continue based on the context.\n\nIn summary, iterative retrieval continuously refines the knowledge base, recursive retrieval decomposes complex problems into sub-problems, and adaptive retrieval allows the system to dynamically adjust its retrieval behavior based on the specific requirements of the task. Understanding these differences is crucial for developing effective Retrieval-Augmented Generation systems tailored to various applications."}

We collected over 1000 such examples, with each conversation being evaluated twice.\n\nNow, let's examine Table 5 provided in image2 to find the answers to the question.\n\n![Table 5 shows pairwise model comparison results, including Seq2Seq, Memory Network, and RetNRef variants.](image2)\n\nFrom the table, we can see that the RetrieveNRefine++ model had a win rate of 54.5%, the highest among the models paired for comparison. Hence, the question's answer is: **The RetrieveNRefine++ model had the highest win rate according to Table 5.**\n\nThis higher win rate indicates that RetrieveNRefine++ performed better in dialogues against other models on a statistically more meaningful test, confirming its superiority in human-like conversations compared to others in the study."}

The distractor paragraphs provide irrelevant information or incorrect answers.\n\nImage quote 5 shows a table with various settings and corresponding F1 scores. One of the settings is \"Distractor,\" where the model achieves an F1 score of 67.08. While the table doesn't specifically mention gold paragraphs, we know from text quote [1] that this F1 score comes from the distractor setting with gold paragraphs present.\n\nImage quote 2 shows that when the model is trained on adversarial distractors and evaluated on regular data, it achieves an F1 score of 46.84. However, re-training the model on adversarial data improves its accuracy to 60.10 F1 (see text quote [4]). This demonstrates that the model can adapt to adversarial scenarios, which likely includes working with stronger distractors.\n\nMoreover, consider text quote [5], which proposes that stronger distractors could potentially make questions more difficult and require multi-hop reasoning. Even when using a large number of distractors (500), the model still struggles, with an F1 score of 39.12 (Image quote 5). However, the addition of two gold paragraphs to the open-domain setting significantly improves the F1 score, as shown in Image quote 5 (from 39.12 to 53.12 F1).\n\nIn conclusion, the inclusion of gold paragraphs and strong distractors affects the F1 scores in multi-hop question answering models in a significant way, with gold paragraphs having a positive impact on model performance, particularly in open-domain settings. The implication is that providing strong gold evidence, paired with carefully selected distractors, can help models improve their ability to reason across multiple paragraphs and answer complex questions more accurately.\n\n![In the distractor setting, strong gold paragraphs (i.e., evidence) paired with carefully selected distractors facilitate multi-hop reasoning and improve the accuracy of question answering models.](image5)"}

This is evident in [10] as well as Figure 14, which depicts the performance of several active learning querying strategies across multiple datasets, including PathMNIST (image5a, red lines).

For instance, Figure 3 compares map-based querying strategies, showing that hard-to-contrast performs best in various datasets like PathMNIST, OrganAMNIST, BloodMNIST, and CIFAR-10-LT (image3).\n\nThe bar chart in image4 demonstrates that the 'Ours' strategy, which represents the 'Hard-to-Contrast' method, selects more from minority classes like mucus and mucosa while maintaining the distribution of major classes.

Our model outperforms all the previous models that use hand-designed features. We observe more signiﬁcant improvement in span identiﬁcation than keyphrase classiﬁcation. This conﬁrms the bene- ﬁt of our model in enumerating spans (rather than BIO tagging in state-of-the-art systems). More- over, we have competitive results compared to the previous state of the art in relation extraction. We observe less gain compared to the S CI ERC dataset mainly because there are no coference links, and the relation types are not comprehensive.\n[**image5**](image5) – The human evaluation shows that propagating coreference can signiﬁcantly improve the quality of the knowledge graph.

Examples of generated reasoning programs can be found in Figure 7 of Appendix B. To assess the quality of the generated reasoning programs, we sampled 300 claims where P ROGRAM FC incorrectly predicted the final veracity labels from the HOVER 2-hop, 3-hop, and 4-hop datasets, with 100 examples per dataset. We asked human annotators to analyze the error types and we classified the results into three categories [..] Third, as the complexity of the claims increases, the proportion of semantic errors in the programs also increases, with structural errors becoming particularly prevalent.\n\nThis passage reveals that we can find the error types and their proportions in Table 2 of the source document, but it does not directly provide the answer to the question.

Firstly, we have [4] that discusses the introduction of repetition control and its effects on question-asking. In this text, it's mentioned that the repetition control reduces question-asking, particularly for the highest control level `z=10`, which should produce 100% questions. Instead, it only produces 79.67% questions due to the weighted decoding feature that discourages bigrams that have appeared in previous utterances.\n\nOn the other hand, we also have image4 that shows the line graph demonstrating how different methods control the frequency of question-asking in generated text. By looking at the purple line with squares, which represents the `Question-controlled CT with repetition control`, we can see that at the highest control level `z=10`, it only achieves an 80% question-asking rate, not the desired 100%.\n\nHence, we can conclude that the introduction of repetition control does affect the question-asking rate at the highest control level `z=10`. Additionally, to further boost the question-asking rate, an extra setting `z = 10 (boost)` is introduced in [4], which allows the model to produce necessary question-asking bigrams and yields a 99.54% question-asking rate.

According to the statistics in Table  1 , the long- term representations of many users in test data are unavailable, which leads to relative weak per- formance of LTUR on these users. In addition, combining STUR and LTUR using our two long- and short-term user representation methods, i.e., LSTUR-ini and LSTUR-con, can effectively im- prove the performance. This result validates that incorporating both long-term and short-term user representations is useful to capture the diverse user interests more accurately and is beneﬁcial for news recommendation.  `![Comparing STUR and LTUR](image2)`\n\n[2] Since not all users can be incorporated in news recommendation model training (e.g., the new coming users), it is not appropriate to assume all users have long-term representations in our mod- els in the prediction stage. In order to handle this problem, in the model training stage, we randomly mask the long-term representations of users with a certain probability    $p$  . When we mask the long- term representations, all the dimensions are set to zero. Thus, the long-term user representation in our LSTUR approach can be reformulated as:  For instance, we can see the impact of randomly masking long-term user representations in [10].  `![Masking long-term user representations in LSTUR](image10)`\n\n[3] In this paper, we propose a neural news rec- ommendation approach with both long- and short- term user representations (LSTUR). Our approach contains two major components, i.e., a news en- coder and a user encoder. The news encoder is used to learn representations of news articles from their titles and topic categories. We apply attention mechanism to the news encoder to learn informative news representations by selecting important words. The user encoder consists of two modules, i.e., a long-term user representation (LTUR) mod- ule and a short-term user representation (STUR) module. In STUR, we use a GRU network to learn short-term representations of users from their re- cently browsing news. In LTUR, we learn the long-term representations of users from the em- beddings of their IDs. In addition, we propose two methods to combine the short-term and long-term user representations.  `![Framework of LSTUR](image2)`\n\n[4] Since there is no off-the-shelf dataset for news rec- ommendation, we built one by ourselves through collecting logs from MSN News 3   in four weeks from December 23rd, 2018 to January 19th, 2019. We used the logs in the ﬁrst three weeks for model training, and those in the last week for test. We also randomly sampled   $10\\%$   of logs from the train- ing set as the validation data. For each sample, we collected the browsing history in last 7 days to learn short-term user representations. The detailed dataset statistics are summarized in Table  1 . In this dataset, we find there are a total of 25,000 users, out of which 2,062 users were not included in the training set.  `![Detailed information about the dataset](image5)`\n\nThe final answer to the question is: There are 2,062 users from the dataset that were not included in the training set. `![Users not included in training set](image5)`"}

The table also includes a column called \"Δτ,\" which represents the difference between the COMET-RANK score without using reference translations and the score using reference translations. This value signifies the improvement in the metric when references are included.\n\nAnalyzing the data reveals that across all languages, the inclusion of reference translations improves the COMET-RANK score.

The output token representations are obtained by stacking the forward and backward LSTM hidden states.\n\nNow, to answer your question about the purpose of the sentence-level BiLSTM in the DYGIE model:\n\nThe sentence-level BiLSTM (Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory) in the DYGIE model is a crucial component that processes input tokens to obtain token representations. It does this by applying a bidirectional LSTM over the input words, concatenating character representations, GLoVe word embeddings, and ELMo embeddings for each token. The output token representations are then obtained by stacking the forward and backward LSTM hidden states.\n\nThe role of the sentence-level BiLSTM is to capture the contextual information present in the input sentence and generate useful representations for each word in the sentence. These representations are then used in the subsequent steps of the DYGIE model for various tasks, such as entity recognition, relation extraction, and coreference resolution. This process allows the DYGIE model to better understand the semantic meaning of the input sentence and make more accurate predictions about the entities, relations, and coreferences present in the text.\n\nTo support this answer, let me show you an image that illustrates the DYGIE model, where the input document is processed through a Sentence-level BiLSTM (as described in image1):\n\n`![The DYGIE model processes input documents by splitting them into sentences, with each sentence processed through a Sentence-level BiLSTM to obtain token representations.](image1)`"}

These approaches include different pathways and sub-pathways according to the type, site and extent of the mutation-induced damage and also according to the stage of cell cycle affected by the mutation. They include base excision repair (BER), nucleotide excision repair (NER), direct reversal repair, mismatch repair (MMR), transcription-coupled repair (TCR) and recombination repair.]\n\nTo provide a detailed response, here's an interleaved text and image response that combines text quote [8] and the relevant parts of the text quotes [2], [4], [5], [6], and [10]:\n\n> **Base Excision Repair (BER)**: This repair mechanism is probably the most frequent DNA repair pathway in the cell and is used for single-strand point mutations affecting one or few bases of one DNA strand [5]. It involves recognition of the damaged base of a nucleotide by a glycosylase enzyme and its removal by detaching it from the deoxyribose sugar via hydrolysis of the N-glycosyl bond. The broken hydrogen bond between the damaged base and the opposing base on the complementary strand occurs probably via ATP-induced changes of the energy dynamics of the bond. Removal of the damaged or mutated base results in creation of an abasic site (AP) of the DNA, which is targeted by endonuclease and lyase activity to remove the damaged base(s) followed by addition of new normal base(s) by a specific polymerase enzyme, and finally, regaining the phosphodiester bonds and, hence, the phosphate-sugar backbone of the DNA strand by the action of DNA ligase [5].\n\n![Base Excision Repair (BER) demonstrates enzymes identifying and removing damaged or mutated bases and subsequent regaining of DNA strand integrity](image5)\n\n> **Nucleotide Excision Repair (NER)**: Nucleotide excision repair is one of the most important DNA repair systems and is highly conserved among species, though it is much more complicated in higher eukaryotes than prokaryotes [4]. The most prominent feature of this repair system is its broad substrate specificity because it can excise DNA lesions such as UV-induced pyrimidine dimers as well as more bulky adducts of DNA.\n\n![Nucleotide Excision Repair (NER) demonstrates the repair of bulky lesions from DNA using endonucleases and DNA polymerases](image3)\n\n> **Mismatch Repair (MMR)**: The mismatch repair system recognizes and corrects mismatched or unpaired bases that result from errors of DNA polymerase during DNA replication [6]. It involves complex reactions and interactions of many enzymes, proteins and signal discrimination factors, probably in collaboration with the proofreading system, to recognize the mutated strand first and then to locate the site of the mismatched pair. This is followed by removal of the mutated sequence by an endonuclease, addition of new pair(s) by DNA polymerase, and finally regaining the DNA double-stranded structure by DNA ligases. Post-replication mismatch repair is achieved by removal of a relatively long tract of mismatch-containing oligonucleotides, a process called long-patch MMR.\n\n![Mismatch Repair (MMR) demonstrates the correction of mismatched bases during DNA replication, involving many enzymes and DNA repair mechanisms](image4)\n\n> **Recombination Repair**: Recombination repair mechanisms aim primarily at repairing double-strand breaks of DNA, which represent the most devastating mutation-induced lesions of DNA because they can lead to loss of genetic information and chromosomal instabilities with consequent pathological alterations including chromosome breakage syndromes and carcinogenesis [10]. Recombination repair mechanisms consist of many various steps: end resection, strand invasion, DNA repair synthesis, and Holliday junction resolution.\n\n![Recombination Repair demonstrates the repair of double-strand breaks in DNA using recombination repair mechanisms](image3)\n\nIn conclusion, Figure 11, as referenced in the question, would likely depict several DNA repair mechanisms, including Base Excision Repair (BER), Nucleotide Excision Repair (NER), Mismatch Repair (MMR), and Recombination Repair. Each of these mechanisms addresses specific types of DNA damage and plays a crucial role in maintaining genetic stability.\n\n![{Diverse DNA repair mechanisms address various mutations and promote genetic stability}](image1)"}

Here’s an interleaved response:\n\n[1] ... Mitchell et al. introduce a new method called RAR (Retrieving And Ranking) to enhance the few-shot/zero-shot recognition abilities for datasets characterized by extensive and fine-grained vocabularies. They propose a multi-modal retrieval technique based on CLIP to create and store explicit memory for different categories beyond the immediate context window. During inference, RAR retrieves the top-$k$ similar results from the memory and uses MLLMs (Multi-label Learning Models) to rank and make the final predictions.\n\n![The table demonstrates how MLLMs are used for accurate label selection](image1)\n\n[2] ... Comparing RAR with CLIP results on rare classes ($AP_r$), RAR significantly outperforms the CLIP model, achieving 19.6 percentage points improvement.\n\n[3] Tab. 6 presents the results for FGVC-Aircrafts and Stanford Cars datasets under the zero-shot recognition setting. RAR outperforms both CLIP baseline and RegionCLIP across several performance metrics, including average precision ($AP_{all}$).\n\nimage2\n\n[4] On average, RAR boosts the top-1 accuracy from 57.0 to 63.2 ( ${\\%}$ ) on the 4-shot setting and from 63.0 to 69.8 ( $\\%$ ) on the 8-shot setting, outperforming the CLIP initial retrieval results on 11 datasets.\n\nimage4\n\nIn summary, RAR models consistently outperform CLIP models in terms of average precision ($AP_{all}$) across different datasets and shot settings. This performance enhancement is particularly prominent in few-shot object recognition tasks, making RAR a powerful tool for handling diverse and challenging image classification tasks with large and fine-grained vocabularies.\n\nTo further discern the effect of the RAR approach on the average precision across different metrics, we can refer to text quote [5]: Averaged Results on 11 Datasets. Tab. 2 summarizes the few-shot results on 11 datasets, including 4 fine-grained datasets. Compared to the CLIP initial retrieval results (top row), our RAR (third row) with ranking facilitates a notable increase in classification accuracy. On average, our approach boosts the top-1 accuracy from 57.0 to 63.2 ( ${\\%}$ ) on the 4-shot setting, and from 63.0 to 69.8 ( $\\%$ ) on the 8-shot setting.\n\nAdditionally, we can further confirm the improvements across different metrics from text quote [5]: RAR achieves improvements over the CLIP baseline and a 6.4 ( ${\\%}$ ) enhancement relative to Re-gionCLIP [57] across multiple datasets. These advancements underscore the efficacy of using an external memory for retrieval assistance coupled with the ranking prowess of MLLMs.\n\nTo better visualize the impact of RAR on each metric, we can refer to image 5: The table compares performance metrics (AP_r, AP_c, AP_f, AP_all) for different models and configurations. RAR models show improvements (indicated by the delta symbol and green highlights) over the baseline models (CLIP variants).

The table in text quote [5] and image5 provide the scores for various metrics.\n\n- BLEU is a popular $n$-gram matching metric but generally fails to recognize semantic similarity beyond the lexical level [10]. Its performance varies across language pairs.\n- CHRF is another $n$-gram matching metric but also tends to focus more on lexical-level features.\n- YiSi-1 is a metric proposed by Lo (2019). While its performance is not discussed in the text quotes, you can see from image5 its scores are not always the highest across the language pairs.\n- BERTScore (with both default and XLM-RoBERTa base settings) has shown auspicious correlations with human judgements, as presented in text quote [2]. However, its performance can also vary among language pairs as seen in both image1 and image5.\n- COMET-HTER, COMET-MQM, and COMET-RANK are the metrics introduced in the COMET framework [6]. From text quotes [7] and [8], it appears that COMET-RANK consistently outperforms other metrics across several language pairs, as it's highlighted in bold in both tables.\n\nIn image1, you can see that COMET-RANK achieves the highest score for several language pairs like de-en, fi-en, lt-en, ru-en, and zh-en; and in image5, it also outperforms most other metrics across various language pairs such as en-cs, en-de, en-fi, en-gu, en-kk, en-lt, en-ru, and en-zh.\n\nTo summarize, COMET-RANK consistently performs well across the language pairs for translation quality evaluation, outperforming other metrics such as BLEU, CHRF, YiSi-1, and BERTScore in many cases. However, it's important to note that the performance of these evaluation metrics may still differ depending on the specific language pairs.\n\n![Table 1 and Table 5 show results for various MT evaluation metrics across language pairs.

Each subplot contributes to understanding how the Chameleon models handle loss spikes during training.\n\n![The plots exhibit three cases of loss spikes in Chameleon models during training.](image1) [The instances of loss spikes in the training process.]\n![The curves show significant loss spikes for Chameleon-34B when norm reordering is not used, whereas it shows less severe spikes with norm reordering.](image3) [The use of norm reordering helps in reducing loss spikes in Chameleon-34B.]\n![The table highlights the use of QK-Norm and Z-loss, which help stabilize the Chameleon models, reducing the occurrence of loss spikes.](image5) [Chameleon models incorporate QK-Norm and Z-loss to achieve stability and reduce loss spikes during training.]"}

To test this hypothesis, we evaluated all systems on a male-only and female-only test set.

The results on the specific test set for the EN–FR dataset are presented in Table  3 . As hypothesized, the biggest BLEU score improvement is observed on the female test set, particularly the test sets containing ﬁrst person singular pronouns (F1).\n\n[3] For each of these language pairs we trained two NMT systems: a baseline and a tagged one. We evaluated the performance of all our systems on a randomly selected 2K general test set. Moreover, we further evaluated the EN–FR systems on 2K male-only and female-only test sets to have a look at the system performance with respect to gender-related issues.

Amazon-AWS gets 17% of its energy from renewable resources, while Microsoft gets 32%.\n\nNow, let's consider some implications for CO2 emissions:\n\n- **CO2 emissions from coal power plants are significantly higher** compared to renewable energy sources because burning fossil fuels releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. So, the larger proportion of energy coming from coal sources directly correlates with higher CO2 emissions.\n\n- **Renewable energy sources** like wind, solar, and hydropower produce much lower greenhouse gas emissions because they don't involve burning fossil fuels. Therefore, increasing the proportion of renewable energy can help reduce a company's carbon footprint.\n\nIn conclusion, both Amazon-AWS and Microsoft rely heavily on coal as an energy source, contributing to higher CO2 emissions.

Quote [6] explains that removing our R-GCN component strips the model of any inductive biases for multi-hop reasoning, resulting in a poorer performance when dealing with context.\n\nExamining the comparison table (image3), we can see that the configuration `GloVe w/o R-GCN` exhibits lower performance compared to configurations that include R-GCN (e.g., `full (ensemble)`, `full (single)`, and `GloVe with R-GCN`). This observation aligns with the insights gathered from the quoted text, confirming that R-GCN is crucial for better model performance.\n\nIn summary, removing R-GCN significantly reduces the model's performance in both unmasked and masked settings, as it denies the model the ability to capitalize on inductive biases for multi-hop reasoning.

In an ideal scenario, we would directly leverage human feedback to optimize the model parameters, following the framework in Figure 2(a): 1) Candidate outputs are generated by LLMs, 2) Humans provide feedback or refinements on these outputs, and 3) LLMs are then directly optimized on the collected (outputs, feedback) to better align with human preferences. A simple strategy is to fine-tune the model on the outputs that receive positive feedback from human raters (Glaese et al., 2022).\n\n[22b] Leveraging Multi-Agent Distillation for Self-Supervised Learning of Commonsense Graphs. This paper proposed a method for distilling knowledge into a smaller model by using multiple agents to learn common sense graph structures through self-supervised learning (Chen et al., 2022b).\n\n[21] Consensus-Based Self-Adaptive Dialogue Systems - A Comprehensive Survey.

However, the test set contains an equal number of neutral examples (196) compared to positive and negative examples (196 each).\n\n- Dataset **D2**: The Laptop14 training set includes 464 neutral examples between 994 positive examples and 870 negative examples.

However, the ratio of neutral examples in D3 and D4 is much lower, and the number of neutral test examples is particularly small. This variation in the distribution of neutral examples may influence the performance of the aspect-level sentiment classification models, as explained in [quote 2].\n\nIn summary, the distribution of neutral examples varies significantly across datasets D1 to D4, with D1 and D2 having more neutral examples than D3 and D4.

The character-level neural network (either an RNN or a CNN) enables the model to capture subword information such as morphological variations and capitalization patterns. On the other hand, the word-level neural network, usually an RNN, consumes word representations and produces context-sensitive hidden representations for each word. By utilizing both word-level and character-level embeddings as inputs, the model can leverage the context and finer-grained details of the words, improving its understanding and prediction ability for natural language tasks such as NER [5].\n\n![The Self-attentive Bi-LSTM-CRF model architecture](image5)\n\nThe figure above illustrates the Self-attentive Bi-LSTM-CRF model, which often employs both word-level and character-level embeddings inputs. As shown in the diagram, the Char Bi-LSTM layer processes character-level information, while the Word Embedding layer represents the semantic representation of each word in a vector form. By concatenating these two embeddings and feeding them into the Word Bi-LSTM layer, the model can effectively capture context from both the character and word levels, thereby enhancing its performance in tasks like Named Entity Recognition (NER)."}

The pre-processing section begins with an input image containing multiple objects of varying sizes. Each identifiable object is cropped and resized ([4]) to isolate the object of interest and ensure a consistent size for the image encoding. This step helps the model better understand the objects and focus only on them, as opposed to the whole image, which may contain irrelevant information ([7], [8]). This pre-processed image is then encoded into embeddings ([2a]) and used in a k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) search to retrieve possible labels ([2b]).\n\nFor instance, suppose the cropped and resized image features a flower and a vase ([2a]). In that case, the k-NN search will retrieve a list of likely labels associated with flowers and vases, such as \"flower arrangement,\" \"saltshaker,\" and \"vase,\" as demonstrated in the diagram ([2b]). This classification occurs at the zero-shot recognition stage, meaning the model hasn't been trained on specific classes or examples, but rather relies on the embeddings and their relationships to the training data during the retrieval process. This method helps object detection systems generalize better and better adapt to new, unseen classes. In summary, the pre-processing step adeptly handles variation in object sizes and positions while assisting the model in understanding and categorizing the object(s) of interest in a zero-shot recognition system.\n\nThe pre-processing step is essential to the operation of the RAR (Retrieving & Ranking) architecture described in the diagram (image1). In fact, we can identify the pre-processed images as the input to the RAR pipeline, on which the subsequent multimodal retrieval and ranking steps are performed. Consequently, improvements in pre-processing techniques can lead to enhancements in the zero-shot recognition performance of the overall RAR system.\n\n![The pre-processing section assists in zero-shot recognition by cropping and resizing object-containing images (image2) to facilitate their subsequent encoding and retrieval, allowing the model to focus on the relevant objects and minimize noise.]([image2])"}

The F1 scores for the Single-hop questions are higher (70.54) compared to the other types (45 and 56.16).

Many Modal QA ( Hannan et al. ,  2020 ) focuses on answer modality choice rather than knowledge ag- gregation or extraction. In MIMOQA ( Singh et al. , 2021 ), the task of extracting a multimodal answer is not necessarily knowledge-intensive. WebQA ( Chang et al. ,  2021 ) does have categorization but lacks fine-grained entities in many QA pairs, result- ing in more general questions and answers. Our proposed SnapNTell differs by including a wide range of fine-grained entities with representative images and explicit entity names in the answer sets. Additionally, it incorporates question-answer pairs that demand knowledge-intensive responses, going beyond simplistic binary answers.\n\n[4] In this work, we tackle the significant challenge VLLMs face with long-tail entity queries, which of- ten lead to inaccurate or hallucinated responses.

This task is designed to test models on entity recognition and their abil- ity to provide detailed, entity-specific knowledge in their responses.

However, we can approach this question through the given context and available information.\n\nFrom the image descriptions:\n- ProgramFC achieved the highest retrieval recall on the HOVER dataset in the 4-hop scenarios compared to one-step retrieval (image4).\n- InstructGPT models, including Self-Ask, were evaluated on the HOVER and FEVEROUS datasets (image2). However, the table does not provide specific scores for the Self-Ask variant on the HOVER dataset, making it difficult to directly compare it to the ProgramFC performance on the same dataset.\n\nEven though we don't have specific scores for the InstructGPT model with Self-Ask in the closed-book setting on the HOVER dataset with 10 retrieved paragraphs, the information provided suggests that ProgramFC performs better in the 4-hop scenarios on HOVER compared to InstructGPT on FEVEROUS (where InstructGPT could have the best scores, but we don't have individual models' scores).\n\nBased on this information, we might hypothesize that InstructGPT with Self-Ask could have a lower performance (while still above random guessing) in the closed-book setting on the HOVER dataset with 10 retrieved paragraphs, considering that ProgramFC outperforms other models in 4-hop scenarios. Yet, it's important to note that this is an assumption based on context and available information, not a direct quote.\n\n![Closed-book setting performance of InstructGPT with Self-Ask on HOVER (10 retrievals) is hypothesized to be lower than ProgramFC in 4-hop scenarios](image5)\n\n[Context: [8], [9], [10]; Image: image2]"}

Here we have two text quotes [2] and [4] that discuss the Engagingness metric:\n\n[2] In conclusion, we showed that retrieval models can be successfully used to improve generation models in dialogue, helping them avoid common issues such as producing short sentences with frequent words that ultimately are not engaging. Our RetNRef ++   model has similar statistics to human utterances and provides more engaging conversa- tions according to human judgments.\n\n[4] Word Statistics Another way to measure the salience of a generation model is to compare it to human utterances in terms of word statistics. We analyze the word statistics of our models in Table 2 . Seq2Seq models are known to produce short sentences with more common words than humans. The statistics on the ConvAI2 dataset bear this out, where the Seq2Seq model responses have lower word and character counts and use fewer rare words than the human responses. The RetNRef model (using the Memory Network retriever, re- trieving from the training set) makes some improvements in this regard, e.g. doubling the use of rare words (with frequency less than 100) and smaller gains for words with frequency less than 1000, but are still not close to human statistics. The RetNRef ++   model which boosts the use of the retrieval does better in this regard, making the statistics much closer to human ones. Of course these metrics do not measure whether the utter- ances are semantically coherent, but it is encour- aging to see a model using rare words as without this we believe it is hard for it to be engaging.\n\nFrom the discussion in the text quotes, it is clear that the RetNRef ++ model, in particular, impresses with its Engagingness, as it comes closer to human performance in this metric. However, no exact Engagingness score is provided.\n\nNow let's consider the image quotes:\n\n- image4 shows the Engagingness score for different methods, but the image does not specify the version of the RetNRef model tested.\n- image5 shows a simulation of a conversation, but it doesn't include Engagingness scores for the models.\n\nSince we don't have a specific Engagingness score for RetNRef ++ in the provided evidence, it's unfortunately not possible to give a definitive answer to which method scored the highest in the Engagingness metric based on the information presented.\n\nHowever, according to the text quotes, RetNRef ++ provides more engaging conversations compared to other models, with its statistics (word and character counts, rare word usage) being closer to human utterances.\n\n![The RetNRef ++ model provides more engaging conversations compared to other models](image4)"}

The two angled sides measure 4 units and 8 units, respectively. The question asks for the lengths and angles of the triangle.\n\nTo find the hypotenuse's length, we can utilize the Pythagorean theorem. In the text quote [4], it is mentioned that this theorem states that $\\mathsf{a}^{2}+\\mathsf{b}^{2}=\\mathsf{c}^{2}$ for a right triangle, where a and b are the two legs and c is the hypotenuse.

This model, unlike previous approaches, jointly handles both categorical and non-categorical slots, and it adapts a single BERT question answering model to interact directly with the dialog context [5].\n\nComparing its performance with DS-Picklist, we find that our model (DS-DST) outperforms it for some slots, including `taxi-leave at` and `train-arrive by` [7]. This is because, for these slots, their values usually have different expressions and cannot be extracted from the dialog context, which makes span-based methods such as DS-Span less effective. On the other hand, their values can be predicted directly from the candidate-value lists, as shown in Table 4 [6].\n\n![Comparative Performance of DS-DST and DS-Picklist](image2)\n\nHowever, it is crucial to note that our model performs better when it has access to the full ontology [3]. In real-world scenarios, it may be challenging to have access to the full ontology, which could potentially impact the performance of DS-DST.\n\n![DS-DST Model Architecture](image3)\n\nFrom the visualized model architecture (image3), we can see that DS-DST consists of two main components: a fixed BERT model and a fine-tuned BERT model. The fixed BERT model works as a feature extractor, processing the candidate-value list for each categorical slot, while the fine-tuned BERT model interprets context and domain-slot information.\n\nFor the specific slots of interest, `taxi-leave at` and `train-arrive by`, the fixed BERT model would process the candidate-value lists containing various departure times, and the fine-tuned BERT model would interpret the context and dialogue to correctly predict these values.\n\nIn conclusion, DS-DST performs better than DS-Span for `taxi-leave at` and `train-arrive by` slots when given access to the full ontology. However, it may be less effective in real-world scenarios where access to the full ontology is limited.\n\n![Slot-level Accuracy on MultiWOZ 2.1 Test Set](image4)\n\n[1] On the other hand, we also investigated slots whose ground-truth values can be found through span matching, and we did not observe a signiﬁ- cant difference between the three methods. This means that both the non-categorical and categorical methods perform similarly when target values are explicitly mentioned in the dialogues. Therefore, when most of the slot values can be found directly in the dialog context, these slots can be treated as either non-categorical slots or categorical slots.\n\n[2] Table 3: Joint accuracy on the test sets of MultiWOZ 2.1. BERT-DST is the model used in MultiWOZ 2.1. BERT-DST-Picklist is the original model described in ( Rastogi et al. ,  2020 ), where a full ontology is required and all the slots are treated as categorical slots,. ‘single turn’ and ‘whole dialog history’ represent the Bert utterance inputs are the current dialog turn and the whole dialog history, respectively.\n\n[3] Comparing DS-Span and DS-DST, we can ﬁnd that jointly using the non-categorical and categori- cal approaches is indeed helpful in multi-domain DST. When the model has access to the full on- tology, DS-Picklist shows that our method could further improve the DST performance. Although DS-Picklist is higher than DS-DST, in real scenar- ios, it may be nontrivial to have access to the full on- tology. In the paper, we jointly train the three mod-\n\n[4] Examples Table  6  shows three examples of di- alogue turns in the validation set. In the ﬁrst ex- ample, we can see that DS-Span cannot correctly extract the ground-truth values, because the User does not always explicitly mention ‘ yes ’ or ‘ no ’ when being asked about the internet or parking requests. In the second example, the User and the System are talking about a swimming pool, but they just say ‘ pool ’ and its meaning can be inferred from the context. As a result, DS-Span can only extract ‘ pool ’ as a value, which is not sufﬁcient. In the third example, all the predictions are semantically correct; however, in terms of the string match, only DS-Picklist can correctly predict the value. The two other methods rely on span extraction. This is caused by formatting issues; that is, it is not always guaranteed that strings in the context satisfy de- sired formats, such as time expressions. Based on our analysis, future work needs to consider more relevant evaluation metrics than the widely-used\n\n[5] Inspired by the task-oriented dialog schema design in ( Rastogi et al. ,  2020 ) and the recent success- ful experience in locating text spans in machine reading comprehensions ( Gao et al. ,  2019b ;  Asai et al. ,  2019 ). we design a simple yet effective  D ual- S trategy  D ialog  S tate  T racking model ( DS-DST ), which adapts a single BERT question answering model to jointly handle both the categorical and non-categorical slots, and different with previous approaches on multi-domain DST, we enable the model with direct interactions between dialog con- text and the slot. We decide whether a slot belongs to a non-categorical slot or a categorical slot by following the heuristics from ( Rastogi et al. ,  2020 ). For example, it is common that when users book hotels, the requests for parking are usually  yes  or no  with limited choices. These kinds of slots are deﬁned as categorical slots, and the slot values are selected over a partial ontology. In addition, how long the user will stay has unlimited values and it can be found in the context. These kinds of slots are treated as non-categorical slots, and the values are found trough span matching in the dialog context. Hence, the model is ﬂexible depending on the access level to the ontology or whether the values of slots could be found directly in the dialog context.\n\n[6] Table 4: The slot-level accuracy on the test set of Mul- tiWOZ 2.1.   $^{\\circ}+/-^{\\circ}$   indicates absolute performance im- provement/degradation compared with DS-Span. The numbers highlighted in bold indicate that the differ- ence is signiﬁcant   $(p\\,<\\,0.05)$  , tested by bootstrap re- sampling ( Noreen ,  1989 ). The slots above the ﬁrst dashed line are categorical slots and the slots below the ﬁrst dashed line are non-categorical slots for DS-DST. The last row shows the average slot accuracy.\n\n[7] Now that we have observed that DS-DST and DS-Picklist perform much better than DS-Span, we focus on where the accuracy improvement comes from. Table  4  shows the accuracy for each slot type on the MultiWOZ 2.1 test set, and we can observe signiﬁcant improvement over the DS-Span baseline for some slots, including  hotel-type ,  attraction- type ,  attraction-name ,  hotel-internet  and  hotel- parking . This is because their values usually have different expressions and cannot be extracted from the dialog context, which decreases the performance of the span-based methods. In contrast, their values can be predicted directly from the candidate-value lists. Compared with other slots, these slots still have space for improvements.\n\n[8] We present outputs of DS-Span and DS-DST in all the turns for two dialogues (i.e.,  MUL0729 , PMUL2428 ) on the validation set of the MultiWOZ 2.1. Table  7  and Table  8  show the predicted dialog states for  MUL0729  and  PMUL2428 , respectively. In Table  7 ,  hotel type  and  hotel internet  are pre- dicted incorrectly by DS-Span, where the value  yes of  hotel internet  has a different description  free wiﬁ in the dialog context. For this type of values, DS- Span cannot ﬁnd the spans directly in the dialog context. In Table  8 , DS-Span does not correctly predict the state  <taxi, departure, funky fun house> at the  $6_{t h}$   turn.\n\n[9] To further investigate the differences and impor- tance of strong interactions, we reproduce the orig- inal BERT-DST model described in ( Rastogi et al. , 2020 ). In addition, we compare with ToD-BERT ( Wu et al. ,  2020 ), which is a large pre-trained model based on several task-oriented dialogue datasets, and it also separately encodes dialog context and domain-slot pairs. We show the results in Table  3 .   3 We observe that our model is consistently much bet- ter than BERT-DST and BERT-DST-Picklist. More- over, our models based on BERT surpass the strong ToD-BERT. We conclude that our improvements come from the strong interactions between slots and dialog context.

Table  5  shows the top-10 slots, according to the ratio of ground-truth slot values which cannot be found through span matching. That is, for such examples, DS-Span cannot extract the ground-truth strings, resulting in the low joint accuracy. Here, we show how well our DS-DST and DS-Picklist can correctly predict the missing values in DS-Span. As we can see in this table, the two methods dra- matically reduce the errors for some slots such as attraction-type ,  hotel-internet  and  hotel-parking Hence, for these kinds of slots, it is better to treat them as categorical slots. Among the top-10 slots, the  time -related slots such as  taxi-leave at  and  train- arrive by , which are span-based slots in DS-DST, DS-Span and DS-DST cannot perform well as there are no span matching in the dialogue context, and only few values (i.e., ‘ none ’ and ‘ dontcare ’) can be correctly predicted by the slot-gate classiﬁcation. When the ontology is accessible, DS-Picklist can further reduce the error rates, since the predicted values can be found in the candidate-values lists."}

Retrieval models on the other hand can surface interesting responses, but are restricted to the given retrieval set leading to erroneous replies that cannot be tuned to the specific context. In this work we develop a model that combines the two approaches to avoid both their deﬁciencies: ﬁrst retrieve a response and then reﬁne it – the ﬁnal sequence generator treating the retrieval as ad- ditional context. We show on the recent C ON - V AI2 challenge task our approach produces responses superior to both standard retrieval and generation models in human evaluations.\n\n![The RetNRef++ model produces longer sentences in terms of word count](image4)\n\n[2] For the generator, we use a standard Seq2Seq model: a 2-layer LSTM with attention. For the retriever, we use the Key-Value Memory Network (Miller et al., 2016) already shown to perform well for this dataset (Zhang et al., 2018), which attends over the dialogue history, to learn input and candidate retrieval embeddings that match using cosine similarity. The top scoring utterance is provided as input to our Seq2Seq model in order to reﬁne it, prepended with a special separator token. For both models we use the code available in ParlAI 2. At test time the retriever retrieves candidates from the training set.\n\n[3] Memory Network Retriever in terms of engage- ment, in line with previous results. We also tried overtraining the Seq2Seq for 100 epochs instead of early stopping by validation on perplexity as it may overfit training sentences and act more as a retriever, but this did not help.\n\n[4] Sequence generation models like Seq2Seq (Sutskever et al., 2014) are increasingly popular for tasks such as machine translation (MT) and summarization, where generation is suitably constrained by the source sentence. However, obtaining good performance on dialogue tasks, where the context still allows many interpretations, remains an open problem despite much recent work (Serban et al., 2016). Several authors report the issue that they produce short, generic sentences containing frequent words – the so-called “I don’t know” problem – as that response can work as a reply in many instances, but is uninformative and unengaging. Retrieval models (Ji et al., 2014) do not have this problem, but instead either produce engaging responses or else completely erroneous ones which they cannot tune to the specific context, as they can only produce a valid reply if it is in the retrieval set.\n\n[5] To compute a statistically more meaningful test, and to evaluate models more clearly against each other, we also tested models by pairing them against each other (different to the protocol previously used for this dataset). We took human-human paired dialogues from the test set, up to a randomly chosen turn, and then computed the response of two rival models. The resulting dialogue history and the two choices are given to a third an- notator to evaluate and asked which model is best; they can also choose “unsure”. We collected over 1000 such examples, with each conversation being evaluated twice. The results are given in Table 5.\n\n[6] Word Statistics Another way to measure the salience of a generation model is to compare it to human utterances in terms of word statistics. We analyze the word statistics of our models in Table 2. Seq2Seq models are known to produce short sentences with more common words than humans. The statistics on the ConvAI2 dataset bear this out, where the Seq2Seq model responses have lower word and character counts and use fewer rare words than the human responses. The RetNRef model (using the Memory Network retriever, retrieving from the training set) makes some improvements in this regard, e.g. doubling the use of rare words (with frequency less than 100) and smaller gains for words with frequency less than 1000, but are still not close to human statistics. The RetNRef ++   model which boosts the use of the retrieval does better in this regard, making the statistics much closer to human ones. Of course these metrics do not measure whether the utter- ances are semantically coherent, but it is encouraging to see a model using rare words as without this we believe it is hard for it to be engaging.\n\n[7] The results are given in Table 4. They show engagingness scores superior to Seq2Seq for all RetNRef variants, and with $\\mathbf{Set}\\mathbf{NRef}^{++}$    slightly outperforming the retriever which it conditions on. Importantly however, it maintains this performance whilst still being able to generate text which a retrieval model cannot. It also performs well in the other metrics, although like the Memory Network model, it is weaker at using the persona than Seq2Seq. Seq2Seq is inferior to the $\\mathbf{Set}\\mathbf{NRef}^{++}$    model in generating longer sentences, as demonstrated in the image accompanying this answer.\n\nIn conclusion, the `RetNRef++` model produces longer sentences in terms of word count compared to the Seq2Seq model. The table in the image provided (image4) supports this observation with the RetNRef++ model consistently surpassing the Seq2Seq model in terms of word count."}

However, adding more components (reasons and claims) to the model slightly reduces its overall performance.\n\nThese results demonstrate that the BERT model's test performance is not significantly affected by the introduction of different components in the model, though the maximum performance does seem to be influenced by the addition of warrants alone. However, as the Table Quote [2] suggests, the entirety of BERT's performance can be accounted for in terms of exploiting spurious statistical cues, so the performance gains observed may not reflect a true understanding of the argument comprehension task.\n\nFor a more robust assessment of argument comprehension, those spurious statistical cues should be eliminated, as described in the Image Quote [3]. The resulting adversarial dataset, presented in the Image Quote [4], would provide a more meaningful evaluation of machine argument comprehension. When trained and evaluated on this adversarial dataset, the BERT model's performance drops significantly, as shown in the Image Quote [7].\n\nIn summary, the BERT model shows varying test performance across different configurations, but all configurations rely on exploiting spurious statistical cues for their performance. A more robust evaluation of argument comprehension requires eliminating these cues, as demonstrated by the adversarial dataset.\n\n[1]: Table 1: Baselines and BERT results. Our results com m 20 different random seeds ( ±  gives the standard deviation). The mean for BERT Large is skewed by the  $5/20$   random seeds for which it failed to train, a problem noted by  Devlin et al.  ( 2018 ). We therefore consider the median a better measure of BERT’s average performance. The mean of the non-degenerate runs for BERT (Large) is    $0.716\\pm0.04$  .\n[3]: Table 3: Results of probing experiments with BERT Large, and the BoV and BiLSTM baselines. These re-sults indicate that BERT’s peak    $77\\%$   performance can be entirely accounted for by exploiting spurious cues. By just considering warrants (W) we can get to    $71\\%$  . Adding cues over reasons (R, W) and claims (C, W) accounts for the remaining six points.\n[7]: Table 4. BERT’s peak performance has reduced to    $53\\%$  , with mean and median at    $50\\%$  . We conclude from these results that the adversarial dataset has successfully eliminated the cues as expected, provid- ing a more robust evaluation of machine argument comprehension. This result better apts with our intuitions about this task: with little to no understanding about the reality underlying these argu- ments, good performance shouldn’t be feasible."}

Let's delve into the provided quotes and images.\n\nFirst off, [1] alludes to the College of Engineering in NTU, offering a topnotch curriculum, but no specific mention of using year 3 students as cover page models is made.\n\n[8] talks about the Mechanical Engineering programme, emphasizing the enriching learning journey and opportunities to explore interests outside the curriculum. Apparently, no mention of using year 3 students as cover page models is discussed here.\n\n[9] and [10] mention Nanyang Business School (NBS), promising an environment designed to nurture driven business leaders. Yet, no direct evidence about using year 3 students as cover page models can be found within these quotes.\n\nNow, let's turn our attention to the images:\n\n- Image1 showcases a theme of progress or achievement, suggesting that merely being in one of the prestigious colleges within NTU (like the ones we explored in the quotes above) can lead to such achievements. However, it doesn't directly answer the question about year 3 students as cover page models.\n\n- Image2 depicts recognition in the field of Education, with the institution ranked 11th in the QS World University Rankings for 2023, and a history of more than 70 years in teacher preparation and professional development. Yet again, no connection to year 3 students as cover page models can be inferred.\n\n- Image3 presents collaboration and interaction between people, possibly suggesting the potential for networking and exchanges among students at NTU. However, it's not explicitly connected to our question.\n\n- Image4 highlights themes related to science, engineering, technology, or data analysis, which are integral parts of the diverse educational offerings at NTU. Yet, it doesn't provide any hints about year 3 student models.\n\n- Image5 portrays global communication, networking, or social connectivity within an educational context, but, again, no mention of year 3 student models can be found here.\n\nFinally, we find a clue in [6], which mentions a student who completed a comprehensive curriculum at NBS, benefiting from numerous opportunities. Nonetheless, without explicit information linking the student to the role as a cover page model, it's quite challenging to provide a definitive answer to the question.\n\nIn conclusion, while there's not a direct answer within the provided quotes, the interleaved evidence suggests that the possibility of using year 3 students as cover page models may exist within NTU, possibly in certain colleges or schools. To find an accurate answer, it is advisable to consult the official NTU website or reach out to the administrative offices of specific colleges or schools for more specific information.\n\n![A possibility of using year 3 students as cover page models exists within NTU, but more specific information is needed.](image6)"}

This metric measures the proportion of time spent moving flow items forward compared to the total elapsed time.

Reference [4] and [9] provide a list of public holidays in 2016 and 2017, but they don't cover the exact timeframe you've provided (15 May 2016 to 15 Jan 2017).\n\nHowever, we can use some logical reasoning to find this information. Let's examine the table provided in image1 (Academic Calendar and University Holidays), it shows the duration of the 2016-2017 academic year with the holiday periods highlighted. Based on the visual representation, we can see that the academic year starts in late-July 2016 and ends in early-May 2017.\n\nSo, for the time frame 15 May 2016 to 15 Jan 2017, we can excluded the following holiday periods (mentioned in image4 and [8]):\n\n1. National Day - 9 Aug 2016 (Tuesday)\n2. Hari Raya Haji - 12 Sep 2016 (Monday)\n3. Deepavali - 29 Oct 2016 (Saturday)\n4. Christmas Day - 25 Dec 2016 (Sunday)\n5.

Vesak Day - 10 May 2017 (Wednesday)\n10. Hari Raya Puasa - 25 Jun 2017 (Sunday)\n\nRegarding Hari Raya Puasa, the date in the list (image4) falls outside the given timeframe, so it doesn't affect our count.\n\nNow, let's subtract the holiday periods mentioned above from the total number of weeks in the timeframe to find the number of regular weekdays:\n\nWeeks in timeframe = (End Date - Start Date) / 7\n                            = (15-Jan-2017 - 15-May-2016) / 7 ≈ 52 weeks (rounded)\n\nHoliday weeks = 6 (already computed from the list)\n\nRegular weekdays within the given timeframe = Total weeks - Holiday weeks\n                                                            = 52 - 6\n                                                            = **46 weekdays**\n\nHowever, it is important to note that some exceptions might apply due to university events or exams that may cause adjustments in the normal class schedule. Since the document does not provide such detailed information explicitly, no further conclusion can be drawn based on the given data.\n\nRegarding the image, here's a brief description:\n![This image shows a cozy lounge area with people working and relaxing, giving an impression of a university or student-centric space where people can gather, converse, or study](image5)\n\nIn summary, within the timeframe 15 May 2016 to 15 Jan 2017, there appear to be approximately 46 regular weekdays without explicit university holidays; however, some exceptions may apply due to university events or exams not mentioned in the document."}

Begin by checking if your dishwasher is level [1] using a spirit level on the door and rack track inside the tub. Adjust the three levelling legs individually if necessary [2]. Remember, it's important to pay attention to not let the dishwasher tip over during this process [3]. Here's an image of a dishwasher rack with various kitchen items placed inside it (image1) as a visual guide for proper loading.\n\n2. Once the dishwasher is level, load the dishes in the dishwasher. Start by pulling out the lower basket and loading large and difficult-to-clean items such as spots, pans, lids, serving dishes, and bowls into the lower basket (as shown in image1). Refer to point [6] for more specific load placement suggestions. Ensure that utensils are stacked securely and can't tip over [9].\n\n3. After loading the lower basket, move on to the upper basket and load it with more delicate and lighter dishware such as glasses, coffee, and tea cups (as per point [9]). Arrange long bladed knives in an upright position, and store long and sharp items of cutlery horizontally in the upper basket (as per point [10]). Here's an image of a dishwasher rack with a numbered guide indicating different dishware items (image4) as a reference.\n\n4. Place items such as cups, glasses, pots/pans, etc., faced downwards [5] in the dishwasher to ensure efficient washing. Avoid placing dishes and items of cutlery inside one another or covering each other, and do not let glasses touch one another [9].\n\n5. Pour in the detergent [4], insert the plug into the socket [4], and make sure the water supply is turned on to full pressure [4].\n\n6. Close the door, press the Power button to switch on the machine [4]. Choose a program based on your specific needs [4]. The response light will turn on indicating that the program is selected [4].\n\n7. Press the Start/Pause button [4], and the dishwasher will start its cycle.\n\n8. It's essential to secure the dishwasher in place [8]. You can do this by either putting the installation hook into the slot of the side plane and securing it to the work surface with wood screws (A, normal work surface) or fixing the side with screws (B, marble or granite worktop) [8].\n\n9. Finally, remember that non-compliance with the loading can result in poor washing quality (warning sign in image3). So, always load the baskets following the previously mentioned guidelines.\n\nBy adhering to these loading guidelines, you are guaranteed to achieve optimal washing quality for your dishwasher as per the provided guide.

This support extends to local communities by helping them build and expand their vector-borne disease surveillance and detection capabilities [5].\n\n![NAMRU-3 Emblem](image2)\nThe emblem of NAMRU-3 shows an anchor with wings and a DNA strand, symbolizing the unit's mission to support both military and medical research.\n\n[3] The Development of the Pa-tient Condition Occurrence Frequency (PCOF) tool is another example of how U.S. Naval Medical Research Centers contribute to military medical planning by providing functional and accurate means of estimating patient occurrence frequencies for various combat and noncombat scenarios [3;4]. These estimates benefit both military personnel and local communities involved in humanitarian assistance, disaster relief, and defense support of civil authorities operations.\n\n![Medical Aid in Djibouti](image3)\nThis image shows a U.S. medical officer, Lt. j.g. Michael Rucker, treating the feet of a 7-year-old girl from Djibouti, demonstrating the healthcare services provided to local communities.\n\nIn conclusion, the activities of the U.S. Naval Medical Research Units support both military personnel and local communities across different regions by implementing force health protection policies, conducting medical research, and offering healthcare services in various contexts, such as combat or humanitarian aid. The U.S. Naval Medical Research Units work closely with international partners like the Navy Entomology Center of Excellence (NECE), the Liberian Institute of Biomedical Research (LIBR), and the Armed Forces of Liberia (AFL) to achieve these goals.\n\n![NAMRU-3 Leadership in Liberia](image4)\nThis image shows Col. Vernon Graham, Capt. Chris Martinez, Capt. Buhari Oyofo, and other military leaders from the U.S. and Liberia collaborating on medical projects, demonstrating the partnership between military units and local communities.\n\n[4] The PCOF tables generated by the tool encompass wounded in action, non-battle injuries, diseases, and outpatient visits for different scenarios, ensuring accurate patient occurrence estimates for various military operations. This information is crucial for the development of patient streams required for health care simulations that benefit both military personnel and local communities [4].\n\n![Group Photo](image5)\nThis image shows a group of individuals from various organizations posing together, symbolizing the collaboration between different organizations to support both military personnel and local communities across different regions."}

This tool is particularly valuable in scenarios such as humanitarian assistance, disaster relief, defense support of civil authorities, and various combat operations [10].\n\nThe PCOF tool generates tables that show the occurrence probabilities of disease and injury types sustained by a population at risk. These tables are crafted for specific combat or noncombat scenarios within the range of military operations (ROMO) [10]. Prior to the introduction of the PCOF tool, the military medical planning community lacked a functional and accurate means of estimating such data, which are essential for creating the patient streams used in health care simulations [10].\n\nUsing an accredited PCOF tool, planners can employ baselined, mission-centric patient condition data and tailor it to fit the anticipated mission more precisely [6]. This helps inform decision-makers about the types of patient conditions to expect, ultimately enhancing medical mission planning [6].\n\n![A PCOF tool aids military operations by enabling the development of accurate patient occurrence estimates.](image10)\n\nIn summary, the PCOF tool contributes significantly to military operations by providing a robust foundation for medical mission planning, ensuring that decision-makers can make informed choices based on precise and repeatable data about the patient conditions they might encounter."}

[1][3][4]\n\nOne of the key aspects of the training was the provision of training for 160 Afghan scientists and technicians on laboratory operations, diagnostic procedures, and ethics in research and management, including work involving U.S. select agents. [2][8] This extensive training was developed based on the needs and gaps identified by NAMRU-3's laboratory assessments. [2][7] The training program in 2012 consisted of nine modules on various topics such as parasitology, bacteriology, bioscience facility management, clinical epidemiology, and virology, among others. [7]\n\nApart from the comprehensive training plan, NAMRU-3 also conducted workshops to train laboratory and administrative staff. These workshops focused on proper laboratory procedures, establishing inventory for supplies, instituing quality control procedures and standard operating procedures, purchasing reliable supplies, and developing national laboratory biosafety and laboratory quality control plans. [9]\n\nIn addition to formal training, NAMRU-3 provided a specifically tailored training materials for the Afghan trainees, taking into account cultural practices. [10] The initial engagement was mainly centered around the Ministry of Public Health (MoPH) and the Afghan Public Health Institute. [3] NAMRU-3 later expanded its training to include additional facilities in Kabul, with plans for other regions of Afghanistan. [3]\n\nA prime example of the impact of these trainings can be seen in the quote from NAMRU-3 trainee, Nador, expressing her gratitude for the training in vector surveillance, vector biology/identification, and vector control, stating, “The knowledge and the equipment provided by NAMRU-3 has very much improved our ability to protect our soldiers and their families from disease.” [6]\n\n![Conducting laboratory training](image2)\n![Implementing proper laboratory procedures](image9)"}

It was noted that the liver cell presents Pf peptides on its surface via MHC Class I molecules [1]. This presentation initiates an immune response, where the CD8+ T-cell releases perforin and granzymes, inducing apoptosis (cell death) in the infected liver cell and the hidden parasite within.\n\nIn addition, interaction between IFN-γ (interferon gamma) and Fas/FasR (a death receptor and its ligand) is indicated [1], reinforcing the role of the immune system in destroying the infected liver cell and malaria parasites.\n\nOverall, the immune system strategically targets malaria parasites within liver cells by utilizing CD8+ T-cells, perforin, granzymes, and immune signaling molecules like IFN-γ and Fas/FasR to destroy the parasites and infected cells.\n\n[![CD8 T cell and liver cell interaction](image1)](image1)"}

However, patient access to medical records remains low, only 2% in 2006 [image3, point 10].\n\nNow, considering quote [9] about the future system and image4, we can expect that access to patient clinical information and physician access for clinical orders will increase significantly over the next two years [image4, points 5 and 6]. Intriguingly, the current use of intranet functions seems to be dropping, whereas the expected usage in two years shows a significant decrease in organizations without an intranet [image4, point 7].\n\nMoreover, quote [6] suggests that the current system fragments patient information and creates redundant, inefficient efforts. However, quote [3] mentions that future systems aim to consolidate information and provide a foundation for unifying efforts. This change is expected to be facilitated by the increased use of computerized medical information systems as per image2. Specifically, we can notice an increase in the adoption of Electronic Medical Records, Digital Picture Archiving (PACS), and Point-of-Care Decision Support over the years [image2, points 1, 7, and 6].\n\nLastly, it's worth highlighting that reducing medical errors has shown notable improvement between 2005 and 2006 according to image1 (from 44% to 57%).

The in-depth Analysis phase (represented by a magnifying glass) plays a crucial role in this chain by revealing insights from the reported data.\n\nFinally, image1, a graph showing the load average on \"server14,\" demonstrates the benefits of data analysis. Notice the spikes in load around Thursday 00:00 and Thursday 06:00. By analyzing this data, we could determine the cause of these spikes and take proactive measures to address potential issues, enhancing overall server performance and efficiency.\n\nIn conclusion, the transition from Business Intelligence to Business Analytics not only enriches data handling by moving beyond mere reporting and drilldown but also generates more profound insights that can lead to improved decision-making and value creation across an organization.\n\n![The figure demonstrates how Business Intelligence evolves into Business Analytics, resulting in increased insights generation and valuable outcomes.](image3)\n![The comparison of Reporting and Analysis reveals an upgrade in data handling and insights production by transforming data into information and then into actionable insights.](image5)\n![The graph on server14’s load average highlights the benefits of data analysis in addressing potential issues, resulting in improved performance and efficiency.](image1)"}

This trend suggests a significant growth in the Big Data market over the years.\n\nTo further understand the revenue trend from 2011, let's inspect the image1 that depicts the yearly big data revenue in millions of US dollars for various pure-play vendors in 2011. The total revenue for all the vendors listed is $468 million, with Vertica ($84 million), Opera Solutions ($75 million), and Mu Sigma ($55 million) as the top three vendors in terms of revenue. The \"Other\" category collectively represents vendors not individually listed, with a combined revenue of $10 million [11].\n\nHowever, to find out which companies led the revenue in 2011, it's important to note that image1 only reflects the revenue of pure-play companies, whereas larger companies like IBM, Intel, and HP might have Big Data revenues exceeding $100 million, as shown in image2.\n\nIn image2, we can see that IBM has the highest revenue above $100 million in 2011.

This phenomenon is known as diminishing marginal utility.\n\nIn standard consumption economics, focusing on a single good or activity often leads to less overall utility due to this diminishing marginal utility [image1, quote 8]. Variety can help alleviate this issue by providing different sources of utility as preferences shift with accumulated experience [image1, quote 10].\n\nPractice can increase utility by enhancing an individual's ability to perform an activity and potentially leading to better outcomes [image2]. However, an excessive focus on a single activity might hinder the exploration of other activities which could offer differing utilities [image3].

Parental generation (P) plants with homozygous alleles (PP for purple flowers and pp for white flowers) produce gametes. When the two types are crossed, the F1 hybrids (Pp) are all inherited the dominant purple allele, resulting in all offspring displaying the dominant purple phenotype.\n\nHowever, in the F2 generation, the F1 hybrids (Pp) produce gametes with a 1:1 ratio of P and p alleles. Since both purple and white alleles are present, we observe variations in the phenotype within the F2 offspring.\n\n![F2 Offspring Ratio](image5)\n\nIn the F2 generation, the genotypic ratio is 1 PP: 2 Pp: 1 pp. The 1 PP genotype is homozygous dominant, resulting in purple phenotype plants only carrying the dominant allele. The 2 Pp genotypes are heterozygous, carrying one copy of each allele (P and p). They exhibit the dominant purple phenotype, explaining three-quarters of the purple phenotypes observed in the F2 generation. The 1 pp genotype is homozygous recessive, resulting in whitephenotype plants only carrying the recessive allele. This explains one-quarter of the observed white phenotypes in the F2 generation.\n\nIn summary, Mendelian inheritance explains the phenotypic and genotypic ratios observed in the F2 generation of pea plants by demonstrating how the ratio of dominant to recessive alleles influences the outcome of thegenetic crosses and the expression of phenotypes.

It suggests that in the F1 generation, the dominant trait seemed to disappear, only to reappear in one quarter of the F2 offspring.\n\nTo support the answer visually, consider image4, which illustrates a genetic cross diagram showing the inheritance of traits in plants. It shows the F1 generation (Hybrids) as heterozygous (Pp), displaying the dominant purple phenotype. The F2 generation is produced from the F1 hybrids (Pp) and has a genotypic ratio of 1 PP: 2 Pp: 1 pp.\n\nBased on this evidence, the phenotypic ratio observed in the F2 generation of the plant cross is 3 purple to 1 white. This is because:\n\n- PP (homozygous dominant) plants produce purple flowers,\n- Pp (heterozygous) plants produce purple flowers as well,\n- pp (homozygous recessive) plants produce white flowers.\n\nSo, for every 4 offspring in the F2 generation, we expect 3 to have the dominant purple trait and 1 to have the recessive white trait—resulting in a 3:1 phenotypic ratio.\n\nAlternatively, if you prefer a text-focused answer:\n\n1. **Genotypic Ratio**: The genotypic ratio in the F2 generation is 1 PP: 2 Pp: 1 pp (homozygous dominant, heterozygous, and homozygous recessive, respectively).\n\n2. **Phenotypic Ratio**: The phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation is 3 purple to 1 white, due to the dominance of the purple flower trait.\n\n![F2 Generation Ratio](image4)"}

In Brussels, for instance, you'll find both the Embassy Brussels and the U.S. Mission to the European Union, as well as the U.S. Mission to NATO. Similarly, Nairobi hosts Embassy Nairobi, U.S. Mission Nairobi, U.S. Mission to UNEP, and U.S. Mission to UN-HABITAT ([10]).\n\nThe presence of the Department of State in such cities contributes to collaborating effectively with international organizations like the African Union, the European Union, the United Nations, and NATO. This kind of partnership enables the Department to advance its diplomatic efforts and maintain a meaningful presence in critical regions.\n\nIn addition to city-based collaborations, the Department of State also contributes to multilateral institutions such as the United Nations, NATO, and the UNESCO. The Department's engagement with these organizations helps promote American foreign policy objectives and facilitate cooperation among nations ([6]).\n\nFinally, the Department of State works closely with USAID to support foreign affairs activities and deliver security, economic opportunities, and global solutions to challenges that directly impact American lives ([7]). This collaboration allows both institutions to collaborate more efficiently and address shared concerns on a global scale.\n\nIn conclusion, the U.S. Department of State supports its diplomatic efforts in cities with multiple international organizations by maintaining a presence in key cities like Brussels, Nairobi, and others, and through active participation in multilateral institutions, as well as working collaboratively with organizations such as USAID.\n\n![U.S. Department of State Organization Chart](image2-4)\n\nThe provided image (image2) is a depiction of the U.S. Department of State Organization Chart (page 11).

However, to compare this with findings about what people remember when they hear information, we can turn to the text quote [1]. The first quote states that people can only remember up to 4 chunks of information at a time, but it doesn't directly provide information about the retention of this information after three days.\n\nIt's worth noting that another text quote [2] does imply that visual content is more likely to be remembered, as outlined in TED Talks that are almost all 20 minutes long [10]. Based on this, it can be inferred that visual information may be more likely to be retained over time when compared to auditory information.\n\nMoreover, using engaging visuals (like the example of the stylized eye in image5) can help improve the retention of a single point per slide [5], making the content more memorable for the audience. In addition, improving learning by presenting ideas as visuals rather than purely in text form [2] can lead to higher retention rates, as people learn best in 20-minute increments [7].\n\nIn conclusion, while there isn't an exact percentage of remembered information in the given text quotes, it seems that visual information may be more likely to be retained after three days than auditory information. To explore this topic further, consider incorporating visually appealing, concise, and engaging content into presentations, training materials, and educational resources. By doing so, you can potentially increase memory retention and enhance the learning experience for your audience."}

Additionally, beginning with data collection rather than desired insights can be counterproductive ([2]). The third quote emphasizes the importance of measuring what matters most, such as customer engagement, conversion, and satisfaction ([5]).\n\nImage1, a bar chart, corroborates these observations by noting that challenges in business often stem from siloed approaches and misaligned goals, occurring 52% of the time. Moreover, the lack of single ownership and technical infrastructure may contribute to this issue (image1).\n\nWhile quantitative data such as site visits and transactions are crucial, qualitative data like brand awareness, loyalty, and feedback from social media should also be considered ([5]). Failing to recognize and incorporate these insights contributes to another major barrier - drowning in data, looking at excessive data that is ultimately not insightful and actionable ([6]).\n\nIn a similar vein, image2 presents a comparison of product/brand-focused (35%) and customer-focused (44%) approaches, suggesting that businesses might focus too much on their own products rather than customers' needs, which impedes an integrated customer management approach.\n\nAdditionally, marketers should endeavour to understand the influence of their activities on customer behavior, as failing to do so can be a significant barrier ([5]). Marketers must also adopt a 360-degree view of their activities and customers' behavior, avoiding isolated measurements ([6]). Lastly, over-engineering solutions, lacking clear processes, roles, and responsibilities, as well as skilled resources, may hinder the effective implementation of an integrated customer management approach ([6]).\n\nTo summarize, the major barriers preventing the adoption of an integrated customer management approach include management and cultural issues, focusing on data instead of insights, measurement issues, excessive focus on quantitative data, and inadequate processes, resources, and skills.\n\n![A bar chart highlighting siloed approaches and misaligned goals as the biggest barriers to adopting an integrated customer management approach.

The current system mainly deals with marketing, recruitment, and directories, while the future system aims to consolidate information and unify efforts.\n\nComparing this with the technology adoption trends for 2006 [5], we see an increase in the use of technologies such as Single Sign On/Identity Management, Bar Code Technology, Speech Recognition, Handheld PDAs, Automated Alerts to Clinicians, Wireless Information Appliances, and Voice over IP (VoIP). This suggests a growing trend towards streamlining processes and integrating technologies, which aligns with the objective of the future system to consolidate information and unify efforts.\n\nNow, let's focus on the intranet functions [4] and their projected changes for the next two years [2]. The chart shows that functions like staff communication, training, and resource tools might see a slight decrease, but access to patient clinical information and physician access for clinical orders are projected to increase significantly. This aligns with the observed trend in technology adoption towards integration and streamlining processes.\n\nMoreover, the bar chart on 2006 Health IT Staffing Needs [10] indicates a high demand for roles related to network support, application support, and systems integration. These roles are instrumental in building and maintaining systems that enable information consolidation and unification, such as the future system discussed earlier.\n\nIn summary, the projected changes in intranet functions align with the trends observed in technology adoption, suggesting a move towards integrated and unified systems.

This separates the first part of the word.\n2. **Fechamento (Closure)**: The \"G\" and \"E\" together make us perceive a closed shape or form, even though part of it is missing. Here, the missing horizontal stroke in the \"E\" is perceived as being present due to closure.\n3. **Proximidade (Proximity)**: The letter \"E\" is depicted as a series of small rectangles grouped closely together, suggesting unity, as per our tendency to see objects that are visually close together as belonging to part of a group.\n4. **Continuidade (Continuity)**: The \"S\" follows a continuous contour line suggesting a smooth flow or pathway, which aids in grouping the letters together.\n5. **Semelhança (Similarity)**: The letters \"T\" and \"A\" share a similar striped pattern, indicating that we group them together based on visual similarity. The repeated pattern makes these two letters seem relatively similar even though they are different shapes.\n\nBy applying these principles, the designer has created a visually appealing and cohesive representation of the word 'GESTALT', emphasizing its meaning as a cohesive whole in Gestalt psychology.\n\nIn conclusion, the word 'GESTALT' serves as a compelling example of how the principles of Gestalt psychology are implemented in visual design to enhance perceived meaning and cohesion.\n\n![The word \"GESTALT\" visually demonstrates closure, similarity, proximity, continuity, and segregation principles of Gestalt psychology.](image1)"}

However, less than 30% use media mix modelling to understand the incremental impact of specific media and activity.\n\n[8] provides a fascinating statistic: 71% of Paid Search clicks are navigational, indicating that almost three quarters of your paid search is not bringing in new prospects but simply delivering people who are already actively looking for you. Approximately 44% of people who have clicked on a Paid Search Ad have been previously exposed to a banner ad, yet the banner ad gets no performance attribution.\n\nIn conclusion, the most common method marketers use to calculate attribution for a transaction is attributing activity to the most recent touchpoint, as abort 52% of marketers refer to in [image4](image4). Despite the awareness of other methods such as inferred attribution and fractional attribution, the last click method remains the most prevalent practice.

Lack of financial support accounted for 18% of obstacles in 2005, and 20% in 2006 [5]. This data suggests an ongoing concern, despite some incremental increase in the challenge.\n\nIn conclusion:\n- As for patient satisfaction, reduction of medical errors was prioritized less in 2006 compared to 2005, perhaps indicating efforts were already underway to address this issue.\n- The adoption of Electronic Medical Records (EMR) remained relatively steady during this period, indicating a sustained focus on this important technology.\n- Financial support remained a consistent challenge in healthcare IT implementation between 2005 and 2006.\n\nNotably, additional information found in the text quote about current EMR adoption and more detailed statistics on financial support can be incorporated into the response to improve its completeness and accuracy.\n\nReferences:\n- [1] Top Business Issues Facing HealthCare\n- [4] image4: 2005 vs 2006 Priorities\n- [5] image5: 2005 vs 2006 Challenges"}

Here, we find that several functions involve IT support (Network Support, Application Support, PC/Server Support) and IT-related tasks like Process/Workflow Design, Programming, and Systems Integration. Clinical Informaticists, Clinical Transformation, and Clinical Champions also play significant roles, suggesting a focus on bridging the gap between clinical needs and IT implementation.\n\nNow, let's turn to intranet functions, beginning with the current state [image1]. Access to patient clinical information and physician access for clinical orders, two areas related to health IT, are underutilized at 45% and 44%, respectively. However, they are projected to see an increase in usage to 53% and 57%, respectively, in two years. This indicates a trend toward greater use of these intranet functions for managing patient information.\n\nComparatively, some functions such as post-policies and procedures (87% to 70%) and staff communication (82% to 70%) are expected to see decreases, while others like resource tools (74% to 68%) and training (76% to 75%) may level off. The intranet function with the most significant projected increase is \"Don't have an intranet\" [image1], which is expected to reduce from 7% to 1% in two years. This suggests that organizations are moving towards greater intranet adoption.\n\nIn conclusion, the current and projected intranet functions are gradually becoming more integrated into organizations, with a focus on improving clinical information management and patient care. This transformation can be observed in the increased projection for access to patient clinical information and physician access for clinical orders [image1]. The trend is further supported by the decrease in organizations without an intranet [image1]."}

Long, sharp items of cutlery such as carving knives must be positioned horizontally in the upper basket [10].\n\nStack utensils securely so that they can't tip over [10], and arrange hollow items such as cups, glasses, and pans with their openings facing downwards to prevent any water collection [10]. Dishes and items of cutlery should not lie inside one another or cover each other to avoid damage [10]. To avoid damage, glasses should not touch one another, and the upper basket is designed to hold more delicate and lighter dishware such as glasses and coffee cups [10].\n\nCurved items or those with recesses should be loaded at an angle so that water can run off them [10].

Although the chromosome number remains the same during meiosis II [9], it's important to note that this division does not produce any change in the genetic material as the sister chromatids are identical.\n\nHowever, comparing the provided images, image 3 suggests that the stages of cell division, specifically meiosis, are depicted. Notably, it shows the separation of sister chromatids and the formation of haploid daughter cells, which aligns with our analysis of meiosis II.\n\nOn the other hand, image 4 shows the stages of meiosis, focusing on Anaphase II and Telophase II. Those stages belong to meiosis II, where chromatids separate and move to opposite poles, forming two new nuclei [4].\n\nIn summary, the main difference between meiosis I and meiosis II is the separation of chromosomes. Homologous chromosomes separate in meiosis I [7], and sister chromatids separate in meiosis II [4]. Both stages, as shown in the images provided, lead to cell division and the formation of haploid daughter cells, contributing to genetic diversity in offspring."}

Text quote [5] is directly related to the question, as it outlines the land area of countries on the continent of Africa.\n2. Image quote image3 shows countries on the continent of Africa, color-coded by land area, with Mali included.\n\nAnswer Construction:\nAnalyzing the text quote [5] in conjunction with the image quote image3, the color of the region representing Mali in the map is not explicitly mentioned in the evidence. However, since the color-coding scheme in the image is by land area, we can deduce that the color of the Mali region should be consistent with its land area on the real continent. In the given image, Mali is represented by a light purple color, so it's reasonable to infer that the same light purple color was used for the Mali region in the SPARQL and OSM map.\n\nDirect Answer: The exact color of the Mali zone in the map used to demonstrate GeoShapes using SPARQL and OSM is not explicitly mentioned in the provided evidence; however, given the color-coding scheme of the image quote image3, we can infer that the Mali region was likely colored in a light purple hue.\n\nInterleaved answer:\n\nTo find the color of the zone Mali in the map used to demonstrate GeoShapes using SPARQL and OSM, we can analyze the provided evidence. Analyzing [5] and image3, it's reasonable to infer that the color of the Mali region in the map was likely a light purple hue, as the color-coding scheme in the image represents countries by their land area.\n\n![Mali on the Africa continent map](image3)\n\nAlthough the exact color is not explicitly mentioned in the evidence, we can deduce that the Mali region should blend with the light purple shades assigned to countries of similar land area in the provided image. This reasoning corresponds to the understanding that the color-coding in the given map is based on land area.\n\nTherefore, based on the provided evidence and analysis, the color of the zone Mali in the map used to demonstrate GeoShapes using SPARQL and OSM is likely a light purple color.\n\n[![Mali-light-purple](image1)](image3)"}

First, we see that some concerns related to IT and data security, such as internal breach of security and HIPAA compliance, remain prevalent throughout both years, though their percentage values decrease slightly from 2005 to 2006 ([image1]).\n\nOn the other hand, the adoption of various healthcare IT systems, like Electronic Medical Record (EMR), Computerized Practitioner Order Entry (CPOE), and Bar Coded Medication Management, remains consistent or exhibits slight increases from 2005 to 2006 in terms of percentage values ([image2]). These trends suggest that while security concerns persist, there is a growing appreciation for the benefits of IT adoption in healthcare, as indicated in quote [1] from text. However, healthcare still lags behind businesses in adoption (Quote [8]).\n\nOne of the most significant barriers to implementing IT in healthcare, mentioned in quote [10], includes issues related to financial support, proving IT's quantifiable benefits or ROI, and employee acceptance. Although changes in these barriers from 2005 to 2006 are not directly addressed in the provided information, the stability observed in the adoption of certain IT systems indicates that healthcare organizations are working to overcome these barriers to some extent.\n\nTo learn more about healthcare IT trends and the barriers to their implementation, you may want to explore additional resources such as peer-reviewed research articles, professional conferences, and industry reports (Quote [1])."}

The image shows a fitness tracker display with various pieces of data, including heart rate (146 bpm). The heart rate zone for this workout is displayed as a circular design with colored segments. These colors correspond to different training zones or intensity levels, as shown in text [8]. Here, we have the zones labeled as Anaerobic, Aerobic, Fat-burning, and Warm-up.\n\nNow, let's consider [8] more closely to understand the heart rate zone calculation and their respective colors (Aerobic shown in image [image2]). Based on this text, we can see that the heart rate zone for different types of workout activities (Aerobic, in this case) is calculated primarily using HRR percentage. This calculation involves the heart rate reserve and heart rate reserve percentage. The calculated heart rate then is for a workout in the Aerobic zone, which is displayed as a particular color on the fitness tracker (image [image2]).\n\nIn summary, the heart rate zone displayed in color on the fitness tracker corresponds to the calculated heart rate for different workout activities.

Reporting focuses on descriptive, backward-looking, data-to-information, and reporting outputs, aiming to answer questions like 'what happened?' or 'how many, how often, where?'. On the other hand, analysis is prescriptive, forward-looking, data + information-to-insights, and addresses questions like 'why is this happening?' or 'what if these trends continue?'.\n\nThese concepts play crucial roles in the analytics value chain, as illustrated in [image4](image4). Reporting is the initial step in transforming data into value, providing a starting point to visualize and understand the data. Analysis then follows, taking the insights generated from reports and delving deeper to uncover reasons and future predictions, ultimately leading to informed decisions and subsequent actions [image4].\n\nNow, let's establish their impact on the progression from Business Intelligence (BI) to Business Analytics (BA), as shown in [image3](image3). Reporting and basic statistical analysis predominantly fall under BI, helping organizations answer questions like 'what happened?' or 'how many, how often, where?' [image3, stages 1-4]. As we move towards BA, more complex analysis like forecasting, predictive modeling, and optimization come into play, enabling us to answer questions like 'what if these trends continue?' or 'what's the best that can happen?' [image3, stages 5-8].\n\nIn conclusion, reporting and analysis contribute significantly to the analytics value chain by transforming data into insights that drive informed decisions, forming an integral part of the progression from BI to BA. This directs organizations towards higher business value and more intelligent decision-making capabilities. [![Transform data into value through Reporting and Analysis](image4)](image4)"}

For example, it shows that the utility decreases with each additional hot dog, and eventually becomes negative for the sixth hot dog.](image4)\n\nIn standard consumption, as depicted in the table, as more hot dogs are consumed, the utility gained from each additional hot dog decreases. This is known as the law of diminishing marginal utility, where the initial hot dog provides the most utility, but subsequent ones provide less. This is due to satiation; the more of a product we consume, the less satisfaction we derive from an incremental unit of that product.\n\nNow, let's explore how the concept evolves in a competitive context.\n\n![The image illustrates the concept of diminishing marginal utility in a competitive context, which shows a unique case where a significant jump in utility occurs at a specific point (64 hot dogs).](image5)\n\nIn a competitive setting, the game changes. We can see this in the image, where there's a jump in utility at 64 hot dogs, from -50 to +5000. This could represent a situation like a hot dog eating contest, where participants win a prize or achieve a certain title for being the first to consume a specific number of hot dogs. In such competitive contexts, achieving that specific milestone (64 hot dogs in our example) could provide an extraordinary boost in utility due to the recognition and rewards associated with it, which is not typically seen in standard consumption situations.\n\nSo, while the law of diminishing marginal utility still applies in competitive contexts, there might be exceptions, particularly when certain thresholds or milestones are achieved that offer significant rewards or recognition. These exceptions could not be observed in standard consumption scenarios."}

A major trend emerging in the HiT domain is the consolidation of information to provide a foundation for unifying efforts [2].\n\nCurrently, the existing HiT systems retort patient information in a fragmented manner, leading to redundant and inefficient efforts [6]. However, there is an increasing focus on improving operational efficiency, patient satisfaction, reducing medical errors, integrating and interoperability, and improving the quality of care [1]. The adoption of new technologies, particularly those related to single sign-on, bar code technology, speech recognition, wireless information appliances, and automation alerts, has been on the rise [2, image2].\n\nAccording to the 2006 Health IT Staffing Needs, the following roles are essential: Network Support, Clinical Informaticists, Process/Workflow Design, Application Support, Clinical Transformation, Programmers, Systems Integration, PC/Server Support, Clinical Champions [7, image4].\n\nAs for the anticipated changes in intranet functions for the next two years, many functions such as staff communication, training, and resource tools are projected to see a stable or somewhat decreased use, while others like access to patient clinical information and physician access for clinical orders are expected to increase [5]. Notably, the number of organizations without an intranet is expected to drastically decrease [5].\n\nConclusion: The 2006 Health IT staffing needs align with the anticipated changes in intranet functions for the next two years. As the focus shifts towards improved operational efficiency, quality of care, and technological advancements, the demand for roles such as Network Support, Clinical Informaticists, Systems Integration, and Programmers may remain high. Furthermore, the increasing emphasis on access to patient clinical information and physician access for clinical orders indicates a growing need for skilled professionals in these areas in the future intranet landscape.\n\n![Intranet functions changes and alignment with staffing needs](image5)"}

This can be seen in image2, where 44% of respondents identified as Customer Focused, compared to 35% in the Product/Brand Focused category [2].\n\nHowever, it's important to note that marketers may still have misalignments between their practices and customer needs, as indicated by the Com score Qualitative Site Satisfaction data in [1]. This misalignment, arising from a focus on pre-sales information while customers seek post-sales information, can impact overall customer satisfaction.\n\nMoreover, it appears that there's room for improvement in marketers' understanding of the impact of different communication methods on each other and their combined effectiveness, as stated in [3]. Image3 seems to illustrate that a significant percentage (87%) is still working on achieving integrated marketing across brand, direct, and digital communications.\n\nFurthermore, while there's a strong emphasis on the frequency and depth of brand interactions (see [4]), more than half of the marketers might overestimate their customer-centricity, as suggested in [8]. Thus, investing in customer-centric measurement frameworks, as indicated in [5] and [7], would be essential to correct this overestimation.\n\nAdditionally, [10] implies that many organizations may prioritize products, services, and line of business over customers. In light of these factors, it would seem that fewer respondents may be Product/Brand Focused than Customer Focused, but meta-analysis of various aspects is required to validate this claim fully.\n\n![Respondents were more Customer Focused](image2)\n![44% expressed being Customer Focused](image1)\n![87% are still working on integrated marketing](image3)\n![A majority of respondents may overestimate customer centricity](image4)\n![55% of marketers say they use a consistent framework](image5)"}

Let's examine two datasets to better understand this variation.*\n\n[1] In the first dataset, we see that the conversion rate from MQL to SAL is 1.50% [2]. This relatively low conversion rate suggests that the leads qualified through marketing efforts might require more time, personalization, or tailored messaging to engage sales teams and move forward in the sales process.\n\nCompare this to the second dataset presented in [4], where the conversion rate from MQL to SAL slightly increases to 6.67% [4]. This higher conversion rate indicates that the marketing-qualified leads in this dataset might be more sales-ready overall and thus require less effort from the sales team to convert them into sales-accepted leads.\n\nThe implications of these differences are crucial for businesses to optimize their marketing and sales efforts. A lower conversion rate might necessitate refining marketing strategies, such as improving lead nurturing or altering lead scoring methodologies. On the other hand, a higher conversion rate enables businesses to focus on the effectiveness of their sales tactics and team performances to further bolster sales results.\n\n![Conversion Rates Comparison](image4)\n\n*In the summation of the provided datasets, it becomes clear that refining marketing and sales processes is key to improve conversion rates and, ultimately, increase the overall performance of a sales organization.*"}
