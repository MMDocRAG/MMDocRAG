Since the question specifically asks about respondents who believe traditional values are outdated, this indicates a significant decline in that belief over these years.\n\nThus, in the year Palestine was added—2014—the percentage of respondents who believed traditional values were outdated increased compared to 2011 [8], with the data showing a decrease in the red segment from 83 to 54, which actually indicates a decrease in the belief.\n\nHowever, considering the potential that the red segment represents the opposite, and that the orange represents those who believe traditional values are outdated, the chart’s trend shows that the proportion of respondents considering traditional values outdated increased from 17% in 2011 to 46% in 2014.\n\nTherefore, respondents who believe traditional values are outdated increased by **29 percentage points** between 2011 and 2014 in the survey year when Palestine was added.\n\n![The stacked bar chart showing decreasing red and increasing orange segments over years, indicating a rise in the belief that traditional values are outdated](image2)\n\nIn summary, in 2014—the year Palestine was added—the percentage of young Arabs who believed traditional values were outdated increased by approximately 29 percentage points compared to 2011."}

Conversely, in 2016, only about a **quarter (26%) of Trump supporters** believed Trump should appoint Democrats to his administration, indicating a much more partisan stance [7].\n\nLooking at the broader voter base, **79% of all voters** in 2016 said Trump’s appointment choices did not matter, and only **26%** thought he should appoint Democrats [7]. Compared to 2008, when **52% of voters who supported Obama** thought he should appoint Republicans, there was a clear shift toward less bipartisan support in 2016. This reflects increasing polarization and less openness to cross-party appointments in recent years.\n\nThe differences are visually supported by the general trend: in 2008, bipartisan appointments were more broadly supported, especially among Obama voters, whereas in 2016, partisan division intensified, with fewer voters endorsing appointing opposition members.\n\nHere's an illustrative chart from 2008 showing broader support for bipartisan appointments compared to the more divided views in 2016:\n![{bipartisan support in 2008 vs. 2016}](image7)"}

According to the survey data, about 46% of Americans currently believe Islam is more likely than other religions to encourage violence among its followers, while 45% think it is not more likely [7]. This indicates that public opinion is quite evenly split, though it is slightly in favor of the idea that Islam encourages violence.\n\nOver the years, this perception has decreased slightly from a high of 50% in September 2014, reflecting a modest decline in the belief that Islam encourages violence more than other religions [7]. The trend shows that while Republicans tend to hold this view strongly, with 68% saying Islam encourages violence more than other religions— a figure that has remained relatively stable since 2014— Democrats are much more skeptical, with only 30% sharing that view, a decline from 42% in September 2014 [11].\n\n![The line graph shows that Republicans' perception of Islam encouraging violence has increased from about 33% in 2002 to 68% in 2015, while Democrats' perception has remained relatively low, decreasing slightly from 22% to 30% over the same period](image2) The divergence between political groups has widened, making the partisan divide more pronounced than ever. Conservative Republicans are especially likely to see Islam as more prone to encouraging violence (77%), whereas liberal Democrats are largely skeptical (73% say Islam does not encourage violence more than other religions) [4].\n\nMoreover, the overall perception among Americans has slightly decreased but remains politically polarized, with nearly half still believing Islam encourages violence more than other religions [7]. The data suggest that perceptions are deeply influenced by partisan views, with Republicans being more likely to associate Islam with violence and Democrats being less inclined to do so [11].\n\nIn summary, while the overall public opinion has seen a modest decline in the belief that Islam encourages violence more than other religions, partisan and ideological differences continue to dominate this perception. Republicans, especially conservatives, are more likely to hold this view consistently, whereas Democrats are increasingly skeptical.

Furthermore, roughly 20% consider this prospect extremely realistic, especially among those who are highly familiar with the concept [4].\n\nHowever, despite the widespread acknowledgment of potential automation, Americans tend to worry more than they are enthusiastic about the implications. Over 70% believe that automation could lead to increased inequality or make it harder for people to find meaningful activities [1], and around 65–76% are worried about negative outcomes such as inequality and social disruptions [1]. Conversely, support for positive outcomes like economic efficiency or the creation of better jobs is noticeably lower [1].\n\nThe overall perception is cautious, with many Americans recognizing the plausibility of automation significantly changing the workforce, but also harboring concerns about adverse societal effects. They tend to favor automation in roles that are dangerous or unhealthy but remain wary of widespread job displacement. This is reflected in the public’s support for limiting automation to hazardous tasks and for interventions like guaranteed basic income or national service programs for displaced workers [2, 6].\n\nVisual insights reinforce this cautiously optimistic view. The bar chart about possible outcomes indicates that most Americans do not believe automation will dramatically worsen inequality or make life less meaningful [image1], but they acknowledge the plausibility of positive effects like increased efficiency and reduced work hours [image1]. Moreover, support exists for policies that regulate automation, with a strong majority favoring limitations on dangerous jobs and paying extra for human interaction [images 2, 4].\n\nIn sum, Americans largely recognize the feasibility of automation taking over many jobs, but their perception is intertwined with concern about social inequality and the need for regulation and social safety nets to mitigate potential negative impacts.

This indicates a clear preference for protected employment in risky tasks and a cautious outlook toward automation.\n\nRegarding broader limits on replacing human jobs, the public is somewhat divided but leans toward caution. Over half of Americans (around **60%** [1], [5], [7]) believe there should be limits on the number of jobs businesses can replace with machines, although opinions slightly differ along partisan lines—about **54%** of Republicans and **60%** of Democrats support such limits [5]. \n\nAdditionally, survey data show that Americans are concerned about economic impacts, such as displacement, and favor policies to mitigate these effects. For example, **approximately 60-77%** support programs like universal income and national service to help workers displaced by automation [7].\n\nSupport for regulation is also visually reinforced by data such as the bar graph indicating high favorability: **38-47%** strongly favor limiting machines to unsafe jobs [image1], and about **30-31%** favor government-guaranteed income and national programs [image1].\n\nWhile many recognize the potential benefits of automation, the majority of the public prefers a cautious approach, prioritizing restrictions in the most dangerous roles, supporting social safety nets, and expressing concerns over widespread replacement of human work.

In contrast, Democrats are less optimistic, with only 53% saying there are plenty of jobs available locally [12], and an even higher 39% believe jobs are difficult to find [6].\n\nThis divergence is further supported by historical trends in political affiliation. A line graph illustrating political allegiance over time shows that Republicans' support for the idea of plentiful jobs has increased substantially, nearing 71% in 2019 [image1], whereas Democrats remain more cautious or negative in their perceptions. Additionally, views on economic conditions have fronted Republicans' optimism; over three-quarters rate the economy positively [6], which correlates with their more favorable perception of local job opportunities.\n\nFurthermore, respondents' perception of \"good jobs\" reflects similar partisan disparities—58% of Republicans see plenty of good jobs available, whereas only 39% of Democrats share this view [image6]. This indicates that Republicans not only see a higher availability of jobs in general but also perceive more access to quality employment.\n\nDespite these optimistic local views, overall satisfaction with the national economic situation remains low among both parties, with only about 26-33% expressing satisfaction [10]. This suggests that perceptions of job availability are more positive at the community level, especially among Republicans, than broader national economic sentiments.\n\nThe polarized views are also reflected in political support and trust in economic policies, where Republicans tend to be more positive about the current economic climate [2], [4], and Democrats more critical. This partisan gap underscores how perceptions of job availability are intertwined with broader economic and political beliefs.\n\nIn summary, Republicans are markedly more optimistic about local job opportunities and the economy, perceiving plentiful jobs and good economic conditions, whereas Democrats tend to view job availability more skeptically, with a larger proportion believing jobs are difficult to find and fewer perceiving abundance [12], supporting the notion that partisan alignment significantly influences perceptions in this area."}

Conversely, those with no college experience, such as high school or less, are more inclined to view neither party favorably; only 20% of this group believe either party has high ethical standards, and they tend to favor Republicans more strongly [9, 12].\n\nPolitical affiliation distinctly influences both perceptions and preferences. Democrats are more likely to support their party across educational levels, especially among college graduates and postgraduates, where they view their party favorably and perceive it as ethically high [6, 8, 10]. Republicans, on the other hand, tend to have more polarized views based on education, with college graduates slightly favoring Democrats in ethics perceptions, but whites with no college degree favoring Republicans strongly [9, 11]. Furthermore, voters leaning heavily towards Republican preferences predominantly associate with white voters and less educated groups, whereas Democrats attract a larger share among Black voters and college-educated individuals [3, 13].\n\nThe visual data further supports this differentiation. For example, the bar chart on party support among demographic groups shows that Black voters favor Democrats overwhelmingly (85%), partly reflecting perceptions of ethical standards and policy alignment [13]. The survey on perceptions shows that liberals and those with higher education levels tend to be more critical of party ethics, aligning with the data indicating that higher education correlates with increased skepticism about party integrity [4, 6].\n\nIn summary, higher education levels generally correlate with more critical perceptions of party ethics and a tendency to favor Democrats, whereas lower education levels and less educated voters tend to be more supportive of Republicans and perceive their parties as having higher ethical standards. Political loyalty significantly colors these perceptions, with partisans rating their own party more positively but with notable variation across education levels and racial groups. \n\n![This bar chart illustrates how education levels influence perceived party support and ethics](image3)\n\n*In conclusion, perceptions of ethical standards and party support vary considerably across education and party lines, with more educated individuals often being more skeptical and favoring Democratic candidates, whereas less educated voters tend to favor Republicans and perceive them as ethically higher.*"}

Historically, public approval of Trump's leadership has been relatively low compared to past presidents. For example, a bar chart shows Trump’s approval rating in May 2018 at 39%, which is considerably lower than Reagan’s 67% in 1983 and Bush’s 59% in 1989 [image1]. This indicates a longstanding skepticism about his presidency among the general public.\n\nFocusing specifically on partisan opinions about Trump's conduct, recent data reveals that a significant gap exists: 85% of Democrats dislike how Trump conducts himself, with only 5% liking his behavior, and little change since August [4]. Conversely, among Republicans, approximately 38% view his conduct positively, while around 45% have mixed feelings—these proportions have slightly increased, as nearly 80% of Republicans now agree with Trump on many issues, a rise of 11 points since last August [9][12]. Furthermore, conservative Republicans are more likely than moderates or liberals to approve of Trump’s conduct, with 44% expressing approval compared to 25% of their more liberal counterparts [6].\n\nLooking at ethical standards of Trump administration officials, in May 2018, only about 9% of the general public rated their ethics as excellent, with 36% viewing them as not good or poor [1][5]. Within partisan groups, Republicans are more favorable: 75% of Republicans/leaning Republicans rated the officials' ethics as excellent, whereas 86% of Democrats/leaning Democrats rated them poorly [3][11]. This disparity highlights that partisan perspectives have consistently colored views of ethical standards.\n\nOver time, the approval ratings and opinions have fluctuated but largely remained polarized. For instance, the approval of Trump's handling of important issues like international crises and economic decisions showed some variation in polls over the months, but the core partisan divides persisted [8]. Democrats' disapproval remains high, while Republicans' approval and mixed feelings have slightly increased, indicating that partisan allegiances strongly influence perceptions of Trump's conduct and ethics.\n\nIn summary, **Democrats remain consistently critical of Trump’s conduct and ethical standards, expressing strong disapproval, whereas Republicans' opinions are more favorable and have slightly warmed over time, leading to a growing partisan divide in perceptions of his presidency.**"}

This indicates a notably negative assessment of their ethics, especially considering that evaluations of presidential administrations' ethical standards since 1983 have generally been higher in other administrations.\n\n![A bar chart comparing perceptions of the Republican and Democratic parties on policy ideas, ethical standards, and extremism, showing similar perceptions of ethical standards for both parties and a slight edge for Dems](image2)\n\nIn contrast, prior administrations, such as Reagan’s in the 1980s, received higher ratings for ethical standards, suggesting that Trump's officials are viewed less ethically than those of many previous presidents. For example, during Reagan’s administration, ratings for ethical standards were significantly better, reflecting more public trust at the time.\n\nThe relationship between these perceptions and Trump's overall job approval is also relevant. Despite the low ethical ratings of his officials, the public still holds somewhat mixed views on Trump's job performance, with approval ratings around 39% in May 2018 [7]. Moreover, approval ratings tend to vary by demographic factors, with notable gender and racial gaps; for example, 48% of men approve of Trump compared to only 30% of women [6], and younger and non-white populations tend to disapprove more.\n\nIn summary, while public ratings of Trump's officials' ethical standards are very low compared to past administrations, this does not directly correlate with a uniformly low approval of Trump's overall job performance, which remains moderate and varies significantly across different demographic groups.\n\n![\nA bar chart comparing perceptions of the Republican and Democratic parties among U.S. adults, showing mixed opinions about their ethical standards\n](image2)"}

Conversely, support among Republican voters for moving in a more moderate direction remains relatively low, with about 36% favoring moderation in 2016, down slightly from prior years [10].\n\nTurning to reactions to the 2016 election: **image 3** shows that Clinton voters were overwhelmingly unhappy (87%) with the election outcome, while Trump voters were almost universally happy (94%) [3]. Moreover, **image 4** indicates that mixed opinions exist about how parties should work with the new president. Among Democrats, only 35% support working with Trump, whereas 63% prefer standing up to him; *Clinton supporters* are even more likely to oppose cooperation, with 78% favoring standing up [4].\n\nFinally, **images 5 and 6** depict that public perception of the parties and candidates has declined over time, with increasing percentages of voters giving the Republican Party and certain candidates failing grades. Notably, in 2016, only 22% of voters gave the Republican Party A or B, down from higher ratings in previous years [5], paralleling the increasingly critical view among Democratic voters, reflected in the high unhappiness levels among Clinton supporters and the low ratings assigned to the Republican candidates.\n\nIn summary, both Democratic and Republican voters have shifted toward more ideological consistency—Republicans toward conservatism, Democrats toward liberalism—over recent years. Nonetheless, the 2016 election results starkly highlight the division: Democratic voters largely disapprove of the outcome and favor opposition and resistance, whereas Republican voters were overwhelmingly pleased, aligning with their ideological leanings. This underscores a growing partisan divide in both orientations and reactions."}

In 2008, a strong bipartisan consensus emerged shortly after Barack Obama’s election. According to [6], nearly 80% of voters from both parties believed Democratic and Republican leaders should work together, even at the risk of disappointing their supporters. Similarly, the data from the November 2008 survey displayed in [8] shows that 86% of Democratic voters and 59% of Republican voters favored cooperation with the incoming president. The public mood was characterized by a willingness for bipartisanship; approximately 57% of Democratic-leaning voters favored moving the party in a more moderate direction, reflecting an openness to collaboration.\n\nIn stark contrast, by 2016, voter sentiments had become much more polarized and less conducive to bipartisan cooperation. As shown in [8], only 32% of Democratic voters wanted their leaders to work with Trump, while 65% preferred that they stand up to him, highlighting a significant shift toward opposition. Among Republican voters, 84% favored working with Trump, but only 14% believed Democratic leaders should do so, revealing divergent partisan expectations. Similarly, the survey data in [5] indicates that more than half of Republican voters wanted Trump to work with Democratic leaders, but a considerable minority (39%) preferred him to stand up to them, mirroring the growing partisan tension.\n\nThe graphs and charts further illustrate this shift. Image1 demonstrates a rapid increase in the perception of negative campaigning, from roughly 68% in 1992 and 1996 to an astonishing 92% in 2016, indicating heightened political divisiveness. This increasing negative climate correlates with the decline in openness to bipartisan cooperation evident in the 2016 data. Additionally, the survey in [11] shows that in 2008, majorities of Democratic supporters favored moving in a more moderate or cooperative direction, whereas in 2016, only a minority of Democrats favored working with Trump, with a robust majority advocating for standing up against him.\n\nIn summary, voter expectations in 2008 leaned heavily toward bipartisan collaboration with the new president, reflecting a desire for unity and moderation. By 2016, polarized partisan sentiments took precedence, with a marked increase in voters preferring leaders to oppose or stand up to the newly elected president, reflecting a more contentious and divided political climate.\n\n![The graph shows increased perceptions of negative campaigning over elections, with 92% in 2016 perceiving more mudslinging, indicating greater political divisiveness](image1)"}

The data shows that **92% of voters** believed there was more mudslinging or negative campaigning compared to past elections[2][12], which is an all-time high, reflecting a significant rise in negativity. The line graph from the images vividly illustrates this trend, with perceptions of increased mudslinging soaring to 92% in 2016 from much lower levels in previous years (see `![more mudslinging in 2016](image1)`).  \n![more mudslinging in 2016](image1)  \n\nFurthermore, voters assigned low grades to the conduct of political parties and the candidates—only **22%** gave the Republican Party and **26%** the Democratic Party an A or B grade, the worst since 1988[3]. Similarly, the press and pollsters received very low marks, with roughly **21-22%** awarding high grades and about **30%** giving failing grades, indicating widespread dissatisfaction with campaign information dissemination and media coverage[7][10].  \n![public perception of press and pollsters](image4)  \n\nThis pervasive negativity extended to personal feelings and emotional reactions. Trump voters mostly felt hopeful (**96%**) and proud (**74%**) about Trump's victory[8], whereas Clinton voters mainly felt uneasy (**90%**), sad (**77%**), and scared (**76%**), clearly reflecting polarized emotional responses based on perceptions of the campaign climate[8]. In addition, voters’ emotional reactions to the election’s outcome reveal intense feelings of unease (**53%**) and hopefulness (**51%**), further illustrating the emotionally charged atmosphere[9].  \n![emotional reactions of voters](image5)  \n\nIn summary, the exceptionally high perception of campaign negativity and mudslinging correlates with widespread dissatisfaction with candidates, parties, and media, creating a political environment marked by heightened emotions and low trust—factors that likely amplified voter polarization and affected perceptions of all political entities involved in the 2016 election.  \n\n**In conclusion, voter perceptions of heightened negativity and poor conduct during the 2016 campaign are closely linked, as the record-high levels of mudslinging and low ratings of political actors contributed to an overall climate of dissatisfaction and emotional polarization.**"}

Trump supporters predominantly felt **happy** and **hopeful**, with 96% indicating hopefulness and many expressing surprise or shock at his victory, reflecting a sense of optimism and pride [2][5]. In contrast, Clinton supporters mostly reacted with **shock** and **disappointment**, with \"shocked\" being the most frequent response among them, highlighting their disbelief and dissatisfaction with the result [10].\n\nExamining the emotions, **Trump voters** expressed strong feelings of **hopefulness** (51), **pride** (36), and relatively moderate concern levels, such as **uneasy** (53), but fewer negative feelings like **sad** or **scared** [8]. Conversely, **Clinton voters** showed high levels of **unease** (53), **sad** (41), and **scared** (41), indicating a more negative emotional response, possibly related to their perception of Trump's performance and the election’s negative tenor [8]. The data on mudslinging shows that **92%** of voters believed the 2016 race was more negative than previous elections, almost doubling the previous high of 72%, indicating widespread perception of unhealthier, more negative campaigning [7].\n\nFurthermore, overall perceptions of Trump's performance are quite kritic: only about **30%** of voters gave him high grades (A or B), and the voters graded the parties even lower, with **22%** for the Republican Party and **26%** for the Democratic Party [11]. This reflects a general dissatisfaction and perhaps correlates with the negative emotions like **uneasy**, **sad**, and **scared** held by many Clinton supporters, who also expressed shock at the election outcome. Such feelings are consistent with their perception of a highly negative campaign environment and a challenging political transition.\n\nIn summary, while Trump voters responded with positive emotions such as hope and pride, Clinton voters experienced negative feelings like shock, unease, and sadness. These emotional divides mirror their perceptions of the election’s negative tone and the dissatisfaction with political conduct and mudslinging, which surged to record levels in 2016. This emotional and perceptual divergence underscores how election outcomes can evoke vastly different reactions depending on voters’ partisan loyalties and views on campaign civility.\n\n---\n\n**![The emotions of voters highlight a stark contrast: Trump supporters mainly felt hopeful and proud, while Clinton supporters experienced shock and unease](image8)**"}

Trump supporters predominantly expressed positive emotions; for example, many reported feeling \"happy\" and \"proud,\" which suggests they anticipated a favorable outcome and were optimistic about Trump’s win [7]. Conversely, Clinton voters largely experienced negative or shocked emotions; many reported feeling \"shocked,\" \"disappointed,\" or \"disgusted,\" indicating their surprise and disappointment, likely because they did not expect Trump to win [10].\n\nThe bar charts further illustrate this emotional divide. The \"Surprised\" response among Clinton voters was quite high, at 87%, whereas only 60% of Trump voters were surprised, with a larger share (40%) not surprised [6, 6, image6]. Additionally, the emotional landscape shows that Clinton voters were more inclined toward feelings of shock and disappointment, aligning with their expectations of a different election outcome. Meanwhile, Trump voters mostly felt hopeful and proud ahead of the results, which underscores their anticipation of victory.\n\nThis contrast reveals that many Clinton supporters did not expect Trump’s victory, contributing to feelings of shock and disappointment after the outcome. On the other hand, Trump supporters generally anticipated his win, which fostered positive feelings like happiness and pride upon the election result. Overall, the data highlight a significant difference in pre-election expectations and emotional reactions, emphasizing how expectations shape post-election sentiment.\n\n![Voters' Emotional Reactions](image4)"}

This widespread shock is visually reinforced by the horizontal bar chart, where 87% of Clinton voters reported being surprised, compared to 60% of Trump voters, emphasizing that Clinton supporters were more likely to be taken aback by the result ([image1](image1)). \n\nDespite the surprise, the emotional reactions varied significantly between the two groups. Trump supporters predominantly felt hopeful and proud, with 96% expressing hope and 74% feeling proud, while only a small minority felt scared or sad [10][11]. Conversely, Clinton supporters largely experienced unease, sadness, and fear, with 90% feeling uneasy, 77% feeling sad, and 76% feeling scared, reflecting a more negative or anxious response post-election ([image3](image3)).\n\nRegarding expectations for a female president, a majority of voters (79%) still anticipate that a woman will be elected president in their lifetime, and this optimism does not significantly differ between men and women or between supporters of either candidate [4]. This holds true despite the election results and the reactions; both Trump and Clinton supporters share this hopeful outlook. The data suggest that while support for Trump was marked by strong positive emotions about his victory, and Clinton supporters were more distressed, both groups maintained a shared expectation for future female leadership [4][5].\n\nIn summary, Trump voters largely felt hopeful and proud about their candidate’s victory and maintained a positive outlook toward seeing a female president in their lifetime. Clinton voters, on the other hand, experienced more negative emotions such as unease and fear but still largely believed that a woman would become president eventually. This indicates that, despite differing immediate reactions to the election, both groups are optimistic about future female presidential candidates.\n\n![The 87% of Clinton supporters were surprised by Trump's victory](image1)"}

According to the data, Americans’ ratings of the government's effectiveness in reducing terrorism are now at their lowest since the September 2001 attacks, with 52% saying the government is doing not too well or not at all well, and only 46% giving positive ratings [2]. This shift is visualized in the first line graph, which shows a rise from 49% in 2004 to 56% in 2015 believing the government has gone too far in restricting civil liberties, and conversely, an increase from 29% to 28% in those who feel the government has not gone far enough to protect the country (image1).\n\nPolitical affiliation plays a significant role in shaping these perceptions. A marked increase is observed among Republicans, with over 71% now concerned that policies do not go far enough, a sharp rise from 57% in January 2015 and a substantial change from 38% in July 2013. Democrats, while also increasingly worried, show a smaller shift, with 54% now indicating concern that policies are insufficient [5][8]. The line graph over time reveals that Republicans’ concern has intensified more dramatically, especially among conservative Republicans, whose positive assessment dropped from 59% in January to just 18% today [11]. The third image, which depicts survey data by political group and issue prioritization, further underscores this divide: Republicans tend to prioritize national security and anti-terrorism issues more heavily than Democrats, who are more likely to focus on civil liberties concerns [3].\n\nAge also influences perceptions. Older Americans and those with lower education levels tend to be more critical. For instance, 57% of those 50 and older believe the government is not doing well in reducing terrorism, compared to 46% of younger adults (18-29). Similarly, a larger proportion of seniors perceive civil liberties are being restricted excessively—43%—compared to 15% among the 65+ group, with younger respondents more inclined to believe that more action is needed to ensure safety [6][10][8]. The last figure shows that while younger people (18-29) are more likely to believe there is too much scrutiny based on religion (80%), older groups tend to see less scrutiny or have different perceptions of government actions.\n\nIn summary, over time, Americans generally view government efforts against terrorism more negatively, with Republicans especially growing more critical, and younger Americans tending to be more optimistic about government effectiveness and civil liberties. Older Americans are more skeptical overall, emphasizing a complex dynamic shaped by political and age-related factors.\n\n![The line graph comparing perceptions from 2004 to 2015 shows increasing concern that policies restrict civil liberties more than they protect the country](image1)"}

Older Americans tend to give more negative ratings regarding the government's effectiveness, with a majority of those aged 50 and older (57%) expressing that the government is not doing well in reducing the terrorist threat [4]. Conversely, younger adults (18-29) are more optimistic; about 53% believe the government is doing fairly or very well, and a smaller proportion (46%) rate the government's performance negatively [4]. The detailed survey table with age-specific data shows that 43% of young adults feel civil liberties are overly restricted, while 44% think more measures are needed to protect the US, highlighting their nuanced views compared to older groups who are more concerned about insufficient protection [image1].\n\nPolitically, there are stark differences. Democrats are more likely to view the government's efforts positively—about 64% believe it is doing fairly or very well—although this has decreased from 85% earlier in the year, reflecting a downturn in favorable ratings [3]. Independents' positive ratings have also declined from 69% to 44%, and among Republicans, only 27% now see the government as effective, down from 63% [3]. This political divergence influences perceptions; those aligned with the Democratic Party tend to be more optimistic, whereas Republicans are far more critical.\n\nOver time, these perceptions have become more negative. The approval ratings show a downward trend for all groups since early 2015, with a recent slight increase in overall approval to 64% by December 2015 but still much lower than previous peaks [2,4,6]. Furthermore, the public is increasingly concerned that anti-terror policies have not gone far enough—56% now believe more measures are necessary, up seven percentage points since the start of the year [2]. The line graph illustrating opinions about civil liberties versus protection reveals a shift: in 2004, more people worried that rights had gone too far (47%) than that the country had not gone far enough (35%). However, by 2015, concerns about restrictions exceeding appropriate levels declined to 28%, while worries about insufficient protection rose to 56%, indicating growing skepticism about civil liberties being overly compromised [8,6].\n\nIn summary, **older Americans and those with less education tend to perceive government efforts as less effective**, with heightened concern about inadequate protection and civil liberties restrictions. Conversely, **younger adults and those with more education are comparatively more supportive** but have also shown increasing concern that policies do not go far enough. Over the past years, perceptions have shifted notably toward more skepticism about government's effectiveness, with rising fears of insufficient anti-terror measures and reduced concern about overly restrictive policies [1,2,4,6].\n\n![Survey results on opinions about civil liberties and national protection by age](image1)"}

According to the data, older Americans tend to be more critical of the government's efforts—57% of those aged 50 and above believe the government is not doing well in reducing the terrorist threat [6]. In contrast, younger adults aged 18-29 are somewhat more optimistic or divided, with 46% rating the government's performance positively and a nearly equal proportion (44%) feeling that policies do not go far enough to protect the country [6], [7].\n\nRegarding attitudes toward civil liberties versus security, opinions also differ by age. A detailed breakdown shows that 71% of seniors (65+) believe that civil liberties are being overly restricted, while only 15% of this group think the government’s actions do not go far enough to ensure safety [11], [5]. Conversely, among younger adults (18-29), opinions are split; 43% believe civil liberties are restricted too much (\"Too far in restricting civ libs\"), while 44% feel that more action is needed to protect the U.S. (\"Not far enough to protect US\") [11], [7], [5]. This indicates a generational divide where older Americans prioritize security over civil liberties, and younger Americans are more balanced or concerned about civil liberty restrictions.\n\nFurthermore, the overall trend shows that concern about policies not going far enough to protect the country has increased, especially among older populations who are more likely to highlight the need for stronger security measures [2], [10], [11], [7]. Conversely, younger demographics demonstrate more concern about overreach and restrictions on civil liberties, reflecting differing political and personal priorities.\n\nThe survey data highlights these interrelated perceptions: older adults tend to rate government efforts as inadequate but favor stricter security policies with less concern about civil liberties, whereas younger adults are more cautious of government overreach and value civil liberties higher.

Specifically, 43% of 18-29-year-olds believe that civil liberties are being too far restricted, while 44% feel that policies do not go far enough to protect the country [4]. In contrast, among those aged 65 and older, a significant 71% are more concerned that policies have not gone far enough, showing a heightened focus on security over civil liberties within older populations. The middle age groups, 30-49 and 50-64, exhibit intermediate concerns, with 52% and 60% respectively viewing the policies as insufficient for protection [4].\n\nOver time, there's been an increased concern across all age groups that the government’s anti-terrorism policies have not gone far enough. For example, since January, concern that policies fall short has risen by 7 percentage points [4]. Moreover, the perception that policies restrict civil liberties too much has declined dramatically since 2013, especially among younger respondents, with only 15% of those 65+ now feeling civil liberties are overly restricted, down from 47% in 2013 [7].\n\nPolitically, opinions also vary substantially. A comprehensive table shows that both Republicans and Democrats are increasingly worried that policies do not go far enough, with Republicans expressing a particularly strong focus on protection—about 71% now see insufficient efforts since January, up 14 points—compared to 54% of Democrats [5][6]. Among Democrats, concern that policies restrict civil liberties is notably higher than among Republicans, with 73% of Democrats versus 22% of Republicans perceiving the threat that civil liberties are overly restricted [2][6]. These differences reflect divergent priorities: Republicans prioritize security, while Democrats tend to be more cautious about civil liberties.\n\nThis divergence is also reflected in trends over time: Republican approval of government efforts has remained relatively higher, but both groups show a shift toward emphasizing the need for stronger security measures. In line with this, public concern has reinforced the sense that policies have not gone far enough, especially among Republicans, whose concern has increased significantly since Snowden’s disclosures [5][6].\n\nIn sum, as shown in the demographic and political data, younger adults demonstrate more nuanced opinions, with some balance between civil liberties and security concerns, but overall, the trend indicates a growing worry that more needs to be done to protect the country. Politically, partisans increasingly agree that security concerns should take precedence over civil liberties, with Republicans notably more convinced of this view than Democrats [4][6].

The data from image1 illustrates that younger adults (18-29) perceive the highest level of scrutiny (80%) [image1], aligning with the survey data indicating that younger groups predominantly see Muslim scrutiny less favorably (80% in that age group oppose increased scrutiny [10]). Conversely, adults aged 50 and older are more divided, with half supporting more scrutiny (50%) and 41% opposing it [11].\n\nPolitically, the divide is stark: Republicans are evenly split, with about 49% favoring more scrutiny [9], while Democrats predominantly oppose it—76% oppose [9], and 87% of liberal Democrats oppose it [5], with an overwhelming majority rejecting additional scrutiny [5]. The data in images 5 and 8 show how these attitudes have evolved over time, with Republican support for increased scrutiny rising from approximately 33% in 2002 to 68% in 2015 [8], reflecting a growing concern about terrorism as a national issue, especially among Republicans.\n\nTerrorism's significance as a national concern has surged among Republicans, rising from 1% in 2014 to 18% in 2015 [6][image6], and is a key driver behind the support for greater scrutiny of Muslims. Conversely, Democrats have shifted away from prioritizing terrorism, with fewer citing it as the top issue [6][image6], and they are less likely to support increased scrutiny, aligning with their lower concern about terrorism as reflected in their preference for focusing on issues like the economy.\n\nIn summary, perceptions of Muslim scrutiny are strongly linked to political ideology: Republicans, especially conservatives, are more inclined to support increased scrutiny, influenced by the heightened importance they place on terrorism, which they increasingly view as a pressing national threat. Demographic disparities show minorities and younger voters tend to oppose heightened scrutiny more strongly, emphasizing a divide based on race, age, and political affiliation. The figures and visualizations collectively illustrate that the rise in terrorism concerns among Republicans correlates with increased support for scrutiny of Muslims, whereas liberal Democrats and minorities view this scrutiny less favorably."}

As indicated in [4], now 52% of Americans believe the government is doing not too well or not at all well in combating terrorism, surpassing the 46% who believe it is doing fairly or very well. This marks the lowest level of confidence since the September 2001 attacks and represents a 26-point decline from January of the same year. Similarly, evaluations among specific groups reveal disparities: seniors aged 50 and older tend to rate the government's efforts more negatively, with 57% expressing dissatisfaction, compared to 46% of younger adults (18–29) who are more optimistic [11].\n\nPerceptions of threat have also increased. The share of the public citing terrorism as the most important problem has risen sharply; nearly 29% now see terrorism, along with national security and ISIS, as top concerns, a substantial increase from just 4% a year ago [10]. Moreover, the concern that the government’s anti-terror policies have not gone far enough has persisted, with a growing majority (56%) now believing more action is needed, up seven percentage points from earlier in the year [8]. \n\nPartisan divides are evident: Republicans are more likely than Democrats and independents to prioritize terrorism and defense issues, with 41% of Republicans mentioning national security or ISIS as the top problem compared to 23% of Democrats [6]. Democrats’ ratings of government efforts to fight terrorism have dropped substantially, with only 64% now rating the government's performance positively, down from 85% earlier [12]. Conversely, Republicans' confidence has fallen from 63% to 27% in just a year, indicating increased skepticism across the political spectrum.\n\nDemographically, older Americans and those with less education tend to view government efforts more negatively [9], and among those aged 50 and above, 57% express dissatisfaction with the government’s handling of terrorism [11]. Partisan and ideological lines further influence perceptions: liberals generally have more favorable views of government efforts than conservatives, whose trust has eroded markedly.\n\nVisual evidence supports these trends. The line graph in the first image shows a decline in approval ratings of U.S. presidents across party lines during the Obama years, corresponding with increasing concerns about terrorism and government performance [image1]. The other images depict patterns of partisan differences and demographic variation in perceptions of scrutiny and security issues, emphasizing that political affiliation profoundly shapes attitudes towards terrorist threats and related policies [images 2, 4, 5].\n\nIn summary, Americans’ perceptions of terrorism and government efforts to counter it have shifted from cautious optimism to skepticism, with heightened concern about threats and doubts about government effectiveness, especially among older populations and Republicans. These evolving perceptions highlight a complex landscape influenced by demographic factors, political ideology, and recent security challenges.\n\n![The approval ratings of U.S. Presidents George W.

For instance, [1] shows that more Republicans than Democrats cite immigration, terrorism, and national security as top problems facing the nation, with 41% of Republicans emphasizing terrorism versus only 23% of Democrats. Similarly, [9] highlights that four-in-ten Republicans mention terrorism and defense issues or ISIS as the most important problems, whereas only about a quarter of Democrats do so.\n\nFurthermore, in terms of perceptions of the government's handling of terrorism, Republicans are more likely to believe that the government has not gone far enough in anti-terrorism efforts, with a significant 71% expressing this concern compared to 41% of liberals and 52% of moderates, reflecting a stronger emphasis on security issues among Republicans. The image in **image4** shows an increasing concern over terrorism globally, with the percentage of Americans rating ISIS as a major threat rising from 67% in August 2014 to 83% in December 2015, indicating heightened security focus, especially among Republicans.\n\nOn economic issues, however, there’s a different trend. According to **image8**, economic concerns have declined in prominence overall, but Democrats historically prioritize economic instability and government performance. The data in **image7** reveals that while terrorism remains a key issue for Republicans, Democrats tend to focus on economic matters, as shown by their higher concern for unemployment and economic stability, with \"Dissatisfaction with government/Obama\" and \"Economy\" figures being notable priorities.\n\nAdditionally, **image6** demonstrates a shift over time where public concern about the country’s safety (related to terrorism) has increased (from 49% to 56% feeling the country hasn't gone far enough in security measures), especially among Republicans, whereas concerns about civil liberties being restricted have also grown but from a different baseline. This indicates that while security concerns dominate Republican outlooks, Democrats might be more concerned about civil liberties and economic issues rather than terrorism.\n\nIn summary, **Republicans emphasize terrorism and national security more heavily** — viewing the government as needing to do more — whereas **Democrats tend to prioritize economic issues**, with less emphasis on terrorism according to the survey data."}

Regarding perceptions of government efforts, **older and less educated Americans tend to rate the government's performance more negatively** [4], reflecting broader public concerns about security effectiveness.\n\nThe disparity in how each group perceives terrorism's importance influences their trust and evaluations of government actions. Republicans' higher concern manifests in a stronger belief that the government should prioritize counterterrorism efforts, which aligns with their more favorable view of partisan performance on this issue. Conversely, Democrats and independents are less likely to see terrorism as the most urgent problem and tend to be more critical of government efforts, especially amidst declining approval ratings [5].\n\nIn summary, **Republicans emphasize terrorism as a key issue, which corresponds with a relatively more favorable view of government efforts to address the threat, although these perceptions are also declining over time**.

According to survey data, older Americans, especially those aged 50 and above, have become significantly more negative in recent months regarding China's response to the pandemic. For instance, [6] reports that 81% of those 50 and older have an unfavorable view of China, which is an increase of 10 percentage points since March, highlighting a rising distrust among older demographics. Furthermore, as shown in [7], around 73% of Americans aged 50 and older believe that China's early handling of the outbreak contributed a great deal to the global spread of the virus, compared to only 38% of Democrats, indicating a partisan divide in assigning blame.\n\nRegarding political affiliations, Republicans show a much higher level of criticism toward China's pandemic response. As detailed in [10], 82% of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents consider China's response to be poor, with about 61% thinking China did a very bad job. In contrast, only 54% of Democrats share this view, with a significantly smaller proportion rating China's efforts as very bad. Moreover, the trend over time illustrates increasing skepticism: [3] shows that unfavorable opinions of China are widespread, with about 68-73% across different demographics, and [11] indicates that Republicans consistently hold more unfavorable views (83%) than Democrats (68%).\n\nVisual data further emphasizes this division. For example, images like [5] and [8] depict that Republicans and older individuals are especially critical of China’s pandemic response, with large majorities expressing unfavorable opinions. The bar and line graphs ([4], [6]) illustrate that these negative perceptions have grown over time, particularly among older age groups, and that the gap between political parties in their assessment of China's handling has widened.\n\nIn summary, older Americans and Republicans are particularly likely to view China's response to COVID-19 negatively, consistently expressing higher levels of criticism compared to younger and Democratic groups. This trend of heightened negativity aligns with the broader pattern of unfavorable views of China observed in recent years, which have been especially pronounced among Republicans and older individuals. The perception of China’s COVID-19 response thus reflects a convergence of demographic and partisan factors, with increasing dissatisfaction over time across these groups.\n\n![The image contains survey data visualized in bar and pie charts about U.S. opinions on China and COVID-19 responses](image1)"}

In Germany, age significantly affects views on military bases; older Germans (65+) largely see the bases as vital to Germany’s security, with about 61% deeming them important, whereas younger Germans (18-29) are more skeptical, with roughly 60% doubting their contribution to national security [10]. This indicates a generational divide, where older Germans tend to prioritize military cooperation with the U.S., while younger Germans are more doubtful of its security benefits.\n\nIn the U.S., political affiliation plays a crucial role in shaping perceptions of foreign policy importance and the U.S. military presence. Supporters of the Republican Party (or those leaning Republican) are more inclined to prioritize the U.K. as a key partner (41%) and favor maintaining a US military presence in Germany, with 85% considering the bases important to U.S. security [9], [12]. Conversely, Democrats or those leaning Democratic show a slightly lower emphasis on Germany’s importance, ranking it fifth among top foreign policy partners, but their support for the U.S. military bases remains high across party lines, though slightly lower among Democrats (see inclusion of support levels). \n\nInterleaving the visual data, the bar charts reveal that Americans with Republican leanings favor the U.K. more strongly (41%) compared to Democrats (35%) [image1], reflecting partisan priorities. Additionally, images show that Republicans are more supportive of Israel as a key partner and generally endorse greater U.S. influence abroad, whereas Democrats tend to have a more balanced view and focus more on Canada and Mexico [image1], [image4], [image7]. Importantly, the survey indicates that overall, Americans across parties recognize the importance of their military presence in Germany, despite political differences.\n\nIn summary, in Germany, age influences perceptions of military importance, with older Germans valuing bases more; in the U.S., political affiliation shapes attitudes toward foreign policy partnerships and military bases, with Republicans generally favoring stronger U.S. military presence and closeness to traditional allies like the U.K., while Democrats tend to hold more moderate views. Both factors contribute to a nuanced understanding of transatlantic security and alliance perceptions.\n\n![The U.S. political preferences for foreign policies vary by party, with Republicans favoring the U.K. and Israel, while Democrats prioritize Canada and Mexico](image1)  \n![Age differences in Germany significantly influence perceptions of the importance of U.S. military bases, with older Germans valuing them more](image4)"}

Conversely, Democrats, particularly liberals, tend to favor helping other nations, with about 53-64% supporting international aid, especially among those with higher education levels, such as postgraduates, where 60% endorse aiding other countries [3, 6, image5]. \n\nPartisan distinctions are stark; liberal Democrats are much more inclined to believe the U.S. should assist others, with over half signaling this approach, whereas conservative Republicans prefer focusing on internal issues. For instance, liberal Democrats show a bleak outlook regarding the U.S. global standing, with 56% believing the U.S. will have less influence—a view less held by moderate and conservative Democrats [12]. \n\nEducational background further influences these perspectives; more educated Americans, notably postgraduates, are more supportive of international aid, reflecting in survey data where they are more positive about helping other nations and more critical of the U.S. response to the pandemic, as captured in lined graphs showing trends over time [6, 10, image5]. Conversely, those with less education tend to prioritize domestic issues and hold more negative views about the country's international achievements.\n\nIn summary, political ideology and educational level are key determinants of whether individuals favor active U.S. engagement abroad or prefer focusing on domestic problems, with liberals and the highly educated leaning toward international assistance and greater global influence, while conservatives and less educated groups favor non-intervention and domestic prioritization."}

Politically, Republicans tend to be more optimistic or skeptical about declines in China’s influence, with approximately 60% believing Chinese influence will diminish after the pandemic [6], and about 70% of conservatives within the Republican camp expecting China’s influence to lessen, as shown in the trust levels chart [6]. Conversely, Democrats are more divided, with roughly 23% believing China’s influence will decrease, and a larger share (around 26%) expecting Chinese influence to grow or remain the same, indicating a less uniformly pessimistic outlook [6].\n\nIn terms of the U.S. and the EU, public opinion is more cautious or neutral, with many believing their influence will stay about the same or decline slightly. For example, 41% of Americans think the U.S. influence will be unchanged post-pandemic, while only about a third believe it will grow [4]. The EU, viewed more positively, is largely expected to remain stable [3], contrasting with China’s more negative outlook among the population.\n\nEducation level further influences these views. Higher-educated Americans are generally more likely to believe the country’s influence will recede; for example, 45% of those with postgraduate education expect the U.S. influence to decline [10]. Moreover, those with higher education levels tend to be more aware of global trends, which may translate into a more cautious or critical perspective on future influence.\n\nThe bar chart on perceptions of influence change by political group supports this, showing Democrats more inclined to believe influence will stay the same or increase (about 23%), whereas Republicans largely believe influence will diminish (around 63%) [8]. Similarly, those with higher education levels are more divided or expect a decline, compared to less educated groups more resistant to change [10].\n\nInterwoven, these findings suggest that political allegiances strongly color expectations about future global influence, with Democrats generally more optimistic or neutral, while Republicans tend to foresee declines, especially regarding China. Education amplifies this divide, with higher-educated individuals more likely to anticipate a reevaluation of influence dynamics, often toward decline. The perception is thus deeply intertwined with partisan identity and educational background, shaping differing visions of the international landscape ahead.\n\n![The survey shows political and educational divides in perceptions of global influence](image1)"}

As [1] and [11] indicate, Republicans are more inclined to believe that U.S. influence will be strengthened or remain stable, with roughly 30% expecting the U.S. to have more influence post-pandemic (see [8]). Conversely, Democrats are split, with many expecting a decline; nonetheless, fewer Democrats (about 36%) believe U.S. influence will diminish compared to Republicans, among whom approximately 70% believe China’s influence will decline ([11], [6]). \n\nRegarding China’s influence, a substantial proportion—about 50%—predict it will decrease after the pandemic, especially among older Americans (65+) who are 16 percentage points more likely to see China’s influence diminish after the crisis ([6], [11]). A notable subset even expects China's influence to grow, especially among Democrats and younger adults ([7], [11]). \n\nAge differences are evident. Older adults (65+) tend to have more negative judgments about China’s global power and are more likely than those under 30 to believe China’s influence will lessen ([6], [11]). For U.S. influence predictions, younger adults are somewhat more optimistic, with a trend toward expecting the U.S. influence to hold or even increase ([8], [11]).\n\nEducation level also impacts perceptions. Higher-educated individuals tend to believe the U.S. influence will recede more than those with less education, and they are more skeptical of China’s rising power ([9], [11]). Racially, Non-White populations are more likely than White populations to view China’s influence as declining ([11], [12]).\n\nPublic opinion also varies geographically and politically. For instance, trust in international organizations like the WHO and EU differs markedly across political lines, with liberals showing much higher confidence ([4], [5], [7]), which correlates with their more optimistic or cautious predictions about the influence of each global actor.\n\nThe combined data from the images and texts clearly demonstrate that the outlook on the future influence of the U.S. and China post-pandemic is not uniform but heavily shaped by demographic and partisan identities, with liberals and Democrats more likely to anticipate declines in Chinese power and softer views of U.S. influence, while conservatives and Republicans are generally more optimistic about U.S. influence and more pessimistic about China’s global standing.  \n\n![A bar chart showing that trust in international organizations like the WHO and EU increases significantly among liberals compared to conservatives](image4)"}

A substantial 83% of Democrats and Democratic leaners have confidence in Biden's dealings with China, whereas only 19% of Republicans and leaners do so, with conservative Republicans at a mere 10% [7]. These differences underscore political bias playing a key role in perceptions of presidential efficacy on China issues.\n\nRegarding specific concerns, Americans see many aspects of China as serious problems. The most prominent issues are cyberattacks, China's military growth, the trade deficit, loss of U.S. jobs, and human rights policies. For example, about 65% see cyberattacks as very serious, and roughly 53% consider the loss of U.S. jobs very serious [8]. These concerns persist across party lines but are heightened among Republicans, who increasingly view these issues as very serious, especially regarding job loss and military power, with the gap between parties widening over time [1], [6], and [image1].\n\nTo visually illustrate the varying confidence, consider the chart showing confidence levels across demographics [7]. Women, Black, and Hispanic adults display notably higher trust in Biden's ability to manage China, while White adults and Republicans are far less confident. Meanwhile, the primary concerns include cyberattacks, military power, and human rights issues, which Americans perceive as very serious problems [8].\n\n![The chart shows demographic disparities in confidence, with women, minorities, and Democrats notably more trusting of Biden on China issues](image7)  \n![Americans perceive cyberattacks, military growth, job losses, and human rights as top serious problems related to China](image8)  \n\nIn summary, confidence in Biden’s effectiveness against China heavily depends on demographic and partisan identity, with minorities, women, and Democrats generally more optimistic, while Republicans and Whites are more skeptical. The foremost worries are cyberattacks, China's military expansion, and the loss of U.S. jobs, reflecting deep concerns about economic and security challenges posed by China."}

Specifically, 83% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents have confidence in Biden's dealings with China [3][11], whereas only 19% of Republicans and Republican-leaning individuals share this confidence [3][11]. Demographic differences further influence this perception: women are more optimistic (59%) than men (48%) about Biden's capacity to deal with China [11], and Black (82%) and Hispanic (70%) adults tend to be more confident than White adults (43%) [11].\n\n![Democrats are substantially more confident than Republicans](image3)\n\nThis disparity also reflects the polarized views on U.S.-China relations. Concerns about specific issues such as China's military growth, cyberattacks, and human rights violations are perceived as very serious by a majority of Americans, with notable variations among groups. For example, about 70% prioritize human rights issues over economic relations in their approach to China [1], and half or more rate issues like cyberattacks, job loss, and military power as very serious problems [5].\n\n![Most Americans see cyberattacks and human rights as serious problems](image5)\n\nPublic concern about China's policies on human rights has increased, with 50% seeing it as a very serious problem — a rise of 7 percentage points since last year [7].

These concerns are echoed visually as well; in a bar chart, cyberattacks, military power, and the U.S. trade deficit are among the most frequently rated as very serious problems [3].\n\nThe images further illustrate these perceptions: for example, the line graphs show that Republicans increasingly view issues like U.S. jobs lost to China, military power, and technological advancements as grave threats, with partisan gaps widening over time [2]. The bar chart on perceived threats shows that over 48% of Americans see China as a threat, especially among Republicans [4], indicating widespread concern. Additionally, about 90% believe China does not respect personal freedoms, and a large majority supports prioritizing human rights over economic relations with China [5].\n\nTogether, these data suggest that confidence in Biden varies substantially across demographics—higher among women, Black, Hispanic, and Democratic groups—and that major concerns center on cyber security, economic impacts, military power, and human rights issues.\n\n![The image shows a bar chart where the majority of Americans perceive China as a threat, especially among Republicans](image4)"}

Specifically, **70% of Americans** believe the U.S. should promote human rights even if it harms economic relations [6], reflecting a broad consensus favoring human rights due to concerns over China's treatment of Uyghurs and dissenters.\n\nLooking at political parties, **Republicans tend to favor a tougher approach** on China, emphasizing strategic and trade measures. For instance, **81% of conservative Republicans** support getting tougher on China [10, image6], and overall, **72% of Republicans** prefer increased economic pressure, including tariffs and scrutiny [4, 10]. This is further supported by their higher likelihood to see economic relationships as less important compared to human rights concerns. Conversely, **Democrats and Democrat-leaning independents** are more inclined to support building and maintaining stronger economic ties, often at the expense of addressing human rights issues [5, 6, 10].\n\nDespite these differences, there is some common ground. Democrats and Republicans both largely agree that China's human rights policies are problematic [7], indicating bipartisan recognition of the issue. However, their policy preferences diverge: **a majority of Democrats** favor emphasizing economic relations [5], while **conservative Republicans** prioritize human rights over economic considerations [6, 9].\n\nVisual data underscores these differences: in terms of evaluating whether to prioritize economic or human rights concerns, **more Republicans** support taking a tougher stance, while **more Democrats** prefer to focus on fostering stronger relationships [10, 11]. These attitudes are reinforced by images showing that **Republicans** generally see more benefits in \"getting tougher\" on China, whereas **Democrats** lean toward \"building a strong relationship\" [6].\n\nIn summary, **Republicans predominantly perceive a need to prioritize human rights and adopt a harder stance towards China**, whereas **Democrats tend to emphasize economic ties**, though both parties show awareness of China's human rights issues.\n\n![The bar chart compares Republican and Democratic opinions on whether they see relations with China as beneficial or problematic, with Republicans more inclined to see a \"bad\" relationship and Democrats more likely to see little effect or positive relations](image6)"}

When examining political affiliations, a significant contrast emerges: liberals tend to emphasize human rights over economic ties, with a substantial majority supporting this priority, whereas conservatives are more inclined toward a tougher stance on trade issues [6].\n\nSpecifically, a large proportion of conservatives and Republican-leaning individuals, with about 81% of conservative Republicans, favor the approach of \"getting tougher\" with China over building stronger economic or diplomatic ties [12]. This indicates that within the Republican camp, there is a strong preference for increased pressure on trade and economic policies rather than prioritizing human rights discussions.\n\nThe differences are visually reinforced by the survey's findings: public opinion shows liberals and Democrats generally favor a balanced or human rights-focused approach, while Republicans strongly favor a tougher stance on trade issues. The bar chart illustrating opinions on “Getting tougher” versus “Building a strong relationship” shows that Republicans overwhelmingly prefer the former, with 72% strongly or somewhat favoring a tougher approach, compared to only 37% among Democrats [7].\n\nMoreover, the perception of how the U.S. should handle human rights versus economic relations is also reflected in the images.

As shown in the line graph (image8), from 2000 to 2015, the unemployment rate for Hispanics generally remained above that of non-Hispanics, starting at 5.8% and ending at 6.4%, with noticeable peaks during recession periods. This persistent higher unemployment rate hampers income stability for Hispanics, which is reflected in the visualized income and wealth disparities detailed in the middle line graph (image2).\n\nThe same graph highlights that in 2014, Hispanic median household income was $42,500 compared to $53,700 for all U.S. households, and their median wealth was significantly lower, at $13,700 versus $81,400 for the overall population. These disparities are influenced by the ongoing higher unemployment rates and economic challenges the Hispanic community faces, such as higher poverty rates (23.6% in 2014) and larger declines in net worth after the recession. Additionally, despite improving perceptions—where 72% of Hispanics feel better off compared to previous periods and 72% expect their children to be better off—the economic realities, including stagnant incomes and wealth gaps, continue to impact their overall economic well-being.\n\nFurthermore, while Hispanics remain optimistic about future economic conditions (image4 and image5), these positive perceptions do not fully align with the actual economic indicators, which suggest continued disparities in income and wealth accumulation. The difference in unemployment trends and economic perceptions creates a complex scenario where positive outlooks coexist with persistent structural inequalities. Overall, the higher unemployment rates among Hispanics contribute to their greater income and wealth disparities, despite growing confidence and demographic growth in the community. \n\n**In summary:** Unemployment rates for Hispanics are higher and more volatile than for non-Hispanics, which adversely affects their income stability and wealth accumulation, perpetuating significant economic disparities between the two groups."}

This upward trend is also evident when comparing the broader perception of economic well-being, which has become more positive over this period, as shown by the rise in favorable opinions from 67% in 2008 to 81% in 2015 among all Hispanics ([8], [4]).\n\nMoreover, when considering family income relative to the cost of living, there hasn't been major change among Latinos between 2014 and 2015, with about half (53%) feeling their income is falling behind in both years, as highlighted in [4] and visualized in the bar chart for 2014-2015 ([image1]). The chart indicates that this perception remained steady, and the proportion of Latinos who felt their income was staying about even or going up faster also showed little variation in this short interval.\n\nHowever, looking further back, comparing 2008 and 2015, data shows a substantial improvement: the percentage of Latinos who believe their overall financial situation is “better off” jumped from 67% in 2008 to 81% in 2015 ([image3]). This suggests a notable shift toward more positive personal finance perceptions post-recession. Additionally, the broader positive sentiment among Hispanics is contrasted by a decline in the general population’s positive perception during the recession years, followed by recovery ([image4], [image5]), implying that Latinos’ outlook has improved more markedly over this period.\n\nIn summary, perceptions of personal finances among Latino groups have become notably more positive from 2008 to 2015, as evidenced by increased ratings of good or excellent finances and overall economic optimism, though perceptions about family income relative to the cost of living remained relatively unchanged during 2014-2015.

As shown in [6], roughly 77% of seniors own cell phones compared to 91% across all adults, whereas smartphone ownership among seniors is substantially lower—just 18% overall, decreasing sharply with age, as detailed in [10], where only 5% of those 80+ own smartphones. Despite this gap, usage trends indicate that seniors who do use the internet tend to do so with increasing frequency when they own devices like smartphones or broadband connections, with [7] showing that 78% of broadband users aged 65+ go online daily.\n\nFurthermore, the adoption of social networking sites among seniors, which is about 27% ([1]), indicates their increasing social engagement online. A significant portion of older adults who use social networks interact frequently, with [9] noting that 81% socialize daily or near daily. Trends over time depicted in [3] and [7] suggest that internet use among seniors has grown steadily from 2000 to 2013, reflecting broader acceptance and integration into daily life. Nonetheless, usage and broadband adoption decline sharply after age 75, as detailed in [8] and [11], emphasizing that age remains a key factor in digital engagement.\n\nIn conclusion, while seniors initially display lower levels of device ownership and internet use compared to all adults, especially in smartphone ownership and broadband access, those who adopt digital technologies often use them regularly, incorporating online activities into their daily routines.

This trend is reinforced by the data in [image4], where higher-educated workers are more likely to perceive technological tools as beneficial, with 70% viewing word processing software positively versus only 25% reporting no impact. Furthermore, higher education correlates with feeling that technologies make work more interesting and enhance career opportunities, as shown in [images5] and [7], where 64% and 53% of college graduates, respectively, feel they have benefited in these areas compared to lower percentages among less educated workers. Overall, education level influences whether workers perceive technology as a positive, neutral, or negative force in their careers, with more educated workers generally viewing it more favorably.\n\nLooking toward the future, public expectations about automation and driverless cars are quite optimistic. As depicted in [image8], a substantial 94% of Americans are aware of driverless vehicle development, and approximately two-thirds anticipate that most vehicles will be autonomous within the next 50 years, with 9% expecting this change within just 10 years. This indicates widespread public optimism about the rapid adoption and impact of driverless car technology, suggesting expectations that autonomous vehicles will become a common part of transportation infrastructure in the foreseeable future.\n\n![A bar chart displaying the expected timeline for driverless cars, with most people predicting widespread adoption within 50 years and some within 10 years](image1)"}

This high level of awareness correlates with a greater sense of enthusiasm and concern. Specifically, among those with high familiarity (\"Heard a lot\"), about 47% feel very or somewhat enthusiastic about the idea of machines performing many jobs [image2], which is significantly higher than the 14% enthusiasm among those who have not heard anything.\n\nHowever, with increased awareness also comes greater worry—76% of those \"Heard a lot\" are very or somewhat worried about machines doing many human jobs, mirroring the worry levels among those with less familiarity [image1][image2]. Even those less familiar or with no exposure at all still display high levels of concern, indicating that worries about automation are widespread regardless of familiarity.\n\nWhen considering the expected outcomes of widespread automation, the general public anticipates more negative consequences. A large majority, about 76%, expect automation to lead to greater economic inequality, and 64% believe people will struggle to find fulfilling activities in a world with extensive machine employment [image6]. Many respondents doubt that automation will create many new, better-paying jobs for humans; only 25% think this will happen, and this optimism drops even further among those with less awareness (just 4-14%) [text4][text10].\n\nIn terms of positive outcomes, fewer Americans expect substantial benefits, such as more efficient economies or more meaningful jobs. Only 25% believe the economy will produce many new, good jobs for humans, while most think it will become more efficient or allow individuals to focus less on work [text4][interleaved]. Overall, higher familiarity with automation tends to increase optimism about potential benefits, but it does not significantly diminish worries—people with more knowledge still express strong concerns about inequality and job displacement.\n\nIn sum, increased awareness about automation tends to correlate with a higher likelihood of enthusiasm for its potential benefits, especially the possibility of machines handling dangerous or unhealthy jobs [2], but simultaneously, it amplifies worries about economic inequality and job loss. The public largely expects that widespread automation will exacerbate inequality and reduce the availability of meaningful human employment, reflecting a complex mix of hope and apprehension [6].\n\n![Concept seems extremely realistic, with a growing number of people hearing about it, and high levels of worry among all levels of awareness](image1)\n\n![Many respondents with higher awareness are somewhat enthusiastic, yet still worried about automation’s impacts](image2)\n\n![Survey results indicating that most Americans expect automation to increase inequality and decrease meaningful jobs](image6)"}

Younger users, especially those aged 18-29, tend to report more intense emotional reactions, frequently feeling amused (around 54%) and also experiencing feelings of loneliness and depression (about 17-36%) compared to older users. Conversely, older adults (65+) report lower emotional intensities across most categories, with many feeling less connected or affected by social media content [8].\n\nEmotionally, it is common for users to encounter highly dramatic or exaggerated posts and arguments or accusations without full facts—58-59% of users see these types of posts frequently, which often evoke feelings of anger or frustration. Notably, men are slightly more likely to see mean or bullying content (29%) than women (19%), who report marginally higher experiences of kindness and support (24%) versus men (17%) [9][8]. Despite these differences, a large proportion of users—over half—perceive a balance of supportive and bullying behaviors, with similar patterns across genders.\n\nMost users also frequently encounter content that overstates or exaggerates (58%) and arguments that start prematurely (59%), which can contribute to negative emotions like anger and frustration. For example, angry feelings are reported by 25% of users frequently, with younger users more prone to such reactions [8].\n\nRegarding the types of posts, overly dramatic and exaggerated content, as well as arguments lacking all facts, are the most common, seen by over 80% of users regularly [8][3]. These posts often evoke negative emotions like anger and can lead to feelings of loneliness or depression, especially in younger users who report higher emotional responses to social media content.\n\nGenders also perceive online behaviors differently: men are more likely to see bullying and deceptive behaviors, while women tend to notice more supportive interactions [9]. When it comes to recommendations and advertisements, most people across age groups find suggestions about local events acceptable, but are more wary about political messages, with only about 30-40% finding political campaign messages acceptable [6][7].\n\nIn summary, younger users tend to experience stronger and more varied emotions, especially amusement and loneliness, while encountering predominantly exaggerated and argumentative content. Men report higher exposure to negative behaviors, whereas women perceive more kindness.

According to the survey data, men are somewhat more likely than women to perceive and encounter negative behaviors; for example, 29% of men see people being mean or bullying, compared to 19% of women [2][10]. Conversely, women are more inclined to view and experience kind or supportive behaviors, with 24% of women reporting more often seeing kindness, versus 17% of men [2][11][4].\n\nWhen it comes to deceptive behaviors and efforts to correct misinformation, the data indicates that men are approximately twice as likely as women to see people being deceptive (24% vs. 13%) [11][4], yet both genders predominantly perceive an equal mix of deceptiveness and corrective actions—about 58-67% in each group [4][12]. These perceptions align with the fact that a large majority of users frequently encounter dramatic, exaggerated posts—58% of users say they see this type of content often or sometimes [6][2], which is the highest among various content types.\n\nThe prevalence of dramatic and exaggerated posts correlates with the considerable exposure to emotionally charged content. This abundance of overly dramatic posts, combined with the perception of a mixed environment of supportive and negative behaviors, underscores that users are consistently navigating a media landscape replete with intense and exaggerated content. Men’s slightly heightened perception of bullying and deception may contribute to their more frequent encounters with such exaggerated posts, echoing overall patterns in how different genders perceive and experience online interactions.\n\nIn summary, men tend to be more aware of and exposed to negativity and deception online, and these perceptions are reflected in the high frequency of encountering exaggerated, dramatic content. Women, on the other hand, tend to experience and view more kindness and support, which may mitigate the feeling of pervasive negativity, but the overall environment remains saturated with exaggerated posts that influence perceptions of online behavior.\n\n---\n\n![A bar chart showing high frequency of dramatic and exaggerated social media posts, with 58% of users encountering them often or sometimes.](image2)"}

Conversely, women tend to see more supportive and kind interactions, with **24% of women** reporting frequent kindness and support compared to **17% of men** [4].\n\nThese perceptions influence how users experience online environments, affecting their comfort with targeted advertising and recommendations. Since both men and women generally see a mix of positive and negative behaviors—about half report an equal mix of supportive and bullying behavior—the differences suggest that men may be more sensitive or alert to deceptive or aggressive content, while women may be more receptive to supportive interactions. \n\nThis distinction indicates that social media platforms could **personalize recommendations** based on these perceptions. For example, platforms might:\n\n- Show **more supportive, community-building content to women**, who report higher kindness support.\n- Intensify **security features and transparency around deceptive or bullying content for men**, to address their heightened perception of deception.\n\nMoreover, given that both genders are largely comfortable with recommendations for local events or connecting with new people—though men are slightly more receptive—platforms might optimize **recommendation algorithms** to cater to different behavioral sensitivities, ensuring content feels authentic and trustworthy for each group.\n\n![People trying to deceive or be kind on social media](image4)\n\nIn summary, recognizing that men perceive social media environments as more deceptive and bullying-prone, while women see more supportive behavior, platforms can tailor their content and recommendation strategies to foster safer and more engaging social spaces for all users."}

Generally, younger users tend to be more accepting of targeted recommendations, while older users show more reluctance.\n\nFor instance, when it comes to using personal data to recommend events happening in one's area, there is a broad acceptance across all age groups, with about 67-80% approving—highest among those aged 18-49 and slightly lower but still majority among those 65 and older [8, image3]. This indicates a general comfort with location-based event suggestions. Conversely, use of data to recommend other people they might want to know has less acceptance, especially among older users—only 36% of those 65+ find it acceptable compared to 66-67% of younger groups [4, image3].\n\nYounger users (ages 18-49) are notably more receptive to using their data for personalized content, including advertisements and friend recommendations, whereas older adults express significant discomfort, especially towards recommendations for new connections and political messaging. For example, about 66-67% of younger users find it acceptable to use their data for recommendations, whereas only about 36-39% of seniors feel the same [4, image3].\n\nThis divergence aligns with overall attitudes towards more sensitive uses such as political messaging. Across all age groups, there is a strong consensus that it is not acceptable for social media to serve political campaign messages, with roughly 30-31% approval and a majority disapproval—particularly among older users, where 31% say it is not acceptable at all [2, image3].\n\nThe emotional responses to content also reflect these perceptions. Younger individuals report stronger emotions, like amusement and feeling connected, suggesting they are more engaged or receptive to content, which may correlate with their higher acceptance of data use for personalized recommendations [4].\n\nIn summary, younger users tend to be more accepting of social media platforms using their data for recommendations and personalization, which aligns with their higher comfort levels with these practices. Older users are more cautious and less accepting, especially regarding recommendations that involve their social network or political content, indicating a perception of higher risk or discomfort with data usage for these purposes.

Generally, although many Americans recognize that these systems can be effective at performing their designated tasks, there is considerable skepticism about their fairness, which impacts overall trust.\n\nFor instance, when examining personal finance scores, about 54% of respondents believe such systems are effective at identifying creditworthiness [12], yet only 32% view them as fair to consumers [11]. This discrepancy of +22 percentage points suggests that people may accept a system’s efficacy even if they doubt its fairness, possibly because financial decisions can be seen as more straightforward and objective. Conversely, when it comes to criminal risk assessments for parole, 49% consider these systems effective, but half (50%) do not find them fair [12], reflecting a more balanced but skeptical perception. The nearly equal split indicates significant doubts about fairness despite perceived effectiveness.\n\nComparing systems for job screening, the effectiveness perceptions are slightly higher; 47% think resume screening is effective, and 43% see it as fair, with only a 4-point difference [12]. The case of video interview analysis shows 39% effectiveness and 33% fairness, a 6-point gap. Interestingly, the assessment of automated parole scoring is more balanced with 49% effectiveness and 50% fairness, practically mirroring each other, which might indicate a slightly more cautious but somewhat neutral trust level in this domain.\n\nThe differences between perceived effectiveness and fairness reveal underlying concerns about bias, transparency, and human judgment. Despite recognizing systems like resume screening or financial scoring as somewhat effective, skepticism remains about whether they treat individuals fairly. The high percentages of people viewing these systems as unacceptable—68% for personal finance scores and 67% for video interviews—underscore widespread doubts rooted in fears of bias, loss of human nuance, and unfair treatment [2]. \n\nThese perceptions imply that public trust in algorithmic decision-making is fragile; acceptance hinges not only on system performance but heavily on fairness and perceived impartiality. When people believe these systems may incorporate bias or reduce humans to impersonal data points, trust diminishes, regardless of their technical effectiveness. Therefore, broader concerns about transparency, bias, and the human element persist across domains, influencing acceptance of these technologies.\n\n![The bar chart shows that while many Americans see automated systems as effective, fewer perceive them as fair, highlighting a gap that affects trust](image8)"}

Over the years, Democratic support increased, especially during Clinton’s presidency, with the gap narrowing by the time of Trump’s presidency, as both parties' support lines converge.\n\n![A line graph depicts the rise and fall of party support for Republicans and Democrats from 1990 to 2019.](image4)\n\nThis realignment coincides with increasing polarization on economic issues. **Image6** shows that, from 2004 onward, Republicans generally maintain a more positive view of Wall Street’s role; as of 2019, 55% of Republicans believe Wall Street helps the economy more than it hurts, compared to only 31% of Democrats who share that view. The perception gap remains notable, with 46% of Democrats believing Wall Street does more to harm than help the economy in 2019.\n\n![A line graph comparing perceptions of Wall Street’s impact across years, highlighting party differences in 2019.](image6)\n\nFurthermore, **image8** illustrates current partisan divides in opinions about Wall Street. Among Republicans, a majority (55%) perceive Wall Street as predominantly beneficial to the economy, whereas nearly half of Democrats (46%) believe it largely harms the economy. These diverging views reflect the broader political and economic dissatisfaction expressed earlier, reinforcing party-specific narratives about economic inequality and corporate influence.\n\n![A chart shows the opposing views of Wall Street’s impact, with Republicans favoring it and Democrats viewing it as harmful.](image8)\n\nOverall, from 1990 to 2019, American public satisfaction has declined markedly, coinciding with increased political polarization. Republicans tend to view Wall Street more favorably, reinforcing their support for policies that focus on financial markets. Democrats, increasingly dissatisfied with national conditions, are more skeptical of Wall Street’s role, viewing it as a source of economic harm. These trends contribute to a growing party division on economic perspectives, shaping debates about the influence of financial institutions on the country's well-being.\n\n**In summary:**\nPublic dissatisfaction with the nation has risen sharply over the years, while political support has polarized, with Republicans viewing Wall Street more positively than Democrats. These trends deepen party divisions on economic issues, reflecting contrasting narratives about the role of Wall Street in shaping the economy."}

In stark contrast, very few Democrats share this confidence; only about 2% of Democratic/lean Democratic respondents are very confident, and around 10% are somewhat confident [11], indicating a significant partisan divide on this issue.\n\nWhen comparing this to other governmental tasks, such as negotiating trade agreements or managing the executive branch, the pattern of confidence appears consistent with the overall partisan trends. For example, 67% of Republicans/lean Republicans are very confident in Trump's ability to negotiate favorable trade agreements, versus just 3% of Democrats/lean Democrats [7]. Similarly, about 52% of Republicans/lean Republicans feel very confident that Trump manages the executive branch effectively, compared to a mere 2% of Democrats/lean Democrats [7].\n\nThis stark contrast reflects that Republicans generally maintain high confidence across various tasks, including judicial appointments, trade negotiations, and executive management, whereas Democrats tend to be largely unconfident in these areas. The confidence levels among Republicans are notably higher—often exceeding 60-65% in the \"Very confident\" category—while Democrats' confidence typically lingers near a few percentage points or is substantially lower, emphasizing the partisan polarization in perceptions of Trump's abilities on these issues [11].\n\nHere's an illustration summarizing the confidence levels:\n\n![Confidence in Trump’s ability to make federal court appointments among partisans](image8)\n\nThis visual emphasizes the vast differences: about 88% of Republicans are confident in Trump's judicial appointment ability versus just around 12% of Democrats, aligning with their confidence in trade negotiations (67% vs. 3%) and managing the executive branch (52% vs. 2%).\n\nIn conclusion, public confidence in Trump's capacity to make good appointments to the federal courts is significantly higher among Republicans than Democrats, and this disparity mirrors their confidence in other key presidential responsibilities like trade negotiations and overall executive management."}

When broken down by party, Republicans or those leaning Republican generally express higher confidence; over half (55%) of Republicans say they are very confident, and 23% are somewhat confident [5], indicating strong intra-party trust. Conversely, Democrats are highly skeptical: nearly 70% (69%) report that they are not at all confident that Trump keeps his business interests separate, with only a small fraction (5%) expressing high confidence [6].\n\nInterleaving the chart data, the opinion trends over time show a persistent divide. The bar chart in image1 illustrates that Republican confidence in Trump’s management of their interests has decreased slightly from January 2017 to January 2019, but remains higher than Democrats' confidence, which has steadily been very low or declining [image1].\n\nNow, regarding perceptions of his responsibility to release tax returns, the majority of the public (64%) believe Trump should release his tax returns, reflecting a broad demand for transparency. Yet, this view diverges sharply along party lines; only about 32% of Republicans think he has the responsibility, while the remaining 64% disagree [9], and within this, the partisan divide is even more stark.\n\nIn summary, confidence that Trump separates his business interests from his presidency is much higher among Republicans and lower among Democrats, with Democrats largely expressing deep distrust. This skepticism correlates with the broader perception that Trump does not feel obligated to release his tax returns, aligning with their doubts over his transparency and potential conflicts of interest. \n\n![A comparison of confidence levels by affiliation, showing Republicans' higher trust versus Democrats' skepticism](image3)\n\nIn conclusion, political affiliation significantly influences how Americans perceive Trump's ability to manage his business interests separately from his presidential duties, with Republicans generally trusting more and Democrats more doubtful.

Similarly, trust in local and state officials is somewhat more balanced but still displays partisan nuances. For example, confidence in hospitals is high across both parties (~88%), but notably, **public health officials** are trusted significantly more by Democrats, whereas Republicans’ confidence in them has declined notably over time, as shown in **Image4**, where Republican confidence dropped from 74% in March to 53% in August.\n\nFurther illustrating partisan differences, **Image8** highlights that 89% of Democrats believe that not enough people are practicing social distancing and mask-wearing, contrasting sharply with only 57% of Republicans. Both groups acknowledge issues like lifting restrictions prematurely, yet the degree of concern and attributions of responsibility differ substantially [8]. Additionally, Democrats tend to attribute the rise in cases more to rising infections rather than testing, aligning with a more critical view of governmental handling [2].\n\nOverall, these divides mean that Republicans tend to have more positive perceptions of the U.S. response—about 42% say it has been about as effective, and 22% say it has been more effective—while Democrats overwhelmingly view the response as inadequate [8]. Trust in health authorities like the CDC has also waned more among Republicans, as **Image4** shows, with their approval ratings decreasing significantly since the early stages of the pandemic.\n\nIn summary, partisan divides shape perceptions in ways that influence both the evaluation of the government's COVID-19 response and the trust placed in institutions, often creating a polarized landscape where partisan loyalty aligns with differing assessments of effectiveness and credibility."}

Conversely, Republicans and Republican-leaning voters are much more supportive; approximately 81% of Republicans strongly favor requiring photo IDs, reflecting a high level of bipartisan support but with a noticeable partisan split overall [11].\n\n![A bar chart showing approval ratings for requiring photo ID among different voter groups, with Democrats at 49% approval and Republicans at 38% approval—highlighting higher support among Republicans](image2)  \n*This chart underlines the party divide in support for photo ID requirements, with Republicans more strongly in favor.*\n\nIn summary, while a large majority supports requiring government-issued photo IDs for voting, support is notably higher among racial minorities and Republicans, and comparatively lower among White Democrats. These differences highlight the complex intersection of race and political ideology in shaping voting policy preferences. The data show that support for photo ID requirements is generally strong but varies significantly depending on race and partisan affiliation."}

Overall, Black adults tend to show higher support for policies that make voting easier, such as allowing 'no excuse' early and absentee voting, with 81% supporting early voting across age groups [11], and 85% favoring voting rights for felons after serving sentences [8]. Conversely, White adults are generally less inclined toward expansive policies; for example, they are less supportive of automatic voter registration and making Election Day a national holiday, with support levels around 54% to 61% for these policies [5,11], and about 38% of White adults favor requiring government-issued photo ID to vote [7]. \n\nSupport for photo identification is notably higher among Black (65%) and Hispanic (72%) Democrats compared to White Democrats (54%) [7], indicating racial-ethnic differences within partisan lines. These differences may stem from varying levels of trust in voting processes, perceived barriers, or historical contexts. For example, Black Americans strongly favor policies that widen access (e.g., 85% support for voting rights after felony convictions [8]) and show less support for restrictive policies such as removal from registration lists [9].\n\nVisual data reinforces these patterns: images show that support among racial groups for policies like early voting and voter ID is higher in Black and Hispanic populations than in White populations, and that Republicans are generally less supportive of these policies compared to Democrats, with substantial partisan divides [1,6]. For instance, support for automatic registration is high among Democrats (around 80%+) across all racial groups, but lower among Republicans, especially conservatives (around 30-35%) [1,6].\n\nIn summary, racial and ethnic differences influence voting policy support: Black and Hispanic Americans tend to favor more accessible voting policies, while White Americans, especially within the Republican base, are more cautious or supportive of restrictive measures like voter ID requirements. These differences are further accentuated by partisan ideology, which remains the dominant factor shaping opinions [3,6].\n\n![The image shows support for various voting policies across racial and partisan lines, highlighting the higher support among minority groups for expanding voting access](image4)"}

Conversely, Democratic respondents, particularly Black, Hispanic, and Asian Democrats, show considerably less support; only about 30% of Democrats overall favor strict photo ID requirements, with support increasing among Black (65%), Hispanic (72%), and Asian Democrats (71%) [3]. The racial disparities underscore that Black and Hispanic adults tend to oppose more restrictive voting policies, including photo ID requirements, aligning with their broader support for more accessible voting options.\n\n![A chart showing over 81% of Republicans strongly favor photo ID requirements, compared to about 30% support among Democrats](image1)\n\nIn comparison to views on voting accessibility policies, these differences are even more striking. Racial groups, especially Black adults, tend to support policies that expand voting access, such as early and absentee voting. Black adults are particularly supportive of policies like allowing people convicted of felonies to vote after serving their sentences, with 85% favoring this [9], and they show the lowest support for restrictive policies like removing inactive voters and requiring photo IDs [10]. Furthermore, the overall support for making Election Day a national holiday and automatically registering all eligible citizens is higher among Black, Hispanic, and Asian adults than among White adults [11].\n\nPolitically, Democrats are significantly more supportive of accessible voting policies: for instance, approximately 84% of Democrats support allowing all voters to vote early or absentee, whereas only about 38% of Republicans do [6], and large majorities across races favor policies like printing paper backups for electronic votes and making early voting available for at least two weeks prior to Election Day [12].\n\nOverall, the data illustrate that racial and political affiliations shape perspectives greatly: Black, Hispanic, and Asian adults, as well as Democrats, tend to oppose restrictive policies like photo ID requirements and favor expanding voting access, whereas Republicans, especially White Republicans, largely support measures that impose stricter voting requirements.\n\n![A bar chart indicating that over 81% of Republicans strongly favor photo ID requirements, while support among Democrats is around 30%](image1)\n\n**In summary**, racial and political affiliations heavily influence opinions, with minorities and Democrats generally opposing restrictive photo ID policies and supporting more accessible voting, contrasting with majority Republican support for stricter requirements."}

For voting methods, particularly no-excuse early and absentee voting, a significant majority of Democrats (84%) favor open voting options, as shown in [1], where only 16% of Democrats believe voters should provide documented reasons for absentee voting [11]. Conversely, Republicans are more likely to require documented reasons: 62% of Republicans support requiring documentation, according to the bar chart in [image1], with even higher percentages among conservative Republicans (70%). Moreover, among Republicans who voted absentee in 2020, 52% support no-excuse voting, contrasted with only 38% among those who voted in person [11].\n\nWhen it comes to redistricting proposals, public opinion is also divided along party lines. Approximately half of adults overall approve of establishing independent commissions for drawing district maps, with 49% approval and only 13% disapproval, while 38% are unsure [9]. Partisans show a clear split: 84% of Democrats favor replacing districting with independent commissions, whereas only 16% of Republicans support it [1]. Furthermore, Republicans tend to disapprove or be uncertain about redistricting reforms; for example, moderate and liberal Republicans are split on requiring documented reasons for early voting (around 49%) versus not (51%) [10], and many Republicans remain unsure or disapprove of these measures.\n\nSupporting this, the visual data shows Democrats overwhelmingly support flexible voting options, while Republicans tend toward stricter requirements. For example, in the chart from [image1], 84% of Democrats support open early voting, compared to only 38% of Republicans, who mostly favor requiring documented reasons. Similarly, the approval ratings for redistricting reforms reflect party divisions, with Democrats strongly backing independent commissions, while Republicans show less enthusiasm and more uncertainty.\n\nIn summary, Democrats tend to favor accessible voting methods without strict documentation requirements and support redistricting reforms favoring independent commissions, whereas Republicans are more cautious or opposed, emphasizing documented reasons for voting and preferring traditional districting methods.\n\n![The bar chart illustrates that Democrats overwhelmingly support open early and absentee voting, while Republicans favor requiring documented reasons for voting in person or by mail.](image1)"}

In 2018, fewer than half of Republicans (42%) supported allowing voters to vote early or absentee without a documented reason [2]. By 2021, the percentage of Republicans who believe any voter should be allowed to vote early or absentee without a reason dropped further, from 57% down to 38% [7], indicating increasing skepticism within the Republican camp. Conversely, Democratic support for no-excuse early voting has remained consistently high, with about 84% favoring this policy, and their views have remained relatively stable over time [7]. In fact, Democrats consistently show strong backing—around 82-84%—for automatic voter registration, with little change since 2018 [4][7].\n\nVisual data from the charts corroborate these trends. For example, in images 1 and 8, the support among Democrats for automatic registration exceeds 80% in both 2018 and 2021, illustrating stability. Meanwhile, Republican support for the same policy has decreased from approximately 49% in 2018 to about 38% in 2021 [8], showing a discernible decline. Similarly, support for allowing felons to vote after serving sentences equally has remained high among Democrats (around 84%), but has slightly decreased among Republicans [4].\n\nThe key takeaway is that while Democratic support for these voting policies has remained solid and stable, Republican support for 'no excuse' early absentee voting has diminished significantly, pointing to growing partisan polarization over voting access policies. Overall, the data reflect a trend toward increased Democratic backing for expansion of voting rights, contrasted with a decline in Republican support for the same measures between 2018 and 2021."}

Additionally, within the community, there's a perception of division, with 45% of Hispanics seeing \"a great deal of difference\" between political groups, almost evenly split among partisan lines [image1].\n\nSignificantly, the importance of issues has shifted, with abortion rising sharply among Hispanics—57% now see it as very important, up from 42% in March—highlighting its increasing relevance in voting decisions especially after the Supreme Court's decision to overturn federally guaranteed abortion rights [2]. Meanwhile, the economy remains the top concern for Latino voters, with 80% ranking it as very important, consistent since March [11], [12], and health care, violence, education, and gun policy also feature prominently. These issues shape electoral priorities, with many voters expressing that they would vote based on candidates' stances on these topics [4], [10].\n\nDemographic factors such as the strength of Hispanic identity influence voting preferences. For example, 60% of those emphasizing their Hispanic identity as extremely or very important are more likely to support Democratic candidates [6].

The stable pattern indicates that, despite differing perceptions of engagement strategies, the core partisan affiliations within the Latino community have remained largely unchanged.\n\n![Line graph showing slight fluctuations but overall stability in Latino party identification over the years](image1)\n\nIn summary, Latino Democrats tend to perceive the Democratic Party as both caring about Latinos and working hard to earn their votes, reinforcing their party loyalty. Conversely, Latino Republicans often view the Republican Party less as prioritizing Latino interests, which can contribute to their consistent party identification. These perceptions, reinforced by survey data and visual trends, underscore a community whose party allegiance remains stable despite varying views on engagement efforts by the parties."}

According to recent surveys, many Hispanics perceive some degree of difference between the Democratic and Republican parties, though the extent varies within subgroups. For instance, a substantial portion (45%) of all Hispanics believe there is a great deal of difference between the parties, and this perception is consistent among those who identify as or lean toward Democrats (47%) and Republicans (48%) as shown in the chart labeled `![perceived differences among Hispanics based on political affiliation](image1)`. \n\nFurthermore, the overall support for each party remains relatively stable, with Latino registered voters favoring Democrats over Republicans by nearly two-to-one (64% vs. 33%), a trend that has persisted in recent years (quotes [3], [8], [12]). Support levels also differ based on demographics and religious or cultural importance; for example, Latinos who consider their Hispanic identity extremely or very important tend to lean more toward Democratic support, reflecting the importance of cultural identity in political alignment (quotes [9], [6], [7]).\n\nOver time, while some Hispanics see only a fair amount of difference between the parties (36%), a significant share perceives a great deal of difference (45%)—indicating increasing awareness of distinct party platforms. Views also fluctuate regarding how much parties care about Latinos; most Latinos believe the Democratic Party works hard and cares about their interests, whereas fewer hold this positive view of the GOP (quotes [5], [9], [7]).\n\nSupport for the parties’ efforts to earn Latino votes has historically been higher for Democrats, with about 81% believing the Democratic Party works hard to earn Hispanic votes, compared to 56% for Republicans (quotes [7], [9]). However, perceptions of how well each party cares about Latinos remain polarized, with Democrats being viewed favorably more often than Republicans (quotes [7], [11]).\n\nIn summary, Hispanics increasingly recognize relevant differences between the parties but continue to predominantly favor the Democratic Party, with their support and perceptions influenced by factors like cultural identity, religious affiliation, and political experiences over recent years. This ongoing alignment suggests both stability and complexity in Hispanic political support and perceptions of party differences."}

Despite this recognition, about half of Hispanics still see little difference between the parties, indicating an ambivalence or perception of overlap in policy positions [1], [2], [6], [8].\n\nSupport for each party also varies by demographic factors such as religious affiliation and importance of Hispanic identity. For instance, Latino voters who identify as or lean toward the Democratic Party do so by a nearly two-to-one margin (64% vs. 33%) and generally believe that the Democrats work hard to earn their votes and truly care about Latinos [4], [6], [10]. Conversely, Republican-leaning Latinos tend to perceive less care from Democrats but still see some support from Republicans.\n\nDespite these perceptions, Latino voters’ party affiliation remains mostly stable over recent years, with little change reported in the proportion identifying with or leaning toward the Democratic Party, roughly 64% [4], [7]. However, the fact that about 45% see a great deal of difference and many believe that the parties differ significantly indicates ongoing political engagement and potential for shifts depending on issue salience and party policies.\n\nThe perception that issues like the economy are very important—highlighted by the fact that 80% of Latinos consider the economy a top voting issue—could influence their party support, especially if one party's policies align more closely with their economic priorities [1], [11], [12].\n\nVisual data, such as the bar graphs showing Latinos' views on how well parties care about and work to earn their votes, reveal that Latinos generally perceive Democrats as more attentive and committed compared to Republicans [image6]. Still, a significant minority, especially within Republican-leaning subsets, feel less connected to or supported by either party, possibly leading to softer party ties or a shift toward independent voting.\n\nIn conclusion, while many Latino voters recognize clear differences between parties and maintain consistent party affiliations, their perceptions are nuanced by issue importance and personal trust in party efforts. The stable or slightly shifting perceptions may influence their political alignment in upcoming elections, especially if parties adjust their outreach and policies to better address Latino interests and perceptions of authenticity.\n\n---\n\n![The image is a series of bar graphs comparing perceptions of the Democratic and Republican parties regarding their relationship with Latino voters.

From the data, around 71% believe STEM jobs pay better, and 58% think they attract more of the brightest young talent [6], [2]. When comparing gender-specific perceptions, women in STEM are more likely than men to value jobs that focus on helping others and that provide societal respect. Specifically, 60% of women consider a job that helps others important compared to only 31% of men, a significant difference of 29 percentage points [5]. Additionally, 50% of women value making a meaningful contribution compared to 43% of men, indicating women place more emphasis on societal impact [5].\n\nOn the other hand, men in STEM are more inclined than women to prioritize higher pay and opportunities for promotion. For instance, 59% of men regard high-paying jobs as important versus 48% of women, a 11-point difference. Similarly, 57% of men value opportunities for promotion compared to 46% of women [11], reflecting a gender gap in the prioritization of salary and advancement prospects.\n\nFurthermore, perceptions about flexibility to balance work and family are relatively similar between genders, with 76% of women and 71% of men valuing this characteristic — the difference here is not statistically significant [5]. Men tend to emphasize higher pay and promotion, while women are more focused on societal contribution and respect in their jobs.\n\nIn essence, while both men and women recognize the higher compensation and prestige associated with STEM careers, women tend to place greater importance on making a societal impact and working in respectful environments, whereas men prioritize opportunities for higher salary and career advancement [5], [11]. This difference influences how each gender perceives desirable job characteristics in STEM fields.\n\n![A comparative chart illustrating that women value helping others and societal respect in STEM jobs more than men, who prioritize higher pay and advancement opportunities](image5)"}

According to the chart comparing job characteristics valued by men and women in STEM, both genders highly value **flexibility to balance work and family**, with 71% of men and 76% of women emphasizing this need, a difference that is not statistically significant [7]. Similarly, both groups appreciate a **welcoming workplace environment**, with 48% of men and 53% of women recognizing its importance, again showing similar priorities.\n\nHowever, notable disparities emerge when it comes to opportunities for advancement, pay, and personal fulfillment. For example, **more men than women value the availability of promotion opportunities** (57% vs. 46%), and **higher pay** is more important to men (59% vs. 48%) [7]. Conversely, women place greater importance on **making meaningful contributions and helping others**—60% of women versus 51% of men value meaningful societal impact, and a striking 59% of women prioritize jobs that help others, compared to only 31% of men [7]. Similarly, women are more inclined to seek jobs that **focus on helping others** and make a **meaningful societal contribution**, reflecting a strong desire for work that aligns with altruistic values.\n\nThese differing priorities relate closely to the perceived difficulties women encounter when entering the STEM workforce. The quotes and evidence from the charts highlight that **women face significant barriers such as discrimination and limited encouragement**, which directly impact their career progression and job satisfaction [1], [3], [5]. The bar chart illustrating reasons why women are underrepresented shows that **discrimination in recruitment and hiring**, **lack of early encouragement**, and **work-life balance challenges** are major hurdles, affecting their ability to enter and advance in STEM fields [image1].\n\nFurthermore, the perception that **workplaces are not sufficiently diverse** or inclusive may dissuade women from pursuing or sticking with STEM careers, especially when combined with the desire for meaningful and helping roles—attributes more highly valued by women. The emphasis on values like societal contribution and helping others suggests that workplaces that align with these values could better attract and retain women in STEM.\n\nIn summary, while both men and women in STEM value flexibility and a respectful environment, women significantly prioritize meaningful, societal, and helping roles over advancement and pay, which correlates with their greater experiences of discrimination and challenges in gaining equal opportunities. Creating inclusive environments that support women’s desire for meaningful work and addressing discrimination are essential to overcoming barriers to entry and advancement for women in STEM.\n\n![Women in STEM value helping others and societal contribution more than men](image7)"}

According to the data, STEM workers tend to have higher education levels, with about 65% earning at least a bachelor's degree and roughly 29% holding postgraduate degrees [6]. This elevated level of education correlates with their predominant employment in private, for-profit sectors, where 66% of STEM workers are employed in such settings, especially in fields like engineering and computer science, where the figures are even higher—82% and 77% respectively [7][4].\n\n![Most STEM workers work in private, for-profit sectors, especially engineers and computer specialists](image4). This bar chart illustrates that in STEM jobs, a majority are employed by private, for-profit organizations—82% for engineers and 77% for computer workers—compared to the overall employment pattern where 66% are in the private sector, indicating that higher education facilitates access to lucrative private employment opportunities. Conversely, non-STEM workers tend to have lower educational attainment, with a higher percentage (37%) having a high school diploma or less, and are more evenly distributed across employment sectors, including government and non-profit sectors [7][12].\n\n![Line graphs show increasing educational attainment among women in STEM over time](image7), especially at the master's and professional/doctoral levels, reflects the increasing demand for advanced degrees in STEM employment.

Moreover, a significant portion of STEM workers (about 29%) possess master's, professional, or doctoral degrees, which is more than double the 12% of non-STEM workers with similar advanced degrees [5]. The visualization in the third image confirms this disparity by showing that nearly half (47%) of STEM workers hold a bachelor's degree, whereas slightly less (49%) of all employed individuals do, and a larger share of STEM workers (41%) have postgraduate degrees compared to non-STEM counterparts.\n\nIn terms of employment sectors, STEM workers are predominantly employed in private, for-profit organizations, with about 66% working in such environments, similar to the overall employment pattern [4]. Engineers and computer workers are especially likely to work for private employers—with 82% and 77% respectively [4], as shown in the second image. However, within specific STEM areas like physical sciences and health, a notable portion works in government or not-for-profit sectors, indicating diversity in employment settings [4].\n\nOver time, trends in educational levels and employment sectors reveal growth but with disparities. The first image highlights that women in STEM have experienced notable increases in advanced degrees from 1990 to 2016, particularly among those with professional or doctoral degrees, where the percentage rose from 27% to 41% [image1]. Meanwhile, a consistent increase in STEM employment in health-related professions is evident from the sixth and seventh images, showing a steady rise in education levels and a slight shift towards more employment in government and non-profit sectors, especially among physical scientists and life sciences.\n\nFurther, trends over time from 1990 to 2016 show that the percentage of women with higher education in STEM jobs has risen, with the most substantial increases among those with master's and doctoral degrees, indicating a shift toward higher educational attainment among women in STEM [image1]. Simultaneously, employment in specific STEM sectors like computer science has slightly declined, but in engineering, there's been a slight increase, reflecting evolving sector dynamics [image8].\n\nIn summary, STEM workers tend to have higher educational qualifications than non-STEM workers, with increasing trends in advanced degree attainment over time.

Among these, cultural connection and language play especially significant roles, with their importance diminishing as generations progress.\n\nInitially, many foreign-born Hispanic individuals strongly identify with their cultural and linguistic roots, often speaking Spanish and holding Spanish last names, which reinforce their Hispanic identity [7, image1]. For example, while 58% of foreign-born Hispanics do not speak Spanish, a majority still identify as Hispanic based on cultural or familial ties. Conversely, as we move to second and higher generations, the percentage who speak Spanish drops sharply—only about 15% of second-generation Hispanics speak Spanish [image1], and over 92% do not have Spanish last names [image1]—which can weaken their cultural connection, potentially affecting their self-identification.\n\nMoreover, the data indicates that the likelihood of identifying as Hispanic decreases with increasing generational distance from immigrant roots; only 70% of third or higher-generation Hispanics self-identify as Hispanic [image7], compared to 85% of foreign-born Hispanics, and only 26% among the fourth or higher generations [10].

Germany's position reflects a moderate to high vehicle ownership, with a well-developed automotive industry.\n\nIn terms of CO2 emissions per capita, the pie chart highlights that the transportation sector accounts for approximately 24% of total CO2 emissions globally (Image 2), emphasizing its importance in overall emissions. European and Japanese standards for passenger vehicles are the most stringent, likely resulting in lower per capita emissions compared to countries with less strict standards [11]. Meanwhile, South Korea faces rising greenhouse gas emissions from passenger vehicles, indicating potential increases in per capita emissions unless measures are taken [10].\n\nThe map of black carbon emissions shows that regions with high vehicle activity and energy use, such as parts of Asia and the Americas, exhibit higher emission levels [4]. The historical trend line demonstrates that global emissions have increased markedly since the industrial revolution, with current levels driven by high-energy consumption and vehicle use in developed nations [5][6][13].\n\nPutting this together, the USA's high motor vehicle ownership correlates with high per capita CO2 emissions, reflecting substantial environmental impacts from transportation. Germany, with stricter standards and moderate vehicle ownership, likely has lower emissions per capita than the USA but higher than China. China's rapid vehicle growth suggests its per capita emissions could rise significantly if current trends continue. Therefore, high vehicle ownership coupled with less stringent standards contributes to greater environmental impact, particularly in the US, whereas policies and vehicle efficiency standards can mitigate some effects, as seen in Europe and Japan.\n\n![A bubble chart comparing motor vehicle demand and ownership across countries](image3)  \n*The bubble chart shows the US leading in vehicle ownership and demand, while China and Germany have moderate levels.*\n\nIn summary, the USA's high per capita vehicle ownership and less stringent standards contribute to greater CO2 emissions per person compared to Germany, which benefits from stricter standards, and China, where vehicle ownership is still expanding. This underscores the importance of vehicle efficiency and emission standards in managing environmental impacts."}

This substantial figure is supported by a visual depiction of a currency note background emphasizing liquidity events, highlighting the importance of recent exit activities [image6].\n\nIn terms of investment activity, a multi-region comparison reveals that the USA dominates venture capital investments, accounting for around 82% of total capital invested since 2004, compared to Europe's 18% [image7]. This is evident from the multi-bar chart, which shows the USA's leading role in key metrics such as total capital invested, number of large exits, and \"home runs\" or 10x multiple investments. Specifically, the USA accounts for 78% of exits over $100 million and 64% of high-return investments, whereas Europe’s share is considerably lower [image7].\n\nFurthermore, the charts and quotes suggest that while the US venture market is more mature and active, Europe is experiencing a recent surge in large exits and improving performance metrics. European IPOs, for example, have shown better post-IPO performance than U.S. counterparts over the period 2004-2011 [2, 10, image2], and recent European exit volumes, especially in Germany, have surged [9]. Despite a relatively smaller investment pool, Europe's higher capital efficiency and a higher median multiple of cash invested (7.2x in Europe vs. 4.5x in the US) demonstrate the efficiency and potential for growth in the European VC space [4, 11, image4].\n\nOverall, while the US leads significantly in both investment and exit count, recent European data shows a growing ecosystem with increasing liquidity events and improving exit performance, reflecting a maturation and deepening of the European venture capital scene over the last two years.\n\n**In summary,** venture-backed liquidity events in Europe over the last 24 months amount to around $15 billion, while the US still dominates in overall investment volume and exit activity, though Europe is catching up in terms of efficiency and recent exit trends."}

European VC funds demonstrate higher capital efficiency largely due to lower entry valuations, leading to overperformance in exit multiples despite smaller exit values on average [1, 9, 11].\n\nFor instance, European VC funds tend to produce higher exit multiples, with the lower entry valuations allowing them to compensate for smaller absolute exit values (around 25% less than US exits), resulting in better return multiples [9]. One visual representation shows Europe having a median multiple of 7.2 times the cash invested, compared to 4.5 in the USA, with a higher percentage (57.26%) of investments returning fivefold or more [4, 10, 11].\n\nThe charts emphasize that Europe, although investing less overall—only about 18% of venture capital funds compared to the US’s 82%—produces a significant share of large exits and high-return investments. For example, a bar chart indicates Europe accounts for 22% of exits over $100 million, while the US accounts for 78%; yet, Europe’s exits tend to yield higher multiples [8, 12].\n\nFurthermore, European IPOs and trade sales have historically shown performance matching or exceeding US counterparts post-IPO, with European IPOs maintaining better index performance between 2004 and 2011 [7]. The visual comparison of IPO post-performance demonstrates that European IPOs often outperform US IPOs in the long run [7].\n\nIn summary, though Europe’s absolute exit values are smaller, the higher capital efficiency, lower entry valuations, and superior exit multiples collectively suggest European VC yields are attractive, especially considering the higher success rate of reaching significant returns relative to invested capital [2, 5, 6].\n\n![The image comparing venture capital investments and exits across European regions shows Europe’s larger proportion in high-value exits relative to its total investments, reflecting strong exit multiples.]  \n![The chart comparing venture capital metrics illustrates Europe’s relatively higher share in large, high-multiple exits despite less total invested capital.]"}

This group is one of the prominent caste groups, reflecting Nepal's traditional social hierarchy. \n\nReligiously, Hinduism remains overwhelmingly predominant, with 84.9% of the population adhering to it in September 2014 [image1], up from 81.3% previously. This high percentage aligns with the cultural significance of Hinduism among many caste groups, especially the Chhetri and Brahmin populations, who are traditionally Hindu.\n\nGeographically, the population distribution is relatively evenly spread across Nepal’s regions, with the Central region holding the largest share at 36.5%, followed by Eastern (21.9%), Western (18.7%), Mid-Western (13.3%), and Far-Western (9.6%) regions [image8]. These regions, especially the Central ones, are home to diverse ethnicities and caste groups, including the Chhetri caste, which is well represented across the country.\n\nInterconnecting these demographics, the dominance of Hinduism correlates strongly with the prevalence of certain caste groups like Chhetri, Raute, Khas, and Bahun, many of whom are followers of Hindu beliefs. The survey data showing that roughly 83% of respondents come from rural areas [1,9] also fits with the traditional concentration of caste and ethnic groups in rural Nepal, where Hindu practices are more entrenched.\n\nFurthermore, the ethnicity data reveals that groups like the Chhetri (and other Brahmin and Khas groups) are significant to the overall population makeup, and their cultural and religious practices influence the observed religious majority. The ethnic and caste compositions are mirrored in geographic distribution; for example, the Terai region's Madhesi populations and other groups tend to have different religious affiliations and social structures (though detailed ethnicity-religion correlation data is limited in the quotes).\n\nIn summary, the demographic data as of September 2014 illustrates a demographic fabric where caste/ethnic identities, predominantly Hindu, are strongly linked to geographic region distributions, with rural and central regions hosting a majority of Hindus from various caste groups such as Chhetri and Brahmin. The dominance of Hinduism among those ethnic groups reinforces the close association between caste/ethnicity and religion, while geographic distribution reflects the prominence of these groups across Nepal’s regions.\n\n**![A breakdown showing Nepal’s population distribution across caste/ethnicity, religion, and regions as of September 2014](image6)**"}

This widespread engagement supports a vibrant online environment where users frequently access platforms like Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter, which dominate the top sites [8,9]. Notably, instant messaging apps such as LINE are installed on many devices, with LINE alone having about 30 million Indonesian users in 2014 [10].\n\nThis active online engagement correlates with e-commerce behaviors where approximately 20% of sales on Indonesian sites like lojai.com and Tokobagus/OLX are mobile-originated, indicating significant mobile shopping activity [7]. The data also shows that users prefer online shopping for apparel (67.1%), bags (20%), and shoes (20%)—products that are easily accessible via mobile platforms [4]. Additionally, there is a preference for shopping for apparel online despite traditional offline popularity, with 67.1% of online shoppers choosing apparel, contrasting with offline preferences where apparel is bought in-person [4].\n\nDemographic data indicates that a large portion of mobile internet users are young adults (32% aged 18-24 and 33% aged 25-35), who are tech-savvy and more likely to shop online. These users are primarily students, entrepreneurs, or full-time workers—groups that are increasingly accustomed to mobile content and online purchasing [3,7,12]. The high penetration of mobile devices and social media usage creates a seamless environment where users’ activities—social media consumption, content downloads (games/apps, videos), and online shopping—intersect, reinforcing each other. The graphic showing mobile content downloads emphasizes that games/apps (70%) and videos (49%) are most popular, which often serve as gateways to targeted online shopping ads and social commerce [2,6].\n\nIn sum, the lively social media and entertainment activities foster a community inclined toward online shopping, especially for apparel and accessories, leveraging the widespread mobile internet access and preferences for instant messaging and content consumption. The high engagement in social media and entertainment indirectly supports the growth of mobile commerce by increasing exposure to shopping through social platforms, advertising, and content-related marketing.\n\n![The graphic showing mobile internet activities and download statistics illustrates high engagement in social media and entertainment, which promote shopping behaviors in Indonesia](image2)"}

This youthful demographic favors high engagement with mobile content, highlighted by the fact that 70% of downloaded mobile content consists of games and apps, followed by video (49%) and music (44%) [3]. Additionally, the graphic on mobile activities emphasizes social media (24%) and entertainment (20%) as leading usage categories, which align with the occupation data indicating many users are students, entrepreneurs, or full-time workers, constituting a vibrant, digitally savvy market [8].\n\nThe high ownership of Facebook accounts (92%) and the fact that 60% of users access Facebook via mobile reinforce the preference for social media-based content. The top websites like Facebook, Google, YouTube, and local portals such as Detik emphasize the importance of social, informational, and entertainment content for these users [7], [9]. The predominant use of instant messaging (IM), with WhatsApp, LINE, and BBM leading, underscores a demand for communication platforms and social engagement that can be leveraged for targeted marketing and advertising.\n\nBusiness opportunities are abundant given these patterns. The strong preference for mobile apps, social media, and multimedia content supports expansion in mobile advertising, which in 2013 was worth around \\$9.5 million and expected to grow to 5-10% of the total ad market by 2015 [5]. E-commerce is also thriving, with 20-26% of users shopping online, primarily for apparel, shoes, and bags, mainly through social media and IM groups [8], [5].

As shown in the bar charts and data, Telkomsel's number of subscribers was substantial, with 139.3 million subscribers reported in 2014 (see image6). This reflects continuous growth, although precise 2013 figures aren't specified here, the overall trend indicates an increase in subscribers over this period, supported by the sustained growth of Indonesian mobile subscribers, which grew from 2006 to 2010 at an annual rate of 31.9% [8].  \n\nThe ARPU for Telkomsel's prepaid services declined during this period. The line graph (image2) illustrates that both Voice and SMS ARPU continued to trend downward from 2013 through 2015, while Mobile Data ARPU declined initially but then started to rise again around 2015 as users increased their data consumption. Specifically, the bar chart comparing ARPU over years (image1) shows a decline in prepaid ARPU values from 2008 to 2012, and although not explicitly for 2013-2014, the overall decreasing trend likely persisted into 2014.\n\nThe decline in ARPU can be attributed to several factors. The widespread adoption of smartphones and instant messaging apps, such as WhatsApp, BBM, and LINE (see [10]), led to a reduction in traditional voice and SMS usage, resulting in lower ARPU for those services. Moreover, data consumption was increasing, prompting users to enroll in larger data plans to accommodate higher internet usage, which eventually helped ARPU to stabilize or increase after 2015.\n\nAdditionally, the competition driven by GSM operators reducing tariffs (see [6]) due to aggressive pricing wars and the technological shift toward GSM dominance (see images 3 and 4) further pressured ARPU. The increasing smartphone penetration, with a significant number of users on Android and BlackBerry, also contributed to changing revenue patterns by shifting revenue sources from voice/SMS to data services.\n\nIn conclusion, from 2013 to 2014, Telkomsel's subscriber base continued to grow, benefiting from rising mobile penetration in Indonesia, while ARPU from traditional voice and SMS services declined due to shifts in user behavior toward instant messaging and data services. These trends were driven by the proliferation of smartphones, increased consumption of mobile internet, and competitive pricing strategies by operators.\n\n![The line graph in image2 illustrates the decline in Voice and SMS ARPU and the rise in Data ARPU after 2015](image2)\n\n![The bar chart in image1 shows the decrease in prepaid ARPU for multiple operators from 2008 to 2012, implying continued trends into 2013-2014](image1)\n\n![The pie chart (image3) highlights Telkomsel's dominant market share, providing a strong subscriber base](image3)"}

XL's smartphone user base also increased to 15 million within the same period [3]. This rapid smartphone adoption correlates with Indonesia's rising mobile internet usage, where nearly 20% of sales on e-commerce sites like lojai.com came from mobile devices around May 2014 [9], and various providers, including Telkomsel, partnering with manufacturers such as Samsung to boost smartphone penetration [3].\n\nSimultaneously, the ARPU (Average Revenue Per User) for prepaid services declined, as shown in the bar chart comparing ARPU between 2008 and 2012 [2, 5], and the line graph illustrating declining ARPU over 2013-2017 [1]. Specifically, Telkomsel's ARPU dropped from Rp53,000 in 2008 to Rp34,000 in 2012 [3], and similar downward trends persisted around 2013-2014, partly due to increased competition and the price war initiated by government policies [11], which reduced tariffs and led to lower revenue per user. The proliferation of affordable smartphones and the growing use of data-based messaging and VoIP (as noted in recent usage trends [4]) contributed to decreasing voice and SMS ARPU, further pressuring overall revenue.\n\nThe surge in smartphone penetration and internet services shifted consumer behavior toward data-centric usage, diminishing traditional voice and SMS revenues while fostering increased data consumption, as shown by the trend of rising data users [3] and the upward movement in mobile data ARPU after 2015 [1]. These dynamics underscore a transition in the telecom landscape driven by technological adoption, consumer preferences, and strategic operator responses.\n\n![The image is a line graph illustrating declining ARPU for Voice and SMS, and a rise in Data ARPU after 2015, reflecting the shift towards data usage in Indonesia](image1)"}

According to the data, **iOS experienced the fastest adoption rate ever** in 2015, with more than 50% of devices actively using the iOS 9 update shortly after its release [8]. This rapid adoption demonstrates a strong and immediate user base for iOS devices, driven by Apple's focused ecosystem and timely updates.\n\nIn contrast, **Android's market share is significantly larger and more varied** across different versions. The distribution chart shows that **Lollipop, Android's latest OS, accounts for around 35% of Android devices**, indicating a steady but somewhat slower adoption process compared to iOS [6]. Additionally, the global OS market share trend over three years highlights Android’s dominance, reaching **82.8% by Q2 2015** [6], whereas iOS's market share remained relatively stable but much lower, at approximately **13.9%** in the same period, reflecting its more limited but rapidly updating device base [6].\n\nRegarding developer mindshare, a notable point is that **Android developers outnumber iOS developers by a ratio of 4 to 3**, although a small percentage (~2%) of developers focus on Windows Phone, and about 20% don't identify with any specific platform [11][12]. This suggests that while Android has a larger consumer market and a broader user base, its developer community is slightly smaller than that of iOS, which benefits from higher user engagement with the latest OS versions and quicker adoption of updates like iOS 9.\n\nInterleaved with this, the pie chart (image1) possibly reflects the market share distribution akin to these OS trends, with a dominant segment representing Android, given its overwhelming global market presence [1]. The app store growth, shown in the bar chart (image3), further emphasizes that Google Play has more apps (over 1.6 million) than the Apple App Store (about 1.5 million) in 2015, reflecting robust developer activity in the Android ecosystem [9].\n\nIn summary, iOS boasted the fastest OS adoption rate in recent times, enabling developers to target a highly active user base rapidly, whereas Android's larger and more diverse market share offers a broader potential audience but with a more gradual update adoption process. Developer mindshare slightly favors iOS in terms of the ratio of developers, but Android’s vast user base continues to motivate substantial developer activity.  \n\n**Thus,** while iOS sees rapid and high adoption of its latest OS versions, Android’s large market share and extensive app ecosystem make it a critical platform for developers, despite its slower rate of OS version adoption."}

Initially, the user's input, such as \"Movie for the day after tomorrow, please,\" is encoded using a bidirectional LSTM (see [2]) that captures the semantic meaning of the utterance in a continuous vector form. This encoding, combined with the previous system dialogue act, updates the dialogue state maintained by an LSTM network (described in [3] and shown in image1). The dialogue state tracker maintains the user's goals and extracts relevant slot-values like \"date\" being \"Thursday\" or \"time\" as \"none\" (see [10]).\n\nFrom this updated dialogue state, the system formulates a symbolic query to an external knowledge base (KB), aiming to retrieve pertinent information, such as available movies or showtimes (see [7] and [8]). The query results are encoded into a summary representation, which informs the policy network—an important neural module that decides the next system action based on the current dialogue context and KB information (highlighted in image1). This policy network produces a system action, such as requesting the preferred time (\"request(time)\"), by processing inputs from the dialogue state, belief tracker, and query results.\n\nFinally, this system action informs the Natural Language Generator (NLG), which converts the abstract dialogue act into a natural language response like \"Ok, what time do you prefer?\" by filling in templates with slot values or entities from the dialogue and KB (see [6] and [3]). The entire process is learned jointly in an end-to-end framework, allowing the system to optimize response generation collaboratively with understanding and policy components (refer to [4]).\n\nThis integrated approach, combining real-time encoding, state tracking, policy decision, and NLG, enables the system to produce contextually appropriate responses to user requests efficiently and accurately."}

Conversely, when positional encodings are only supplied to the decoder (not the encoder), the AP drop is minor—around **1.3 points**—demonstrating that decoder-level encodings mostly suffice for maintaining high AP, while encoder encodings are more critical for optimal performance. \n\nFurthermore, **learned positional embeddings**, whether shared across layers or passed at every attention step, yield results comparable to fixed sine encodings, indicating flexibility in encoding choices without drastic performance loss [6][8]. This suggests that the model can adapt to different positional encoding strategies without severely compromising accuracy.\n\nRegarding loss components, the combination of `class`, `ℓ₁`, and `GIoU` losses has been shown to enhance performance.

Specifically, the line graphs illustrate that for all model sizes from small (80M) to XXL (11B), ProgramFC's F1 scores are superior across 2-hop, 3-hop, and 4-hop reasoning tasks. For instance, at 11B parameter size, ProgramFC attains F1 scores of approximately 77.62 (2-hop), 69.56 (3-hop), and 68.18 (4-hop), outperforming FLAN-T5's corresponding scores, which are around 77.07, 66.89, and 63.39 respectively.

These improvements occur because the iterative, reasoning-guided retrieval process of ProgramFC enables it to uncover relevant evidence more effectively, especially since some critical information emerges only during intermediate reasoning steps.\n\nIn summary, ProgramFC not only delivers higher F1 scores than FLAN-T5 across various model sizes and increasing task complexity, but its reasoning-aware retrieval strategy also substantially enhances evidence recall compared to simpler one-step retrieval methods."}

For example, in the 2-hop scenario, ProgramFC's F1 score reaches approximately 77.62 at 11B size, surpassing FLAN-T5's 77.07, with similar trends in 3-hop and 4-hop tasks where performance steadily improves with larger models.\n\nRegarding error types, as detailed in the error analysis table, the dominant issue across all hops is incorrect program execution, which accounts for 71% of errors in 2-hop claims, 62% in 3-hop, and drops to 23% in 4-hop cases. Semantic errors, including missing or incorrect arguments and structure issues, increase with the complexity of the claim, especially in 4-hop reasoning, where semantic errors rise to 38% and structural errors to 57%. Notably, structural errors become particularly prevalent at higher hop counts, indicating difficulty in correctly parsing and generating the necessary long-chain reasoning strategies.

The strong correlation between initial and later performances, and the observed superior results, underscore its importance in setting a robust starting point. This strategy tends to select examples that challenge the model, thus enriching the training data's informativeness from the outset.\n\nIn addition, the text elaborates that selecting hard-to-contrast data— which can be done without labels—significantly outperforms random or easy-to-select samples, and yields higher performance metrics on datasets such as PathMNIST, OrganAMNIST, BloodMNIST, and CIFAR-10-LT (see [3]). The label-free nature of this approach makes it practical for real-world active learning applications where manual annotations are costly or unavailable initially.\n\nIn summary, the 'hard-to-contrast' strategy:\n\n- **Outperforms other querying methods** in initial and subsequent learning cycles across various datasets.\n- **Addresses the cold start problem** effectively by selecting the most informative and challenging samples without requiring ground truth labels.\n- **Leads to stronger model performance early on**, which positively influences subsequent active learning cycles and overall accuracy.\n\nThis approach demonstrates that focusing on hard-to-contrast data provides a practical, label-free means to improve initial sample selection and consequently enhances the overall efficacy of active learning workflows."}

GPT-4, on the other hand, tends to be **overconfident** as well, frequently misclassifying NEI claims, highlighting the difficulty models have when making fine distinctions based on evidence quality and reasoning complexity [7].\n\nFurthermore, the difficulty in correctly handling **calculation errors** and **lack of evidence**, as identified from error analyses (~50% grounding errors, 22% ambiguity errors), correlates with the common misclassification issues observed. The models' tendency to default to the \"uncertain\" category when faced with complex reasoning or insufficient information indicates that these core reasons are major factors hampering accurate classification in the zero-shot setting [2][8].\n\nIn conclusion, the fundamental issues in refuted and NEI claims—complex numerical calculations, ambiguity, and insufficient evidence—pose significant challenges for current models, leading to decreased accuracy when distinguishing these claim types without task-specific training [1][6]."}

Conversely, GPT-4 demonstrates higher overall accuracy, correctly predicting a larger share of the true labels—specifically, it achieves a macro F1 score of 64.80, significantly above InstructGPT's results, and shows a clearer distinction between classes with fewer NEI misclassifications [6], [3].\n\nPerformance differences are also reflected in their confidence patterns: InstructGPT displays over confidence, frequently misclassifying NEI claims as supported or refuted, indicating a tendency to overstate its certainty [1], whereas GPT-4's predictions are more calibrated, as seen in higher correct support and refute predictions and fewer incorrect NEI classifications [3], [6].\n\nRegarding error types, the analysis of GPT models reveals that grounding errors—misreferencing data cells—are prominent in program-guided reasoning, leading to many inaccuracies in complex numerical tasks [12]. InstructGPT's less confident and sometimes ambiguous predictions further emphasize its struggle with the fine-grained distinctions required to accurately categorize claims, especially when evidence is ambiguous or incomplete.\n\nThese differences suggest that GPT-4's superior understanding and calibration lead to higher accuracy in zero-shot classification, with fewer errors stemming from overconfidence or misgrounding, whereas InstructGPT's tendencies towards uncertainty and overconfidence can result in more cautious but less accurate classifications [1], [3], [6].\n\n---\n\n![Comparison of confusion matrices illustrating InstructGPT's over-confidence and GPT-4's higher accuracy in classifying claims](image3)"}

Its error analysis suggests difficulty in confidently distinguishing claims that lack sufficient evidence, leading to overgeneralization and ambiguous predictions, likely due to limited understanding of when the data is insufficient (as seen in its overconfidence and misclassification patterns).\n\nConversely, GPT-4 exhibits overconfidence, but still struggles with the same NEI detection problem. Its confusion matrix shows that only 10.4% of NEI claims are correctly identified, but it also misclassifies some as supported or refuted with relatively high percentages (e.g., 10.3% predicted as supported and 8.5% as refuted). This indicates that GPT-4's challenge is more about overconfidence in its predictions, which causes it to incorrectly label ambiguous or insufficiently supported claims as verifiable, rather than outright uncertainty.\n\nThe difference lies in their confidence calibration: InstructGPT is overly cautious and hesitant, often defaulting to supported or refuted labels on ambiguous data, reflecting difficulty in recognizing the absence of evidence. GPT-4, on the other hand, tends to overconfidently assign a supporting or refuting label, even when the claim is NEI, leading to misclassification due to overtrust in its reasoning confidence.

As shown in the **retrieval analysis graph** [image7], when retrieval accuracy decreases from nearly perfect (100%) down to 20%, all three metrics—precision, recall, and F1-score—decline, but at different rates. Precision (blue line) notably drops from about 26 to well below 10, indicating that as less relevant or absent knowledge is retrieved, the correctness of citations diminishes substantially. Conversely, recall (orange line) remains relatively stable around 14-15, suggesting that models are somewhat consistent in recognizing when knowledge is missing, but cannot always effectively recover or compensate for it. The F1-score (green line), combining precision and recall, also decreases, reflecting overall degraded performance.\n\nFrom the **table comparing performance metrics** under varying knowledge removal scenarios [image2], the specific impact on answer quality is stark: when no knowledge is removed (ground truth), recall is at 57.1, but with just one element removed, recall plummets to 42.5; with two elements, it drops further to 31.4; and with three, to 20.4. Precision similarly decreases from 30.1 to 16.3, and the F1-score declines from 39.4 to 18.1. These changes imply that as the knowledge base becomes incomplete, models struggle more to cite correct information accurately, indicating limited handling of absent knowledge.\n\nThe **evaluation metrics** [images 4, 5, 6], particularly those concerning citation and text quality, reinforce this conclusion: as knowledge coverage diminishes, the models' ability to produce high-quality, precise, and aligned citations deteriorates, especially when retrieval accuracy drops. The \"Conscious Incompetence\" setting emphasizes this challenge—models can recognize when knowledge is missing, but their ability to compensate or accurately ascertain absent information is limited, as evidenced by the relatively stable yet insufficient recall.\n\nOverall, these findings imply that **removing knowledge elements hampers models’ precision and overall citation accuracy**, reflecting their difficulty in effectively handling absent or incomplete knowledge. The decline in F1-score and precision suggests that models are less confident and less accurate in citing relevant information when the knowledge base is incomplete, highlighting the need for improved retrieval and attribution mechanisms to better manage absent knowledge scenarios."}

The left graph illustrates that when logical constraints are incorporated, especially with an increasing number of demonstration samples (from 1 to 20), the Micro-F1 scores for MAVEN-ERE tend to rise, with a notable jump when going from no constraints to constraints at lower demonstration counts. This confirms that logical constraints serve as a form of structured prior knowledge that guides the model toward more consistent and accurate reasoning, especially when demonstrations are limited. Specifically, the study notes that logical constraints can even surpass the performance obtained with more demonstrations alone, emphasizing their importance in guiding reasoning [1].\n\nSecondly, **Table 3 (image3)** reveals that models trained or fine-tuned with logical constraints—such as Vicuna-13B-PT and Llama2-13B-PT—show markedly improved Macro-F1 scores, especially when combined with Chain-of-Thought prompting with logical constraints. For example, Llama2-13B-PT achieves higher Micro-F1 compared to vanilla versions, indicating that explicit training with logical reasoning enhances the model’s ability to handle complex reasoning tasks. This supports the idea that pre-training on logic-rich datasets and applying logical constraints during inference enhances the model’s reasoning performance [3], [6].\n\nFurthermore, **iterative methods (image1, right graph)** show that multiple retrieval iterations reduce logical inconsistency, suggesting that repeated reasoning steps informed by logic help models refine their outputs, although performance gains may plateau or lead to redundant information [5].\n\nIn terms of demonstration samples, increasing the number generally improves performance but with diminishing returns after around five demonstrations; the initial addition yields notable gains, but further increase results in limited improvements [1]. The combination of demonstrations (telling the model \"what\" to do) with logical constraints (guiding \"how\" to reason) appears to be most effective, often allowing fewer demonstrations to achieve comparable or superior results compared to many demonstrations without logical guidance.\n\nIn summary, the strategic use of logical constraints—either via prompting, training, or retrieval—significantly boosts model performance and logical consistency across datasets like MAVEN-ERE and Causal-TimeBank. Increasing demonstration samples helps but is most effective when combined with logical constraints, which provide explicit reasoning structure that guides the models toward more accurate and consistent outputs.\n\n---\n\n![The left graph illustrates that adding logical constraints across increasing demonstration samples improves MAVEN-ERE performance, and the right graph shows iterative retrieval reduces logical inconsistency over iterations.](image1)"}

According to the data in images and text, logical constraints generally outperform post-processing in lowering logical inconsistency (LI).\n\nFirstly, from **image1**, which displays a comparison table, we see that models like GPT-4 and Llama2-13B achieve near-zero LI percentages when logical constraints are applied—often approaching 0% LI—highlighting their effectiveness in enforcing logical consistency. For example, GPT-4 with all logical constraints results in LI close to 0%, whereas post-processing retains a relatively high LI [1].\n\nFurthermore, **image7** presents detailed performance metrics for models like Vicuna-13B-PT and Llama2-13B-PT, showing that the application of logical constraints significantly reduces LI to 0%, whereas post-processing’s LI also reaches 0%, but often at the cost of reducing overall answer quality, as some related performance metrics (like Micro-F1 scores) may dip. Notably, models with logical constraints tend to maintain higher predictive accuracy while achieving lower LI, indicating a more effective correction of logical errors [7].\n\nIn **image4**, the methodology illustrations demonstrate how logical constraints can guide the model’s reasoning, either through generative reasoning, retrieval-based correction, or pre-training on logical data, leading to more consistent outputs. For example, the retrieval approach corrects conflicting relations, decreasing logical inconsistency, which aligns with the quantitative improvements seen in the tables.\n\nSimilarly, **image6** shows that iterative reinforcement of logical constraints through multiple iterations further decreases logical inconsistency, emphasizing that direct embedding of logic (via constraints) improves LLMs’ reasoning fidelity more effectively than post-processing, which might only correct errors after generation.\n\nIn addition, **text quotes** support these observations. Specifically, [1] mentions that “the logical inconsistency of LLM answers is greatly reduced when using retrieval-based approaches to obtain logic constraints,” and [6] confirms that “adding logical constraints into instructions provides stable improvements,\" often surpassing the effects of post-processing alone.\n\nIn summary, incorporating logical constraints directly into the reasoning process—whether through constrained prompting, retrieval, or pretraining—tends to more effectively reduce logical inconsistency, often to near-zero levels, across models and datasets. Post-processing, while still capable of lowering LI, tends to be less effective and can sometimes impair answer quality due to random selection or limited operations.\n\n**In conclusion,** the use of logical constraints is generally more effective than post-processing in minimizing logical inconsistency across LLMs on MAVEN-ERE and Causal-TimeBank datasets."}

According to the evidence, MMMU is specifically designed to evaluate **expert-level multimodal understanding and reasoning** across multiple disciplines, which sets it apart from many previous benchmarks that primarily focus on basic perception or common-sense knowledge. For instance, as noted in [4], most prior benchmarks like VQA, GQA, and VisWiz tend to test either perception or simple reasoning and often involve limited image formats, such as photographs or diagrams. Conversely, MMMU incorporates **30 diverse image formats** including diagrams, tables, charts, chemical structures, paintings, medical images, and more [3], [8], evidenced by the detailed image types shown in images 2 and 3. This variety challenges models to not only process different visual modalities but also to perform **deliberate, expert-level reasoning** that often requires domain-specific knowledge, such as applying Fourier Transforms or interpreting complex images from textbooks.\n\nFrom the perspective of reasoning depth and knowledge breadth, the benchmarks highlighted in [2], [4], and [8] emphasize that MMMU covers **six broad disciplines with over 183 subfields**, including Science, Medicine, Art, Business, and Engineering, with problems sourced from college exams, textbooks, and lecture materials [8], [10]. This comprehensive coverage demands models to perform **multi-step, nuanced reasoning** and recall **specialized subject knowledge**, which is higher than the basic perception or common sense reasoning tested by other benchmarks.\n\nFurthermore, as shown in the summary of [3], [8], and visualized in images 1 and 3, MMMU introduces **interleaved text-image inputs** and requires models to synthesize information across heterogeneous formats and disciplines — a level of complexity generally absent in other datasets. The focus on **holistic multimodal understanding**, combining perception with deep reasoning, specifically aims to simulate expert-level cognition, in contrast to more superficial assessments.\n\nIn conclusion, **the MMMU benchmark distinguishes itself by emphasizing advanced reasoning depth, broad and detailed knowledge coverage, and extensive variety of image types**, making it a more rigorous and comprehensive tool for assessing the true multimodal and reasoning capabilities of current models, advancing toward the goal of Expert AGI."}

This indicates that although GPT-4V is proficient at simpler tasks, complex problems with heavy reasoning or nuanced visual understanding remain difficult [11].\n\nIn terms of image types, GPT-4V demonstrates superior robustness across most categories, including diagrams, charts, and photographs, as depicted in the bar chart [3]. However, its performance drops notably for less common or more complex image types such as geometric shapes, music sheets, and chemical structures, where models generally perform near random guessing, highlighting a generalization gap [12].\n\nError analysis of GPT-4V reveals that approximately 35% of its mistakes are perceptual—related to visual understanding—while 29% stem from a lack of domain knowledge, and 26% are due to reasoning flaws [10], [7].

Specifically, it employs query routing, rewriting, and expansion techniques in the pre-retrieval phase to generate more relevant and precise search queries [8], as well as re-ranking, summarization, and fusion methods after retrieval to enhance the relevance and coherence of the retrieved information [5]. This results in higher accuracy, reduced noise, and better contextual understanding, ultimately producing more accurate and credible outputs [8].\n\nThe visual diagram in **image1** effectively illustrates this evolution, showing how advanced techniques build upon the foundational Naive RAG structure, moving from simple retrieval to more sophisticated, optimized processes.\n\n![The diagram depicts the evolution of RAG from basic indexing and retrieval to optimized, multi-stage processes in Advanced RAG, emphasizing key milestones since 2020.](image1)\n\nOn the other hand, Modular RAG further refines retrieval-augmented generation by introducing a highly flexible, component-based architecture that allows modular substitution and reconfiguration [3], [11]. Unlike the fixed, linear pipeline of Naive and even Advanced RAG, Modular RAG incorporates various specialized modules—such as search, reranking, memory, routing, and prediction—that can be dynamically combined and tailored to specific tasks or challenges.

As shown in **Image 4**, it employs a fixed pipeline where documents are first indexed, then relevant data is retrieved based on the query, and finally, a language model generates an answer solely from this retrieved context [9], [10]. This method does not adapt or optimize retrieval dynamically, making it simple but potentially limited in handling complex or ambiguous queries.\n\nIn contrast, **Advanced RAG** introduces enhancements aimed at improving retrieval quality.

This is further supported by **Table 3** data, where RAPTOR paired with various models, such as GPT-3, GPT-4, and UnifiedQA, consistently outperforms baseline methods like BM25 and DPR in F-1 scores across datasets, with improvements generally ranging from 1.8 to over 4.5 points. For example, on the QASPER dataset, RAPTOR achieves F-1 scores of 53.1% with GPT-3, 55.7% with GPT-4, and 36.6% with UnifiedQA—surpassing pulling only from raw text chunks.\n\nFurthermore, metrics assessing summarized or evaluated content demonstrate RAPTOR’s improved overall performance: **ROUGE**, **BLEU**, and **METEOR** scores are all higher when RAPTOR is employed, as shown in **Table 4 and 5**. For instance, in the ROUGE metric, SBERT with RAPTOR achieves 30.87%, compared to 29.26% without RAPTOR; similarly, BLEU-1 scores increase from 22.56% to 23.50%. METEOR scores see a rise from 18.15% to 19.20%. These improvements highlight that RAPTOR effectively leverages the retrieval strategy—particularly the collapsed tree approach—to enhance the quality and relevance of generated responses across diverse NLP tasks and metrics.\n\nIn summary, while the **collapsed tree** retrieval delivers superior performance at an optimal context length of about 2000 tokens due to its holistic evaluation of nodes, **tree traversal** offers steady benefits with increasing context but lower peak performance. RAPTOR, across various models, consistently yields higher metric scores like ROUGE, BLEU, and METEOR, confirming that its retrieval methodology significantly improves the quality and relevance of information retrieval and downstream task performance."}

Specifically, as shown in the detailed comparisons, RAPTOR coupled with models like GPT-4 and UnifiedQA achieves the highest F-1 scores on datasets like QASPER and Narrative QA. For instance, in Table 3, RAPTOR with GPT-4 reaches an F-1 score of 55.7%, surpassing DPR's 53.0% and BM25's lower scores; similarly, when paired with UnifiedQA, it attains a 36.6% F-1, outperforming the baselines [3][9]. Additionally, on the QuALITY dataset, RAPTOR achieves accuracy improvements of at least 2.0 percentage points over baselines with different models (Images 5 and 11), indicating its robustness across tasks and retrieval strategies.\n\nConcerning the impact of context length on retrieval methods, the results depicted in the graph (Image 4) reveal that the collapsed tree approach maintains a higher F1 score at an optimal context length of around 2000 tokens compared to the tree traversal method. The green line representing the collapsed tree peaks at this point, showing that this approach efficiently balances context size and recall, with performance slightly decreasing beyond this length. Conversely, the blue line for tree traversal exhibits a steady but lower increase in F1 score as context length grows, indicating less efficiency at leveraging added context for the same or lower gains. This suggests that the collapsed tree method optimizes retrieval by selecting the most relevant nodes within a manageable context window, leading to better question answering performance.\n\nMoreover, the hierarchical structure of RAPTOR, as illustrated in Image 1, enables it to select nodes at different layers depending on the query's detail level, which is facilitated by the hierarchical clustering and summarization strategies discussed in [8][4]. This adaptive retrieval process allows RAPTOR to effectively utilize varying context lengths, ensuring comprehensive yet focused information retrieval, which translates into improved performance across different evaluation metrics.\n\nIn summary, RAPTOR's performance is notably higher across multiple benchmarks and metrics when paired with different retrieval methods, and the choice of context length significantly influences its effectiveness. The optimized collapsed tree approach, especially at around 2000 tokens, offers a balanced strategy for leveraging contextual information to maximize retrieval quality and downstream task performance."}

Its architecture allows for the selection of informative nodes from different layers of the hierarchical tree, which contributes to more comprehensive and contextually relevant retrievals; for example, Figure 7 illustrates that a substantial portion of retrieved nodes come from non-leaf layers, emphasizing the importance of its hierarchical summarization in capturing both general themes and specific details [6].\n\nQuantitatively, RAPTOR consistently outperforms other retrieval methods on several benchmarks. On the QASPER dataset, across different language models like GPT-3, GPT-4, and UnifiedQA, RAPTOR's F-1 Match scores are at least 5.5 points higher than BM25 and 1.8 points higher than DPR, reflecting its capacity to synthesize higher-level summaries rather than merely extracting raw text chunks [2], [4], [5]. Furthermore, on the QuALITY dev dataset, RAPTOR increases accuracy by at least 2.0% compared to baseline retrieval methods, demonstrating its robust performance across diverse tasks [8].\n\nIn qualitative studies, RAPTOR's hierarchical retrieval enables it to select nodes from different layers tailored to question detail levels, often retrieving more relevant and comprehensive information than methods like DPR, especially on multi-hop and thematic questions, as visualized in Figure 4 and the Cinderella classic fairytale example [9], [11], [12].

Instead of merely extracting the top-k raw text chunks, RAPTOR employs recursive clustering and summarization techniques to create a multi-layered, hierarchical tree of information [4], [12]. This architecture allows RAPTOR to retrieve and synthesize thematic and detailed information at various abstraction levels—ranging from general themes to specific details—by selectively querying upper-layer nodes that encapsulate broader contexts. The diagram depicting the process for two questions about Cinderella emphasizes how RAPTOR’s upper nodes often include relevant information retrieved by individual DPR leaf nodes, ensuring comprehensive coverage [1].\n\nThe effectiveness of this structure is supported by ablation studies and layer-wise evaluations, which show that incorporating multiple hierarchical layers can enhance retrieval accuracy—evidenced by improved F-1 scores in multilayer queries, especially when using higher layers that provide broader context [11], [2], [6], [8].

This pre-processing, emphasized in [5], employs techniques like cropping and blurring to focus the model's attention on relevant object regions, especially since objects in detection datasets are often small and variably positioned.\n\nFollowing this, the image embeddings are extracted using an image encoder similar to the one described in [10], which ensures that each object’s visual features are encoded into a fixed representation. As detailed in [11] and shown in the second part of the pipeline in image6, these embeddings are stored in an external memory system, called $\\mathcal{M}$, forming a large, indexed database of multimodal representations. This setup allows efficient retrieval based on similarity measures, typically employing k-nearest neighbors (k-NN), as mentioned in [12].\n\nThe retrieval process matches each object’s embedding against the stored embeddings to identify the most similar categories. This is demonstrated in the example of the object detection pipeline (image7), where bounding box embeddings are matched to candidate labels like \"flower arrangement\" or \"vase.\" Once retrieved, these candidate labels are refined through a ranking step that leverages multimodal large language models (MLLMs) described in [1] and [7], which combine internal knowledge with retrieved data, employing semantic and contextual analysis to rank the candidates accurately.\n\nAs shown in image2, this reranking process corrects initial retrieval errors—for instance, filtering out incorrect labels like \"polo_shirt\" and emphasizing more accurate labels like \"short_pants.\" Similarly, the improvements in detection metrics presented in the table (image5) reflect that integrating this retrieval and ranking approach boosts recognition performance compared to baseline models.\n\nOverall, the multimodal retriever system first extracts object features via pre-processing and encoding, then searches a large database for semantically similar instances, and finally employs MLLMs to rank and select the most appropriate class labels, enabling precise and contextually aware object recognition in detection datasets."}

Additionally, Step-Back + RAG fixes a substantial **21.6%** of errors originating from RAG itself. The dataset consists of **5226** test examples, highlighting the broad coverage of time-related reasoning tasks.

The analysis indicates that reasoning errors are most frequent (**55%**), with the model sometimes failing to reason accurately about complex strategies or multi-hop logic. The dataset has **229** examples, focusing more on multi-hop reasoning and strategic questions, which are intrinsically more difficult.\n\nThe significance of these differences lies in the divergence of dataset design and task nature: **TimeQA** involves temporal and factual reasoning over a larger and diverse sample, making correction measures like Step-Back + RAG more effective at fixing errors and reducing misinformation, especially in reasoning-heavy questions. Meanwhile, **StrategyQA** requires multi-hop reasoning and understanding over strategic scenarios, where errors are more related to reasoning failures, thus less amenable to correction via step-back and retrieval augmentation. Also, the different number of examples (TimeQA's 5226 vs. StrategyQA's 229) implies that the effect of error correction strategies varies depending on dataset size, complexity, and the specific reasoning challenges posed by each task.\n\n**In summary**, the analysis underscores that Step-Back + RAG is highly effective in correcting factual and temporal errors in TimeQA with a large dataset, whereas in StrategyQA, owing to more complex reasoning demands and fewer examples, the error correction impact is comparatively moderate, emphasizing the importance of dataset type and example volume for evaluation of such methods."}

The detailed error breakdown highlights that reasoning errors are the most frequent (55%) when using Step-Back, but the method significantly reduces other types of mistakes, suggesting that explicitly performing abstraction before addressing the main question enhances reasoning accuracy.\n\nIn terms of performance across benchmarks, Table 2 and related figures show that 'Step-Back' combined with retrieval augmentation (RAG) consistently outperforms baseline techniques such as Chain-of-Thought or Take a Deep Breathe prompting. For example, on the TimeQA dataset, the 'Step-Back + RAG' achieves an accuracy of 68.7%, substantially higher than the baseline models (around 45-57%) [3], and even surpassing models that do not use step-back prompting. Similarly, on Knowledge QA tasks, as depicted in Figures 4 and 11, the 'Step-Back' approach with RAG ranks highest, with performance reaching approximately 81.8% on MMLU Chemistry and 86.4% on StrategyQA, outperforming other prompting strategies [4][11].\n\nFurthermore, analyses in Figures 7 and 8 reveal that 'Step-Back' is robust against variations in sample size and consistently reduces reasoning errors—highlighted in the error class analysis (e.g., 55% of errors are reasoning-related)—indicating that the explicit abstraction step helps model better navigate complex reasoning chains. The ablation studies also suggest that sample efficiency is high, as performance does not heavily rely on a large number of exemplars [5].\n\nIn summary, 'Step-Back' prompting enhances task accuracy significantly across diverse benchmarks—especially when combined with retrieval augmentation—and effectively reduces reasoning errors by encouraging models to abstract and reason at higher conceptual levels before arriving at an answer."}

For example, in the results summarized in **image2**, COMET-RANK achieves the highest scores among evaluated metrics across numerous language pairs, including both high-resource and low-resource languages. Its architecture, which incorporates semantic embeddings and a triplet loss function (as shown in **image5**), allows it to capture semantic nuances beyond surface-level lexical similarities, resulting in superior performance in correlating with human assessments [4].\n\nIn contrast, **BLEU**, an n-gram matching metric based on lexical overlap, remains popular for its computational efficiency but often underperforms in capturing semantic adequacy, especially when the translations are valid but lexically different from references. This limitation is evident in the observed trends where **BLEU scores** tend to be lower and less aligned with human preferences, particularly when evaluated across diverse language pairs with varying degrees of lexical overlap and semantic divergence [6][7].\n\n**From the interleaved data, several trends are notable**:\n\n- In **language pairs with English as the target**, COMET-RANK generally outperforms BLEU significantly, correlating more closely with human judgment (see **Table 2**, [8]), demonstrating its robustness in these scenarios.  \n- When evaluating **language pairs without English**, the performance gap persists, with COMET-RANK maintaining strong correlations, even in zero-shot conditions (refer to **Tables 1 and 3**, [4][11][12]).  \n- Graphical representations (**images 3 and 8**) illustrate that COMET-RANK's correlation remains relatively stable when considering top-performing systems, while BLEU's correlation drops notably as the number of systems decreases—from \"All\" to \"4\"—indicating that BLEU is more sensitive to the set of systems evaluated and less reliable in sparse or high-quality system reports.  \n- The trend across **top models** shows that **COMET-RANK** maintains higher Kendall Tau scores across evaluations, underpinning its robustness, whereas **BLEU’s** scores decline more steeply as the evaluation focuses on fewer, higher-quality systems.\n\n**In summary**, COMET-RANK exhibits superior and more stable performance compared to BLEU in capturing translation quality aligned with human judgments, especially across diverse and challenging language pairs.

In contrast, span-based methods like DS-DST may struggle with slots where values have diverse expressions or are difficult to extract from context.\n\nConversely, for some time-related slots like *taxi-leave at* or *train-arrive by*, both models tend to perform less well due to the challenge of span matching in the absence of explicit candidate lists. In these cases, DS-Picklist's advantage is less pronounced because the values are often no longer found in candidate lists, and both models might perform similarly or with slight differences.\n\nIn summary, **DS-Picklist demonstrates better overall performance on the MultiWOZ 2.1 dataset, particularly excelling in categorical slots where candidate lists are accessible, whereas DS-DST has relatively lower accuracy on such slots.** The prominence of these differences emphasizes the effectiveness of the candidate-value approach, especially in slot types with well-defined possible values."}

Specifically, the human performance on LANI has an SD of 5.2 with a 63% success rate, while on CHAI, the SD improves to 1.34 with a 100% success rate [10]. This indicates that humans find CHAI instructions more straightforward for overall goal achievement, despite CHAI's complexity, perhaps because of its carefully designed instructions or less ambiguity.\n\nIn the model evaluations, \"Our Approach\" outperforms other methods in both datasets, with significantly lower SD and higher task success or accuracy metrics (e.g., SD of 8.43 in LANI vs. 3.34 in CHAI, and higher TC and MA scores [3], [8], [9], [12]). The results demonstrate that errors tend to be larger in LANI, indicating it is comparatively more challenging for automated agents given its data and instruction structure.\n\nFurthermore, the variance in linguistic features between datasets amplifies this difference. LANI includes more spatial relations and conjunctions, with a larger vocabulary (2,292 vs. 1,018), and has a broader set of instructions per paragraph (average 4.7 vs. 7.70) [4], [5].

It includes diverse spatial relations and trajectory constraints, with over 120 instances of spatial relations, and supports a larger state space and environmental complexity, including synthetic language data and larger navigation environments [1][3], which poses substantial challenges for accurate goal prediction and action execution.\n\nIn contrast, CHAI involves fewer instructions per paragraph—about 7.7 on average—and a smaller vocabulary (1,018 words), with fewer spatial relations and constraints, making its instructions simpler yet still complex as they involve both navigation and manipulation tasks (e.g., opening cabinets, moving objects) [3][8][12]. The linguistic analysis suggests that CHAI instructions have fewer mentions of trajectory constraints but include co-reference and temporal coordination, reflecting a rich but less expansive set of semantic categories than LANI.\n\nPerformance evaluations indicate that the proposed approaches perform better on LANI than on CHAI, especially when utilizing oracle goals to eliminate ambiguity. For example, the approach scores a task completion rate of around 36.9 in LANI but struggles to learn effective manipulation in CHAI [6][8]. Standard metrics such as stop distance (SD) and task completion (TC) show that the model's navigation performance improves with richer information, but manipulation remains difficult, as shown in poor scores for CHAI's manipulation accuracy [4][6].\n\nHuman evaluation highlights that humans outperform models in both tasks, with humans achieving nearly perfect manipulation and lower errors—like an SD of 1.34 in CHAI and a 63% success rate in LANI—pointing to the ongoing challenge of modeling complex language and perception [4][10]. The correlation between automated metrics and human judgment remains moderate, indicating that current models still cannot fully grasp the semantic nuances of instructions, especially in more complex environments like CHAI.\n\nLinguistically, the data show that LANI instructions frequently contain spatial relations and conjunctions, with 123 and 36 occurrences respectively, whereas CHAI has fewer such instances but similar levels of temporal coordination [2]. The statistical significance of differences in categories like temporal coordination and co-reference underscores these distinctions [4].\n\nIn summary, LANI offers a more challenging platform with richer language and environment complexity, leading to lower performance in goal execution tasks despite significant progress, whereas CHAI, with its simpler language and environment, still presents difficulties, especially in manipulation tasks.

This indicates that decomposing goal prediction and action generation, as the proposed method does, substantially enhances the agent's ability to follow instructions and complete navigation tasks effectively. In contrast, other models either rely on simpler heuristics or less sophisticated architectures, limiting their task success rates.\n\nTurning to CHAI, where manipulation accuracy (MA) is measured, the proposed approach demonstrates a considerable improvement, with an MA of 40.3%, compared to prior approaches like Janner et al. (2018), which achieved 28.3%, and Center baseline at 19.0% [7,12]. The lower stop distance (2.12) also suggests more precise goal localization, which correlates with higher manipulation success. The use of goal decomposition and explicit goal representation contributes to better understanding and executing household instructions, leading to superior MA.\n\nOverall, these performance trends highlight the advantages of the model’s architecture. The ability to predict interpretable goals and generate actions accordingly allows for more accurate and effective task execution. The improvement over previous methods suggests that explicitly separating goal understanding from action generation enables the model to handle complex instructions and ambiguous situations better. Furthermore, the gap between the proposed approach and human performance—particularly on CHAI—remains an important area for future research, emphasizing the ongoing challenge of matching human-level reasoning and flexibility in instruction following.\n\n![Comparison diagram illustrating higher TC and MA scores of the proposed approach over baselines](image8)"}

Its core design involves a decomposition of instruction execution into goal prediction and action generation, enabling the model to focus separately on understanding the objective and executing steps accordingly [1, 4]. This separation improves interpretability and may reduce errors propagated through the process. Additionally, access to oracle goals further enhances navigation, indicating that accurate goal identification is crucial [2]. \n\nThe approach also benefits from recent advances in goal prediction accuracy, as shown in the evaluation results where it outperforms previous methods like Janner et al.

These figures significantly outperform traditional pipeline approaches like E2E Rel and models with hand-engineered features, highlighting the effectiveness of SciIE’s unified multi-task framework.\n\nIn the detailed comparison, SciIE also outperforms previous models in precision and recall, as evidenced by the evaluation metrics in the images. For example, in entity recognition, SciIE attains an F1 score of 68.1 in development and 64.2 in testing (see image2), which surpasses models like LSTM+CRF+ELMo. Similarly, for relation extraction and coreference resolution, SciIE maintains the top scores across datasets, indicating robust and balanced performance [2][7].\n\nThe success of SciIE can be largely attributed to its multi-task learning approach, which enables shared span representations and leverages cross-sentence information. This is supported by insights from the text, where joint training across entity, relation, and coreference tasks leads to mutual benefits, improving span boundary detection and overall accuracy without relying on hand-crafted features [10][11].

Moreover, the visual evidence from an experimental performance chart (image4) underscores the positive impact of coreference links: systems with coreference information (\"With Coref\") reach high precision above 84%, and the pseudo-recall with coreference is also higher, leading to an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.751 versus 0.695 without coreference. This indicates that **including coreference links significantly enhances recall** without reducing precision, emphasizing their role in retrieving more relevant relations and entities.\n\nFurthermore, the ablation study (image8) confirms that models with integrated coreference improve F1 scores across various information extraction tasks, again reflecting better recall and precision due to coreference, which helps in consolidating entity mentions across sentences.

Combining different loss functions does not necessarily improve performance, suggesting that focusing on a unified, context-predictive training regime is more effective. Additionally, stacking task-specific architectures on top of pretrained models—either through linear combination or fine-tuning—significantly boosts state-of-the-art results across tasks like NER and constituency parsing [6].  \n![Comparison tables display that models employing the cloze training objective and fine-tuning on task-specific architectures perform better on various NLP benchmarks, confirming the advantage of tailored training and fine-tuning strategies](image1)  \n\nFinally, larger, more advanced models such as BERT_LARGE demonstrate superior performance across multiple tasks compared to smaller or earlier models like GPT or ELMo, especially when combined with extensive pretraining data and fine-tuning [3][9][10].

Pre-training embeddings generally helps improve translation performance, especially when the initial systems are weak or data is scarce. For instance, [1] explains that a moderate baseline system is necessary for pre-training to be effective, implying that embedding alignment might be more beneficial when the system is not yet strong. \n\nThe data from images 2 and 3 reinforces this notion. Image 2 shows that alignment improves BLEU scores significantly, with the highest scores often achieved when embeddings are aligned, as seen in the \"align\" column, suggesting that aligning word embeddings enhances the model's ability to learn cross-lingual correspondences. Conversely, image 3 indicates that in some cases, alignment has negligible or even negative effects (e.g., slight decreases in scores), highlighting that the impact isn't uniformly positive.\n\nFurthermore, [7] explicitly states that alignment of word embeddings was not particularly beneficial in their experiments, with gains or losses being insignificant across languages, which aligns with the observations in image 3. Interestingly, [8] notes that a priori alignment may not be necessary in bilingual settings, but becomes more helpful in multilingual scenarios, emphasizing the context-dependent nature of embedding alignment.\n\nIn summary, aligned embeddings can improve BLEU scores by providing a shared semantic space that facilitates translation, especially in low-resource or multilingual contexts, but their benefits are not guaranteed and can sometimes be minimal or absent, depending on the language pair and training setup.\n\n![The table shows that aligning word embeddings generally improves BLEU scores, but the effect varies across language pairs and setup conditions](image2)  \n![In some cases, embedding alignment has negligible or negative impact on BLEU scores, indicating the effect is context-dependent](image3)"}

As shown in [4], when the BLEU score is in the range of 3-4, pre-training yields the most significant gains, indicating that a minimum level of language modeling is necessary to benefit from pre-training. This is supported by the data in [1] and [8], where BLEU improvements are larger for language pairs with lower baseline scores, such as Russian (RU) → Portuguese or Hebrew (HE) → Portuguese, which have very low initial performance and larger headroom for improvement.\n\nThe impact of training set size is evident from [2] and the graphs in [2], where pre-training provides greater improvements when training data is limited. The bottom graph illustrates that the BLEU score gain from pre-training diminishes as the amount of available training data increases, showing pre-training is particularly beneficial in low-resource scenarios. For instance, translation from Portuguese to English (Pt→En) benefits more at smaller sample sizes than at larger ones, indicating that pre-training helps the model learn better representations when data scarcity is an issue.\n\nLanguage similarity plays a crucial role in the effectiveness of pre-training, as hypothesized in [3]. When source and target languages are linguistically closer, the semantic neighborhoods in their embedding spaces tend to be similar, resulting in larger gains. This is exemplified in the data from [1] and the description of [3], where language pairs with shared origins—such as French and Italian (both Romance languages)—see larger improvements compared to less related pairs like Hebrew and Portuguese, or Russian and Portuguese, with the latter showing significant gains due to their low base scores and less linguistic similarity. Additionally, [11] confirms that pre-training and embedding alignment improve performance more for similar language pairs, as aligned embeddings facilitate learning in a common semantic space.\n\nIn summary, pre-training improves translation accuracy by providing richer, more consistent embeddings, especially when the initial performance is low, dataset sizes are small, and target-source pairs are linguistically similar. For low-resource or highly dissimilar language pairs, the benefits are amplified, while in high-resource, similar languages, the gains are more modest but still present.\n\n![Translation dataset from various languages to Portuguese, showing differences in language family and improvement after pre-processing](image1)\n\nThe graphs further emphasize that pre-training yields larger improvements at smaller dataset sizes, with diminishing returns as the training data grows, and that the similarity between languages significantly influences the magnitude of the gains from pre-trained embeddings."}

Conversely, for certain pairs like RU→EN, there's a modest improvement (+0.3), suggesting that alignment can sometimes help, particularly when the embedding spaces are brought into a common structure that may facilitate better learning, as discussed in [7].  \n\n![the comparison of unaligned and aligned embedding scores, showing minor or mixed effects across language pairs](image4)  \nThis image illustrates the scores for unaligned versus aligned embeddings across different language pairs, confirming that the impact of alignment varies and is often minimal or slightly negative.  \n\nFurthermore, regarding the quality of translation concerning target word frequency, [10] and [12] highlight that pre-trained embeddings improve translation accuracy across the entire vocabulary, with a particular benefit for low-frequency words.

When the R-GCN is removed (‘No R-GCN’), the performance drops from about 68.5 to 62.4 in unmasked settings and from 71.6 to 63.2 in masked settings, as shown in the performance table [4]. This indicates that the multim-hop reasoning enabled by R-GCN significantly enhances the model’s ability to incorporate relational information across mentions, especially in more complex or ambiguous cases. \n\n![The architecture diagram details a multi-layer R-GCN component used for relation modeling, which is pivotal for capturing multi-hop dependencies in the graph](image2).\n\nThe importance of relation types themselves is underscored by experiments where all relation types are omitted (‘No relation types’). This configuration results in performance reductions similar to removing the entire R-GCN component, underscoring how relations provide essential contextual cues. \n\nFurthermore, ablation studies on specific relation types reveal that ‘DOC-BASED’ connections, which link mentions within the same document, are particularly impactful. Removing DOC-BASED edges causes performance to decline more sharply than removing MATCH or COREF edges, because much of the model’s understanding depends on intra-document co-occurrence to establish relevance. For example, eliminating DOC-BASED links causes a performance drop from 68.5 to about 62.9 unmasked, whereas omitting MATCH or COREF relations results in smaller performance degradations [7].\n\n![The histogram plot displays a negative correlation between candidate set size and accuracy, illustrating the challenge when dealing with larger candidate sets, which relates to the complexity affected by relation modeling](image6).\n\nSpecifically, when removing coreference relations (‘No COREF’), the impact on performance is less severe compared to removing document-based relations, which points to the primary importance of intra-document mention co-occurrence over inferred coreference links in these tasks.\n\nLastly, the experiments with induced edges, where edges are predicted rather than predefined, show a performance decline (approximate 5-7% drop), indicating that learned relations cannot fully replace explicit, well-constructed relation types, especially in masked conditions where context is limited [9].\n\nIn summary, removing R-GCN impairs the model’s capacity for multi-hop reasoning; eliminating relation types removes valuable structural information; and excluding specific relations like MATCH or COREF reduces the richness of the entity graph. These ablations collectively demonstrate that the structural components of the graph, particularly the relations connecting mentions within documents and across entities, are vital for maintaining high accuracy, especially as the task becomes more challenging in masked and larger candidate scenarios."}

Moreover, the performance difference between these configurations is minimal, and sometimes removing coreference edges does not significantly degrade or may even slightly improve accuracy, indicating that coreference features might not be strictly necessary for high performance on this task.\n\nThe performance tables (including [12]) reinforce this observation: the ensemble Entity-GCN models, which likely utilize coreference information among other features, achieve the best results overall (accuracy of 71.2 on unmasked test). However, from the detailed ablation results, it becomes evident that the absence of coreference edges does not substantially diminish the model's accuracy. This could imply that the graph structure—particularly document-based and exact-match edges—already captures much of the necessary relational information, and coreference information contributes marginally or is redundant.\n\nFurthermore, the detailed analysis in [8] notes that modeling all relations, including coreference, provides an advantage, but performance degrades if coreference is added where the coreference system might be unreliable, especially on test sets. In some cases, integrating coreference information might even lead to performance degradation, possibly due to noisy or inaccurate coreference links.\n\nIn summary, while coreference information provides additional relational cues that can enhance reasoning, especially in well-structured graphs, the overall impact appears to be moderate. Reducing or removing coreference edges does not drastically impair model performance, and in some cases, might prevent degradation due to noisy coreference predictions. Therefore, the inclusion of coreference information has a positive but not critical effect on Entity-GCN performance—its influence is more subtle in both unmasked and masked settings.\n\n![The impact of coreference on Entity-GCN performance appears modest, with models performing similarly regardless of coreference inclusion](image8)"}

Answers and AG News, indicating that simple pooling strategies can sometimes match or surpass more complex models. Conversely, deep CNNs and LSTMs tend to perform better on sentiment analysis datasets like Yelp Polarity and Yelp Full, as seen in the same table, highlighting that for tasks requiring nuanced understanding of short texts, models capturing sequential information may have an edge.\n\nRegarding model efficiency, Table 1 (implied in other descriptions) indicates that SWEM has no parameters for semantic compositionality and is computationally more efficient, capable of parallel processing, and requiring fewer sequential steps than CNNs and LSTMs (see evidence from the complexity discussion in [9] and [10]). Figures 2(c) and 2(d) further demonstrate that SWEM performs well at lower embedding dimensions, especially on datasets like AG News, indicating it is highly parameter-efficient and effective in low-resource settings. However, CNNs with more trainable parameters eventually can leverage larger embedding dimensions for higher accuracy given sufficient training data, as shown in these figures.\n\nMoving to the subspace dimension analysis, graphs in images 5 and 8 reveal that as the subspace dimension (d) increases, the accuracy of both SWEM and CNN models improves and approaches their respective direct implementations. Notably, SWEM accuracy tends to saturate faster at lower dimensions, achieving competitive performance with much fewer parameters, which is particularly advantageous in resource-constrained environments. The comparison of their lines shows that SWEM can reach high accuracy levels quickly with less parameter tuning, whereas CNNs may require larger embedding sizes to match that performance.\n\nFrom the histograms in image7, we observe that SWEM-max embeddings are very sparse, with most values near zero, implying the model relies on a few key words. GloVe embeddings, in contrast, are denser, distributing values more evenly. This sparsity in SWEM-max suggests robustness in key word selection but might limit its effectiveness on short texts where word-order.\n\nIn summary, the overall insights are:\n\n- SWEM models excel in efficiency, requiring fewer parameters and computational resources, and perform competitively on large, long documents and sequence matching tasks.\n- CNNs often outperform SWEM in tasks demanding fine-grained semantic understanding of short texts or sentiment analysis, where word order and nuanced features matter.\n- Both models improve as their embedding subspace dimension increases, but SWEM can achieve high performance at lower dimensions, showing parameter efficiency.\n- Sparsity in SWEM-max embeddings indicates reliance on salient key words, which suffices for many classification tasks but may be less effective for tasks requiring detailed word order modeling.\n\n**In conclusion,** SWEM models are highly efficient and perform well across many datasets, especially when resource constraints are present, while CNNs tend to be more effective for tasks requiring intricate semantic and structural features, particularly in shorter texts."}

Incorporating specific layers or elements consistently enhances the effectiveness of aspect-level sentiment classification. For instance, as shown in the table summarized in the last image [4], **including the LSTM layer** tends to result in higher accuracy and macro-F1 scores compared to using only embeddings or the output layer. Specifically, the \"Without LSTM\" setting still maintains strong performance but generally shows a slight decrease compared to the full model, indicating that the LSTM component is crucial for capturing sequential patterns in the data.\n\nSimilarly, **using only the embeddings or output layer** alone results in comparatively lower scores, suggesting that relying solely on static word representations or the task-specific output hampers the model's ability to fully understand contextual nuances. The **full model**, which combines all components, achieves the best overall performance, emphasizing the importance of an integrated approach.\n\nFurthermore, the figures in the third image [3] illustrate the effect of varying the **percentage of document-level training examples**. As this percentage increases, the performance metrics—accuracy and macro-F1 scores—consistently improve across all datasets (D1 to D4). Notably, **D4** shows the most significant gains, reaching higher performance levels earlier as the document-level data volume increases, indicating that larger amounts of document-level training data help boost the model's generalization, especially in datasets with more complex or unbalanced label distributions.\n\nIn summary, the inclusion of components such as the LSTM layer markedly improves performance by enabling better sequential and contextual understanding, while augmenting training with more document-level examples consistently yields better results, with the most notable improvements observed when increasing from zero to moderate levels of document data."}

As illustrated in the domain expansion experiments [5][10], GEM consistently outperforms naive fine-tuning and EWC in maintaining performance across existing domains.

For example, in expanding to the attraction domain, GEM achieves a joint accuracy of 34.73%, surpassing naive fine-tuning's 29.39%, demonstrating better knowledge retention and transfer [4][10].\n\n![The diagram illustrates a dialogue system pipeline with components like utterance encoder, slot gate, and state generator, emphasizing the process of encoding user input, managing slot labels, and generating dialogue states, which are shared across domains.](image1)\n\nIn the zero-shot domain transfer context, models leveraging transfer learning, such as TRADE, demonstrate the importance of understanding slot similarities. The zero-shot DST error analysis [4][8], using scatter plots for hotel and restaurant domains, shows that transferring knowledge about slots like \"people,\" \"area,\" \"price range,\" and \"day\" enables the model to accurately track unseen slots with minimal training data.

For visualization, the bar chart in [image1](image1) demonstrates that Google Translate's accuracy in gender translation is consistently higher for stereotypical roles compared to non-stereotypical ones across all tested languages. For example, Spanish shows a 67% accuracy for stereotypical translations versus 46% for non-stereotypical [image1](image1). Similarly, Hebrew exhibits a notable difference with 76% versus 38%. This pattern indicates that MT systems tend to perform better when sentences align with gender stereotypes, thus reflecting bias in translation performance.\n\nFurther, the table in [image2](image2) highlights actual translation biases, such as in the Spanish example where \"baker\" (él) is incorrectly translated with a male inflection when the context is female, although adding stereotypical adjectives like \"pretty\" can mitigate this by prompting the system to produce more gender-appropriate translations. This suggests that bias manifests in gendered word choices, often favoring stereotypical associations, as corroborated by analyses showing that all tested commercial and academic models tend to translate based on stereotypes rather than contextual cues [1], [2], [4].\n\nLooking at quantitative data, [image3](image3) breaks down datasets by gender classification, illustrating balanced or skewed distributions, which may influence bias in training data. The accuracy relations are also reflected in [image4](image4), where various MT services such as Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and SYSTRAN are compared across languages. For instance, Google Translate has an accuracy of 63.6% in French and 53.7% in Hebrew, yet the error metrics (ΔG, ΔS) indicate significant variability and sensitivity to gendered structures, confirming that performance often deteriorates with non-stereotypical or anti-stereotypical roles [10], [11].\n\nFinally, experimental adjustments, like adding stereotypical adjectives, can temporarily improve bias issues, as shown in [image6](image6), which reports increased accuracy after such modifications (e.g., ES: from 53.1 to 63.5). Yet, these are not practical fixes, emphasizing that current systems inherently favor stereotypical contexts, leading to uneven translation quality and reinforcing societal biases. In summary, while some systems show higher overall accuracy in languages like German and French, they tend to perpetuate gender stereotypes, especially when contexts are stereotypical, demonstrating a systemic bias in MT performance and translation fairness."}

According to the study referenced in [6], all tested commercial and academic MT systems tend to translate based on gender stereotypes rather than contextual cues, revealing pervasive gender biases across multiple languages. \n\nFor instance, Figure 4 illustrates that Google Translate's accuracy in gender translation is higher for stereotypical contexts (e.g., translating \"pretty doctor\" as female) than for non-stereotypical contexts, with stereotypical translations reaching up to 80% accuracy in French and 76% in Hebrew, while non-stereotypical translations drop notably, for example, to 30% in Italian [4]. This demonstrates that stereotypes boost correct gender assignment because the systems rely heavily on stereotypical cues [8].\n\nThe experiment shown in [9] further explores this by artificially introducing stereotypical adjectives like \"handsome\" and \"pretty\" to alter gender biases. The results reveal that these adjustments can 'correct' biases in some languages, such as Spanish, Russian, and Ukrainian, where bias is reduced when stereotypical cues are added, as reflected in the data showing increased accuracy (+Δ) when adjectives are included [+10.4, +11.2, +4.5 in Table 7]. Such findings suggest that these stereotype-based cues can temporarily improve gender accuracy, but this approach is impractical for broad use due to reliance on perfect coreference resolution and the risk of reinforcing stereotypes.\n\nMoreover, Table 1 from Image 1 demonstrates that the accuracy of different translation services fluctuates across languages, with some systems performing better in German due to its linguistic similarity to English, but all still exhibiting bias issues, especially in languages with grammatical gender marked morphologically, like Spanish or Arabic. Adding stereotypical adjectives or context modifies the translation output, often improving accuracy but also risking stereotype reinforcement or bias amplification, as detailed in [5].\n\nIn essence, stereotype-based adjustments can temporarily enhance gender correctness in translation systems by leveraging stereotypical cues, but they also tend to reinforce pre-existing biases. The impact across languages depends on the linguistic features of each language, such as morphological gender markers [8], and on the specific techniques employed to introduce contextual cues. Thus, while they can improve accuracy in controlled scenarios, these adjustments do not eliminate underlying biases and may perpetuate stereotypes if used uncritically.\n\n![The table presents accuracy and error metrics for different translation services—Google Translate, Microsoft Translator, Amazon Translate, and SYSTRAN—across various languages.](image1)"}

According to the evidence, training models on adversarial distractors — as opposed to standard or original distractors — can recover much of the accuracy lost during more challenging testing conditions. For example, Table 4 from the text indicates that models trained on adversarial distractors see their F1 scores increase from around 40.73 to approximately 58.42 when evaluated on adversarial data with filtering by entity type [1]. This suggests that adversarial training enhances the model’s robustness in handling complex or biased data.\n\nFurthermore, the performance varies based on the type of question and the specific model used. As depicted in the tables and figures, models such as single-paragraph BERT perform well in distractor settings (67.08 F1) but struggle in open-domain scenarios where retrieval is challenging, with F1 scores dropping to 38.40 without with additional gold paragraphs [4][8]. The inclusion of gold paragraphs significantly boosts performance, as seen by the increase to 53.12 F1, illustrating the importance of retrieval strategies in open-domain tasks.\n\nAdditionally, analysis in the text emphasizes that single-hop reasoning can solve much more of the dataset than previously believed, with models like BERT achieving an F1 of 67, suggesting that multi-hop questions are sometimes answerable with simpler reasoning when evidence is properly provided [6]. However, models achieve near chance accuracy (Table 3) on comparison questions, especially in multi-hop cases, highlighting the difficulty posed by complex reasoning requirements [7].\n\nThe results imply that both training strategies, such as adversarial distractor filtering, and evaluation setups, including gold paragraph inclusion or knowledge retrieval methods, critically affect F1 scores. Careful dataset construction, improved retrieval techniques, and adversarial training can substantially enhance model performance in multi-hop and single-hop question answering.\n\n![A table showing F1 scores for various models under distractor and open settings, indicating decreased scores in open-domain and the boosting effect of gold paragraphs](image2)"}

However, this performance was misleading because it was primarily driven by recognizing these cues rather than genuine understanding of argument structures.\n\nIntroducing the adversarial dataset—created by negating claims and inverting labels to mirror cue distributions across classes—helps eliminate these superficial signals. The consequence of this setup is evident in the performance drop: BERT’s maximum performance reduces to approximately 53% accuracy on the adversarial test set [6], which is around chance level, implying the cues have been successfully removed.

This low sensitivity correlates with a lower WER, approximately 9.5 to 12.7, indicating that such models, internally treating out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words as identical, are less sensitive to perturbations and more robust. The scatter plot shows that these models (green and blue bubbles) cluster towards lower sensitivity and WER, which results in higher robustness scores.\n\nIn contrast, **open vocabulary models**, illustrated in the right scatter plot of image3, tend to have higher sensitivity values, sometimes approaching 30, and a wider WER range from around 6.5 up to 11, depending on the model variant like pass-through or background. These models consider each OOV or character combination as unique, which increases their sensitivity to input variations, especially when perturbations involve swapping, dropping, or adding characters. Consequently, their sensitivity is higher, leading to a trade-off with WER; however, certain background variants with backoff strategies show lower sensitivity (around 17.5) but may incur higher WER.\n\nThe use of the background model as a backoff strategy, highlighted in image1 and the accompanying quotes, contributes to lowering sensitivity by mapping unknown words to a generic representation, thereby reducing the number of unique predictions an attacker can exploit. As explained, this strategy results in **lower sensitivity**, which in turn yields **greater robustness** against adversarial attacks.

From the table comparing these, **Memory Networks** lead with higher scores in engagingness (3.66) and fluency (3.83), but **RetrieveNRefine++** also performs well, with an engagingness score of 3.80 and improved consistency, indicating a stronger capacity for coherent and natural dialogue [3]. Notably, models incorporating retrieval and refinement, especially **RetNRef++**, demonstrate statistically significant advantages over simpler Seq2Seq models, with win rates around 54-53% against Memory Networks and others [6].\n\n![Performance metrics comparing various models show that retrieval and reﬁnement models like RetNRef++ approach human standards in engagingness and fluency](image3)\n\nFurthermore, these models' ability to selectively copy or generate novel content, as evidenced by word overlap statistics (over 80% overlap with retrieved responses about half the time), suggests they effectively balance authenticity and novelty [9]. The higher percentage of responses in the >80% performance category (above 80%) for **RetNRef++** (53%) indicates that this model can produce responses that are both relevant and diverse, much like human dialogue [2].\n\nWhen comparing perplexity scores, **RetNRef** and **RetNRef++** show improvements over baseline models, yet perplexity remains an imperfect measure of conversational quality, as human judgments often favor responses that may have higher perplexity but better engagement [7,12]. The model's ability to effectively retrieve and refine responses translates into dialogue that appears more natural, engaging, and contextually appropriate, compared to the more mechanical outputs of traditional Seq2Seq responses.\n\n![Comparison of perplexity scores indicates retrieval-enhanced models tend to generate more coherent responses compared to vanilla Seq2Seq](image5)\n\nIn summary, models like **RetNRef++** significantly improve the richness, diversity, and coherence of generated dialogues, making their conversational behavior more akin to humans. They succeed by producing responses with more complex word statistics, higher engagement scores, and better suitability for natural conversation, outperforming traditional systems in multiple metrics.\n\n**Therefore, advanced retrieval and refine models such as RetNRef++ exhibit word statistics and performance metrics that bring them closer to human conversational abilities compared to simple sequence-to-sequence models.**"}

For en-fi and en-kk, we see the following:\n\n- For **en-fi (English-Finnish)**, metrics like **BEER** and **chrF** exhibit high correlation scores, often exceeding 0.9, indicating a strong alignment with human judgments. For instance, **BEER** shows a correlation of **0.985**, and **chrF** shows **0.980**, both among the highest values, suggesting these metrics reliably reflect human evaluations in this language pair. On the other hand, QE metrics such as **YISI-2** have relatively lower correlations (around 0.271), indicating a weaker predictive power for translation quality as judged by humans.\n\n- For **en-kk (English-Kazakh)**, the correlation scores for many metrics are noticeably lower, especially for the QE metrics, which hover around 0.133 to 0.223. However, metrics like **BEER** (0.974) and **chrF** (0.962) still maintain high correlation, demonstrating their robustness across language pairs. Interestingly, **EED** performs notably well with an overall high correlation (0.928), as shown in **image3**.\n\nThe significance test heatmaps in **images 4 and 8** further illustrate these performance disparities by indicating which metrics significantly outperform others in their correlation with human assessments.

As detailed in [2], amortization expenses during 2020 increased compared to prior years, specifically noted as $232 million in 2020, slightly higher than the previous years' $227 million in 2019. This heightened amortization largely impacted the net book value of assets such as **developed technology**, **trade names**, and **favorable contracts and leases**, which possess finite useful lives, and are systematically amortized over their estimated periods.\n\nFurthermore, the detailed tables (shown in images 2 and 4) reveal that while the gross carrying amount for assets like **developed technology** grew modestly from $291 million to $302 million, accumulated amortization increased accordingly (from $72 million to $111 million), leading to a net decrease from $220 million to $194 million for that group. Similar patterns are observed across other finite-lived asset classes, including trade names and contracts.

The company uses forward exchange contracts and currency options to hedge forecast transactions, assets, and liabilities, hedging the majority of its currency exposure [5], [11]. According to the data presented for 2020, currency fluctuations can have a notable effect on financial results.\n\nFrom the financial data in Table 6, which details the impact of a hypothetical immediate 5% change in currency rates versus EUR and DKK, the total effects on comprehensive income and income statement are symmetrical but opposite in direction, with a total impact of approximately DKK 1,594 million in both scenarios (5% increase or decrease). Specifically, a 5% increase would negatively impact other comprehensive income by DKK 1,893 million but positively affect the income statement by DKK 299 million, resulting in a net negative effect. Conversely, a 5% decrease would positively impact other comprehensive income by the same amount while reducing income statement gains, leading to a similar net impact [6], [12].\n\nThe use of derivative financial instruments aimed at hedging currency risk is illustrated in Table 2, which shows magnitude and fair values of forward contracts in 2020 and 2019. The derivatives' fair values and contract amounts indicate active hedging activities that are expected to impact the income statement within the next 12 months, with deferred gains and losses transferred accordingly [7].\n\nFurthermore, Table 4 compares estimated amounts in various currencies for 2020 and 2021, illustrating that the underlying foreign exchange exposures are significant and vary across currencies, with USD, CNY, and JPY being sensitive to exchange rate changes, which could influence financial outcomes and hedge effectiveness.\n\nLastly, impact scenarios in Table 6 reveal that positive or negative shifts in currency rates can cause sizable effects on other comprehensive income and earnings, demonstrating the real financial impact of exchange rate volatility. The hedging activities serve to mitigate these short-term effects and stabilize earnings, although some residual risk remains.\n\nIn conclusion, in 2020, Novo Nordisk’s foreign exchange rate movements and financial risks significantly affected its comprehensive income, primarily through the valuation of foreign currency exposures, while its use of derivatives and hedging strategies helped manage and curb these impacts, maintaining a degree of financial predictability."}

For instance, in image 2, the core gross profit was USD 33,275 million compared to IFRS of USD 29,896 million, primarily due to adding back amortization costs of USD 366 million. Similarly, core operating income rose from USD 9,172 million IFRS to USD 13,645 million after adjusting for amortization (USD 366 million) and impairments, among other items (images 2 and 3). The \"other items\" category, which includes restructuring charges and legal provisions, also contributed to the adjustments, further increasing the core operating figures.\n\nIn 2021, as demonstrated in the tables (images 5, 6, and 7), the impact of amortization and other items remained substantial. For example, in image 5, the core gross profit was USD 67 million, identical to IFRS, indicating no adjustments for amortization on gross profit in this particular case, but operating income was affected—with adjustments totaling USD 106 million for amortization and USD 243 million for impairments, leading to a more negative core operating loss of USD -691 million compared to IFRS of USD -599 million. Meanwhile, in images 6 and 7, similar adjustments (roughly USD 3,655 million in amortization in some instances) were applied to gross profit and operating income, markedly increasing the core figures compared to IFRS.\n\nOverall, across both years, amortization of intangible assets reduces IFRS-based gross profit and operating income figures, and adding these costs back in the core calculations results in higher performance metrics. Other items, such as impairments, restructuring charges, legal provisions, and divestment-related costs, also contribute to these adjustments, providing a more normalized view of the company's core operational results that exclude non-recurring or accounting-specific expenses.\n\n**In summary:**  \n- Adjustments for amortization of intangible assets increased core gross profit and operating income figures significantly in 2020 and 2021 by adding back amortization expenses.  \n- Other items, such as impairments, restructuring, legal provisions, and divestment charges, also boosted the core results by excluding certain costs recorded under IFRS.  \n- These adjustments generally lead to higher core gross profit and operating income than IFRS results, offering stakeholders a clearer picture of sustainable operational performance."}

This reduction—approximately a 24% decline—indicates a strategic move to curb cash outflows amid lower realized prices and reduced earnings. The company prioritized managing its resources prudently, focusing on opportunities to sustain financial health while navigating industry downturns.\n\nConcurrently, ExxonMobil's tax profile saw a dramatic change. In 2019, the total taxes on the income statement were **$38.5 billion**, with an income tax expense of **$5.3 billion**, and the effective tax rate was **34%** [8][1]. By contrast, in 2020, total taxes decreased significantly to **$22.8 billion**, with the income tax expense turning into a benefit of **$5.6 billion**, driven by asset impairments and changes in jurisdictional results, leading to an effective tax rate of **17%** [9][1]. \n\nThis shift in taxes resulted from several factors, including asset impairments recorded in 2020, which reduced taxable income and, coupled with portfolio adjustments and operational cost reductions, lowered the overall tax burden. The decreased tax expense and rate enabled the company to improve net income and preserve liquidity during a period of reduced earnings.\n\nThe financial implications of these changes are profound. The reduction in capital expenditures allowed ExxonMobil to conserve cash and prioritize debt management, which was crucial considering the increase in gross debt to **$68 billion** in 2020 [2][6].

Notably, the comprehensive income decreased by about $1.53 billion from 2019 to 2020, reflecting a significant reduction mainly driven by changes in other comprehensive income (OCI) components, especially in the valuation of foreign currency translation, cash flow hedges, and pension plans [7].\n\nThe detailed OCI components reveal that in 2020, there was a net loss of approximately $104.1 million, compared to a net gain of about $126.8 million in 2019 and a substantial loss of $431.1 million in 2018 [7]. The increase in OCI losses in 2020 was primarily due to unfavorable currency translation adjustments and hedge losses, which offset some of the net income gains. For instance, currency translation adjustments, while positive in 2020 at $63.1 million, decreased significantly from $174.3 million in 2019 [7], partially affected by foreign exchange rate fluctuations.\n\nFurthermore, the pension plans experienced losses in 2020, contributing to the overall OCI reduction [7]. The total decrease in OCI in 2020 was compounded by adverse revaluations of foreign subsidiaries and hedge positions, which are substantial components of comprehensive income.\n\nVisualizing these factors, the financial statement shows an increase in assets related to foreign operations and investments, reflecting ongoing currency and market risks [8]. The overall effect was a lower total comprehensive income despite relatively stable net income levels; in 2020, net income was $4,730.5 million compared to $6,025.4 million in 2019, indicating that OCI changes significantly impacted the total reported comprehensive income.\n\nIn summary, McDonald's comprehensive income for 2020 decreased notably compared to the previous two years mainly due to adverse currency translation effects, losses on cash flow hedges, and pension valuation impacts—factors that reflect global economic uncertainties and foreign exchange fluctuations during that year."}

Specifically, the operating income from Sandoz increased from USD 1,043 million in 2020 to USD 1,600 million in 2021, representing a substantial USD 557 million or approximately 53% growth in USD terms [3]. This significant rise was driven primarily by higher sales, which grew by 10% in USD and 48% in constant currencies, suggesting strong growth in key markets and product lines, although it was partly offset by other factors like increased expenses or investments [3].\n\nSimilarly, the core operating income from Sandoz notably increased from USD 1,043 million to USD 2,064 million, a USD 1,021 million or 98% increase, driven by higher sales volumes and improved efficiency in core operations. The segment’s core operating income as a percentage of net sales also improved, showing a shift toward greater profitability despite some fluctuations [2].\n\nThe main factors contributing to these changes include:\n- **Sales Growth:** Both reported and core sales increased significantly, indicating robust demand and successful market strategies.\n- **Market Dynamics:** While sales in retail generics declined slightly in USD terms, biopharmaceuticals saw a 10% USD increase, contributing positively to overall performance [6].\n- **Expenses and Investments:** Despite higher sales, expenses such as R&D and selling, general, and administrative costs also increased but were more than offset by sales growth, improving profit margins.\n\nIn summary, the Sandoz segment experienced a robust improvement in both operating and core operating income from 2020 to 2021, primarily driven by higher sales volumes and revenues, with these gains partially offset by increased operational expenses.\n\n![Sandoz segment financial performance](image6)"}

According to the data, net interest income increased from $866 million in 2019 to $1,011 million in 2021, representing an overall growth amidst a fluctuating interest rate environment [1, image1]. This growth was primarily fueled by lower interest expenses, which decreased from $619 million in 2020 to $449 million in 2021, reflecting effective cost management and reductions in funding costs [1, image1], as well as a lower cost of funds, as highlighted in the overall interest rate trends. However, lower average card member loan balances slightly tempered the net interest income growth, with the average loans decreasing from around $13 billion in 2020 to $15 billion in 2021 [3, image3].\n\nConcurrently, card member receivables increased significantly—from approximately $18.7 billion in 2020 to about $22.4 billion in 2021—an approximately 20% rise [5, image5]. This increase was driven by growth in billed business, which rose 21% reflecting economic recovery from COVID-19 impacts, alongside increased card point-of-sale activity and higher outstanding balances. The expansion in receivables was also supported by macroeconomic improvements, including better unemployment rate projections and portfolio quality, which resulted in reserve releases for credit losses—indicating lower expected future losses and supporting receivable growth [7, 9].\n\nThe increased card member receivables, coupled with strategic efforts to grow billed business and consumer spending, contributed to higher revenue opportunities, while declining interest expenses due to favorable interest rate trends further supported net interest income gains. Overall, the interplay of rising receivables, improved macroeconomic outlooks, and declining funding costs underpinned the positive trends in these key metrics over the period.\n\n**In summary:**\n\n- **Net interest income** increased by about 16% from 2019 to 2021, mainly driven by lower interest expenses and a lower cost of funds, despite slight decreases in average card loan balances.\n- **Card member receivables** grew by roughly 20%, supported by higher billed business, increased consumer activity, and macroeconomic improvements lowering credit loss reserves.\n\nThis combination underscores a strategic focus on revenue growth through expanded cardholder activity and cost management amidst macroeconomic recovery."}

In contrast, the non-U.S. defined benefit plans allocated about 73% to fixed income securities and cash equivalents, with equities comprising about 27%, indicating a more conservative fixed-income-heavy investment strategy globally.\n\nThe accompanying images reinforce this disparity.

Specifically, the annual provision increased each year: from $3.56 billion in 2018 to $3.74 billion in 2019, reaching around $4.97 billion in 2020, indicating a rising tax expense aligned with increased pre-tax income [6, 9]. \n\nThe detailed breakdown in the tables illustrates that the *current* tax provisions notably increased over these years across federal, state, and foreign segments, especially in 2020 (current provision of $4,981 million) compared to previous years [3, 9]. The *deferred* income tax benefit or expense, however, fluctuated—being minimal or slightly negative in 2020 at $(8) million, compared to positive adjustments in 2019 and 2018, which signify changes in deferred tax balances [3, 9].\n\nIn relation to deferred income tax assets and liabilities, these play a significant role in influencing the company's overall tax provision trends. As of 2020, the company holds substantial *deferred income tax assets* totaling approximately $3.39 billion, mainly resulting from accrued expenses, tax loss carryforwards, and share-based compensation [8]. Conversely, the *deferred tax liabilities*, totaling around $6.76 billion, are largely driven by intangible assets, goodwill, software, and depreciation [8]. The net deferred income tax liabilities, roughly $3.37 billion in 2020, reflect that liabilities outweigh assets, which could contribute to higher current tax expenses as temporary differences unwind.\n\nThe growth in deferred tax assets, especially tax loss carryforwards with indefinite carryforward periods and various allowances, might provide future tax benefits, but their realization is subject to valuation allowances (approximately $170 million in 2020) [8]. These allowances indicate that some deferred tax assets may not be fully realizable, which can restrict the company's ability to offset future taxable income, thus influencing the trend of increasing current taxes.\n\nIn summary, the upward trend in provision for income taxes over these years correlates with increased current liabilities and elevated book income levels, while the substantial deferred tax assets and liabilities represent ongoing, complex adjustments related to temporary differences and tax planning strategies. These deferred balances are critical in understanding future tax expenses and assessing how the company's deferred tax positions will impact tax expense fluctuations.\n\n![Financial notes on deferred income tax assets and liabilities as of 2020 and 2019](image4)"}

Correspondingly, the net discrete tax benefits decreased from a benefit of $475 million in 2019 to an expense of $122 million in 2020, indicating fewer favorable tax adjustments and a reduction in tax benefits associated with items like the conversion of employee share-based awards [10].\n\n![The effect of tax changes on compensation expenses in 2020](image5)  \n*The table displays the substantial increase in effective tax rate and reduction in net discrete tax benefits from 2019 to 2020.*\n\nThis shift in tax rate and benefits impacts overall compensation expenses indirectly. While the total compensation expenses rose from $1,878 million in 2019 to $2,119 million in 2020, driven by higher incentive payouts, deferred compensation, and acquisition-related costs [1][7], the change in tax benefits affects the net income and effective expense efficiency ratios.

This decline was primarily driven by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which reduced operating earnings and led to lower cash flows and profit margins. For example, operating margin decreased from 42.8% in 2019 to 36.7% in 2020 after exclusions [1].\n\n![The balance sheet shows a substantial increase in cash and equivalents in 2020, partly due to fewer treasury stock purchases and proceeds from the sale of stock, which also contributed to the overall financial impact](image3) The rise in cash and equivalents to $3,449.1 million from $898.5 million in 2019 was partly due to lower capital expenditures and strategic sales, helping buffer the decline in net income.\n\nIn terms of comprehensive income, there was a notable shift from a positive $126.8 million in 2019 to a negative $104.1 million in 2020 [1]. This change was heavily influenced by the significant losses in other comprehensive income, particularly from cash flow hedges, which recognized losses of $129.1 million in 2020 compared to gains of $17.3 million in 2019 [1][2]. Moreover, foreign currency translation adjustments contributed positively in 2020, but not enough to offset the losses from hedging activities.\n\nAnother key factor is the impairment and other charges related to strategic gains and asset write-offs, including the sale of shares and impairment of software, which affected the total comprehensive income [1][7].

Starting with the overall net revenue, the total increased from $64.66 billion in 2018 to $70.37 billion in 2020, indicating robust growth [1, Image1]. This growth is reflected in divisions such as FLNA (Frito-Lay North America), which saw its total assets rise significantly and an increase in net revenue, suggesting a strengthening food/snack segment, traditionally dominant in that division.\n\nIn terms of operating profit, certain divisions experienced substantial growth; for example, the total operating profit grew by 23% in 2020 driven by net revenue growth and productivity savings, as well as reduced restructuring costs [6, 11]. Conversely, some divisions faced slight declines due to increased operating costs or external factors like COVID-19, which impacted profit margins.\n\nThe distribution of beverage vs. food/snack categories also plays a crucial role in these performance patterns. Regions like LatAm maintained a stable low percentage (10%) of beverage sales and a high (90%) of food/snack sales across 2018–2020 [6, Image6]. Since food/snack products often have higher margins and more stable demand, the dominance of food/snack sales in certain divisions likely contributed to steady revenue growth in those regions.\n\nFurthermore, regions like Europe and AMESA showed shifts in their percentage splits over the years, with Europe's beverage share increasing from 50% to 55%, possibly reflecting a strategic shift or new product introductions that could influence revenue composition and profit margins [6, Image6]. Changes in the distribution between beverage and food/snack categories could impact revenue streams, as beverages often have different pricing and margin structures compared to snacks.\n\nIn summary, from 2018 to 2020, divisions generally experienced growth in net revenue and operating profit, with food and snack segments playing a key role in sustaining this growth due to their high margins and stable demand. Variations in regional category distributions suggest strategic adjustments that likely influenced division performance, aligning with broader market trends such as diversification into beverages or increased focus on food/snacks depending on regional preferences [2, 6, 12].\n\n![The table displays financial data for various regions, focusing on net revenue and long-lived assets over 2018–2020](image1)"}

This massive increase in outflows primarily reflects the substantial payout for acquiring Varian, which cost roughly €12,228 million [6]. Such investments aimed at capacity expansion and strengthening the company's portfolio led to higher capital expenditures, including additions to intangible assets and property, plant, and equipment [6].\n\nMeanwhile, cash inflows from financing activities in 2020 were minimal or negative at around € -249 million, indicating limited borrowing or financing actions [3]. However, in 2021, financing inflows soared to approximately € 11,839 million, largely attributable to a significant increase in borrowings (about €10 billion), complemented by additional financing of €850 million provided by Siemens Group to support the Varian acquisition [5][9].

The data indicates no change in their shareholding percentage, which is reaffirmed by the summary that shows zero change in their shareholding during the year. Similarly, other Tata group companies, like Tata Industries Limited and Tata Investment Corporation Limited, maintained their shareholding levels without any increase or decrease.\n\nIn the broader public context, as summarized in the distribution tables, the total public ownership (including mutual funds, financial institutions, foreign investors, and individual investors) was approximately 28% at both the start and the end of the year. For example, the foreign institutional investors held about 15.7% at the beginning [7] and maintained almost the same percentage at year-end [7]. Similarly, mutual funds and insurance companies showed negligible fluctuations—minor increases or decreases within 0.1%—but overall, the distribution remained consistent, with total holdings in the public domain approximately steady at 28%.\n\nIn terms of absolute numbers, the data from the various shareholding tables show that the number of shares held by major categories like promoter entities, mutual funds, and institutional investors remained almost unchanged.

Specifically, Upstream earnings were **$15,818 million in 2021**, a marked increase from **$(2,433) million in 2020**. This dramatic improvement is largely driven by higher crude oil prices, which influence exploration, development, and production revenues, as well as lower impairments and operational costs compared to a difficult 2020 [6].\n\nIn contrast, the Downstream segment's earnings remained relatively stable but much lower in magnitude. In 2021, the Downstream earnings totaled **$2,914 million**, compared to **$47 million in 2020**. While still positive, it did not see the same level of increase as the Upstream segment, indicating that downstream profitability remains heavily influenced by refining margins, regional demand, and supply conditions, which can be volatile [5].\n\nRegarding assets, the Upstream segment held **total assets of $184,412 million in 2021**, slightly decreased from **$191,309 million in 2020**. The change might reflect asset sales, impairments, or investment adjustments, but overall, the Upstream asset base remains large and capital-intensive.

This growth could be attributable to investments in refining capacity, marketing infrastructure, or product inventories. Asset values here are generally more stable, reflecting ongoing investments in infrastructure and inventories, which respond less dramatically to commodity price swings compared to exploration and production assets [8].\n\n**In summary**, the Upstream segment saw a remarkable recovery in earnings driven by higher oil prices, despite a slight decrease in asset values. The Downstream segment maintained steady but modest earnings, with increased assets possibly reflecting ongoing operational investments.

This growth was primarily driven by overall improved earnings before income taxes and reductions in the effective income tax rate, which helped offset a decrease in operating income and foreign exchange impacts. Specifically, the increase in earnings before income taxes by $0.4 billion and the benefit from lower taxes contributed significantly, with foreign exchange effects negatively impacting net earnings by approximately $274 million in 2022 [2].\n\nMeanwhile, stock-based expenses showed a slight decrease over the same period. Total stock-based expenses declined from $558 million in 2020 to $528 million in 2022, a reduction of $30 million or about 5%. The main factors contributing to this change were fluctuations in the expenses related to stock options and RSUs/PSUs. Stock options expense decreased from $249 million in 2020 to $271 million in 2022 (although the figure actually increased slightly, but overall, the total stock-based expense slightly declined), but more notably, RSUs and PSUs expenses decreased from $309 million in 2020 to $257 million in 2022, a reduction of $52 million. These shifts could be due to fewer RSU and PSU grants or changes in the fair value of awards, as seen in the detailed data showing fair values and activity [1], [7], and [8].\n\nIn summary, the increase in net earnings attributable to P&G from 2020 to 2022 was mainly supported by higher earnings before taxes, lower taxes, and favorable operating conditions, while the slight decline in stock-based expenses resulted from decreased RSU/PSU expenses and possibly other stock compensation activities over this period [2], [7], [8]."}

Here, the adjustments escalate operating income by USD 3,673 million, roughly tripling the IFRS figure, emphasizing the substantial impact of amortization expenses.\n- In **image8**, IFRS operating results are USD 10,688 million. Adjustments including amortization of USD 3,528 million and impairments (USD 619 million) contribute to reaching a core operating income of USD 15,215 million. Similar to the previous, these adjustments significantly raise the operating income figures by removing non-cash charges, making core results more reflective of the operational core.\n\nAcross different segments, the trend is consistent:\n- Amortization of intangible assets, which is a non-cash expense related to acquired rights or technologies, is consistently added back, increasing operating income.\n- Impairments, which are charges for reductions in asset values, are similarly added back and tend to have a noticeable impact, especially when impairment charges are large, as seen in 2021.\n- These adjustments collectively inflate the core operating income, demonstrating that a significant portion of the IFRS operating results stem from non-cash amortization and impairment charges rather than ongoing operational performance.\n\nIn summary, removing amortization of intangible assets and impairments increases operating income from IFRS to core results substantially across both years and most segments, with the adjustments sometimes tripling the reported IFRS operating income, underscoring their crucial role in assessing the true operational profitability."}

Similarly, the fair values of derivatives not based on observable market data grew from 12,833 million DKK to 16,223 million DKK, indicating increased valuation adjustments on less liquid instruments. Total derivative assets expanded from 13,867 million DKK to 19,189 million DKK. This change can be linked to the company’s use of derivatives for hedging currency risks, as detailed in [10] and [11], which also show that the fair value of these derivatives is measured based on quoted market prices or valuation models, reflecting market conditions.\n\n![The fair value of derivatives in 2020 is significantly higher than in 2019, indicating increased hedge activities or market volatility](image6)\n\nOn the liabilities side, the fair value of derivative financial liabilities increased from 734 million DKK in 2019 to 1,365 million DKK in 2020 [3]. This reflects an increase in financial commitments or market valuation changes impacting liabilities.\n\nRegarding cash flow changes, as detailed in [4], the ‘change in working capital including exchange rate adjustments’ decreased by approximately 1,211 million DKK from -3,388 million in 2019 to -4,353 million in 2020. The overall cash flow effect from working capital movements had a more negative impact in 2020, driven largely by increases in inventories, receivables, and payables, as shown in the detailed table [4]. Exchange rate adjustments also shifted negatively from +176 million in 2019 to -1,729 million in 2020, amplifying outflows due to currency fluctuations. \n\n![In 2020, the company experienced a larger negative cash flow effect from working capital than in 2019, influenced by exchange rates and operational changes](image4)\n\nTogether, these elements demonstrate that in 2020, market volatility and currency fluctuations led to increased derivative valuations—both assets and liabilities—and more pronounced outflows from operating activities. The heightened derivative activity and adverse working capital movements reflect heightened risk management efforts but also contribute to complex accounting entries on the income statement and balance sheet, as explained in [8] and [9]. These changes impact net income through gains and losses on derivatives and influence cash flow reports, emphasizing the importance of accurate valuation and risk management in the company’s financial health.\n\nIn simple terms, the company's derivatives increased substantially from 2019 to 2020, affecting both assets and liabilities, while cash flows from operating activities experienced a larger negative impact, mainly due to working capital and exchange rate effects."}

For SG&A expenses, the data indicate a consistent decrease as a percentage of net sales. Specifically, SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales declined by 77 basis points, reaching approximately 8.88% in 2022 from about 10.04% in 2020, driven by leveraging increased sales and cost management initiatives [10]. This downward trend reflects efforts to control operational costs despite wage increases and other expenses, which is supported by the data showing lower SG&A expenses relative to sales each year.\n\nIn contrast, Interest Income and Other, Net exhibited fluctuations over the same period. According to the financial data, interest income increased in 2022, primarily due to higher global interest rates, resulting in a rise in interest income; however, foreign currency transaction gains varied slightly [3]. The detailed tables in images 1 and 2 suggest that the net interest income, including other income, experienced some reduction, influenced by changes in interest rates and foreign exchange effects. Specifically, the second table illustrates that net interest and other income decreased overall in 2022 compared to 2021, which is consistent with the broader trends in interest income being affected by rate changes and currency fluctuations.\n\nOverall, while SG&A expenses decreased as a share of sales, indicating improved operational efficiency, Interest Income and Other, Net saw a more volatile trend with incremental growth influenced by external factors such as interest rates and foreign exchange, rather than a clear upward or downward trajectory. Thus, from 2020 to 2022, SG&A expenses steadily declined relative to sales, whereas Interest Income and Other, Net experienced fluctuations driven by interest rates and currency effects.\n\n![A comparison line graph showing SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales decreasing over 2020-2022](image3)"}

In 2018, the company’s total comprehensive income was approximately $3.73 billion, which rose to about $4.58 billion in 2019, and further increased to roughly $5.47 billion in 2020 [5]. This upward trend reflects overall growth in both net income and other comprehensive income components.\n\nLooking into the components of other comprehensive income (OCI), notable fluctuations are evident. For example, for 2018, Accenture experienced a substantial OCI loss due to foreign currency translation and cash flow hedges, totaling around $(481) million [5]. In 2019, these components shifted to a significant OCI loss of about $(264) million, driven by adverse translation effects and other factors. However, in 2020, the OCI components improved markedly, contributing approximately $279 million to OCI, mainly driven by favorable foreign currency translation and defined benefit plan adjustments [5].\n\nThese changes in OCI components directly influence the total shareholders' equity. The increase in comprehensive income adds to retained earnings and other equity reserves, thereby expanding total shareholders’ equity. For instance, total shareholders’ equity increased from about $17.1 billion as of August 31, 2019, to approximately $17.5 billion by August 31, 2020, partly driven by higher net income and positive OCI contributions [8].\n\nIn summary, Accenture's comprehensive income has been on an upward trajectory, with improvements in OCI components, especially in 2020 due to favorable currency and pension-related adjustments. These positive OCI changes, combined with strong net income, contributed to a growth in shareholders’ equity over the three-year period.\n\n![Summary of Accenture's comprehensive and other comprehensive income components from 2018 to 2020](image5)"}

The compensation for non-executive and independent directors was limited to sitting fees of Rs. 5,000 per meeting attended, which was a modest figure reflecting their primarily oversight roles rather than performance-based incentives [5]. For the executive directors, such as Mr. K.K. Modi, Mr. S.V. Shanbhag, and Mr. Samir Kumar Modi, service contracts detailed periods of engagement (ranging from one to three years) with notice periods of six months, but no severance fees were payable—indicating stability in their contractual obligations rather than variable compensation tied directly to short-term company performance [2], [4], [6], [12].\n\nRegarding their total earnings, detailed information shows salary, allowances, perquisites, and sitting fees, but specific figures for the 2002-03 year are not explicitly provided here. However, the total compensation paid to directors was structured around fixed salaries and fixed fees, with no indication of performance-linked bonuses or stock options. \n\nIn terms of market conditions, the period from April 2002 to March 2003 saw the company's stock price fluctuate notably—highlighted by the high of Rs. 397 and a low of Rs. 300 (see images 4 and 6)—and the stock's performance, compared to the BSE Sensex, showed some correlation with broader market trends. The shareholding was concentrated among a few large shareholders owning over 80% of shares, giving limited direct influence of market performance on individual director compensation.\n\nIn addition, the company's financial performance, as shown in the audited financial statements, was portrayed as being in accordance with accounting standards, and the accounts provided a true and fair view of the company's fiscal health [1], [7]. The absence of performance-based remuneration components suggests that director compensation during 2002-03 was predominantly fixed and not directly linked to the company's financial results or market performance.\n\n**In summary**, the remuneration structure for the directors in 2002-03 was mainly fixed salaries for executive directors and sitting fees for non-executive directors, with no performance-based incentives.

This increase is primarily driven by higher **unpaid losses, loss adjustment expenses, and policyholder liabilities**, which grew from **$250.2 billion** in 2020 to **$255.7 billion** in 2021 [4, (liabilities section)]. These liabilities are crucial in insurance operations, and their growth could reflect increased estimated claim liabilities, which are inherently linked to the company's claims under management.\n\nMeanwhile, shareholders’ equity also saw a substantial rise, from **$443.9 billion in 2020** to approximately **$506.2 billion in 2021**, an increase of about **$62.3 billion** [10]. The significant growth in shareholders’ equity is largely attributable to **net earnings of around $89.8 billion** and **investment gains totaling roughly $61.6 billion** after-tax during 2021, which substantially bolstered the company’s retained earnings and overall net worth.\n\nRelating these figures to net earnings and comprehensive income, the company's **net earnings increased dramatically from $43.3 billion in 2020** to **$90.8 billion in 2021** [2, (from the second image, the income statement)]. The **comprehensive income** also rose significantly, from about **$44.3 billion** in 2020 to **$91 billion** in 2021, emphasizing both realized and unrealized gains in equity securities, foreign currency translation effects, and pension-related adjustments [2, (statement of comprehensive income)].\n\nThe rise in **comprehensive income** indicates positive market valuation changes and other non-net income remeasurements, which together contributed to the overall increase in shareholders' equity. For example, the **net unrealized appreciation of securities and foreign currency translation** (which show notable swings) directly impact comprehensive income, as reflected in the detailed figures. Additionally, the marked increase in net earnings and investment gains underpins this growth in equity, reinforcing the company's solid financial health.\n\nIn summary:\n- Total liabilities expanded slightly, primarily due to increased claim reserves and policyholder liabilities.\n- Shareholders’ equity surged largely because of robust net earnings and investment gains.\n- The increase in shareholders’ equity reflects the company’s strong operational performance and market valuation improvements, aligning with the significant net income reported in 2021.\n- These financial movements showcase how the company’s operational results (net earnings) and market-driven valuation changes (comprehensive income) directly influence its overall financial position, leading to a higher equity base despite growing liabilities.\n\n**In simple terms:** From 2020 to 2021, liabilities increased moderately due to higher claims estimates, while shareholders’ equity grew substantially because of strong earnings and investment gains, indicating a healthy financial position with improved net worth driven by excellent operational performance."}

For instance, the payout ratio has hovered around 30%, aligning with their aim to maintain stable dividends while allocating surplus earnings to strategic investments.\n\nSimultaneously, Toyota prioritizes environmental initiatives, including electrification, as part of its long-term sustainability objectives. The company's environmental milestones—such as reducing CO₂ emissions and expanding electrified vehicle sales—are clearly outlined in the Toyota Environmental Challenge 2050 (see image4). In 2020, they achieved nearly 17 million electrified vehicle sales and reduced greenhouse gas emissions significantly, demonstrating a substantial shift toward greener mobility solutions.\n\nThe evaluation framework in image2 emphasizes operational income and share price volatility, which reflect how the company balances financial performance with market confidence.

This reduction indicates a stabilization or slight improvement in asset utilization, but the significant point lies in the details of impairment losses, especially related to intangible assets. Specifically, **image4** notes that impairment losses on patents and licences decreased from 982 million DKK in 2019 to 350 million DKK in 2020, reflecting fewer write-downs and possibly better asset valuation or fewer impairments expected from future cash flows.\n\nFocusing on tangible assets, **image6** illustrates that for \"Land and buildings\" and \"Other equipment,\" depreciation in 2020 amounted to 644 million DKK and 320 million DKK respectively, totaling approximately 964 million DKK, which is slightly higher than the previous year's combined depreciation (852 million DKK as per **image6**). The increased depreciation on tangible assets decreases their net carrying amounts, which is consistent with regular asset aging and the systematic depreciation process.\n\nConversely, **image4** shows that impairment losses primarily affected intangible assets, particularly patents and licences. The decline in impairment from 982 million DKK to 350 million DKK suggests fewer asset write-downs, which would positively influence the net book value of intangible assets. Additionally, **quotes [9] and [10]** confirm that impairments are based on significant estimates such as discounted cash flows, and a reduction in impairment losses generally indicates more favorable future cash flow projections or asset reevaluation.\n\nFurthermore, **images 5 and 8** provide insights into the total carrying amounts of intangible assets and property, plant, and equipment. In **image5**, the total capitalized intangible assets and property, plant, and equipment at the end of 2020 show some fluctuation driven by additions, disposals, and impairments. The reduction in impairment losses likely contributed to maintaining or increasing these net carrying amounts, and the slight increase in tangible asset depreciation suggests ongoing asset utilization, which diminishes their book value over time.\n\nIn summary, from 2019 to 2020:\n- Total impairment losses decreased significantly, especially on intangible assets (patents and licences), as shown in **image4** and corroborated by **quotes [9] and [10]**.\n- Slight increases in depreciation on property, plant, and equipment further reduced their net carrying amounts.\n- These combined effects resulted in a moderate decline or stabilization in the net book values of intangible assets and tangible assets. The reduced impairments eased the downward pressure, while continued depreciation systematically reduced asset carrying amounts over time.\n\n**In conclusion**, depreciation and impairment losses evolved in a manner that decreased the net carrying amounts of assets, with fewer impairments improving asset valuations for intangible assets, but ongoing depreciation on tangible assets continuing to erode their book values."}

Specifically, as shown in the third table [image3], total revenue rose from approximately $13,282 million in 2019 to about $17,098 million in 2020, reflecting an increase of nearly $3,816 million. This growth likely stems from enhanced sales across various product lines, increased customer adoption, and acquisitions such as Tableau, which, according to the evidence [10], significantly contributed to revenue growth during this period.\n\nSimultaneously, unearned revenue, detailed in the fifth table [image5], grew from $8,564 million at the end of 2019 to $10,662 million at the end of 2020, an increase of roughly $2,098 million. The rise in unearned revenue suggests that the company invoiced more in advance of recognizing revenue—possibly due to larger contracts, increased subscription commitments, or broader geographic sales, as regional revenues have also climbed notably [image3].\n\nThe implications of these changes are multifaceted. The increase in total revenue signals strong business expansion, likely driven by successful sales strategies and recent acquisitions. The higher unearned revenue indicates a robust pipeline of future recognized income, providing stability and predictability. Additionally, since approximately 50% of 2020’s recognized revenue was from unearned revenue from the prior year [quote 9], this growth in unearned revenue further supports sustained revenue streams.\n\nIn conclusion, these upward trends in both total and unearned revenue demonstrate a thriving business with growing customer commitments and promising future revenue recognition, implying positive growth momentum and effective revenue management strategies."}

Looking at the data, deferred tax assets decreased from $4,564 million in 2021 to $4,091 million in 2022, a reduction of $473 million. The primary contributors to this decline in assets were decreases in **pension and other retiree benefits** ($1,476M in 2021 to $740M in 2022), **loss and other carryforwards** ($1,030M to $914M), and reductions in “Other” assets ($878M to $717M) and valuation allowances ($569M to $409M). \n\nMeanwhile, deferred tax liabilities increased from an unspecified amount in 2021 to a total of $9,288 million in 2022, with major contributions from categories such as **unrealized gain on financial and foreign exchange transactions** (up from $111M to $439M) and **goodwill and intangible assets** (from $5,761M to $5,783M).

This process was aided by tax relief measures that deferred roughly $600 million in tax payments, partially offset by higher workforce rebalancing payments and increased taxes paid [9].\n\nOn the investment side, net cash used in investing activities decreased dramatically by about $23.9 billion to $3.0 billion in 2020, mainly because of a significant reduction in cash used for acquisitions, which was about $32.3 billion lower than the prior year due to the Red Hat acquisition in 2019 [7,11]. There were also adjustments related to the winding down of OEM IT financing operations, impacting cash flows. \n\nRegarding financing activities, there was a net use of $9.7 billion, contrasting sharply with a net source of $9.0 billion in 2019. This change was primarily due to a decrease in net debt transactions, especially because of reduced net borrowings driven by a prior year’s financing to fund the Red Hat deal, and a reduction in cash used for share repurchases by $1.36 billion [6,12].\n\nIn terms of financial adjustments, notable impacts include an increase in deferred taxes and prepaid pension assets, as well as a slight decline in net intangible assets and goodwill [4]. These adjustments reflect strategic tax planning and asset management that, along with operational cash flows, contributed to the overall positive change in cash position.\n\n![A summary of IBM's year-end cash flow and assets in 2020, including operating, investing, and financing activities, showing a net increase in cash of $5,361 million compared to the previous year](image3)\n\nIn conclusion, the substantial reduction in cash used for acquisitions and financing, aligned with increased operational cash flows and strategic financial adjustments, resulted in IBM experiencing a net increase of approximately $5.36 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash in 2020 compared to a decrease in 2019."}

The pie charts further illustrate this reduction, with the total revenue share dropping from 54% in 2019 to 50% in 2020, indicating a contraction in the company's revenue segments [3]. The significant decline was primarily driven by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to temporary restaurant closures, limited operations, and government-imposed regulations especially in the International Operated Markets segment, resulting in a revenue decline of 15% in these markets as shown in the percentage data [1,3, image1].\n\nConcurrently, restaurant margins also decreased notably, with total restaurant margins falling 13% in 2020 compared to 2019. The margin data indicates a decrease from approximately $10.8 billion in 2019 to about $9.4 billion in 2020, with a specific drop in both franchised and company-operated margins. Franchised margins decreased due to higher depreciation costs linked to investments in new store formats (“Experience of the Future”) and increased support for marketing initiatives like free meals to first responders and healthcare workers, which bolstered brand recovery efforts but added expenses [11, 5, image5]. Similarly, company-operated margins suffered from sales declines and COVID-19 related incremental costs such as employee safety measures and personal protective equipment [10].\n\nThe key contributing factors to these changes include:\n- The COVID-19 pandemic causing sales declines, especially in International Markets [1,3].\n- Increased expenses for safety-related measures, marketing campaigns, and incentive programs to support recovery [9, 11].\n- A shift in revenue mix with a higher proportion of franchised restaurants (93%), which are relatively fixed-cost, but still impacted by local restrictions [12].\n- Strategic asset sales and impairment charges slightly offset some losses but did not fully mitigate the decline in revenues and margins [5].\n\nIn summary, both total revenues and restaurant margins contracted significantly in 2020 compared to 2019, predominantly due to the COVID-19 pandemic’s operational disruptions and higher associated costs. The company responded with increased marketing support and safety investments, which, while necessary, contributed to the margin compression alongside reduced sales opportunities.\n\n![The pie charts showing revenue segments in 2020, 2019, and 2018](image3)"}

The total revenue increased by approximately 12.4%, rising from $103.6 billion in 2020 to $116.4 billion in 2021, indicating a significant overall growth. This increase was primarily driven by substantial contributions from the NBCUniversal segments, which added approximately $7.1 billion to revenue, and the Cable Communications segment, which grew by about $4.3 billion, as depicted in the waterfall chart ([image6](#)). The Sky segment also contributed an increase of roughly $1.7 billion.\n\n![The waterfall chart shows that NBCUniversal and Cable Communications significantly increased their revenue, leading to the overall rise in total revenue.](image6)\n\nIn terms of operating expenses, the overall costs rose, but at a different rate compared to revenue. The segment expenses increased due to higher programming, support, and network costs, particularly in NBCUniversal and Sky. For example, NBCUniversal's expenses increased due to more media, studio, and theme park costs, while Sky's expenses grew because of network and other direct costs. Conversely, the Corporate and Other expenses decreased, notably due to prior year severance charges ([7](#)). The increase in operating expenses was a factor in the growth of total costs, which rose alongside revenue, but the company maintained strong profitability as evidenced by a 19% increase in operating income and a 29% rise in net income in 2021 compared to 2020.\n\nComparing the segments:\n- **NBCUniversal** was a key driver of revenue increase, with an approximately $7.1 billion contribution, and its expenses also increased due to higher media and theme park costs ([1](#), [7](#)). \n- **Cable Communications** experienced a $4.3 billion revenue growth with increased programming and support costs, but its revenue growth was relatively modest, at about 0.7% from the previous year ([7](#)). \n- **Sky** showed a notable 11.4% revenue increase, contributing about $1.7 billion, mainly due to higher network costs but also decreased programming costs, helping improve margins ([7](#)).\n\nOverall, the revenue growth was mainly driven by increased contributions from NBCUniversal and Sky segments, while operating expenses rose due to increased programming, media, network, and support costs across segments. Yet, strategic expense management, especially in Corporate and Other areas, helped sustain profitability increases.\n\n**In summary**, the significant revenue gains from NBCUniversal and Sky, combined with segment-specific increases in operating costs (notably in media, theme parks, and network expenses), were the main contributors to the overall change from 2020 to 2021, with segments like NBCUniversal leading the growth in revenue and costs across the board influencing the expense side."}

Specifically, the net operating income increased by $392 million, representing a 60% rise [1, 8]. This improvement was driven largely by a reduction in operating expenses and a decrease in credit losses. The substantial drop in operating expenses—by 36% or $273 million—indicates cost management efficiencies or reductions in certain expenses, which helped boost net income. Additionally, expected credit losses decreased sharply by 97%, from $36 million in 2019 to just $1 million in 2020 [1, 12], reducing impairment charges and contributing positively to net operating income.\n\nCorrespondingly, profit before tax for HSBC as a whole saw an increase of $387 million (42%), rising from $924 million in 2019 to $1,311 million in 2020 [1, echelon]. The strong capital position is evidenced by the CET1 ratio of 15.9%, which exceeds the risk appetite threshold of 13.1% [6], providing robustness. The overall improved profit reflects not only the reduction in impairment costs but also resilient operational performance amid economic headwinds.\n\nIn contrast, the Global Banking and Markets segment shows a different picture. The detailed revenue breakdown indicates that, despite a significant increase in FICC revenues (a component of Markets), overall revenue in sectors like Global Markets and Global Liquidity & Cash Management experienced declines. For example, global markets revenue increased by 27% in 2020 compared to 2019, mainly driven by a 33% rise in FICC activity, especially in Credit and Foreign Exchange [2, 12]. However, segment-specific profit metrics are not directly detailed here; overall, the management report notes that the balance sheet and liquidity remained strong, supporting customer needs during restrictions [1, 9].\n\nFrom the intersegment revenue perspective (images 2 and 8), the adjusted revenue for markets increased substantially (by over 200% in some areas), reflecting a growth of trading and securities activity, but this did not necessarily translate directly into proportionate profit before tax gains. Despite increased trading revenues, the drop in other areas such as Global Liquidity & Cash Management (a 26% decrease) suggests uneven performance across segments. Moreover, the increased volatility and low-interest environment—further driven by central bank rate cuts and the possibility of negative interest rates—have constrained profitability in core segments like Global Banking [1, 7].\n\nRegarding the relationship to financial metrics, the adjusted return on tangible equity (RoTE) for HSBC was only 3.1% in 2020, well below the risk appetite of ≥6.5%, indicating that despite operational improvements, overall returns remained subdued relative to regulatory or internal targets [6]. The CET1 capital ratio stood at 15.9%, comfortably above the minimum requirement, reflecting strong capital management.\n\nIn summary, the Corporate Centre experienced significant improvements in net operating income and profit before tax from 2019 to 2020, driven mainly by cost reductions and lower credit impairment charges, supporting a robust profit increase. Conversely, in the Global Banking and Markets segments, despite revenue growth in trading activities, profit dynamics were affected by uneven performance across different sectors, and macroeconomic headwinds constrained profitability, as evidenced by lower RoTE and other metrics. These contrasting trends highlight the differing impacts of the pandemic and market conditions on various parts of HSBC's business.\n\n---\n\n### ![The Corporate Centre financial results show a substantial rise in net operating income driven by lower expenses and credit losses](image1)\n\n### ![Trading revenues in Markets and global activities increased significantly, but overall profitability remains subdued due to wider economic pressures](image2)\n\nThis contrast between segments underscores how internal cost management and credit risk mitigation helped boost the Corporate Centre's profitability, while market volatility and low interest rates limited the gains in the trading and banking segments of HSBC in 2020."}

Specifically, the adjustments for the current year are noted as `$6` million in 2021, compared to no specific figure reported for 2020 in the table, but prior balances suggest a minimal change overall.\n\nLooking at the components of income before income taxes, the data shows that most tax-related income components experienced notable fluctuations over the two years. For example, the expected income tax provision at the statutory federal rate rose from `$1,201 million` in 2020 to `$2,158 million` in 2021. In addition, various tax benefits such as the FDII deduction and R&D credits decreased in absolute terms, with FDII benefits dropping from `( $381 million )` in 2020 to `( $550 million )` in 2021, indicating a larger benefit in 2021.\n\nFurthermore, the derecognition of deferred tax assets related to the intellectual property was `$2,472 million` in 2019 but was not present in 2020 or 2021, reflecting a significant tax adjustment.

To understand this impact, let's analyze the relevant evidence.\n\nFirstly, the detailed breakdown of shareholders’ equity shows that the **total shareholders’ equity** decreased slightly from $22,984 million in 2020 to $22,177 million in 2021, which is partly attributable to changes in comprehensive income components [4]. This change reflects both net income and other comprehensive income (loss).\n\nLooking specifically at the components of **accumulated other comprehensive income (Loss)**, we observe notable variations over the years [4, 5]:\n\n- In 2019, the net unrealized debt securities gains were $41 million, with foreign currency translation adjustments at $(56) million, and pension and postretirement benefits at $(125) million, summing to an overall **comprehensive income** of approximately $6,619 million when combined with net income [5].\n\n- In 2020, these components shifted to a net unrealized debt securities gains of $32 million, with translation adjustments at $(40) million, and pension benefits at $(150) million, resulting in a comprehensive income of about $2,977 million. The reduced comprehensive income compared to 2019 was due to increased losses in translation adjustments and pension benefits.\n\n- In 2021, the net unrealized debt securities losses were $(42) million, foreign currency translation adjustments were more negative at $(163) million, and pension benefits gained $155 million. These variations led to a slight overall **loss in other comprehensive income** of about $50 million in 2021, which, combined with net income of $8,060 million, resulted in total comprehensive income of around $8,010 million [5].\n\nFurthermore, the change in **total shareholders’ equity** over these years reflects both net income and other comprehensive income/loss. The net income more than doubled from 2020 to 2021, reaching $8.06 billion in 2021, partly offset by negative adjustments from accumulated other comprehensive income. \n\nThe cumulative effect of these components demonstrates that fluctuations in the accumulated other comprehensive income — driven by unrealized gains/losses on debt securities, foreign currency translations, and pension adjustments — directly impacted overall shareholders’ equity. The net loss in other comprehensive income in 2021 partially offset the gains from net income, slightly reducing the overall equity level compared to 2020.\n\n**In summary**, the company's changes in shareholders’ equity impacted its comprehensive income through variations in accumulated other comprehensive income components. These fluctuations — driven by market value adjustments, currency translations, and pension adjustments — either added to or offset net income, shaping the total comprehensive income from 2019 to 2021."}

The stockholders' equity further increased in 2016 to $19,285 million, driven primarily by substantial net income of $2,371 million and continued issuance of common stock options, which boosted the additional paid-in capital — from $13,394 million at the end of 2015 to $17,186 million in 2016 [2][4].\n\nBy 2017, net income further grew to $3,033 million, and additional stock-based compensation issuances, along with gains reported in comprehensive income, bolstered the total stockholders’ equity to an estimated $22,286 million, aided by increased retained earnings and the issuance of additional shares. The notes indicate that stock-based compensation and related equity transactions significantly contributed to the growth in equity, alongside consistent net income increases over the years [2][10][11].\n\nThe sharp rise over these years netted from accumulated retained earnings, stock issuance, and stock-based compensation adjustments, demonstrating a sustained expansion in stakeholders' ownership value. The interrelated improvements in profitability and equity issuance activities were primary contributing factors to this upward trend.\n\n![The table presenting changes in stockholders’ equity from 2015 to 2017, showing increases in common stock, additional paid-in capital, and retained earnings](image2)"}

According to the detailed financial statements, the operating income improved due to factors such as increased revenue from terminaling services and higher equity earnings, despite some declines in transportation and product revenue [11]. The company generated \\$650 million in cash flow from operating activities in 2020, up from \\$597 million in 2019, indicating a strengthening in cash provided by core operations [9][6].\n\nLooking at the cash flows from investing activities, there is a notable change: in 2020, the net cash provided by investing activities was \\$64 million, compared to an outflow of \\$87 million in 2019. This shift suggests that in 2020, Shell Midstream Partners had either reduced capital expenditures or received proceeds from sales or investments, which contributed to positive cash flow in investing activities. The decrease in capital expenditures for 2020 ( \\$22 million ) versus previous years (2019's \\$35 million and 2018's \\$51 million) partly explains the shift towards cash inflows, as the company completed major projects like the Houma tank expansion and did not make additional investments [2].\n\nIn summary, Shell Midstream Partners' operating income increased possibly due to higher operational and equity earnings, even as some revenue streams declined due to market conditions during 2020, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Simultaneously, the shift to positive cash flow from investing activities was largely driven by lower capital expenditures and perhaps asset disposals or prior investment recoveries, reflecting strategic timing and project completions."}

Revenue surged from approximately US$6.72 billion to US$9.47 billion, and underlying EBITDA more than doubled from US$3.54 billion to US$6.48 billion, reflecting higher copper prices and efficiencies [1]. Production volume at Escondida slightly decreased to 1,066 kt from 1,164 kt, partly due to efforts to catch up on mine development and a slight decline in ore grade, yet costs per pound decreased marginally to US$1.00 from US$1.01, aided by lower costs and higher by-product credits [1][2]. The table in image1 underscores these financial shifts, highlighting improved revenues and EBITDA alongside stable unit costs despite operational challenges.\n\nSimilarly, WAIO's performance markedly improved, with revenue increasing from US$20.66 billion in FY2020 to US$34.34 billion in FY2021, and underlying EBITDA rising from US$14.5 billion to US$26.3 billion, driven mainly by higher iron ore prices and record production levels—254 Mt versus 248 Mt the previous year—supported by ongoing efficiencies and new ore sources like South Flank [10][11][12]. The cost per tonne increased from US$12.63 to US$14.82, reflecting increased costs but also higher sales volumes and prices, as shown in image6. The figures show a robust performance despite increased costs.\n\nCommodity price fluctuations had a substantial impact on both entities’ financial results. As shown in image5, a US$1 per pound increase in copper prices contributed approximately US$23 million to profit after tax and US$33 million to EBITDA, while a US$1 per ton rise in iron ore prices notably contributed US$163 million and US$233 million respectively [5]. These price sensitivities illustrate that global commodity price upswings drove the significant financial improvements in FY2021 for both Escondida and WAIO, reinforcing the importance of commodity markets on their profitability.\n\nOverall, FY2021 saw both Escondida and WAIO markedly improve their revenues and EBITDA margins, largely fueled by favorable commodity price movements, increased sales volumes, and operational efficiencies, despite facing operational and cost pressures."}

Furthermore, the total long-term debt excluding current portions decreased from $7,531 in 2021 to $6,484 in 2022, accounting for repayments and amortization, as shown in **text quote [4]** and summarized in the balance sheet-related figures.\n\nThis contrast highlights that while the fair value and recorded amount of Level 2 assets went up, the long-term debt valuations and balances decreased significantly. The increase in Level 2 assets could reflect favorable market conditions, improved valuation of financial instruments, or increased holdings measured at Level 2. The decrease in long-term debt likely results from debt repayments, such as the early redemption of the $2.300% Senior Notes in December 2021 (see **text [3]**), and possibly lower interest rate impacts on the debt's fair value, as interest rates tend to influence debt valuation.\n\nIn summary, the company’s Level 2 assets increased due to higher valuations or asset acquisitions, whereas its long-term debt decreased because of repayments and market valuation adjustments, reflecting a less leveraged overall position in 2022 compared to 2021."}

This positive change reflects several key factors highlighted in the financial statements and supporting tables.  \n\nFirstly, the increase was mainly driven by higher operating income adjusted for non-cash items, which boosted cash generated from operations, as shown in the detailed cash flow analysis [5][8]. The higher operating income can be linked to improved operational performance, though adjustments for non-cash expenses such as depreciation and impairments also played a role, as evidenced by the reconciliation tables illustrating adjustments from IFRS to core results [4][8].\n\nSecondly, the proceeds from divestments, notably USD 20.7 billion from the sale of the Roche investment, contributed significantly to cash inflows, providing extra liquidity that supported the overall increase in free cash flow [7].  \n\nThirdly, the statements indicate lower payments related to legal provisions and other non-cash adjustments, which helped improve free cash flow compared to the previous year [3][9]. Conversely, some outflows, such as upfront payments for licensing agreements like tislelizumab (USD 650 million), slightly offset these gains but did not hinder the overall upward trend [3].\n\nAdditionally, the increase in marketable securities, time deposits, and derivative financial instruments, along with a rise in cash and cash equivalents of USD 2.7 billion, further contributed to the higher free cash flow in 2021 [7][12].\n\nIn summary, the notable improvement in free cash flow from 2020 to 2021 was mainly due to stronger operational cash generation, substantial proceeds from divestments, and effective management of cash outflows related to legal and licensing expenses.  \n\n![The table shows the increase in free cash flow from USD 11.7 billion in 2020 to USD 13.3 billion in 2021, driven by operating performance and divestments.](image5)"}

In fiscal year 2021, the total actuarial losses amounted to **–22 million euros** [1], primarily driven by significant negative financial assumption changes, notably a **–26 million euros** impact, and smaller demographic assumption shifts. The detailed actuarial gains and losses table (image1) shows that financial assumption changes alone contributed a **–26 million euros** loss in 2021, reflecting adverse adjustments such as lower discount rates or other financial factors.\n\nComparing fiscal year 2020, the total actuarial gains were **67 million euros** [1], with a positive impact of **72 million euros** from financial assumptions. This indicates that in 2020, favorable shifts in financial assumptions, possibly including higher discount rates or better forecasted market conditions, led to actuarial gains, offsetting some demographic or experience variance losses.\n\nAdditionally, the effect of discount rate changes on the net defined benefit obligation is substantial. As shown in image8, a **half percentage point** decrease in the discount rate as of September 30, 2021, would increase the obligation by **271 million euros**, representing increased liabilities and contributing to actuarial losses. Conversely, an increase in the discount rate decreases liabilities by **242 million euros**.\n\nIn summary, deterioration in financial assumptions, especially a lower discount rate, increased the actuarial liabilities in 2021, contributing to the negative gain/loss figure. Conversely, more favorable assumptions or higher discount rates in 2020 contributed to significant actuarial gains.

In parallel, the detailed tax-related data reveal that the foreign tax provision, which is part of the overall tax expenses, remained relatively stable or slightly increased over this period, with the foreign component of tax benefits fluctuating between negative and positive values. For instance, in the tax provision table, the foreign benefit was negative in 2019 (-\\$407), turned positive in 2020 (\\$526), and was \\$518 in 2021, reflecting some variability but overall a consistent contribution to tax benefits.\n\nThese upward trends in foreign earnings before taxes, coupled with the fluctuations in foreign tax benefits and provisions, suggest that the company has been increasingly generating profits internationally, which could influence its tax planning and asset allocation strategies. The company might focus on maintaining or expanding foreign operations to capitalize on favorable tax treatments like FDII (Foreign-Derived Intangible Income), especially as U.S. tax rates on such income are projected to rise from 13% to 16% starting in fiscal 2027. Moreover, the company could reassess its foreign reinvestment policies, considering whether to continue indefinitely reinvesting foreign earnings or repatriate more funds, given the potential tax liabilities and changes in international tax regulations.\n\nIn summary, the notable increase in foreign income before taxes from 2019 to 2021 likely prompts the company to strategically optimize its international tax positions, possibly emphasizing foreign earnings management, repatriation decisions, and adaptation to evolving regulatory landscapes to sustain its profitability and tax efficiency."}

As shown in the detailed AUM activity table, there was a substantial sale of approximately $587.1 billion on November 1, 2021, which drastically reduced the total AUM from around $603.0 billion at the beginning of 2021 to about $16.0 billion at year's end, as the sale impacted the total balance. Inflows and outflows also fluctuated during the year, but the sale was the dominant factor in the overall decrease.\n\n![WFAM assets under management](image4)  \n*The table highlights the large sale of WFAM assets, reducing the total assets under management significantly by the end of 2021.*\n\nIn terms of available-for-sale debt securities, the portfolio experienced a decrease in total amortized cost and fair value. As detailed in the securities table, the amortized cost of AFS securities decreased from approximately $215.5 billion at the end of 2020 to around $175.5 billion at the end of 2021. Simultaneously, the net unrealized gains on these securities fell from about $4.9 billion to roughly $1.8 billion, leading to a decline in the fair value from about $220.4 billion to $177.2 billion.

This suggests a deliberate repositioning of their investment portfolio to enhance yields and liquidity management, especially considering the transfer of securities from AFS to HTM for capital optimization (see [8]).  \nMeanwhile, WFAM (Wells Fargo Asset Management) assets under management (AUM) experienced significant fluctuations. At the end of 2020, WFAM managed assets valued at roughly $603 billion, but following the sale of WFAM in November 2021, the end-of-period AUM dramatically decreased by approximately $587 billion, ending at around $16 billion post-sale [8]. Prior to the sale, inflows and market impacts demonstrated active management and growth, but the sale represented a strategic divestment from active asset management, possibly to streamline operations or reallocate resources towards core banking activities.  \nThis major reduction in AUM and the shift in asset portfolio composition impacted Wells Fargo’s strategic focus. The reduction in managed assets and the sale of WFAM indicated a move away from a diversified asset management business to concentrate on traditional banking and lending operations. The investment in debt securities and the liquidity management strategies, evidenced by portfolio rebalancing and credit rating focus ([1], [2]), reflect a prioritization of asset quality, liquidity, and risk mitigation in a low-margin environment.  \nIn conclusion, the changes in total assets and WFAM AUM from 2020 to 2021 guided Wells Fargo to realign its strategy towards a more capital-efficient, asset-liability optimized approach, reducing reliance on asset management fee income and emphasizing balance sheet robustness.  \n![The bank's asset adaptation involved portfolio shifting and divestment, focusing on core banking operations](image2)"}

These tailored mortality tables reflect country-specific demographic trends and are crucial for precise valuation of pension obligations. Conversely, in **the United States**, the Pri-2012 generational projection is employed for both years, aligning with U.S. Social Security Administration standards [5, image5], which impact the assumptions for mortality rates and longevity.\n\nRegarding **financial assumptions**, notably the **discount rates**, **image1** shows that in 2021, the discount rate in Switzerland rose slightly to 1.7% from 1.5% in 2020, and similar upward trends are observed in other currencies. These rates are based on yields on high-quality corporate bonds or government bonds, which influence the present value of pension obligations [4, image1]. Since Germany's assumptions are likely aligned with regional bond yields, their discount rate assumptions are influenced by the German bond market. The **U.S.** employs the trusts' investments and regulatory requirements such as ERISA, with independent actuarial calculations determining contribution levels and discount rates, which are generally higher given U.S. market conditions.\n\nThe **actuarial gains and losses** also differ, as shown in **image6**: in 2021, German plans experienced a net loss of €22 million due to adjustments in demographic and financial assumptions, whereas in 2020, there was a gain of €67 million, largely driven by changes in financial assumptions (notably, a significant positive impact of €72 million on financial assumptions) [6].\n\nFurthermore, **market conditions** and **economic factors** influence assumptions periodically. For instance, the lower discount rates in 2020 and 2021 (as per **image1**) reflect low-interest-rate environments impacting the valuation of obligations, more so in Germany where regional bond yields directly affect assumptions, while U.S. assumptions depend on domestic bond markets and regulatory policies. \n\nIn conclusion, while both countries rely on region-specific actuarial tables and market-based assumptions, Germany's assumptions are based on local demographic data and bond yields, leading to different valuations compared to the U.S., where the focus is on U.S.-based demographic projections and regulatory-driven assumptions. These differences are reflected in their respective measurements of pension obligations, actuarial gains/losses, and overall financial impact.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- **Germany** uses Siemens-specific demographic tables and regional bond yields for assumptions, with regional market influences affecting discount rates and actuarial valuations.  \n- **The U.S.** employs generational mortality projections (Pri-2012) and regulatory-calibrated assumptions with trust-based assets and contributions.  \n- **Financial indicators** such as discount rates were slightly higher in 2021 than 2020, impacting the valuation of obligations in both regions, with market conditions playing a significant role in the variations observed."}

Conversely, segment-specific data show that Global Markets experienced a notable increase in adjusted revenue, with figures from the management’s view showing a 27% rise to $7,290 million, driven by stronger performance in FICC and Credit, as outlined in [2] and visualized in images 2 and 6, which detail sector revenue shifts.\n\nNow, considering net operating income, the first table (image 1) indicates a moderate growth of 3% (from approximately $14,869 million in 2019 to $15,303 million in 2020). Similarly, the detailed segment data in images 6 and 8 show improvements in certain areas such as the \"Net operating income\" (see images 6 and 8), which increased significantly after adjustments. For instance, one table notes a 60% increase in net operating income in 2020 compared to 2019, from $(654) million to $(262) million, reflecting better control over operating costs and credit losses.\n\nHowever, there are segments like Global Trade and Receivables Finance and Global Liquidity and Cash Management, which experienced declines in revenue (~4% and 26%, respectively), as detailed in images 2 and 6, impacting their contribution to overall profit before tax. This is consistent with the overall decrease in segment profits, as the consolidated profit before tax fell by $342 million (from $5,172 million in 2019 to $4,830 million), shown in the first table [1].\n\nIn summary, while some segments like Global Markets and certain trading activities showed strong adjusted revenue growth, the overall profit before tax was significantly affected by increased credit losses and revenue declines in other areas, leading to a noteworthy decline in profitability in 2020.

Specifically, total loans increased slightly from $887,637 million to $895,394 million, reflecting a modest growth of approximately $7,757 million or about 0.87% [4]. This suggests a cautious but stable approach to extending credit, possibly aiming to meet customer demand while maintaining credit quality, as the decrease in the allowance for credit losses and improved credit portfolio quality imply [2].\n\nMeanwhile, total deposits rose from $1,404,381 million in 2020 to $1,482,479 million in 2021, an increase of approximately 6%.

However, time deposits decreased significantly by 41%, and interest-bearing deposits in non-U.S. offices declined by 44% [3, 5].\n\nThis pattern suggests that the entity aimed to strengthen its funding base through stable deposit categories like demand and savings deposits, which are less sensitive to interest rate fluctuations. The reduction in time deposits and non-U.S. interest-bearing deposits could be a strategic response to manage funding costs or regulatory considerations, possibly attempting to reduce reliance on less stable or more expensive funding sources.\n\nFurthermore, the increase in loans alongside higher deposits indicates a balanced growth approach—growing the asset base to support customer needs while ensuring funding remains largely stable and low-cost. The decrease in certain deposit types, along with actions to manage the asset cap (e.g., reducing brokered time deposits), reflects active asset-liability management and risk mitigation strategies [10].\n\n**In summary, the entity's strategy appears to be a cautious expansion of its loan portfolio combined with a focus on stabilizing and optimizing its deposit base, prioritizing core, stable deposit categories while reducing dependence on more volatile or costly funding sources.**"}

This fluctuation suggests that while the company saw growth in 2019, profit margins declined somewhat in 2020. Possible factors include higher operating expenses, impairment considerations, or changes in revenue streams. The detailed income statements from various tables show that overall revenues and expenses can fluctuate, impacting net income.\n\nSimilarly, **Mars** earned $108 million in 2018, rose to $126 million in 2019, but dropped to $114 million in 2020 [5]. The decline from 2019 to 2020, although not as steep as Amberjack’s, still indicates some pressure on profitability. The financial data mention capital expenditures, impairment evaluations, and debt service, which can affect profitability. For instance, the evaluation of impairment indicators during the COVID-19 pandemic, although no impairment was triggered initially [1], suggests ongoing uncertainty that might have impacted net income.\n\nAdditionally, other factors such as fluctuations in revenues, operational expenses, capital contributions, or financing costs (interest rates and debt levels) could influence net income. The presence of significant debt, as shown in the credit facilities tables, points to interest expenses that impact bottom-line results. Changes in depreciation and amortization expenses, which increased over the years, also contribute to net income variations.\n\nIn summary, from 2018 to 2020, Amberjack’s net income decreased after peaking in 2019, likely influenced by market conditions, operational expenses, or impairment considerations. Mars also experienced a decline in net income after 2019, influenced by similar financial dynamics and economic factors affecting profitability.\n\n![Assets under property, plant, and equipment for 2019 and 2020](image6)  \nThis image shows that property, plant, and equipment increased slightly, but depreciation costs also rose, affecting net income.  \n![Liabilities and liabilities-related data as of 2019 and 2020](image7)  \nThis image indicates current liabilities and accrued expenses that can influence overall profitability margins.\n\n**In conclusion, both Amberjack and Mars experienced reductions in net income from 2018 to 2020, likely driven by increased operational costs, market conditions, and asset management factors reflected in the financial data.**"}

For instance, in the corporate segment, the Adjusted EBITDA was approximately $34.3 billion in 2019, decreased to around $30.8 billion in 2020, and then rose again to about $34.7 billion in 2021 [4][7]. This pattern suggests a dip in 2020, likely due to COVID-19-related disruptions affecting revenue and expenses, and a recovery in 2021 as operations stabilized.\n\nLooking at individual segments, the cable communication segment’s revenue increased notably in 2021—boosted by spending on infrastructure and line extensions—yet expenses also rose due to programming and support costs, impacting profitability [5][10][11]. Similarly, the content and media segments faced costs related to increased production, sports events, and international operations, which influenced overall profitability [2][11].\n\nIn 2020, expense reductions from cost-saving initiatives and lower production costs temporarily improved Adjusted EBITDA, but the industry-wide impacts of COVID-19 caused revenue and profit pressures [7][10]. The recovery seen in 2021 was driven by increased revenue from advertising and consumer sales, along with strategic investments in infrastructure and content.\n\nIn summary, the decline in Adjusted EBITDA in 2020 was mainly due to pandemic-related disruptions, such as decreased advertising and production delays, while the rebound in 2021 resulted from increased digital consumption, advertising, and strategic spending. The fluctuations across segments reflect shifting cost structures, revenue sources, and industry conditions over these years."}

In particular, the Global Banking and Markets division performed notably well amidst the challenging environment. Its revenue in 2020 was approximately $3,804 million, reflecting a slight decline of 2% from $3,875 million in 2019 [1,7]. Despite this minor decrease in revenue, Global Markets within the division achieved significant growth, with FICC revenues rising 33% to $6,278 million, driven mainly by increases in Credit (up 90%) and Foreign Exchange (up 26%) [image1,1].\n\nConversely, the Corporate Centre’s contribution to overall revenue included elements like funding activities and other adjustments, which increased substantially. The revenue related to Markets Treasury and associated funding costs saw over 200% growth, totaling $340 million in 2020 compared to less than $60 million in 2019 [image1,11]. This reflects increased internal allocations to better capture global market activities.\n\nRegarding profitability, HSBC’s profit before tax in 2020 was about $4.83 billion, down 7% from roughly $5.17 billion in 2019 [2,11]. The adjusted profit before tax dropped more significantly, by 45%, to approximately $12.1 billion, with Global Banking and Markets performing strongly, especially in Asia [11]. The net operating income increased slightly by 3% to around $15.3 billion, despite the challenging 2020 environment [image2].\n\nOn risk measures, HSBC improved its RWA reduction efforts, delivering around \\$37 billion of reductions during 2020 and achieving an overall decrease of \\$8 billion in RWAs, helping to mitigate asset quality deterioration and market volatility impacts [4,10,1]. Meanwhile, the Return on Tangible Equity (RoTE) in 2020 was 3.1%, which is significantly below the risk appetite of ≥6.5%, indicating that profitability was below target despite operational resilience [8].\n\nIn summary, HSBC's Global Banking and Markets maintained a relatively stable revenue with a strong performance in certain sectors like capital markets, despite some decline in traditional revenue segments, and the Corporate Centre saw considerable growth in internal allocations linked to market activities. These shifts highlight a resilient yet challenged financial position in 2020 compared to 2019.\n\n---\n\n![The global markets division had increased revenue, with significant growth in FICC, especially in credit, forex, and rates, reflecting active trading in these sectors](image1)"}

This decrease was largely due to lower income from short-term investments and fixed maturity securities, which is consistent with the asset allocation shifts. \n\nReferring to the asset allocation data, the investment portfolio's composition changed notably between 2020 and 2021. As shown in the first image, holdings in fixed maturity securities decreased from $20,317 thousand in 2020 to $16,386 thousand in 2021, a reduction of approximately 19.3%. Conversely, cash, cash equivalents, and U.S. Treasury Bills increased significantly from $67,082 thousand to $90,688 thousand, a rise of about 35%. Equity securities increased from $269,498 thousand to $334,907 thousand, a 24.2% jump [12].\n\nThis shift towards higher allocations in cash and equities—both of which typically yield lower or more variable income than fixed maturity securities—reflects a strategic move possibly due to interest rate environments and market conditions. The low interest rates prevailing through 2021, as noted in the textual data, likely contributed to the decline in income from fixed income securities, which are a major source of interest income. \n\nFurthermore, the substantial decrease in interest income aligns with the reported decline in returns from fixed income assets, as the company maintained liquidity by increasing cash holdings, which offer lower yields but provide safety and flexibility in a volatile market. The asset reallocation thus directly impacts the income profile, explaining the lower net investment income despite a diversified portfolio.\n\nIn summary, the factors contributing to the decline include lower yields on fixed income securities, strategic asset reallocation towards cash and equities, and a broader low-interest-rate environment—all reflected in the asset allocations between 2020 and 2021."}

The increase in net income over the years reflects improved operational performance, as seen in the stable rise in revenue components like transportation, product, and lease revenues, and efficient cost management. For instance, the net income for 2020 was $556 million, slightly higher than $546 million for 2019, continuing the upward trend from 2018’s $482 million.\n\nMoreover, the comprehensive income figures incorporate not just net income but also other comprehensive losses, such as remeasurements of pension and postretirement benefits. For example, in 2020, a small loss of $1 million was recorded in this category, slightly impacting the total comprehensive income, which was $555 million for 2020 compared to $544 million in 2019.\n\nThe main contributing factors include consistent operational earnings, as reflected in the stable net income, and minor adjustments from other comprehensive income categories—mainly pension remeasurements—that influenced the final comprehensive income figures subtly. Adjustments from investments, such as equity earnings and dividend incomes, also played roles, as shown in detailed financial disclosures.\n\nIn summary, the partnership's net income and comprehensive income grew modestly from 2018 to 2020, driven by steady operational performance and minor impacts from other comprehensive income adjustments."}

Starting with shipment volumes, **South & Southeast Asia** experienced a sharp decrease of **17.2%** in cigarette units, dropping from approximately 175 billion units in 2019 to about 145 billion in 2020, mainly due to lower overall consumption and lower heated tobacco volume (image5). Similarly, the **Middle East & Africa** region saw a reduction of **13.3%** in total shipment volume, from around 137 billion units in 2019 to 119 billion in 2020, with both cigarettes and heated tobacco units declining notably (image6). In contrast, **East Asia & Australia** maintained relatively stable shipment volumes, with a slight decrease of **2.1%**, where cigarette sales declined by about 9.7%, but heated tobacco units increased by approximately 10.4%, balancing out overall volume impacts (image7).\n\nConcurrently, net revenues also showed varied downtrends across regions. For instance, **General Group** revenues declined by **23.6%** total, and after excluding currency effects, decreased by **21.7%**—a substantial drop reflecting lower volumes and unfavorable mix shifts (image1). The **North America** segment, shown in another summary, experienced a modest increase in net revenues of about **2.9%**, driven by favorable pricing, despite some volume declines (image2).

Similarly, **Europe and other regions** showed modest revenue growth or decline, with differences influenced by currency impacts and product mix.\n\nOverall, the data across regions uniformly indicate that decreased shipment volumes—mainly driven by lower cigarette and heated tobacco unit sales—contributed significantly to the decline in net revenues from 2019 to 2020. The declines were compounded by unfavorable currency effects and shifts in product mix, though some regions like North America managed better revenues despite volume decreases, thanks to favorable pricing strategies. Thus, the global market contraction and product shifts primarily drove the variances in shipment volumes and net revenues during this period."}

Specifically, the **Adjusted EBIT** increased significantly from €2,248 million in 2020 to €3,142 million in 2021, reflecting a rise of approximately 40%. This boost was primarily supported by the first-time earnings contribution from Varian, as well as strong revenue growth and improved margins, especially in Diagnostics where the adjusted EBIT margin surged from 1.9% to 13.3% [4][9]. Supporting this improvement, the **adjusted EBIT margin** for the total group increased from 15.5% to 17.4%, driven by better performance in diagnostics and the contributions from the newly acquired segment [4].\n\nIn terms of **net assets** and overall financial position, the influence of the Varian acquisition is evident in the escalation of net assets and related figures. Total **\"Remaining non-current assets\"** rose sharply from €14,736 million in 2020 to €30,846 million in 2021, primarily due to the recognition of goodwill (€17,512 million in 2021 vs. €9,038 million in 2020), other intangible assets, and property, plant, and equipment related to Varian's integration [8]. Additionally, **\"Operating net working capital\"** increased from €2,550 million in 2020 to €3,270 million in 2021, mainly because of the acquisition, indicating higher operational liquidity requirements [3][6].\n\nFurthermore, the total **\"Net debt (including pensions)\"** substantially grew from €2,513 million in 2020 to €12,809 million in 2021, influenced largely by the financing activities associated with the Varian acquisition, including loans totaling €10 billion from the Siemens Group [11].

In 2019, unallocated revenues were approximately $4,891 million, primarily comprising licensing revenues and other variances not attributed to specific segments. By 2020, this figure decreased to roughly $1,974 million, largely due to the settlement of licensing revenues from Huawei and royalties under new patent license agreements. However, in 2021, unallocated revenues further diminished to about $182 million, primarily driven by the drop in licensing revenues and other miscellaneous income, as shown in the data [6].\n\nCorrespondingly, unallocated expenses such as research and development, and selling, general, and administrative costs, also declined markedly from 2019 to 2021. For example, unallocated R&D expenses decreased from approximately $989 million in 2019 to about $1,820 million in 2021, reflecting increased investment or operational focus areas, while other operating expenses followed similar trends.\n\nWhen comparing these changes to the net assets acquired during the NUVIA acquisition in 2021, the total net assets amount to about $1,264 million, which includes items like goodwill ($885 million), IPR&D ($247 million), and other assets totaling $1,332 million less liabilities of $68 million [4]. The net assets reflect the company's strategic expansion into new technologies and capabilities.\n\nWhile unallocated revenues and expenses saw a substantial reduction over these years—particularly the sharp drop in unallocated revenues—the net assets acquired for NUVIA represent a significant infusion of assets valued at over $1.2 billion. This suggests that, despite the decline in unallocated revenues, the company made a substantial investment in a new business segment with high-value assets associated with workforce, intellectual property, and other assets aimed at future growth. Essentially, the company's strategic acquisition reflects a commitment to expanding its asset base, which complements the observed decrease in unallocated revenues that had previously driven operating income but has recently restructured to focus on new technological assets. \n\n![The net assets acquired in the NUVIA acquisition are primarily composed of goodwill, IPR&D, and other assets, totaling approximately $1.3 billion](image4)"}

The fall in revenue, partly offset by lower operating expenses, further contributed to the decline.  \n![A pie chart illustrates the contribution to group adjusted profit before tax, with a significant $4.8 billion portion](image6)  \n  \nIn summary, both net operating income and profit before tax declined from 2019 to 2020 primarily due to the economic disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, lower interest rates, increased credit impairments, and reduced revenues in certain segments."}

This commitment is reflected in the company's efforts to create an inclusive workplace where women can develop their careers and contribute effectively. For example, Toyota actively promotes women's participation through targeted programs such as mentorship, career development support, and gender diversity targets [3], [11].\n\nGlobally, Toyota has launched region-specific initiatives to foster an inclusive environment. In Europe, especially at Toyota Motor Europe NV/SA (TME), activities such as International Women’s Day events, mentorship programs, unconscious bias training, and targeted hiring support are organized to enhance gender diversity [7]. Similarly, in China, Toyota allows lactating female employees a breastfeeding break of up to one hour each day, facilitating work-life balance [7]. In South Africa, leadership workshops and employment targets are set to ensure the active promotion of women in managerial roles [7]. These regional efforts are complemented by Toyota’s overarching recognition that diversity—in gender, age, nationality, and other characteristics—is vital for fostering innovation and transformation into a mobility company [6].\n\nIn Japan, Toyota acknowledges the need to improve gender diversity, striving to create a corporate culture where all employees, including women, can demonstrate their full potential [3], [5]. The company also encourages women’s participation in leadership development and supports their work-life balance, aligning with its mission to produce happiness for all and ensure workplace safety and health [4], [5].\n\nFurthermore, Toyota’s inclusive approach extends to supporting employees regardless of their background or orientation. The company has introduced initiatives to promote understanding and inclusion of LGBT employees, such as non-discrimination policies and internal systems recognizing same-sex marriages [8].\n\nIn summary, Toyota’s strategy encompasses region-specific programs like mentorship, hiring targets, work-life balance support, and inclusion policies, all aimed at fostering diversity and enabling women to thrive within a global, innovative workforce.\n\n---\n\n![Toyota women at the Annual Toyota Women’s Conference in Australia](image5)"}

During this period, net income experienced fluctuations due to varying revenue figures, expense management, and strategic investments, while retained earnings reflected these income changes along with dividends paid and stock-related activities.\n\nInitially, looking at the net income figures from 2018 to 2020, the data indicates that net income was approximately $1,217 million in 2019, slightly higher than $1,005 million in 2020, and estimated to be around $3,107 million in 2018 [9]. The net income in 2019 and 2020 was impacted by factors such as revenue performance, expense control, and strategic decisions like stock repurchases and dividend payouts. For example, in 2020, the company generated a free cash flow of $5.5 billion, representing 38% of revenue—highlighting strong cash generation capacity despite revenue challenges [10].\n\nThe changes in retained earnings are directly influenced by net income amounts, dividends declared, and other equity-related transactions. In 2018, the company paid dividends of $2.63 per share, and in 2020, dividends increased to $3.72 per share, indicating a strategy to return more value to shareholders [9]. During this period, stock repurchases also fluctuated, with significant buybacks reducing the number of outstanding shares (e.g., a $2.6 billion buyback in 2020), which contributed to earnings per share growth and affected overall retained earnings.\n\nSignificant factors affecting these changes include the company's efforts to optimize capital allocation through share repurchases and dividend increases, as well as strategic restructuring within segments, such as reorganizing product lines in the Analog segment to improve efficiency and profitability [11][12]. Additionally, strong cash flow generation and a robust balance sheet (ending 2020 with around $6.6 billion in cash and investments) supported these activities and overall financial stability.\n\nIn summary, from 2018 to 2020, net income and retained earnings experienced growth influenced by strategic capital management, operational performance, and restructuring initiatives, even as revenue growth and total TSR compared to competitors showed some variability. The company's focus on returning value to shareholders through dividends and buybacks, alongside maintaining solid cash flows, played critical roles in shaping these financial changes.\n\n![The company demonstrated strong cash generation and shareholder returns through buybacks and dividends, influencing retained earnings](image4)"}

Similarly, \"Medicaid\" experienced a significant growth, adding 720 thousand individuals (12%), increasing from 5,900 thousand to 6,620 thousand [4].\n\nIn contrast, the \"Commercial\" segment, which includes employer-sponsored plans, slightly declined by approximately 2%, losing 1,073 thousand members, dropping from 56,945 thousand to 55,872 thousand [12]. Additionally, the \"Global\" segment also decreased by 295 thousand (5%), going from 5,720 thousand to 5,425 thousand [4].\n\nThis shift towards public programs like Medicare and Medicaid likely reflects broader industry trends during the COVID-19 pandemic, such as economic instability leading to employment attrition and loss of employer-sponsored insurance. The official reports cite increased unemployment and related attrition as reasons for decreases in commercial and global markets, whereas growth in government-funded programs is driven by states easing redetermination requirements and increased enrollment efforts in response to the pandemic [5].\n\nFurthermore, the surge in Medicaid and Medicare beneficiaries aligns with the increased demand for health coverage during the health crisis, as more individuals transitioned to public assistance programs. Conversely, declines in commercial and global segments suggest that economic hardship and care deferrals due to COVID-19 negatively impacted commercially insured populations and international markets.\n\n![A breakdown of UnitedHealthcare segments by number of individuals served shows growth in Medicare and Medicaid and a slight decline in commercial and global segments](image4)"}

This rise in discount rate would decrease the present value of the projected benefit obligation (PBO), reducing the company's liability. Correspondingly, the expected return on plan assets decreased slightly from **6.5% in 2021** to **5.5% in 2022** (from Image Quotes 2 and 4), which could lead to a lower expected gain on plan assets, potentially increasing net periodic costs. \n\nSimilarly, for **Other Retiree Benefits**, the discount rate rose from **3.2% in 2021** to **5.0% in 2022** (validated by Image Quote 1), again lowering the benefit obligation’s present value. The expected return on plan assets remained steady at **8.4% for both years** (from Image Quote 2), but the overall impact of the rising discount rate would notably reduce the liability on the balance sheet.\n\nThe **net recognized amounts** in the company's financials reflect these changes.

Specifically, the total equity declined from approximately **$191.7 billion in 2019** [12] to about **$157.2 billion in 2020** [10], representing a reduction of roughly **$34.5 billion**. This reduction is detailed with several contributing factors. \n\nFirstly, the decrease in equity was partly due to **losses incurred in 2020**, with the company recording a net loss as indicated by the significant negative net income figures in the 2020 financial statement [3, 8, 9]. The net loss in 2020 can be attributed to a variety of operational and market factors, including lower revenues and possibly impairments, as suggested by the negative figures in the income statement data [8] and the overall earnings decline discussed in the financial summaries.\n\nSecondly, **dividends distributed to shareholders** played a major role in reducing equity. According to the data, dividends of about **$14.9 billion in 2020** [10] and **$14.7 billion in 2019** [12] were paid out, which directly reduces retained earnings and consequently total equity. \n\nThirdly, **foreign exchange effects**—notably weaker U.S. dollar impacts—also increased equity by approximately **$1.8 billion in 2020** [10], partially offsetting some of the reductions. Additionally, changes in the funded status of postretirement benefits reserves influenced equity positively by about **$1.0 billion in 2020** [10].\n\nFurthermore, the notes hint at other factors like **impairments, asset retirements, and market conditions**, which could have impacted the book value of assets and liabilities, thereby affecting overall equity. For example, significant impairments or asset write-downs often occur during periods of market stress, such as in 2020, which might have contributed to the net reduction in equity.\n\nIn summary, the decrease in ExxonMobil’s total equity from 2019 to 2020 was primarily driven by the company’s net loss, substantial dividend payouts, and market effects, including currency translation impacts and changes in pension reserves, as reflected across the financial statements.\n\n![ExxonMobil’s financial data tables](image1)"}

Interleaving the evidence from the financial statements and related notes provides a comprehensive picture.\n\nIn 2020, the total equity attributable to the company's shareholders increased notably from RMB 43,590 million to RMB 52,245 million, reflecting strong profit contribution and capital transactions, as shown in the second and fifth equity change tables ([2], [5], and [11]). The increase in retained earnings (from RMB 7,007 million to RMB 11,111 million) was driven largely by profit for the year, substantiated by the net income reported (RMB 4,176 million in 2020), and supported by positive comprehensive income, including fair value gains on financial assets ([7], [12], and [11]).\n\nMajor transactions that contributed to equity changes in 2020 include:\n- **Share-based compensation and exercise of share options**, which adjusted the \"Shares held for share award schemes\" and increased paid-in capital ([5], [15], [17]).\n- **Acquisition of treasury shares**, which affected the treasury shares component, although the exact change was minimal until later years ([5], [15], [17]).\n- **Profit for the year**, as noted, significantly increased retained earnings, supporting overall growth.\n\nIn 2021, total equity faced a decrease from RMB 52,731 million to RMB 51,055 million, despite continued profitability, with profit attributable to owners decreasing to RMB 3,029 million ([7], [12], [15], [17]). The decline was primarily driven by:\n- **Share repurchases** or movements in treasury shares, which grew markedly from RMB (134) million to RMB (3,660) million, reducing equity ([5], [15], [17]).\n- **Profit for the year** contributed gains, but less than in prior years, and fair value losses on financial assets and currency translation adjustments also negatively impacted comprehensive income ([7], [11], [13], [14], [15], [17]).\n- **Share-based awards and new share issuances** influenced \"Shares held for share award schemes\" and \"Additional paid-in capital,\" both reflecting ongoing employee compensation and equity financing strategies ([5], [15]).\n\nNotably, the \"Other reserves\" decreased from RMB 6,300 million to RMB 3,726 million, indicating adjustments from fair value changes and other comprehensive income components, as detailed in the comprehensive income statement ([7], [13], [14]).\n\nTo summarize, in 2020, key drivers of equity growth were:\n- Profits from operations,\n- Capital contributions and share-based schemes,\n- Moderate share buybacks.\n\nIn 2021, despite continued profitability, large-scale treasury share re-purchases and fair value adjustments, along with currency translation effects, led to a slight decline in total equity. These changes are largely attributable to strategic share management and financial market fluctuations impacting fair value reserves.\n\n**In essence:**\n\n- Over 2020, equity increased driven by profits, share-based compensations, and minor treasury activities.\n- Over 2021, equity slightly declined mainly due to share repurchase activities, fair value losses, and currency translation effects, despite ongoing profits.\n\n**![Summary of Equity Changes](image5)**"}

Starting with revenue, the data indicates a positive overall trend; total revenue increased from approximately $19.2 billion in 2019 to about $20.3 billion in 2021, a 9.1% rise [3]. This growth was driven by increased distribution, advertising, and content licensing revenues, partially offset by the impact of COVID-19 on traditional broadcasting and broadcast rights [3][6]. Specifically, the media segment revenue rose significantly, with a 20.3% increase in 2021, highlighting improved content sales and advertising performance [6].\n\nCustomer relationships, measured in thousands, remained relatively stable but showed a slight net loss over the period. The total customer base slightly declined from 23,280 in 2019 to 23,027 in 2021, with net losses of 394 and 198 customers respectively, reflecting ongoing competitive pressures and changes in viewing patterns [5]. The decline in customers, particularly in regions affected by reduced broadcast rights like Italy, impacted the revenue per customer but was partially offset by higher revenue per individual relationship, driven by rate adjustments and increased average revenue per customer [11].\n\nOverall, the combined effect of stable customer relationships and rising revenue indicates that NBCUniversal was able to enhance its per-customer profitability despite a slight shrinkage in its customer base. The growth in revenue and relatively steady customer relationships contributed to a better financial standing, as seen in the increase in adjusted EBITDA from approximately $(690) million in 2019 to $(65) million in 2021, suggesting a reduction in losses and improved operational efficiency [3][6].

This approach is characterized by several key steps and activities, as illustrated in the provided evidence.\n\nInitially, BHP employs a **rigorous and structured approach** to board succession planning. As depicted in the table outlining an eight-step process [image1], the process begins with assessing the current board's skills, diversity, tenures, and attributes necessary for effective governance and risk management. The process accounts for unforeseen departures and aims to maintain a diverse pipeline of potential candidates, focusing on balancing experience with fresh perspectives. \n\nThis begins with **continuous planning**, where the process remains ongoing, especially for Non-executive Directors with a typical nine-year tenure as a guideline, ensuring that the board remains adaptable to external and internal changes [image1]. The committee regularly reviews each candidate's role description, incorporating criteria from governance documents to define the qualities sought in new directors.\n\nOnce the criteria are set, BHP utilizes an **external search firm** to conduct a global search for suitable candidates, aligning their profiles with the outlined role descriptions [image1]. Shortlisted candidates then undergo **interviews with the Chair and board members**, fostering a thorough assessment of their suitability, followed by **background and reference checks** supported by external consultants [image1].\n\nThe recommended candidates are then presented to the Board for approval, culminating in the issuance of a **letter of appointment**, which clearly states terms, independence, participation requirements, and expectations around continuous development [image1].\n\nThroughout this process, the Nomination and Governance Committee also oversees **director training and development** activities post-appointment, including ongoing education on environmental, social, and governance issues, aligned with performance evaluations [8]. The committee actively supports continuous improvement activities to enhance directors’ understanding of BHP’s assets, markets, and governance practices.\n\nFurthermore, BHP emphasizes **board renewal and evaluating skill gaps** through annual assessments and talent pipeline evaluations, which are critical for aligning director skills with strategic needs [10, 11]. The renewal process also involves **assessing potential conflicts of interest**, particularly regarding directors holding positions in companies with whom BHP has dealings, ensuring objectivity and independence remain intact [11].\n\nIn summary, BHP's Nomination and Governance Committee ensures effective board succession planning and director development by following a meticulous, multi-step process: defining role criteria, engaging external search firms, conducting thorough interviews and checks, approving appointments with clear terms, and supporting ongoing director education. This structured approach promotes a continuously refreshed, skilled, and independent board aligned with the company’s strategic and governance needs."}

As indicated in [9], the goodwill resulting from the acquisition or termination of franchise contracts represents intangible assets that did not meet the IFRS 3 recognition criteria, particularly concerning the capacity to generate future cash flows. This highlights that some goodwill recognized during these periods was not entirely based on identifiable future benefits.\n\nFurthermore, in 2021, the discussion about goodwill emphasizes that its recovery is adequately guaranteed through the profitability of the acquired companies, with future cash flows supporting the carrying amount at year-end [3]. This suggests a robust assessment of goodwill’s value, possibly reflecting a stabilization or improvement in the profitability of acquisitions during 2021 compared to 2020.\n\nWhile the actual quantitative details of goodwill components are not explicitly provided in the quotes, the focus on the guarantee of goodwill recovery and the note that certain goodwill arises from intangible assets not meeting IFRS 3 standards imply that, in 2020, there may have been more uncertainty or adjustments related to goodwill recognition, whereas by 2021, the company confirms that the goodwill is supported by the target companies' profitability. This indicates a potential stabilization or improvement in the valuation and recoverability of goodwill components from 2020 to 2021.\n\n**In summary:** The main difference lies in the assurance that, as of 2021, goodwill is adequately supported by the profitability of acquired entities, whereas in 2020, some goodwill may have been recognized from intangibles that did not fully meet IFRS 3 criteria, possibly reflecting initial recognition uncertainties."}

The CEO and MD, Rajesh Gopinathan and N. Ganapathy Subramaniam, received total remunerations of ₹1,337.94 lakh and ₹1,011.69 lakh respectively, which include gross salary, perquisites, stock options, commission, and other allowances. These figures reflect the high level of compensation typical for top executive positions, with commissions alone amounting to ₹1,700 lakh collectively for both, indicating performance-based incentives strong enough to contribute substantially to their total earnings [[2](image2)].\n\nIn contrast, the Independent Directors received considerably lower total remuneration, which primarily consisted of sitting fees and modest commissions. For instance, each Independent Director earned a total of around ₹61.80 lakh to ₹206.90 lakh, depending on their individual fees and commissions, with the total for all independent directors summing to approximately ₹910.60 lakh [[8](image8)]. Their remuneration mainly comprised sitting fees (e.g., approximately ₹1.80 to ₹6.90 lakh per director) and fixed commissions (ranging from ₹60 lakh to ₹200 lakh), capped as per the legal provisions based on the company's profits.\n\nThis stark difference highlights the executive compensation structure, where top management receives variable and performance-linked remuneration, often significantly higher than the fixed fees paid to non-executive independent directors. The independent directors' remuneration is primarily aimed at compensating their oversight and governance functions rather than incentivizing operational performance.\n\nIn summary, while the CEOs and MDs at Tata Consultancy Services earn total remunerations exceeding ₹1,000 lakh, largely through salary, perquisites, and performance-linked commissions, the Independent Directors earn substantially less, predominantly through fixed sitting fees and comparatively modest commissions, reflecting their roles focused on governance rather than operational leadership."}

This growth indicates an expanding demand for the platform services and other offerings within Salesforce's portfolio. \n\nSimultaneously, the company's total revenue increased significantly during this period, as shown in the seventh and eighth images, with total revenues rising from approximately  $13.28$ billion in 2019 to  $17.10$ billion in 2020, a growth of about 29%. The growth in the 'Salesforce Platform and Other' segment contributed positively to this overall revenue expansion.\n\nOn the cost side, the fifth and sixth images display an increase in total cost of revenues from about  $3.45$ billion in 2019 to approximately  $4.24$ billion in 2020, an increase of around 22.7%. While specific breakdowns for 'Platform and Other' costs are not detailed separately in these images, the overall rise in costs suggests that as revenue grew, the company also invested more in delivering services, particularly in increasing data center capacity and support infrastructure, as noted in the first and fifth quotes.\n\nThe impact on overall financial performance can be summarized as follows:\n\n- Revenue growth in the 'Platform and Other' segment supports Salesforce's strategic focus on expanding its cloud services.\n- The increase in costs, while significant, was proportionate to revenue growth, which helped maintain a healthy gross profit margin; in fact, the gross margin remained robust at around 75% in 2020.\n- The overall revenue increase led to higher operating cash flows and improved financial health, despite rising operating expenses, which increased primarily due to investments in research and development, sales, and administrative functions.\n\nIn conclusion, the growth in both revenue and cost within the 'Salesforce Platform and Other' category contributed positively to Salesforce’s overall financial expansion, enabling it to strengthen its service offerings while managing expenses to sustain profitability.\n\n![The Salesforce Platform and Other revenue increased from 2019 to 2020, supporting overall growth](image2)"}

This rise, primarily driven by market volatility, derivative exposures, and increased investments, meant that the total assets weighted by risk rose substantially, requiring higher capital buffers to maintain regulatory ratios— as reflected in the actual capital ratios surpassing the minimum requirements. For example, the **Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratios** remained high at around **17.4%** (Standardized) and **17.7%** (Advanced) in 2020, well above the required 13.2% and 10.0%. This indicates a strengthened equity cushion to absorb the increased risk.\n\nRegarding **External TLAC**, its percentage of RWA rose from **about 49.9%** in 2019 to **47.7%** in 2020, slightly decreasing but remaining well above the minimum requirement of 18.0%. Similarly, the **TLAC as a percentage of leverage exposure** increased from 17.0% to 18.1%, surpassing the regulatory minimum of 7.5%. The higher relative TLAC ensures the institution maintains adequate loss-absorbing capacity amidst increased risk exposure, which supports financial stability and confidence in its capital structure.\n\n**In sum**, the upward trend in Credit Risk RWA indicates greater risk exposure, necessitating more capital. The consistent and elevated levels of External TLAC as a percentage of RWA and leverage exposure demonstrate a strengthened capacity to absorb losses, thereby reinforcing the robustness of the institution’s capital structure amidst increased risk. This proactive enhancement of capital buffers and loss-absorbing capacity ensures regulatory compliance and promotes financial resilience.\n\n![Risk and Capital Structure](image7)"}

This indicates robust financial health and successful cost management, such as energy savings of 130 units per million cigarettes produced [4], and a strategic focus on developing new brands like Piper, Tipper, and Jaisalmer, which have enhanced market share and product innovation [7], [10].\n\nSimultaneously, the export potential for tobacco from India is substantial but under-realized. Current export earnings are Rs. 930 crore, with the possibility of expanding this to Rs. 7000 crore by capturing just 5% of the global tobacco trade—highlighting a sevenfold increase if harnessed effectively [3]. The significant tax burden on cigarettes, being 21 times higher than bidis and 17 times higher than chewing tobacco, constrains domestic sales but underscores the importance of export growth as an alternative revenue source [1].\n\nThis juxtaposition suggests that while the company has achieved strong financial results domestically and launched innovative products, the considerable export potential represents an enormous opportunity for future growth. Capitalizing on export channels, especially given the global demand and India's current small share (0.7% of USD 30 billion global trade), could diversify revenue streams and offset domestic market challenges. \n\nThe implication for the company's strategy is clear: it should bolster export initiatives, improve international market penetration, and leverage India's competitive advantages highlighted by the export figures and potential [3, image3].

From 2019 to 2020, net interest income decreased sharply by approximately $19.75 billion (as shown in Image2), primarily driven by a significant decline in interest income across various segments, especially those related to loans and securities. Conversely, interest expense decreased by about $5.63 billion, mainly due to lower interest-bearing deposit costs and reduced funding expenses amid a low-interest-rate environment. This resulted in a substantial narrowing of net interest spread, reflecting macroeconomic conditions like COVID-19’s impact, leading to lower rates and altered asset and liability management strategies.\n\nIn contrast, from 2018 to 2019, interest income had increased by roughly $4.45 billion, and interest expense rose slightly, leading to a higher net interest spread (Image3), indicating an environment of rising interest rates and more favorable earnings conditions. The organizational structure of Bank of America, distinctively divided into segments like Consumer Banking, Global Wealth & Investment Management, Global Banking, and Global Markets (Image1), plays a crucial role in these changes. For instance, the Global Markets division, which handles trading and securities, is directly impacted by interest rate fluctuations, affecting interest income, as depicted in the detailed segment data (Images4,5,6). Simultaneously, retail segments like Consumer Banking, which relies heavily on deposits and loans, also experience these shifts, influencing internal credit strategies and risk management.\n\nOverall, the major difference lies in the macroeconomic environment—rising interest rates in 2018–2019 supported higher net interest income, while the pandemic-driven low-interest rate landscape in 2020 caused a steep decline. The bank’s segmented organizational structure, with specialized divisions managing different assets, liabilities, and market operations, ensures that these external interest rate changes propagate through their financial results via both asset yields and funding costs, as reflected in the detailed data and organizational setup."}

Specifically, net investment income decreased from approximately $5,039 million in 2020 to $4,807 million in 2021, representing a reduction of about 4.7% [7]. This decrease was primarily driven by a sharp drop in interest and other investment income, which fell from $1,059 million in 2020 to $589 million in 2021—a decline of 44.4% [7]. Despite this, dividend income increased modestly from $4,890 million to $5,060 million, partly offsetting the impact on total investment income. \n\n![Invested assets of the insurance business increased from $363,117 thousand in 2020 to $446,277 thousand in 2021](image3). The asset composition shifted notably: cash, cash equivalents, and U.S. Treasury Bills rose from $67,082 to $90,688, indicating a higher liquidity position aimed at safety and liquidity. Equity securities also increased from $269,498 to $334,907, reflecting a growth in market holdings amidst ongoing volatility. Conversely, fixed maturity securities decreased from $20,317 to $16,386, which combined with shifts in other assets signifies a move toward more liquid, lower-yield investments. \n\nThe implications of these changes suggest that, amid persistently low interest rates—evident from the declines in interest income—the insurance company opted to hold larger cash and equity positions, likely prioritizing liquidity and safety over yield. Although this shift reduces income derived from fixed-income securities, it enhances the company's ability to meet policyholder obligations and adapt to market volatility.\n\nIn summary, from 2020 to 2021, the insurance business experienced a decrease in net investment income primarily due to lower interest income, despite increasing overall invested assets and shifting their composition toward more liquid and equity-based assets. These strategic asset allocation changes help maintain liquidity and mitigate market risks, but may constrain income growth in a persistently low-interest environment."}

Let's examine each component with supporting evidence.\n\nRegarding equity index put options, their fair value is primarily affected by market volatility rather than interest rates, though interest rates can have an indirect effect. From the table described in [7], the fair value of the equity index put option liabilities was approximately $99 million as of December 31, 2021. When interest rates change, the valuation models for options may experience small adjustments; however, the primary sensitivities are with respect to market volatility and the underlying stock index movements. The data indicates that a hypothetical 30% change in market prices would significantly impact net earnings — with estimated effects of roughly $74 million to $781 million variance, depending on whether prices increase or decrease, demonstrating the options' high sensitivity to market conditions rather than interest rates. \n\nFurthermore, the sensitivity analysis in the same table shows that the fair value of these options is relatively stable with interest rate changes, as the primary concern is the underlying equity market movement, which directly affects the intrinsic value and volatility assumptions used in valuation models.\n\nOn the other hand, non-U.S. denominated debt impacts net earnings through foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. The comparison from the table in [3] and [6] shows notable differences between 2020 and 2021. For instance, the foreign currency translation included in other comprehensive income experienced a significant turnaround: in 2020, there was a gain of approximately $1.264 billion, while in 2021, there was a loss of about $1.021 billion. This indicates that currency movements negatively affected net earnings in 2021 compared to the positive impact in 2020. \n\nSpecifically, the text notes that the carrying values of these debts are translated at current exchange rates, and changes in these rates directly influence earnings. The decline in the currency translation gains/losses impacts overall net earnings, as seen in the substantial swing from positive in 2020 to negative in 2021, underscoring how foreign currency exchange rate volatility has a sizable effect on the company's financial results in these years.\n\nIn summary, while changes in interest rates have limited direct impact on the fair value of equity index put options—mostly affected by market volatility—the effects of foreign currency fluctuations on non-U.S. denominated debt are significant, with 2020 experiencing large gains and 2021 seeing substantial losses, thus broadly reducing net earnings in 2021:\n\n- **Interest rate changes** have minimal direct effect on the fair value of equity index put options but can influence the valuation models indirectly through discount rates and market variables.\n- **Foreign currency rate movements** caused large swings in net earnings via translation effects, notably shifting from gains in 2020 to losses in 2021."}

This rise was driven primarily by a significant positive change in the 'Other comprehensive income that may be reclassified subsequently to profit or loss,' which increased from a loss of €593 million in 2020 to a gain of €542 million in 2021. Key elements like currency translation differences shifted from a negative €768 million to a positive €724 million, reflecting favorable currency movements, and cash flow hedge effects improved from €61 million in 2020 to a loss of €154 million in 2021. Additionally, the 'Other comprehensive income, net of taxes,' turned positive, contributing to the overall increase. Conversely, the 'Net income' rose from €1,423 million to €1,746 million, further enhancing total comprehensive income [2].\n\nOn the balance sheet side, significant changes occurred in assets, liabilities, and equity. Total non-current assets nearly doubled from €14,827 million in 2020 to €31,338 million in 2021, largely due to increased intangible assets and property, plant, and equipment, possibly from acquisitions such as Varian [6]. Current assets also rose modestly from €10,268 million to €10,824 million. \n\nLiabilities saw a marked increase, especially in non-current liabilities, which expanded from €5,294 million to €15,758 million, mainly driven by higher long-term financial debt, reflecting financing activities like the acquisition of Varian. Current liabilities grew from €7,289 million to €10,065 million, attributable to increased trade payables and short-term debts. These changes resulted in total liabilities rising correspondingly. \n\nEquity attributable to shareholders increased from €12,498 million in 2020 to €16,321 million in 2021, influenced by a capital increase in March 2021 (raising €2,284 million) and retained earnings, despite dividend payouts, maintaining a positive net growth. The equity ratio declined from 76% to 55%, primarily due to the rise in debt levels, which offset the equity increases [7].\n\nIn summary, fiscal year 2021 saw a pronounced improvement in comprehensive income driven by favorable currency and hedge effects, alongside substantial asset growth and increased liabilities due to financing and acquisitions, resulting in a reshaped but strengthened financial position compared to 2020.\n\n![](image2)  \n*The comprehensive income table illustrates a significant rise in total comprehensive income from 2020 to 2021, mainly due to favorable currency translation differences and other comprehensive income components.*\n\n![](image6)  \n*The balance sheet comparison highlights considerable increases in non-current assets, total liabilities, and equity, with a notable expansion of non-current liabilities and assets, reflecting strategic investments and financing activities.*"}

The gross profit margin slightly declined by 1 percentage point to 77.1%, reflecting the impact of increased costs or investments in growth areas but still maintaining high profitability [4, 8]. The decline in pre-tax income was primarily driven by higher expenses related to strategic investments and the integration of Red Hat, which, although boosting revenue, affected short-term profit margins [7].\n\nIn contrast, **Global Business Services (GBS)** posted a modest external gross profit of **$4,655 million**, up **3.0%** from 2018, with a slight increase in gross margin by 0.8 percentage points to **27.7%**.

In terms of shipment volumes, the data shows a pronounced decrease; specifically, cigarette shipment volumes declined by 11.8%, from 72,293 million units in 2019 to 63,749 million units in 2020 [3, image3]. Conversely, heated tobacco units experienced a remarkable upsurge of 50.8%, increasing from 299 million to 451 million units, which partly offset the overall decline in total shipment volume, which dropped by 11.6% from 72,592 million to 64,200 million units [3].\n\nFinancially, the net revenues for Latin America & Canada in 2020 decreased by 18.6% compared to 2019, mainly driven by lower cigarette sales in Argentina, Colombia, and Mexico, as detailed in the text, with Argentina showing a 12.2% decline and Mexico an 18.0% reduction [12]. Nonetheless, the company’s operating income improved substantially — increasing by 100%, from $235 million in 2019 to $564 million in 2020 [5]. This suggests that despite lower revenues, PMI managed to enhance profitability, potentially through cost management, product mix shifts towards higher-margin heated tobacco, or operational efficiencies associated with restructuring efforts.\n\nAdditionally, the company's cash flow from operations saw a slight decrease but remained relatively stable, with net cash provided by operating activities slightly declining from $10,090 million to $9,812 million, and a significant reduction in net cash used in investing activities from $(1,811) million to $(1,154) million. The decline in investing outflows, along with strategic asset impairment and exit costs (notably in restructuring), contributed to better cash management [1, 3, image1].\n\nIn summary, the decrease in shipment volumes—particularly in traditional cigarettes—was mitigated by growth in heated tobacco product sales and cost controls, leading to a decrease in revenue but a substantial increase in operating income, reflecting a shift in product mix and operational adjustments during 2020. The combination of volume declines and strategic financial management helped PMI navigate the challenging market conditions in Latin America & Canada during this period.\n\n![The chart showing shipment volume decline in cigarettes and rise in heated tobacco units in Latin America & Canada](image3)"}

Despite the slight dip in 2020, the loans rebounded in 2021, surpassing the 2019 level, reflecting ongoing credit availability but moderated growth due to higher paydown rates, as the company notes that the growth in loans was lower than billed business because of increased customer repayment capacity [10].  \n\nSimultaneously, **net interest income** declined over the same period from $7,683 million in 2019 to $7,145 million in 2020 and further down to $6,674 million in 2021 [2; image8]. This decrease was primarily driven by a lower interest yield on loans, stemming from higher paydown rates and reduced interest yields, which suggests tighter net interest margins despite maintaining credit quality, as indicated by outstanding low levels of bad debt metrics [12; image7].  \n\n**Implications for the company's financial performance** include a mixed impact: while higher cardholder paydowns pressured interest income, the company's revenue momentum was bolstered by increases in non-interest revenues, such as discount revenue and card fees, which grew significantly (26% for discount revenue) [2; image4]. Additionally, the company's provision for credit losses was substantially reduced, releasing reserves due to improved macroeconomic outlooks, which benefited net income [4].  \n\nIn summary, although lower net interest income and slight fluctuations in average loans reflect narrower interest margins amid a prudent credit environment, the company's overall revenue growth and capital adequacy suggest resilient financial performance with a strategic focus on risk management and revenue diversification."}

This activity directly boosts shareholders' equity through the recognition of compensation expenses that enhance retained earnings and equity reserves. Such equity adjustments reflect the company's strategic incentive strategies aimed at aligning employee interests with shareholder value, ultimately contributing positively to the total shareholders’ equity, which ended at $17,499,173 as of August 31, 2020. \n\nSimultaneously, from the cash flow statement, net cash provided by operating activities in 2020 was substantial, with an articulated cash inflow driven by net income of $5,185,313 and further adjustments for non-cash expenses like share-based compensation. These non-cash expenses reduce net income for accounting purposes but do not lessen the company's cash position, allowing the company to allocate funds toward share repurchases, dividends, or investments. The cash flows from operating activities, therefore, support ongoing shareholder returns and financial stability without depleting cash reserves.\n\nIn summary, share-based compensation increases shareholders’ equity through recognized expenses that reflect employee incentives, while positive cash flows from operating activities bolster cash availability for shareholder remuneration and reinvestment.

The rise in net income boosted retained earnings and overall equity, but the decrease in total assets could be partly due to cash flow activities and asset reallocation, such as reduced investment securities and changes in loan portfolios. ![Net income and comprehensive income showed substantial growth in 2021](image2)\n\nThe cash flow statements reveal that net cash flows from operating activities increased markedly in 2021, primarily due to higher net income, but there was a net decrease in cash and cash equivalents by about $10.9 billion, largely attributable to cash used in investing and financing activities—such as repayments of debt and share repurchases—which contributed to the net asset reduction. The reduction in cash and cash equivalents, despite high profitability, reflects strategic funding and investment decisions that impacted the asset base. ![Cash flow activities show significant cash used in investing and financing in 2021](image7)\n\nIn summary, the entity's total assets decreased slightly in 2021 compared to 2020, driven largely by reductions in securities and cash holdings, while total liabilities also decreased mainly through debt repayments. These structural changes are aligned with the notable increase in net income and overall comprehensive income, which strengthened shareholders’ equity, even as cash flows indicated strategic asset and debt management activities that led to asset base contraction."}

From the detailed data, the net operating income for HSBC in 2020 was \\$13,312 million, representing a 12% decrease year-over-year, largely due to lower interest income and customer activity impacted by Covid-19 [image1].\n\nIn contrast, the report indicates that the overall profit before tax dropped significantly, by 74%, to \\$1,868 million in 2020 from \\$7,170 million in 2019, reflecting challenges across all segments, including the commercial banking areas. The segment-specific revenues show reductions, particularly in areas like Global Trade and Receivables Finance, which saw a 4% decrease, and Global Liquidity and Cash Management, which fell by 30%. These areas form part of the broader Commercial Banking operations, which faced lower trade volumes and interest income, as detailed in the management reports.\n\nThe decline in profit before tax and net operating income highlights the adverse impact of Covid-19 and the low global interest rate environment on HSBC's core segments. The Wealth and Personal Banking segment, with its focus on retail and private banking, was affected by reduced customer activity and lower net interest income, while the Commercial Banking areas faced declines in revenue from trade finance and lending activities, contributing to the overall profit drop.\n\nIn summary, HSBC’s Wealth and Personal Banking segment saw notable declines in net operating income and revenue, while Commercial Banking also experienced significant impacts, leading to a major decrease in overall profit before tax in 2020. The challenging environment affected both segments differently, but both contributed to HSBC's lowered earnings for the year."}

This growth reflects strategic investments and perhaps asset acquisitions during the year.\n\nMeanwhile, total equity experienced a decrease from $2,749 million in 2019 to $2,352 million in 2020, as depicted in the sixth image. The decline in equity could be attributed to dividends paid of approximately $5.8 billion, and a reduction in accumulated other comprehensive income, mainly due to foreign currency translation adjustments. However, net income of about $5.59 billion partially offset this decrease [1].\n\nIn terms of debt, IBM's total company debt decreased from $62,899 million in 2019 to $61,538 million in 2020, evidenced in the first image. Notably, the global financing segment's debt also declined from $24,727 million to $21,167 million, and total debt supported external clients decreased from $21,487 million to $17,819 million [1, image1].

Let's start with the leasehold improvements and other assets, as depicted in the detailed asset table (image1).\n\nInitially, at the beginning of the year (1 July 2019), the carrying amounts were:\n\n![Asset values at 1 July 2019](image1)\n\n- Leasehold improvements: $XX (not specified precisely in the summary but can be inferred from cost and depreciation data)\n- Hardware and software: similarly, a starting value\n- Fixtures and fittings: likewise\n\nThroughout the year, additions for new stores and leasehold improvements increased the cost base, as shown in the table's \"additions\" entries. For example, the increase in total asset value (from $138,403,000 to $150,464,000 for right-of-use assets in image6) indicates new lease recognition and capitalized costs.\n\nDepreciation charges, notably $37,454,000 recognized during the year, reduced the carrying amounts for these assets. Impairments on certain assets (notably in the hardware/software category) also further decreased their value, as reflected in impairment losses.\n\nRe-measurements of lease liabilities, modified lease terms, and currency exchange movements contributed to variations in the assets’ book values. For instance, in image6, the re-measurement of lease liabilities ($1,698,000) and currency effects (−$1,755,000) impacted the right-of-use assets’ balances.\n\nBy the end of the year (28 June 2020), the total carrying amount of right-of-use assets increased to **$150,464,000**, primarily due to new leases and capitalized costs, offset somewhat by depreciation and impairments.\n\nThe factors contributing to these changes include:\n\n- **New leases and additions:** As shown in the lease asset recognition and \"additions,\" the group acquired new leases, increasing the overall right-of-use asset base.\n- **Depreciation:** The group recognized $37,454,000 in depreciation, reducing asset values.\n- **Impairments:** Impairment losses impacted certain assets, decreasing their carrying amounts.\n- **Re-measurement and lease modifications:** Adjustments due to lease term extensions and changes impacted the asset values.\n- **Exchange rate effects:** Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates affected the value of assets denominated in foreign currencies.\n\nIn sum, the assets' carrying amounts increased due to new lease capitalizations and acquisitions but were reduced primarily by depreciation, impairments, and adjustments from lease modifications.

This indicates a significant reduction in tax expense in 2020, primarily driven by benefits such as the derecognition of deferred tax assets on distributed intellectual property (which notably impacted 2019 with a \\$2,472 million benefit) and other tax credits and deductions. However, in 2021, the tax provision increased again, partly due to the absence of such large one-time benefits and changes in tax strategies.\n\nSpecifically, the **excess tax benefits associated with share-based awards** increased from \\$27 million in 2019 to \\$83 million in 2020, and \\$265 million in 2021 ([2], [1]).

Moreover, the establishment of new U.S. net deferred tax assets in 2019 added to the tax benefits at that time.\n\nIn terms of **unrecognized tax benefits** (from image5), there was an increase from \\$1,705 million in 2019 to \\$1,901 million in 2020, and \\$2,136 million in 2021, reflecting ongoing uncertainties and potential adjustments in tax positions, notably due to ongoing examinations and disputes (e.g., Korean withholding taxes, transfer pricing issues).

According to the data presented in the tables, WFAM's beginning AUM in 2021 was approximately $603.0 billion [image2], but the sale impact was recorded as a reduction of about $587.1 billion, essentially liquidating the managed assets under WFAM by the end of the year.

For example, in 2021, the company reported net gains of $674 million from the sale of its Corporate Trust Services business and $269 million from the WFAM sale, contributing to the increased other income for the year [1][2]. These gains temporarily boosted noninterest income and contributed positively to the profit figures. Conversely, the sale also led to lower asset-based fees, as the AUM associated with WFAM was a primary source of ongoing revenue—immediately lowering revenues derived from asset management fees [4].\n\nOn the balance sheet, the sale of WFAM assets reduced both the managed assets and the associated liabilities or administrative balances, as evidenced by the large outflows in the AUM data.

Although the specific 2019 figure for WPB revenue isn't directly listed here, the general trend indicates that revenue declined from 2018 to 2020, likely similar between 2018 and 2019 based on the pattern of reductions seen, partly due to lower interest rates affecting net interest income.\n\nRegarding operating expenses, the 2018 figure was approximately $7,865 million according to the 2020 data (though this figure might be the operating profit; the precise expenses would be slightly higher or lower). In 2019, as per the data from image6, the total operating expenses for the entire bank were reported as $34,432 million, with the WPB segment contributing a significant portion.

This reduction was primarily driven by a sharp decrease in interest income, which fell by $19,747 million, as shown in the interest income breakdown [image1], reflecting lower yields on various assets such as loans, securities, and deposits. \n\nAt the same time, interest expense decreased by $5,627 million from 2019 to 2020 [image1], mainly due to lower interest paid on deposits and borrowings, driven by declining interest rates [6]. However, because interest income dropped more substantially than interest expense, the net interest spread compressed markedly. The decrease in yields on earning assets, especially in loans and securities (shown in the interest income segments), was a primary factor. \n\nFurthermore, the data shows that the overall interest rate environment softened in 2020, with lower interest rates on consumer and commercial loans, government securities, and other assets, which compressed the margins [6]. The decrease in deposit interest rates and funding costs helped reduce the expense, but the more considerable decline in income was due to reduced yield on assets, primarily because of the broader lowering of interest rates amid economic challenges in 2020.\n\nTo summarize visually and factually, the interplay between the drastic drop in interest income and a comparatively smaller reduction in interest expense led to a narrower net interest spread, mainly driven by lower interest rates on assets and a reduced amount of interest earned on loans and securities [image1, 6].  \n![Interest income and expense changes from 2019 to 2020](image1)  \nThis combination resulted in a less profitable margin for the bank's core lending and investment activities during this period."}

The key activities influencing these changes include acquisitions—adding 12 units in 2021 and 37 in 2022—and foreign exchange translation differences, which contributed a slight increase in 2021 (1) and 2022 (4) [10]. Disposals appear minimal with a small reduction, notably a disposal of 11 in 2020, and negligible in later periods, indicating steady investments with some disposals but an overall upward trend.  \n\nIn contrast, guarantees experienced a decrease over this period. The guarantees balance was 378 at the start of 2020, then fell to 329 by the end of January 2021, due to acquisitions of 6 and disposals of 42, along with transfers and currency translation effects [4][13]. From 2021 to 2022, the guarantees further declined from 329 to 290, impacted by additional acquisitions (6), disposals (54), transfers, and currencies fluctuations [4][13].

According to the first image, the promoter entities held a total of approximately 2.7 billion shares, constituting 72.0% of the total share capital, with no change observed from April 1, 2019, to March 31, 2020. The shareholding was entirely held by Indian \"Bodies Corporate,\" indicating a tightly controlled ownership structure [1, Image1]. The second image affirms this stability, showing that the promoter shareholding remained steady at 72.0%, with no fluctuations in the number of shares held, emphasizing their dominant and consistent stake.\n\nIn contrast, public institutions' shareholding, detailed in images 6 and 8, showed more variability but remained a minority compared to promoters. For example, mutual funds and foreign institutional investors each held around 15.7% of the total shares at both the start and end of the year, with minor increases (Mutual Funds: from 93.36 million to 95.70 million shares; FIIs: from 4.73 million to 0.98 million shares, illustrating a decrease in FII holdings) [8].

The year-end consolidated operating profit for 2021 was reported as **$6,878 million**, up from the prior year, indicating a substantial improvement. Additionally, the detailed breakdown shows that sales volume, price realization, and decreases in manufacturing costs and SG&A/R&D expenses contributed positively to this increase, leading to the total operating profit of $6,878 million in 2021 [8].\n\nOn the other hand, the **Machinery, Energy & Transportation (ME&T)** segment's net cash from operating activities experienced a substantial rise. Image4 details that ME&T's net cash provided by operating activities increased from **$4,054 million in 2020** to **$7,177 million in 2021**, reflecting a strong improvement, mainly driven by higher profit before taxes adjusted for non-cash items and working capital changes.

This indicated additional tax positions that the company hadn't yet recognized, possibly reflecting ongoing uncertainties or disputes in their tax filings. Despite this increase, the company also believed that its liability for unrecognized tax benefits could decrease in the next twelve months by about $39 million due to potential audit settlements and the expiration of statutes of limitations [6].\n\nConcurrently, the company's common share repurchase activity experienced a reduction in total shares reacquired; in 2019, they repurchased 22 million shares at an average price of $245.97 per share, totaling $5,500 million [1, 5], whereas in 2020, they repurchased 14 million shares at an average price of $300.58 per share, totaling $4,250 million [image1]. This decline in share repurchases, combined with a higher per-share purchase price in 2020, suggests that the company was reducing its buyback volume but was willing to pay a higher price for shares remaining authorized under ongoing buyback programs.\n\nThe implications for their financial position are multifaceted. The increased unrecognized tax benefits could signify greater tax-related uncertainties, which might temporarily affect the company's valuation and tax planning strategies. Meanwhile, the reduced share repurchase volume and higher prices paid in 2020 could imply a strategic shift toward conserving cash or adjusting capital allocation, potentially affecting shareholder return strategies.

Specifically, sales volume increased by approximately $3,076 million, as highlighted in the bar chart (image1), which indicates higher end-user demand for equipment and aftermarket parts, particularly in sectors like mining, heavy construction, and quarrying [1][11]. This rise in sales volume was primarily driven by higher customer demand, favorable pricing conditions, and inventory adjustments across various regions, as depicted in multiple regional sales reports [2][3][4][6].\n\nConcurrently, the operating profit for Q4 2021 increased by about $231 million, reaching roughly $1.611 billion from $1.380 billion in Q4 2020 (images 4 and 7). Key contributors to this rise included higher sales volumes, which accounted for about $687 million of the profit increase, and favorable price realization adding roughly $507 million, as shown in the detailed profit breakdowns [4][8][10]. Despite higher manufacturing costs—related to increased labor and material expenses captured in the text [1][7]—these were offset by the gains from increased sales and price improvements.\n\nAdditionally, the profit increase was supported by a net restructuring income from asset sales and productivity improvements in manufacturing processes, along with favorable currency effects and financial product contributions [1][10][11]. The decrease in manufacturing costs by approximately $1,246 million (image1) and reductions in SG&A expenses helped improve net margins, while inventory reductions in dealer networks, especially in 2020, set the foundation for higher sales demand in 2021 (images 2, 4, and 5).\n\nIn summary, the major factors contributing to the observed growth in sales volume and operating profit were:\n- Increased end-user demand across key sectors such as mining, construction, and energy.\n- Favorable price realization strategies.\n- Inventory adjustments on regional and dealer levels.\n- Cost management and restructuring initiatives.\n\n**Overall, the company experienced a notable boost in both sales volume and operating profit in Q4 2021, driven by higher demand, better pricing, and operational efficiencies.**"}

This decline was primarily due to lower interest rates, as noted explicitly in the financial data, which reduced the yield on interest-earning assets [1]. The total revenue, net of interest expense, also dropped to about $33.3 billion from nearly $38.6 billion in 2019, a decrease of about 13.7% [1][5]. The revenue decrease reflects lower interest income and noninterest income, the latter influenced by decreases in service charges and card income due to decreased client activity during the pandemic [5].\n\nIn the wealth management sector, the Merrill Lynch Global Wealth Management and Private Bank together generated approximately $18.6 billion in revenue in 2020, down from $19.5 billion in 2019, a reduction of around 4.7% [2]. While assets under management and client balances increased—assets under management grew to approximately $1.41 trillion in 2020 from about $1.28 trillion in 2019 [2]—the net client flows, market valuations, and overall client activity experienced a slowdown, partly due to market volatility during the pandemic [2].\n\nTo summarize, despite increased client assets and asset flows in wealth management, both sectors saw reductions in net interest income and total revenue in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily driven by lower interest rates, lower client activity, and the economic impact of COVID-19.  \n![Financial Data for Consumer Banking and Wealth Management](image7)"}

These non-recurring factors tend to inflate IFRS expenses or gains, skewing the net income figure downward or upward.\n\n- **Other Non-Recurring and Financial Items:** Adjustments like fair value changes, legal-related items, and fine-tuning provisions also play a considerable role in differentiating IFRS and core metrics.\n\nIn summary, the most impactful adjustments are related to amortization/impairments of intangible assets and restructuring/divestment-related charges. These adjustments have elevated core net income and EPS figures relative to IFRS by excluding these non-cash or non-recurring expenses, providing a clearer picture of underlying operational performance.\n\n---\n\n**Here's a visual summary:**\n\n![The table showing financial data for 2021 with detailed adjustments from IFRS to core results](image8)\n\n*This image illustrates how adjustments, especially for intangible assets and restructuring, significantly boost the core net income and EPS compared to IFRS results for 2021.*\n\nIn conclusion, adjustments related to asset amortizations, impairments, divestments, and restructuring costs most significantly influenced the differences in net income and EPS between 2020 and 2021 under both IFRS and core results."}

This substantial growth in goodwill is primarily attributed to the acquisition of Varian, which contributed approximately €7,692 million of goodwill in 2021 [3], as indicated by the allocated goodwill for the Varian segment. The remainder of the increase is due to other acquisitions and adjustments within the company's segments. The acquisition of Varian not only added to the company's assets but also resulted in a major increase in goodwill, which is an intangible asset arising from the purchase price exceeding the fair value of net identifiable assets acquired. This is confirmed by the detailed financial notes and the large goodwill allocation to the Varian segment in 2021, highlighting how the acquisition significantly impacted the company's total goodwill figure. \n\n![The table displays goodwill, terminal value growth rate, and discount rate for various segments, showing a notable increase in total goodwill primarily due to the Varian acquisition](image3)"}

From the consolidated cash flow table, the company's operating activities generated significant cash, with net cash provided by operating activities reaching $29,187 million [6]. These operational inflows support dividend payouts and share repurchase activities. \n\nRegarding cash dividends, the equity table indicates that dividends paid to shareholders contributed to a reduction in retained earnings—though specific dividend amounts are not explicitly listed, the overall decrease in retained earnings over successive years implies dividends are a key factor. The \"Cash Dividends\" line under the common stock activity shows dividend distributions directly impacting shareholders' equity, aligning with the general decrease in retained earnings reflected in the equity statement. These dividends serve to distribute profits, decreasing overall equity, but also signal the company's commitment to returning value to shareholders.\n\nAs for treasury stock transactions, the equity table reveals active share repurchases in 2021, evidenced by the change in \"Treasury Stock (at cost)\". The net purchases of treasury shares reduce the number of outstanding shares and consequently affect the total equity attributable to Chevron stockholders. Specifically, the \"Purchases of Treasury Shares\" decrease the equity total while simultaneously increasing treasury stock at cost—this activity temporarily reduces stockholders’ equity but can bolster share value or serve strategic purposes.\n\nOn the cash flow front, net purchases of treasury stock would appear as cash outflows under financing activities. Indeed, the cash flow statement shows a net cash used for financing activities of approximately $23,113 million in 2021, which includes share repurchases. This outflow decreases cash reserves but consolidates the company's equity base by reducing outstanding shares.\n\nIn summary, in 2021, Chevron's cash dividends reduced retained earnings, thus decreasing overall equity, while treasury stock repurchases reduced the number of outstanding shares and impacted total equity through cash outflows. These activities demonstrate a strategic approach to returning value to shareholders and managing the company's equity structure, supported by strong operational cash flows.\n\nHere is a visual representation of these activities:\n![Chevron Equity Changes and Cash Flow Activities](image5)\n\nTogether, these dividend and treasury stock activities shaped Chevron’s equity by both distributing profits and reducing outstanding shares, impacting the company's capital structure and liquidity in 2021."}

The detailed performance data shows that despite overall challenges, some regional segments like Asia delivered resilient results, while others were impacted by lower interest rates and increased credit losses [8].\n\nSpecifically, while the detailed breakdown of WPB's specific contribution to the group’s profit isn’t explicitly quantified in the available quotes, the data from the performance tables and the regional emphasis suggest that WPB, as a significant part of HSBC’s operations, faced lower interest income and reduced customer activity in 2020, impacting its revenues and profitability. The financial performance data reflects overall declines across revenue, profit before tax, and other metrics, mainly driven by the adjustments for credit losses and lower interest rates. For example, the reported profit before tax decreased by 53% in 2020 compared to 2019, and the net operating income dropped by 14% [10][12].\n\nIn sum, while a precise figure for WPB's contribution isn't directly specified, the information implies that WPB's share of HSBC's adjusted profit before tax was subordinate to the dominant contribution from Asia, with the entire group experiencing significant declines due to pandemic-related economic pressures.\n\n![HSBC group's 2020 profit distribution pie chart](image3)  \n*The pie chart illustrates HSBC's profit contribution, with the highlighted segment showing \\$4.1 billion, which accounts for 34% of the total group adjusted profit before tax, indicating Asia’s substantial contribution.*"}

Specifically, as shown in the data, the initial implementation of the leasing standard led to the recognition of a lease liability of approximately $143,621,000 upon adoption [image1], which increased over the year due to new lease agreements and re-measurements, reaching a total of $167,154,000 by June 2020. This shift meant that operating leases, previously off-balance sheet, are now reflected as lease liabilities and right-of-use assets, affecting both assets and liabilities on the balance sheet.\n\n     ![The table shows the movement in lease liabilities during 2020, indicating initial recognition, re-measurements, lease payments, and exchange effects](image1)\n\nThe change also eliminated the need to recognize provisions for onerous operating leases, as lease payments are now incorporated into lease liabilities, leading to a more consistent and transparent lease accounting approach. Additionally, lease incentives are offset against rental expenses over the lease term [image2], simplifying lease expense recognition.\n\nFor employee benefit liabilities, notably long-service leave and annual leave, the figures remained relatively stable from 2019 to 2020, with current liabilities for annual leave at $2,848,000 and long-service leave at $837,000, along with non-current long-service leave obligations of $407,000 [image3]. The adoption of AASB 16 did not directly affect employee benefit liabilities, but the increased emphasis on fair value measurement and discounting using high-quality bond rates improved the precision of the obligations' valuation within the 2020 financials.\n\n![Employee benefit liabilities remained stable between 2019 and 2020, with minor increases in long-service leave obligations](image3)  \n\nIn summary, the main financial impact of adopting AASB 16 in 2020 was the recognition and upward movement of lease liabilities to $167,154,000, replacing previous operating lease provisions and liabilities. Employee benefit liabilities remained largely stable, with consistent recognition based on expected future benefit obligations, but now potentially measured with more precise discounting techniques.\n\n**Therefore, the transition to AASB 16 increased lease liabilities significantly, while employee benefit liabilities remained relatively stable in 2020.**"}

The liabilities, including accounts payable and lease liabilities, amount to roughly $(589) million, leading to net assets of approximately **$14,845 million**[5]. Notably, the intangible assets such as developed technology and customer relationships are explicitly identified with defined fair values and useful lives, emphasizing a focus on intangible differentiation and the significant goodwill impairment primarily related to workforce and market expansion.\n\nConversely, **Salesforce.org**'s detailed fair value allocation, as depicted in the accompanying table, mainly includes cash ($54 million), deferred tax assets ($59 million), and goodwill ($164 million), with others like current and noncurrent assets totaling about $46 million[1]. The total net assets acquired are calculated as **$134 million**[1], significantly less than ClickSoftware's allocation, reflecting perhaps a different asset composition or valuation complexity. The assets are primarily tangible and relatively straightforward, with goodwill recognized mainly from workforce and market opportunities, but at a much smaller scale compared to ClickSoftware.\n\nOne key similarity is that in both cases, **goodwill** is a significant component of the net assets—over $164 million for Salesforce.org and over $10 billion for ClickSoftware—primarily attributed to workforce and market expansion. Additionally, in both acquisitions, the fair value of tangible assets and liabilities is based on management estimates and assumptions, subject to adjustment upon final valuation[1][5].\n\nThe main difference lies in the **scope and complexity**: ClickSoftware's fair value allocation includes a comprehensive set of assets with detailed intangible valuation (developed technology and customer relationships), whereas Salesforce.org’s allocation is more condensed with a focus on fundamental assets and minimal intangible specifics. Also, the total net assets acquired differ greatly, mainly due to the size and scope of assets involved—ClickSoftware’s being in the billions, reflecting a large-scale business, while Salesforce.org's is relatively modest.\n\n**In summary**, both acquisitions allocate fair values to assets and liabilities, with intangible assets and goodwill being primary components. The scale and complexity differ significantly, with ClickSoftware showing a detailed and extensive asset profile, whereas Salesforce.org's fair value allocation is simpler and smaller in scope.\n\n![The table lists various assets and liabilities along with their fair values, emphasizing the detailed valuation in the ClickSoftware acquisition](image5)"}

As outlined in the provided quotes, the evaluation primarily hinges on two critical metrics: **consolidated operating income** and **share price volatility**. \n\nThe **consolidated operating income**—which represents the company's profitability—accounts for **50%** of the evaluation weight [7], [11], [12]. The method involves assessing whether Toyota attains its target income levels, with a set reference value of 1 trillion yen, and examining the degree to which current income meets or surpasses this benchmark. In the current fiscal year, a result of 150% indicates high performance relative to the target, positively impacting remuneration assessments [7], [11].\n\nSimultaneously, **share price volatility** also holds a **50%** weight in the evaluation framework. This criterion measures the stability and attractiveness of Toyota’s stock relative to the market, specifically comparing Toyota's share price against the Nikkei average at the end of the last fiscal year [7], [11], [12]. Lower volatility and higher relative stock performance signal shareholder confidence and effective management, which contribute favorably to executive compensation evaluations.\n\nThe evaluation process involves a **quantitative assessment** where achieving or exceeding the target indicators (like the 150% operating income and favorable share price stability) enhances the likelihood of higher remuneration. Conversely, underperformance or increased share price volatility may result in lower evaluations [7], [11].\n\nFurthermore, qualitative aspects like **individual performance evaluation** also factor into the process, emphasizing efforts and contributions toward sustained growth and corporate value [1], [2].

The net interest yield decreased from 2.75% to 1.86%, reflecting lower interest rates. Client assets under management increased from $1.28 trillion to $1.41 trillion, driven primarily by market valuation gains despite lower net client flows [7][11][12][13].\n\nSimilarly, net income for GWIM declined substantially, from about $4.7 billion in 2019 to roughly $2.3 billion in 2020, a 57% drop. The decline was mainly due to lower revenue, reflecting reduced net interest income, decreased market-driven investment income, and lower client flows, as well as higher provisioning and expenses impacting profitability [7][12][13].\n\nIn summary, both segments experienced significant declines in net income in 2020 compared to 2019, driven largely by the adverse economic environment, decreased client activity, lower interest rates, and increased credit provisions. Revenue also fell, with Consumer Banking especially impacted by reduced client activity and loan origination declines, while GWIM faced lower interest yields and investment income.\n\n---\n\n![Financial performance decline in 2020](image7)"}

According to the data, the company recognized restructuring charges of **$25 million** in 2020, primarily related to severance and benefits for the Embedded Processing business [11]. These charges are reflected as a specific expense line item and directly reduce operating profit, which in 2020 was **$1,813 million** in the fourth quarter alone (see interleaved quarter-by-quarter data), and contribute to the overall operating expenses. \n\nCompared to 2019, the company incurred a **$36 million** restructuring credit due to the sale of a manufacturing facility in Scotland, which effectively provided a reduction in expenses and positively influenced operating profit [9]. This implies that in 2019, restructuring activities slightly improved or mitigated expenses, contrasting with the more recent year’s additional charges in 2020.\n\nFurthermore, these restructuring charges affect net income, as they are deducted from operating profit before tax considerations. In 2020, restructuring costs contributed to a reduction in net income **$1,688 million** in the fourth quarter, whereas in 2019, the absence of such charges (or the presence of credits) helped maintain higher income levels, with net income in Q4 being **$1,070 million**.\n\nThe restructuring charges are also reflected in changes in liabilities and accruals, as detailed in the restructuring balance accounts, which showed an increase leading to a balance of **$18 million** at year's end 2020 [4, 12]. These adjustments impact the overall financial position and future cash flows.\n\nIn summary, the 2020 restructuring charges increased expenses by **$25 million**, negatively impacting operating profit and net income, whereas in 2019, restructuring activities either contributed positively or were less burdensome, with a **$36 million** credit improving profitability during that year.\n\n![Restructuring charges and their impact on financial statements](image4)"}

This change reflects a combination of factors, as shown in the detailed comprehensive income table.\n\nA key contributor was the substantial positive foreign currency translation adjustments, which improved from a loss of $632 million in 2018 to a gain of nearly $2.9 billion in 2020 [5, image7]. This gain indicates favorable currency translation effects during 2020, reversing prior losses. Additionally, the company benefited from increased net earnings, which rose from about $2.7 billion in 2018 to roughly $3.6 billion in 2020, driven by higher sales, acquisitions like Cytiva, and gains from asset sales [1,6].\n\nFurthermore, other comprehensive income components such as unrealized gains on securities and cash flow hedge adjustments contributed positively in 2020. Notably, the unrealized gain on available-for-sale securities remained minimal, but the positive impact of foreign currency translation adjustments had the largest effect on overall comprehensive income growth. The net change in comprehensive income includes these cumulative effects, leading to the growth from approximately $2.0 billion in 2018 to $6.3 billion in 2020 [5, image7].\n\nIn essence, the dramatic improvement in Danaher’s comprehensive income over these years was mainly driven by favorable foreign currency translation adjustments and higher net earnings, supplemented by gains from asset divestitures and acquisitions.\n\n![The table displays accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) from 2018 to 2020, showing large gains in 2020 driven primarily by currency translation adjustments](image7)"}

For example, one table notes a significant COVID relief initiative which collected over ₹1,500 crore from retail and corporate customers (as per [12]). These projects are implemented across multiple states including Maharashtra, Kerala, Rajasthan, Gujarat, and others, often through various agencies or directly, depending on the project. Implementation modes vary; some are directly executed by organizations, while others are through specialized agencies with CSR registration numbers, especially for localized healthcare and relief activities (e.g., \"Setu Charitable Trust\" or \"Mumbai Police Foundation\") [7], [8], [8].\n\nIn contrast, Rural Development Projects under the HRDP (Human Resource Development Program) show more region-specific, long-term development efforts, often in rural districts of states like Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar, Odisha, Punjab, etc. The total amount spent on these projects, as detailed in multiple tables, runs into hundreds of crores (for example, total expenditure noted as ₹444.72 crore across some tables). These projects tend to involve larger sums allocated over Districts and states, focusing on rural infrastructure, education, and livelihood activities. \n\nRegarding project implementation modes, a clear difference emerges: \n- Many COVID Relief projects are carried out directly by the organizations or through registered agencies (evident in projects which specify direct implementation). For instance, projects with agencies like \"Setu Charitable Trust\" or \"National Health and Education Society\" explicitly mention their CSR registration numbers [7], [8].\n- Conversely, a majority of Rural Development Projects are implemented through external agencies rather than directly by the parent organization, often with specified CSR registration numbers but marked as \"No\" for direct implementation [5], [6]. The distribution suggests that rural development projects generally rely on external agencies to execute initiatives at district or state levels.\n\nIn summary, **COVID Relief projects are more dispersed, often urgent, and tend to involve both direct and agency-led implementation modes based on project scope**. **Rural Development Projects tend to be more structured, regionally focused, with larger financial commitments, and predominantly executed through external agencies rather than direct implementation**. This reflects the different strategic approaches: immediate crisis response versus long-term rural upliftment.\n\n![COVID-19 relief activities, like distribution of masks, medicines, and community kitchens, involve direct outreach but also rely on agencies for large-scale implementation](image8)"}

The net income was approximately $12,559 million in 2018, decreased to roughly $7,353 million in 2019, and further declined to about $7,175 million in 2020, indicating a downward trend in profitability attributable directly to shareholders [6][6]. \n\nAnalyzing comprehensive income figures, which include net income plus other comprehensive (loss)/income items, there was a different pattern. In 2018, comprehensive income was about $10,497 million; it decreased to roughly $8,172 million in 2019, and lowered further to approximately $5,999 million in 2020 [1] (combined with the comprehensive income table).

Since the discount rate increased slightly from 1.5% in 2020 to 1.7% in 2021 (image2), this would have contributed to a decrease in the DBO due to the higher discount rate reducing the present value of future obligations.\n\nMoreover, in 2021, the total actuarial gains and losses amounted to a decrease of €22 million [4], driven mainly by changes in financial assumptions, which include discount rates, as well as experience gains and demographic assumptions. Notably, the change in financial assumptions contributed a significant loss of €26 million in 2021 compared to a gain of €72 million in 2020, implying that market conditions or assumptions about financial variables like interest rates and market prices impacted the obligation.\n\nLooking at demographic assumptions, changes such as mortality rates and other demographic projections also affected the obligations. For instance, a 10% reduction in mortality rates would increase the obligation by €110 million as of September 30, 2021, indicating that mortality assumptions are crucial for assessing long-term liabilities [4].\n\nFinally, the plan assets increased from €2,813 million in 2020 to €3,259 million in 2021, partly due to market value changes in asset classes like equity securities, fixed income, and alternative investments (images 6). The asset development suggests positive market performance and strategic asset-liability management, which better matched the liabilities amidst changing assumptions.\n\nIn summary, the slight increase in discount rates from 2020 to 2021 helped reduce the present value of obligations, while financial and demographic assumption changes contributed to actuarial gains or losses. The overall impact was a recognition of actuarial losses of €22 million in 2021, reflecting the nuanced influence of updated assumptions and market conditions on both the DBO and plan assets.\n\n![The table provides detailed financial data related to defined benefit plans, including the effects of actuarial assumptions such as discount rates, compensation increases, and mortality rates.](image1)"}

According to the data, the total RWA decreased from $453,106 million in 2019 to $445,151 million in 2020, a reduction of approximately 1.7%. This decline was primarily driven by reductions in credit risk RWA, which fell from $342,684 million to $284,930 million (a decrease of about 17%), and operational risk RWA, which decreased by about 7.6% under the advanced approach. Conversely, market risk RWA slightly increased but remained relatively stable. \n\n![The balance of risk components affecting total RWA shows a reduction in credit risk and operational risk, leading to lower overall RWAs in 2020](image3)  \n\nDespite this overall decrease in RWA, the External TLAC in dollar terms increased from $196,888 million in 2019 to $216,129 million in 2020, indicating an absolute increase of around 10%. More notably, the TLAC as a percentage of RWA rose dramatically from approximately 49.9% in 2019 to 47.7% in 2020, reflecting a slight decrease in this ratio owing to the larger proportional increase in TLAC relative to the reduction in RWA. This means that although RWA decreased, the firm increased its TLAC holdings in absolute terms, maintaining a high ratio and thereby strengthening its loss-absorbing capacity relative to its RWA.\n\n![Comparison shows that despite a decrease in RWA, the firm increased its TLAC in dollars, slightly reducing the percentage of TLAC relative to RWA](image7)  \n\nIn summary, the decrease in RWA components—especially credit and operational risks—was outweighed by the increased external TLAC amount, which caused the TLAC as a percentage of RWA to slightly decline from about 49.9% in 2019 to 47.7% in 2020.

This stability reflects the company's resilient performance in its largest market, supported by its flexible operating model and strong drive-thru presence.\n\nIn contrast, the International Operated Markets segment saw a more significant decline, with revenues decreasing by 17% from $11,462 million in 2019 to $9,462 million in 2020, excluding currency translation impacts [4]. The decline was driven by widespread restaurant closures, limited operations, and sales declines in key markets such as the U.K., France, Germany, Italy, and Spain, as shown by a -15% change in same-store sales excluding currency effects [5,10,12]. Despite positive performance in markets like Australia, overall revenue momentum was negatively affected by the pandemic's restrictions.\n\nMoreover, the revenue composition shifted slightly; the U.S. remained the dominant contributor with around 40% of total revenues, whereas the International Operated Markets' share declined due to the sharper decrease in their revenues. Currency translation effects also played a role, with some markets experiencing unfavorable exchange rate impacts that exacerbated the decline [4,5,7].\n\nOperationally, these changes were influenced by factors such as restaurant closures, restrictions on dine-in services, and safety-related expenses, which affected sales volumes—especially in Europe and parts of Asia. The company's franchise-based model provided some stability in franchised revenue streams, but overall, the pandemic caused a significant revenue contraction, especially in international markets with stricter lockdowns.\n\n**In summary**: From 2019 to 2020, McDonald’s U.S. revenues remained stable with minimal decline, buoyed by a resilient operational model, while the International Operated Markets experienced a steeper revenue decrease driven by COVID-19-related closures and restrictions, with currency effects further impacting these trends."}

Simultaneously, the net value of solar energy systems slightly decreased from $6,138 million in 2019 to $5,979 million in 2020, reflecting the impact of that depreciation and other capital changes.\n\nHere's an interleaved view with the relevant visuals:  \n![The table of asset categories shows total tangible assets increasing from $14.13 billion in 2019 to $17.86 billion in 2020, but after subtracting accumulated depreciation of $3.73 billion in 2019 and $5.12 billion in 2020, the net value is $10.4 billion in 2019 and $12.75 billion in 2020](image3).  \nThe property, plant, and equipment (PP&E) including machinery, tools, and land, also experienced increased accumulation of depreciation, rising from $483 million in 2019 to $816 million in 2020. Even as the gross value of PP&E rose from approximately $7.17 billion to $8.49 billion, the accumulated depreciation gaining $333 million results in the net PP&E increasing from about $6.68 billion to $7.67 billion.  \n![The image depicting financial data of assets shows total net assets rising, but the increases are tempered by depreciation costs](image3).  \n\nIn summary, the rising accumulated depreciation from 2019 to 2020 reduced the net values of the solar energy systems and PP&E, offsetting some of the asset value growth from new investments and construction. The depreciation expense systematically decreases the book value of these assets over time, aligning asset valuation with their usage and wear. Therefore, accumulated depreciation negatively impacted the net value of solar energy systems and property, plant, and equipment, contributing to a lower net carrying amount in 2020 compared to the gross asset increases."}

As shown in the financial data, the company’s net income increased gradually over these years from $4,214,594 in 2018 to $5,185,313 in 2020, boosting retained earnings which form a core part of shareholders' equity. The net income directly adds to the equity through retained earnings, as evident from the 2020 figure where net income contributed over $5.1 billion to equity.\n\nMoreover, comprehensive income—comprising foreign currency translation adjustments, gains or losses from defined benefit plans, cash flow hedges, and investments—also impacted the total equity, often offsetting some of the effects of net income depending on whether the components were positive or negative. For example, in 2020, Accenture experienced a positive $278,740 in other comprehensive income attributable to shareholders, which, when combined with net income, increased overall equity.\n\nThe detailed equity table (Image 4) shows these effects manifest in changes like the increase in accumulated other comprehensive loss or income and adjustments due to share repurchases, dividends, and share-based compensation. From 2018 to 2020, the total shareholders’ equity grew from approximately $14.7 billion to about $17.5 billion, reflecting the combined influence of consistent net income growth and fluctuations in other comprehensive income components.\n\nThe contribution of cumulative net income increases and positive comprehensive income components over these years drove the overall growth in shareholders' equity, indicating a steady enhancement of the company's financial strength.\n\n**In summary:**\n- Net income contributed directly to increasing retained earnings and shareholders’ equity, with consistent growth each year.\n- Other comprehensive income components added to or deducted from equity depending on whether they were gains or losses.\n- Overall, these income components, along with capital transactions and dividends, shaped the upward trend in Accenture's total shareholders' equity from 2018 to 2020."}

According to the provided data, WFAM's assets under management (AUM) experienced a substantial decrease due to the sale finalized on November 1, 2021, as detailed in the quotes and confirmed by the table images.\n\nPrior to the sale, WFAM managed a considerable amount of assets, including money market funds and other managed assets, totaling approximately $603 billion at the start of 2021, with inflows of $69.3 billion, outflows of $96.8 billion, and a market impact adding about $11.6 billion [5]. The sale, which resulted in a net reduction of about $587 billion, drastically lowered WFAM's AUM, as indicated by the end-of-period balance of $16.4 billion in December 2021 (deduced from the substantial outflows and sale impact data).\n\nThis reduction in WFAM's AUM meant that assets previously managed under WFAM—such as mutual funds and institutional accounts—were no longer included in Wells Fargo's consolidated assets following the sale. The impact is observable in the balance sheet data: total assets decreased modestly by $16.2 billion from 2020 to 2021, which aligns with the sale of WFAM, as assets under management were transitioned out of the company's balance sheet [2, 3, 12].\n\nFurthermore, the sale contributed to the decline in assets like 'Assets under management' by removing a significant portion of managed assets, impacting asset-based fee revenues and the composition of asset classes, including equity and fixed income securities managed or administered by Wells Fargo. As management noted, AUM is a useful metric for evaluating potential fee generation; thus, its decrease signifies a shift away from fee-based income derived from WFAM-managed assets.\n\nIn summary, the sale of WFAM assets in 2021 caused a notable reduction in the managed assets on Wells Fargo’s balance sheet, leading to a decrease in total assets and a change in the asset composition, reflecting the company's strategic move to divest from asset management in that year."}

Initially, the company concentrated on establishing a strong presence within Australia and its neighboring regions, as evidenced by its rapid growth in store counts globally, increasing from 250 in 2016 to 435 in 2020 [1, image1]. A strategic emphasis has been placed on opening stores in high-traffic, premium locations, which can be quickly marketable due to their homogenized store sizes (around 50 square metres), enabling a typical fit-out in approximately 14 days, facilitating rapid expansion [8].\n\nThroughout this period, Lovisa expanded successfully into diverse international markets, opening 47 stores outside Australia, including in the UK, France, the US, and supporting franchised outlets in Middle Eastern countries [9, image2]. This demonstrates a deliberate rollout plan that capitalizes on large, attractive markets with a proven capability to operate profitably abroad. The strategy also involves cautious exploration of new markets through pilot programs, with the flexibility to accelerate or delay entry based on regional conditions, such as the global COVID-19 pandemic’s impact on retail leasing and travel restrictions [12].\n\nKey achievements include consistent international expansion, with a steady increase in store numbers, successful penetration into mature markets, and achievement of profitable operations internationally, demonstrated by established store portfolios outside Australia and New Zealand. Lovisa's ability to identify prime site locations with high pedestrian traffic further underpins its expansion success. The company has also focused on streamlining its supply chain to support growth, notably moving over 56% of products through its China warehouse, and optimizing existing store performances by closing underperforming outlets [10, 11].\n\nHowever, challenges have arisen, such as intense industry competition, low barriers to entry for new players, and risks associated with currency fluctuations, supply chain disruptions, and changing customer preferences [2]. The impact of COVID-19 has also introduced volatility, making flexible market entry strategies crucial. Despite these obstacles, Lovisa's strategic focus on rapid international expansion, supported by targeted marketing and optimized store networks, has allowed it to adapt and continue growing its global footprint during this period.\n\nIn conclusion, from 2016 to 2020, Lovisa's international expansion evolved from primarily domestic growth to a robust, multi-region global presence, marked by strategic store placement, agile market entry, and a focus on operational efficiencies—key achievements that have been balanced against industry competition and external challenges like the COVID-19 pandemic."}

Specifically, the net interest income for 2020 was $27.6 billion, down $2.9 billion or 9.5% compared to 2019 [9]. The total interest expense also declined, notably due to lower market interest rates impacting various liabilities, such as customer deposits and debt securities, as shown in the detailed liabilities table [6].\n\nAs a result of lower net interest income, the net operating income fell substantially, contributing to reduced profitability. The total operating income, which includes net interest income and other revenues, was impacted by the lower interest income derived from decreased yields on assets like AIEA, driven by subdued interest rates globally [4][2]. Despite growth in average interest-earning assets, such as short-term funds and loans, the yield decline substantially narrowed income from these assets, as reflected in the lower interest income figures.\n\nThe impact is visually supported by the significant drop in net interest income in 2020, which directly reduces the core earnings of the organization, and the decrease in interest expense—while beneficial—was not enough to offset the decline in interest income from lower yields. This combination led to a reduction in overall profitability, evidenced by the fall in net income and return metrics such as RoTE, which dropped sharply to 3.1% from higher levels in prior years [1].\n\nThe interrelation between these elements shows that the organization’s operational profitability was adversely affected primarily by the downward pressure on interest rates, reducing income from interest-earning assets, and the decrease in net interest income that could not be fully offset by the reduction in interest expense or other income sources. Consequently, this resulted in a lower net operating income, reflecting diminished overall profitability during 2020 amidst the challenging economic environment.\n\n![Interest Income and Expenses Table shows lower interest income in 2020, leading to reduced net interest income and impacting overall profitability](image1)"}

As shown in the data, this decrease was primarily driven by a significant drop in interest and other investment income, which fell by 44.4% ($470 million) due to lower income from short-term investments and fixed maturity securities, partly because of prolonged low interest rates that prevailed through 2021 [6]. Conversely, dividend income increased modestly by 3.5% ($170 million), but this did not fully offset the decline in interest income, leading to an overall reduction in net investment income [6].\n\nIn contrast, railroad operating earnings saw a substantial increase from $5,161 million in 2020 to $7,903 million in 2021, representing a growth of about 52.8%. This growth was primarily driven by higher revenues, which increased by 11.6%, and an increase in operating income before taxes. The revenue growth reflected higher volumes (6.9%) and a 3.5% rise in average revenue per car/unit, fueled by increased freight volumes and higher fuel surcharge revenue due to rising fuel prices.

This change is aimed at better aligning the division with customer needs and market dynamics, streamlining its management and operational focus [6].  \n\n![Organization chart showing the company's governance structure including the CEO Roche Group, CEOs of Pharmaceuticals and Diagnostics, and key executives](image6)  \n\nThe management of Roche’s divisions is overseen by an executive governance structure that includes the Corporate Executive Committee and its enlarged version. The top leadership involves the CEO of Roche Group, Dr. Severin Schwan, who has been leading the entire organization since 2008. Also, crucial executives managing Roche’s divisions include the CEOs of Pharmaceuticals and Diagnostics—Bill Anderson and Dr. Thomas Schinecker, respectively—both of whom have been in their roles since 2019 [8].\n\n![Infographic detailing the composition of a Board of Directors including nationalities, gender, age, and tenure distribution](image2)  \n\nFurther, the company’s governance includes various committees—such as the Audit, Remuneration, and Corporate Governance and Sustainability Committees—that involve members like André Hoffmann, Vice-Chairman, and Dr. Jörg Duschmalé, a member of the Audit Committee, who have responsibilities related to strategic oversight and risk management [3],[9].  \n\nIn summary, Roche has transitioned its Diagnostics division from a structure based on specific business functions to a more customer-oriented segmentation, under the strategic guidance of key executives like the CEO of Roche Group, Dr. Severin Schwan, and division-specific leaders, ensuring integrated management across its core divisions."}

However, during FY20, S Fallscheer purchased an additional 1,687,764 shares, increasing their total holdings from 4,140,000 to 5,827,764 shares by 28 June 2020, reflecting an active reinforcement of their stake in the company (see table in [7] and [8]).\n\nIn terms of remuneration, S Fallscheer's compensation includes short-term employment benefits, performance-based payments, and share-based payments. The detailed figures from the remuneration table indicate that during FY20, their remuneration included a combination of salary, bonuses, and share-based incentives, although specific figures for FY20 are not explicitly isolated in the quotes. However, the data suggests that their long-term incentives, through grants and vested rights (see [4] and [5]), were substantial, with multiple grants awarded over the years, vesting during FY20 (see [4], [5], and [8]).\n\nThe implications of these changes suggest that S Fallscheer has increased their stake in the company, potentially aligning their interests more closely with shareholder value. The significant shareholdings combined with long-term incentives can motivate enhanced performance, and the reinforcement of shareholding may also signal confidence in the company's prospects. Financially, this indicates a positive stance towards the company's growth, and increased shareholding could impact the company's share price and investor confidence, especially if accompanied by performance improvements.\n\n![The large shareholding and active purchasing behavior of S Fallscheer, including their increased share numbers and vested incentives, highlight a committed oversight and belief in the company's long-term value](image8).\n\nIn summary, from FY19 to FY20, S Fallscheer increased their shareholding through additional acquisitions and shifted from forfeited rights to accumulated shares, while their remuneration reflected ongoing incentives and rewards tied to performance, ultimately bolstering their financial position and alignment with shareholder interests."}

Notably, primarily service costs—covering content royalties, creator fees, and content delivery—constituted the bulk of this increase, as depicted in image6, which details service costs jumping from RMB 14,967 million in 2019 to RMB 18,992 million in 2021. These increases indicate higher expenditures on content and infrastructure to support expanding service offerings.\n\n![Service costs rose significantly over the years, pointing towards increased content acquisition and delivery expenses](image6)\n\nMeanwhile, **operating expenses**, particularly **selling and marketing expenses**, grew from RMB 2,041 million in 2019 to RMB 2,678 million in 2021, a moderate increase primarily aimed at user acquisition and brand promotion, as per data in images 2 and 3. Interestingly, **general and administrative expenses**, which include salaries, professional services, and R&D costs, grew more substantially—from RMB 2,703 million in 2019 to RMB 4,009 million in 2021—suggesting intensified investments in R&D, management, and infrastructural overheads.\n\n![Administrative expenses increased notably, indicating heightened focus on R&D and management](image2, [6], [10])\n\nMoreover, looking at the **operating expenses as a percentage of total operating costs**, there was a slight shift: in 2019, selling and marketing accounted for 43%, and G&A for 57%; by 2021, selling and marketing were about 40%, while G&A rose to 60%, implying a shift towards administrative and R&D focus.\n\nThe increasing expenses, especially in R&D and content-related costs, suggest that the company is investing heavily in expanding its technological capabilities, content library, and user engagement channels, which could be part of a strategic effort to enhance competitive advantage. The growth in content costs and R&D also indicates a commitment to innovation but raises concerns about cost efficiency if revenue growth does not keep pace (which, according to images 1 and 3, has been steady but moderate).\n\nIn terms of overall financial management, this pattern implies that the company is prioritizing long-term growth through significant investments in content, technology, and brand promotion, which is typical for technology and content-driven firms aiming to capture more market share. While operating expenses are rising, they seem aligned with revenue growth, and the company's management likely views these as necessary to sustain competitiveness and future profitability.\n\n**In summary**, from 2019 to 2021, the company's cost structure shifted towards increased investment in content, R&D, and administrative capabilities. This indicates an aggressive growth strategy focused on strengthening core assets and technological innovation, with associated higher operating expenses reflecting proactive financial management aimed at long-term expansion."}

Similarly, the NGL prices in the U.S. grew from 35.85 USD per barrel in 2019 to about 39.69 USD per barrel in 2020, showing an upward trend in NGL value.\n\nLooking at Canada/Other Americas, the crude oil prices went from approximately 66.93 USD per barrel in 2019 to around 68.92 USD in 2020, again showing growth. The NGL prices followed suit, increasing from 36.34 USD to 39.69 USD per barrel, suggesting a positive price movement for both commodities.  \n![Crude oil and NGL prices in North America](image3)\n\nIn Europe, the crude oil prices rose from 54.85 USD in 2019 to about 54.85 USD in 2020—indicating stability or slight increase.

The noncurrent assets increased from $113,767 million in 2019 to $116,806 million in 2020, reflecting an addition of approximately $3 billion, as indicated by the increase in noncurrent assets [image8]. This growth could be driven by acquisitions or investments in long-term assets, potentially underpinning future growth strategies.\n\nSimultaneously, IBM’s long-term debt rose slightly from $54,102 million in 2019 to $54,355 million in 2020 [image8], indicating a modest increase that might have been used to finance asset acquisitions or refinance existing obligations. However, at the same time, IBM's total debt decreased from $62,899 million in 2019 to $61,538 million in 2020, primarily due to early debt retirements and maturities [image6]. This suggests a focus on debt reduction, which would positively influence its leverage ratios and creditworthiness.\n\nCash flow data show an overall positive net change in cash, with net cash provided by operating activities increasing from $14,770 million in 2019 to $18,197 million in 2020 [image5], indicating stronger core operations. Conversely, cash used in investing activities was significantly reduced from a substantial outflow of $(26,936) million in 2019 to $(3,028) million in 2020, implying decreased investment outflows, possibly due to fewer acquisitions or asset purchases.\n\nRegarding equity, total equity decreased slightly from $2,749 million in 2019 to $2,352 million in 2020 [image4], mainly because of dividends paid and currency translation effects [text], which somewhat offset the positive contributions from net income and stock issuance.\n\nIn summary, the increase in noncurrent assets alongside controlled debt levels and improved operating cash flows suggest that IBM strengthened its investment base and optimized its capital structure. The slight decline in equity reflects typical distributions and currency impacts but does not overshadow the overall improvement in liquidity and asset position, thereby maintaining or enhancing IBM’s financial stability."}

Purchases also declined sharply from $277.9 billion to $251.6 billion, a 9.4% drop, mainly driven by reduced spending in travel and entertainment sectors, as evidenced by lower client activity and the effects of COVID-19 restrictions [10][11].\n\n![The credit card purchase volumes decreased from 277.9 billion in 2019 to 251.6 billion in 2020, reflecting reduced consumer spending during the pandemic](image7)\n\nConversely, home equity balances fell from $11.13 billion to $8.16 billion overall, with first-lien balances dropping from $72.5 billion to $69.1 billion and outstanding balances in second- or junior-lien positions where the bank also held the first lien decreasing to $5.9 billion [1][2][7]. This decline indicates that many consumers likely paid down their home equity lines or drew less on their existing credit, possibly due to reduced home equity lending activity or financial caution during uncertain economic times.\n\n![The home equity portfolio overall declined from 11.1 billion to 8.2 billion, indicating reduced borrowing or increased repayment by consumers](image2)\n\nIn summary, the reductions in both credit card spending and home equity balances suggest consumers were more cautious, spending less on discretionary items, delaying new borrowings, and paying down existing debts during 2020. This behavior aligns with the economic uncertainties brought about by the pandemic, leading to tighter credit activity and more conservative consumer financial management.\n\n**In conclusion**, between 2019 and 2020, consumer borrowing and spending in both credit card and home equity segments decreased, indicating a shift toward greater financial caution and reduced consumer engagement in credit activities during that period."}

For instance, a US$1 per tonne increase in metallurgical coal prices can boost profit after taxation by approximately US$24 million and underlying EBITDA by US$35 million [5].\n\nIn the case of coal, the report highlights that the unit costs are expected to rise due to higher diesel prices and increased stripping requirements, which could impact profitability if prices do not sufficiently increase [3]. The prices for thermal and metallurgical coal have decreased, with the average realised prices dropping from $130.97 per tonne in 2020 to $106.64 in 2021 for metallurgical coal, contributing to lower revenues and EBITDA [6, 8].\n\nNickel's market is also notably volatile; the report mentions that higher prices and volumes led to a US$296 million increase in Underlying EBITDA for Nickel West, reflecting the sensitivity of nickel revenues to price changes [9]. A US¢1 increase in nickel price impacts profit after taxation and EBITDA by US$1 million each, demonstrating the marginal but consistent effect of nickel prices on financial results.\n\nThe key drivers behind these impacts include: (1) fluctuations in market prices due to global economic and geopolitical factors, (2) demand and supply dynamics in commodities, and (3) foreign currency exchange rates that can alter the realised prices since most sales are in US dollars but costs are partly in local currencies [4, 5].\n\n![Impact of commodity price changes on financial results](image5)  \n*The table details the specific US$ million impacts of commodity price variations on profit after taxation and EBITDA for oil, copper, iron ore, coal, and nickel.*\n\nIn summary, rising commodity prices tend to improve BHP's financial results, while declines exert downward pressure, with key impacts mediated by market dynamics, costs, and currency movements."}

This decrease was primarily due to factors such as lower interest rates, reduced loan balances stemming from soft demand, and higher securities premium amortization, as well as the sale of certain loan portfolios, notably the student loan portfolio [7]. Conversely, noninterest income markedly increased from approximately $4.92 billion in 2020 to around $10.04 billion in 2021, an increase of about $5.12 billion or 104%. The rise was driven by higher gains on equity securities, mortgage banking income, and asset-based fee income, although offset by some lower gains in other areas [2][9].\n\nDespite the steep decline in net interest income, the substantial growth in noninterest income led to a considerable overall increase in total revenue, which went from about $5.36 billion in 2020 to approximately $8.50 billion in 2021 — an increase of roughly $3.14 billion or 59%.

This specific figure highlights Apple's significance within Berkshire Hathaway's investment portfolio, functioning as its second-largest holding after BNSF, which is an operational subsidiary rather than an equity investment.\n\nSupporting this, the quote about equity investments [8] notes that Berkshire's total market value of equity securities was about **$350.7 billion**, with multiple holdings contributing to this total. Among these, Apple stands out as a major individual investment based on market value, as its valuation in 2021 was substantially higher than other individual holdings such as Kraft Heinz or Pilot.\n\nFurthermore, the comparison table [10] indicates Berkshire’s cumulative stock gains since 2016, reflecting impressive growth driven by key holdings like Apple.

This rebound in net income likely supported ongoing dividend payments, especially considering the January 2022 board decision to raise the quarterly dividend to $0.25 per share, indicating confidence in the company's stability. The report also mentions that Wells Fargo issued new common stock and repurchased shares, actions that can influence the Book Value.\n\nRegarding the **Dividend Payout Ratio**, although exact ratios are not provided, the increase in net income and the company's decision to raise dividends suggest a positive trend or at least a maintained payout ratio after the 2020 downturn due to the pandemic.\n\nFor **Book Value**, the data shows that total equity increased from approximately an unspecified amount in 2019 to higher levels in 2020 and 2021, supported by retained earnings and capital management strategies.

Starting with the data on October 1, 2019, the equity was composed of issued capital, capital reserves, retained earnings, and other comprehensive income elements such as currency translation differences and reserves for equity instruments and hedges.\n\nFundamentally, the **issued capital** increased from €1,075 million on October 1, 2019, to €1,128 million by September 30, 2021, primarily due to multiple capital increases, including the one resolved upon in March 2021, when 53 million new shares were issued through partial utilization of authorized capital. This increase in share capital was aligned with issuances at different times and prices, such as placing shares with institutional investors at €36.40 and €44.10 per share, which augmented the company's equity base [12], [9].\n\nIn addition, **capital reserves** experienced substantial growth, rising by €2,284 million after the March 2021 capital increase, which was part of financing an acquisition (notably Varian). This boost in reserves, alongside the rise in issued capital, significantly enhanced total equity and reflects strategic capital raising efforts.\n\nThe overall **total equity attributable to shareholders** expanded from approximately €12,498 million in 2020 to €16,321 million by September 30, 2021. This increase was not only from new share issuances but also from net income earned during the period (€1,746 million in 2021), which contributed to retained earnings, as well as positive other comprehensive income components like currency translation differences (€724 million in 2021). \n\nFurthermore, movements in \"Other comprehensive income\" illustrate increased reserves from currency translation (€724 million in 2021) and gains from equity instruments and hedging activities. Notably, currency translation differences substantially contributed to overall comprehensive income, reflecting exchange rate fluctuations affecting the company's international operations.\n\nShare repurchases, like the buyback of approximately 1.9 million shares for €105 million, reduced the treasury shares (held as assets), but overall, the company's strategic issuance of shares and retained earnings led to a net increase in total equity.\n\nIn summary, from October 1, 2019, to September 30, 2021, the equity components of Siemens Healthineers AG experienced notable growth driven by issuance of new shares, capital reserves increases from strategic financing activities, and accumulated net income and translation gains, culminating in a substantial rise in total equity attributable to shareholders, from around €12.5 billion to over €16.3 billion.\n\n![Equity components evolution from 2019 to 2021](image6)"}

Specifically, interest expense rose from approximately $(59.7)$ million in 2014 to $(64.2)$ million in 2015, representing an 8% increase [12]. This indicates a higher interest burden in 2015, likely due to increased total debt, as noted in the financial descriptions [1].\n\nThe rise in interest expense contributed to a more negative overall non-operating income (expense). Total non-operating income (expense), which includes interest expense, decreased from $(51.3)$ million in 2014 to $(29.3)$ million in 2015 — a significant improvement in the negative impact, with a 43% reduction in net expense [12]. However, since interest expense increased, this suggests that other components within non-operating income, such as interest and other income (expense), net, must have also improved sufficiently to offset the higher interest costs.\n\nIndeed, interest and other income (expense), net increased markedly from $7.3 million in 2014 to $33.9 million in 2015, indicating that gains from investments and other income sources offset much of the rise in interest expense. This improvement helped reduce the overall net non-operating expense, lessening the negative impact on the company's bottom line despite higher interest costs [12], [8].\n\nIn summary, while the net interest expense grew from 2014 to 2015, its impact on total non-operating income (expense) was mitigated by substantial gains in interest and other income, resulting in a reduced net non-operating expense overall."}

For example, the total AOCL was affected by currency translation effects—shown by positive or negative adjustments—and by gains or losses on derivatives, pension obligations, and other comprehensive items. The balances in each component changed as a result of remeasurements, settlements, and tax impacts, ultimately altering the total AOCL at the end of each year. While precise numeric differences are not explicitly provided in the quotes, the overall trend indicates that these components grew or reduced due to the marked adjustments and reclassifications within each fiscal year.\n\nRegarding property and equipment (PP&E), data from the table for August 31, 2019, and August 31, 2020, shows an increase in gross values and accumulated depreciation, leading to higher net PP&E balances. Buildings and land slightly increased from $56 million in 2019 to $61 million in 2020. Computers, related equipment, and software rose significantly from approximately $1.72 billion to $1.98 billion, and leasehold improvements grew from $1.23 billion to $1.42 billion. Total gross PP&E increased from about $3.35 billion to $3.86 billion, while accumulated depreciation also rose from approximately $1.96 billion to $2.31 billion, resulting in a net property and equipment value increasing from roughly $1.39 billion in 2019 to $1.55 billion in 2020.\n\nIn summary, between 2019 and 2020, the components of accumulated other comprehensive loss underwent changes driven by currency, pension, and hedging adjustments, affecting the total AOCL. Meanwhile, property and equipment values increased across most categories due to acquisitions and capital expenditures, despite higher accumulated depreciation. This reflects ongoing investment and remeasurements during those fiscal years."}

Initially, on December 31, 2018, the profit employed in the business had a certain balance, which experienced fluctuations over the two years due to various factors such as net income, dividends, and other comprehensive income components.\n\nFrom the diagram showing reconciliation, we observe that the profit employed increased or decreased based on the net profit (or loss) for each year, along with other adjustments like foreign currency translation, pension and other postretirement benefits, derivatives, securities adjustments, and dividends declared. Notably, dividends declared and certain comprehensive income items tend to reduce the profit employed, while net income and other comprehensive income items contribute to increases.\n\nSpecifically, by December 31, 2020, the profit employed in the business had grown due to accumulated net income from 2018 through 2020, adjusted by dividends paid and other comprehensive income impacts, such as translation effects and pension adjustments. Overall, this component reflects the accumulated earnings a company retains after all distributions and comprehensive income adjustments over these years, with the net change driven mainly by the profit recognized and dividends paid during this period.\n\nIn summary, the main changes in \"Profit Employed in the Business\" from December 2018 to December 2020 involved the accumulation of net income over these years, less dividends and adjustments from other comprehensive income activities, resulting in an overall increase in retained earnings by the end of 2020."}

First, the company experienced a rise in operating income from $17,493 million in 2020 to $20,817 million in 2021, which directly boosts operating cash flow [6]. Additionally, although there was an increase in depreciation and amortization expense from $13,100 million to $13,804 million—adding to cash flow—the most significant impact comes from changes in operating assets and liabilities, which improved from a $178 million outflow in 2020 to a $1,499 million outflow in 2021. This indicates better management of accounts receivable, deferred revenue, and timing of costs related to film, television, and other operations, including the broadcast of the Tokyo Olympics and the reopening of theme parks after COVID-19 restrictions [9].\n\nMoreover, the company's operating activities benefited from increased revenue streams across many segments, notably the growth in theme park revenues (up 141.2%), and improved financial management contributed to lower interest payments and taxes paid, further enhancing net operating cash flow [2], [4]. The rise in net cash from operations reflects a combination of higher revenues, effective cost management, and positive changes in working capital.\n\n![The company’s increasing cash flow was driven by higher revenues and better working capital management, resulting in a $4.4 billion increase in operating cash flow from 2020 to 2021](image8)"}

Additionally, higher sales volumes added another **$470 million** to earnings, further bolstering the segment's profitability. However, these gains were partially offset by higher operating expenses of **$150 million**.\n\nLooking at the financial data, the profit growth can also be tied to broader improvements in refining margins and increased sales and productivities that enhanced the overall margin structure of the segment.

This indicates a general growth in store count across most regions.\n\nOne key change was the increase in the number of stores in the Americas and Rest of the World, which suggests targeted expansion, possibly to penetrate emerging markets or strengthen presence in existing ones. Conversely, the distribution figures show that the proportion of stores kept in Europe remained significant but slightly adjusted, reflecting ongoing optimisation efforts.\n\nThe reasons behind these changes are multifaceted. Firstly, Inditex actively engaged in store optimisation activities, such as refurbishments and enlargements, finalised at the end of 2021, which likely improved store performance and presence [1]. Additionally, the impact of the pandemic in 2020, which heavily restricted store operations and led to a substantial store closure plan of about 1,000 to 1,200 stores [11], may have prompted strategic reevaluation of store locations. Post-pandemic, the focus has shifted toward opening new stores in more resilient or growth-oriented markets, especially in regions like the Americas and parts of Asia, where retail recovery and online integration can be better leveraged.\n\nFurthermore, the regional adaptation, such as the concentration of stores under leasing agreements in countries like Russia and Ukraine [9][10], might influence decisions based on market stability and economic considerations. The expansion into new markets and rationalisation of underperforming stores aligns with Inditex’s goal of store optimisation and adapting to changing consumer behaviors, including increased online shopping.\n\nIn summary, from 2021 to 2022, Inditex's store distribution shifted towards growth in the Americas and other global markets, driven by strategic diversification, pandemic recovery, and ongoing store optimisation efforts to maximize efficiency and market presence.\n\n![The regional distribution of stores in 2022 shows growth and strategic expansion across different markets.](image1)"}

Specifically, it decreased from 11.1% in 2019 to 10.7% in 2020, and further down to 10.2% in 2021 [2][8]. This downward trend reflects several contributing factors.\n\nOne significant factor was the reduction in interest income earned on the loans, as shown by the decline in total interest income from $8,620 million in 2019 to $7,750 million in 2021 [2][8]. This decrease was partly driven by higher paydown rates and lower revolving loan balances, which resulted in a lower interest yield on the loans [5][10].  \n\nAdditionally, the average Card Member loans slightly increased in 2021 ($76.0 billion) compared to 2020 ($74.6 billion), but still remained below the 2019 level ($82.8 billion) [2][8], which moderated the yield impact. Elevated paydown rates — meaning customers repaid their balances faster — contributed to a decline in the interest yield and net interest income, as borrowers carried smaller balances that generated less interest [5][8].\n\nFurthermore, external market interest rate fluctuations can influence the yields. The company's interest expense could change with market rates, potentially reducing net interest yield if the rate paid on deposits increases more than interest earned on loans [7]. Changes in customer behavior, such as lower lending balances during periods of higher interest rates, also contributed to the decreasing net interest yield.\n\n![The table shows the decline in net interest yield from 11.1% in 2019 to 10.7% in 2020, and further to 10.2% in 2021, driven primarily by lower interest income and higher paydowns](image2)\n\nIn summary, the primary drivers of the decreasing net interest yield on Card Member loans from 2019 through 2021 were lower interest income due to higher paydown rates and reduced loan balances, alongside external interest rate environment impacts and changes in customer borrowing behavior."}

ENBREL's sales declined slightly in 2020, decreasing by 4% globally to $4,996 million from $5,226 million in 2019, as shown in the financial data where U.S. sales fell by 4% to $4,855 million [1, 4, 5], and Canadian sales dropped sharply by 20% to $141 million [1, 4]. This downward trend is attributable to lower unit demand, reduced market share, and the impact of benefit plan changes, insurance verification challenges, and increased co-pay expenses as patients worked through deductibles, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic [4].\n\nIn contrast, Prolia's global sales increased modestly by 3% in 2020 to $2,763 million, up from $2,672 million in 2019 [2, 6]. The U.S. contributed significantly to this growth, with sales rising by 3% to $1,830 million, and the Rest of the World (ROW) saw a 4% increase to $933 million [2]. The growth in Prolia was driven by higher net selling prices and favorable inventory changes, although it was partially offset by lower unit demand [2, 6]. The pandemic disrupted demand patterns, notably in the U.S., affecting patient visits and diagnosis rates for osteoporosis, which likely tempered further growth [11].\n\nVisual evidence supports this analysis:  \n![The table showing Prolia's sales increased in 2020 in both U.S. and ROW regions](image2)  \n*Prolia's sales gradually increased, reflecting higher prices and favorable inventory adjustments despite demand fluctuations.*\n\nWhile ENBREL's decline is characterized by market share loss and competitive pressures from biosimilars approved since April 2019, legal litigations and biosimilar entries threaten its market presence [9, 10]. Conversely, Prolia's growth highlights steady demand, partially supported by increasing awareness and pricing strategies.\n\n**In summary**, ENBREL's sales declined in 2020 due to lower demand and market share erosion, compounded by biosimilar competition and pandemic-related factors, whereas Prolia's sales grew driven by pricing and inventory factors, despite some demand impacts."}

The monthly high prices hovered around the 390-397 Rs. range, while lows varied between Rs. 320 and Rs. 340, indicating moderate volatility (see **[6]** for high-low prices). Similarly, the BSE Sensex showed stability, fluctuating within a narrow range during this period.\n\nSince July 2002, GPI's stock price saw an upward movement, peaking at Rs. 420 in July, signaling increased investor confidence or positive company performance. The lows also increased slightly, maintaining an overall positive trend through September 2002. Conversely, the BSE Sensex's normalized index, represented in the line graph, fluctuated but stayed relatively close to the 100 mark, indicating stable general market conditions (see **[4]**).\n\nFrom October 2002 onward, GPI's high prices declined gradually from Rs. 415 to about Rs. 329 by March 2003, reflecting a downward trend in the stock’s highest trading prices.

Meanwhile, the BSE Sensex, as the graph indicates, moved within a similar band, showing slight fluctuations but no dramatic divergence from GPI's movement (see **[4]**).\n\nThe line graph contrasting GPI with the BSE Sensex demonstrates that during this period, GPI's stock displayed more volatility with sharper rises and falls, while the Sensex's index followed a broader, more stable pattern. In particular, GPI saw a peak around July 2002, followed by a steady decline toward March 2003, whereas the Sensex experienced minor fluctuations around the normalized baseline.\n\nIn summary, while GPI's stock showed significant short-term fluctuations—peaking mid-year and then declining—both indices moved within similar ranges, indicating that GPI's stock performance aligned loosely with overall market trends, with additional company-specific volatility. The comparison highlights that GPI's share prices had sharper swings compared to the relatively steadier movement of the Sensex over this one-year period."}

Since the net cash at the end of 2020 is \\$20.4 million and considering that the cash flows from operating activities are typically the largest component of net cash, it can be reasonably inferred that the net cash from operating activities in 2019 was lower, especially given the impacts of COVID-19 disruptions on 2020's operations.\n\nGiven these points and the general context of the reported disruptions and COVID-19 impact, **the net cash from operating activities in 2020 was higher than in 2019**.

For instance, [5] notes that all segments experienced a decrease in gross margin, with core merchandise categories seeing a 27 basis point reduction—most significantly in fresh foods—due to higher merchandise costs and a LIFO charge. Additionally, [3] explains that decreases across segments were partially offset by benefits from ceasing COVID-19 related wages and positive impacts from gasoline-related ancillary businesses. Moreover, [10] details that inflation in merchandise costs led to pricing strategies where some increases were absorbed to maintain competitiveness, which negatively impacted gross margin percentage.

Specifically, overall net interest income declined by $1,674 million, from $6,134 million in 2020 to $4,960 million in 2021 [3]. This decrease in net interest income was primarily driven by lower loan balances, weaker demand, and the lower interest rate environment, as mentioned in the highlights [4], [5].\n\nLooking at the loan segments, the balance sheet data (from the provided tables and images) shows that total loans decreased significantly from 2020 to 2021.

The total consumer nonaccrual loans, which include other consumer loans such as securities-based loans and personal lines, saw a notable rise, reflecting ongoing challenges in consumer credit quality after the pandemic impact.\n\nConversely, **commercial nonaccrual loans showed a substantial decrease**, dropping from $4,779 million in 2020 to $2,376 million in 2021 [3,8], largely driven by paydowns, foreclosures, and charge-offs, notably in oil, gas, and pipelines industries, which saw reductions in nonaccrual balances. The table and description indicate a focus on distressed commercial loans, particularly in certain sectors recovering from pandemic effects.\n\nOverall, the **largest change** was a **decrease in commercial nonaccrual loans**—over $2.4 billion—primarily due to declines in oil, gas, and pipelines industry loans, while **consumer nonaccrual loans** increased significantly by nearly $900 million, primarily due to residential mortgage issues following COVID-19 related forbearances [1,8,9].\n\n![The table displays a significant decrease in commercial nonaccrual loans and a rise in consumer nonaccrual loans between 2020 and 2021](image1)  \n\nIn summary, **the commercial sector experienced a sizeable reduction in nonaccrual loans, especially in industries affected by pandemic recovery, whereas the consumer sector, particularly residential mortgages, saw notable increases in nonaccrual loans** over the period."}

As detailed in [1], there was a decrease in product costs for 2019 compared to 2018, mainly due to the sale of the Destiny publishing rights to Bungie in December 2018, which resulted in lower associated development costs. Supporting this, [3] notes that there was a lower overall cost in product development specifically for the Destiny franchise, which directly contributed to the reduction. Interestingly, despite the decrease in expenses, there was a $25 million increase in the capitalization of development costs, primarily driven by the timing of Blizzard’s game development cycles, indicating some development activities continued but were capitalized rather than expensed ([3]).\n\nThis shift from expenses to capitalization suggests a strategic change in how development costs were recorded, possibly to defer expense recognition over the lifecycle of the game projects. Additionally, the overall decline was also influenced by reduced product costs from key franchises, most notably Destiny, Hearthstone, Call of Duty, and Overwatch, as their revenues and development activities declined or shifted, contributing to the broader cost reduction trend seen in 2019.\n\nHere is an illustration showing the components of costs and expenses, including development costs:\n\n![The table shows sales and marketing expenses for 2019 decreasing compared to 2018](image1)\n\nAnd an indication of restructuring costs rose significantly in 2019, but that was more related to restructuring activities rather than direct product development:\n\n![Restructuring and related costs increased sharply in 2019](image2)\n\nIn conclusion, the main contributors were the reduced costs associated with the Destiny franchise, resulting from selling its publishing rights, and overall lower product development expenses across the company's portfolio, partially offset by increased capitalization of development costs related to Blizzard's ongoing projects ([1], [3])."}

The consolidated cash flow statement indicates that despite challenges such as COVID-19, the company managed to generate positive net cash of $\\S20.4\\mathrm{m}$ [3], which suggests that operational cash flows contributed to maintaining or increasing parts of the company’s equity during this period.\n\nSimultaneously, examining the consolidated statement of changes in equity reveals that retained earnings increased from $43,352 in July 2018 to a higher value by June 2020, reflecting accumulated profits over this period. Specifically, the total equity rose from $45,242 (as of July 2018) to approximately $58,368 (as of June 2020) [4] [8], driven partly by retained earnings accrued from profitable operations and possibly supported by positive cash flows from operating activities.\n\nBelow is a visual depiction illustrating how the components interacted, especially emphasizing cash inflows from operations and retained earnings:\n\n![The table shows a consolidated cash flow statement comparing financial data from 2020 and 2019.

This reduction of approximately $473 million mainly stems from decreases in certain asset categories such as pension and retiree benefits (from $1,476 million to $740 million) and valuation allowances (from $(569) million to $(409) million). Also, certain other assets like capitalized R&D and inventory saw increases or decreases but the overall net effect was a decline. This reduction implies that the company has either realized some deferred tax benefits, adjusted for lower projected future taxable income, or changed its asset valuations according to recent tax positions.\n\nConversely, the total deferred tax liabilities increased from $8,503 million in 2021 to $9,288 million in 2022, an increase of approximately $785 million [7]. Notably, liabilities related to goodwill and intangible assets rose from $5,761 million to $5,783 million, and unrealized gains on financial transactions increased significantly from $111 million to $439 million. This suggests an uptick in taxable temporary differences, potentially from increased amortization or asset revaluations, impacting future taxable income.\n\nThese shifts indicate that the company’s net deferred tax position has become somewhat more tax-lazy, with increased liabilities that could lead to higher future tax payments, partially offset by decreased assets. The net expense or benefit from these adjustments influences the company's effective tax rate and cash flow planning. The increased liabilities and decreased assets could result in higher future tax outflows, thereby impacting net income and liquidity.\n\nInterleaved with the visual data, the decline in deferred tax assets and the rise in liabilities suggest management’s reassessment of future taxable income and tax strategies, which might be driven by changes in asset values, tax law impacts (such as those resulting from the U.S. Tax Act transition tax), or shifts in business operations [6][7].\n\nIn summary, the company's deferred tax assets decreased by $473 million, and liabilities increased by $785 million from 2021 to 2022. These changes reflect a cautious or strategic stance towards future tax obligations, impacting the company's overall financial health by potentially increasing future tax expenses and affecting net income and cash flow."}

Specifically, as shown in the financial table, the margins decreased from approximately 1,747 in 2018 to 1,660 in 2019, and further down to 1,158 in 2020 [6]. This indicates a consistent downward trend over the three years, primarily driven by sales declines, higher operating expenses, and other operating costs related to the challenges faced during this period.\n\nRegarding the impact of currency translation on these margins, the reconciliation table reveals that currency benefits or costs influenced the margins each year. In 2020, currency translation had a slight negative impact of 1 million on company-operated margins, which means that unfavorable currency movements reduced margins marginally. Comparing this with earlier years, in 2019, there was a more significant positive translation benefit of 51 million, while 2018 saw a smaller positive impact of 4 million [6]. This variation suggests that currency fluctuations had some influence but were not the primary driver of margin declines. The overall decrease in margins was mainly due to operational factors, though currency translation effects did either slightly offset or contribute to these changes.\n\nHere's a visual representation of the revenue distribution over the years, highlighting the segments contributing to the margins' landscape:\n\n![Pie charts of revenue segments in 2020, 2019, and 2018](image8)\n\nIn conclusion, company-operated margins decreased significantly from 2018 to 2020, with currency translation having a relatively minor and sometimes offsetting impact on these margins."}

The negative numbers indicate net benefits rather than costs, reflecting changes in assumptions, actual returns, or gains associated with pension and postretirement benefit plans.\n\nThis trend closely relates to marked-to-market gains (or losses). In particular, the **mark-to-market (losses) gains** have an inverse correlation with the Total Net Periodic Benefit Cost. For example, in 2021, there was a **mark-to-market loss of ($833) million**, which contributed to the sharp decrease in the total benefit cost, turning it negative. Similarly, in 2020, a **gain of $383 million** corresponds with a positive net benefit of $239 million, and in 2019, a **loss of $468 million** coincides with a positive overall cost of $638 million.\n\nFurthermore, the projected decrease in net periodic benefit cost in 2022 (expected to be –$121 million) suggests that positive mark-to-market effects or improved assumptions are anticipated to mitigate the costs, possibly leading to net benefits or reduced expenses.\n\nIn sum, the decreasing trend from 2019 to 2022, especially the transition into negative figures, highlights increasing favorable mark-to-market gains that offset the regular benefit costs, leading to net benefits in recent years rather than expenses."}

This suggests that early-stage investments dominated at that time, with relatively few funds progressing into later developmental phases.\n\nBy contrast, the 2007 fund exhibits a dramatic change: only about 10% of funds were allocated to Seed-stage investments, while a substantial 74% targeted the Early Stage, with Mid-Stage investments comprising 16% [2] (see image2). This indicates a clear trend toward more significant investments during the early growth phases rather than initial seed funding, reflecting perhaps a maturation of the European venture ecosystem and a preference for investing in companies with some proven progress.\n\nThis transition from predominantly seed investments to a higher proportion of early-stage funding demonstrates a strategic shift within European VC activity—from fostering very early startups to supporting companies in more advanced development stages. The data highlights how European VC funds have increasingly concentrated resources on startups closer to market expansion, aligning with broader ecosystem development and possibly reflecting improved risk management and confidence in earlier-stage companies.\n\n![The chart visually depicts this shift, with the 1998 fund heavily dominated by Seed investments—78%—which is sharply contrasted by the 2007 fund, where Seed investments fell to just 10%, and Early Stage investments surged to 74%](image2)."}

According to [1], approximately 64% of Latino registered voters identify with or lean toward the Democratic Party, compared to 33% for Republicans, a nearly two-to-one margin that has remained stable over recent years. This stability suggests that Latino voters continue to be a significant Democratic-leaning group, reinforced by overarching survey data indicating consistent party preferences, with about half of Latino voters planning to support Democratic candidates in upcoming elections [5, 10].\n\nFurthermore, the perceptions of differences between Latino voters based on political affiliation reveal notable insights. Image 8 illustrates that both Democratic-leaning and Republican-leaning Latinos perceive substantial divisions within the community, with roughly 45-48% of each group indicating \"a great deal of difference\" between Democrats and Republicans among Hispanics. These perceptions reflect internal divides that influence political attitudes and behaviors, although the overall party identification remains largely stable, as emphasized in [7].\n\nLooking at the support for candidates, image 1’s bar chart underlines strong support for Democratic candidates among Latino voters, especially among Dem/Lean Dem groups (81%). In contrast, Republican support remains comparatively lower but more significant among evangelical Latinos, who favor the GOP over other religious groups [image1]. This indicates that while party allegiance remains stable, divergent perceptions—like those expressed about intra-community differences—may influence the intensity of partisan support and candidate preferences.\n\nIn summary, Latino registered voters have maintained a consistent tendency to identify with or lean toward the Democratic Party over recent years, despite perceptions of significant internal differences within the Latino community [8], which may affect future shifts, although current data shows stability in their overall political alignment."}

This contrasts sharply with only **19% of men** in STEM reporting such experiences, illustrating a substantial disparity. Additionally, [4] emphasizes that women in STEM, especially those working in environments where men outnumber women, report higher rates of gender discrimination and perceive gender as more of an obstacle to career advancement than men do. \n\nThe visual representations further support this discrepancy.

According to a Pew Research Center survey, 42% of Americans find the use of such scores acceptable, citing reasons like their potential effectiveness and fairness, and the belief that they can help identify deserving individuals. For example, some argue that these scores can promote objectivity and reduce human bias, which is especially important when biases can affect human decision-making [4].\n\nHowever, a larger proportion (56%) considers these scores unacceptable, mainly because of concerns about fairness and individual circumstances. Critics worry that these systems often fail to account for personal context, changes in behavior, or the unique nuances of each case. Many also believe that criminal behavior is too complex for algorithms to accurately assess, and fear that reliance on such scores could perpetuate biases or unfair profiling, especially when data used might reflect existing prejudices [2, 10, 11].\n\nImages support these points: a pie chart shows that 74% of respondents oppose using criminal risk scores, emphasizing concerns about unfairness and bias, while a small segment (25%) are open to their use, often citing potential effectiveness or fairness [image4]. Meanwhile, survey data indicates that people are particularly wary of systems that remove human judgment, fearing they may lead to unfair outcomes or overlook the complexity of individual cases [11].\n\nIn summary, the main reasons people find automated criminal risk scores acceptable revolve around their potential to improve objectivity, fairness, and efficiency in decision-making. Conversely, those opposing their use focus on the inability of algorithms to capture individual nuances, the risk of bias, and the importance of human judgment in sensitive decisions."}

Generally, voters with postgraduate and four-year college degrees tend to favor the Democratic candidate. For instance, [1] states that those with a postgraduate degree favor the Democrat over the Republican roughly two-to-one (62% vs. 30%), while those with a four-year college degree also prefer the Democrat (53% vs. 40%). These figures suggest that higher education correlates with a stronger Democratic preference in congressional elections.\n\nConversely, voters with less or no college education show more divided or Republican-leaning preferences. [6] notes that only 26% of those with some college experience and 20% of those with a high school degree or less view neither party as having high ethical standards, implying closer ties to Republican-leaning voters. Supporting this, the data in [8] reveals that among those with at least a college degree, a significant 43% believe that high ethical standards describe one party but not the other, indicating clearer partisan distinctions among the educated.\n\nLooking at party support, the demographic divides are also reflected in the general preference patterns: data from [12], illustrated in the images, shows that younger and more educated voters are more likely to favor Democrats; for example, 58% of adults under 30 favor Democrats, and the trend of higher education corresponds with increased Democratic support across age groups. Additionally, image4 underscores that racial and educational groups differ in their political engagement, with college-educated and Black voters following campaign news more closely, which can influence their congressional preferences.\n\nIn summary, higher educational attainment generally increases the likelihood of favoring Democratic candidates for Congress, whereas those with less education tend to be more divided or lean Republican. This pattern reflects a broader trend where education level shapes political attitudes and voting intentions.\n\n![A bar chart showing how closely different demographic groups follow campaign news, with college-educated and Black voters following most closely](image4)\n\n**In brief, higher education levels are associated with a greater tendency to support Democratic candidates in congressional elections, while lower education levels are linked to more Republican support or divided preferences.**"}

According to the stacked area chart in image4, Independents made up about 33% of the population in 1994, and this share grew to approximately 38% by 2018. During this period, the overall share of Democrats remained relatively stable around 31% to 33%, while Republicans declined slightly from about 30% in 1994 to 26% in 2018. Notably, among Independents in 2018, only a small fraction—around 17% lean Democrat, 13% lean Republican, and 7% with no lean—indicate that the majority of Independents actually hold some partisan tilt, although they are categorized as \"independent\" politically.  \n\nThe lingering question is whether this rise reflects a genuine increase in truly independent voters or a broader disengagement from traditional party labels. The evidence suggests that many Independents are not entirely free agents; rather, most lean toward one party or the other, blurring the lines between independents and party identifiers. This indicates that while the number of self-identified Independents has grown, their political leanings tend to be somewhat predictable, often aligning subtly with one of the major parties, which can reduce the perception of Independents as entirely unaligned or neutral voters.  \n\n![The chart shows the growth of Independents from about 33% in 1994 to 38% in 2018, with most of them leaning toward Democrats or Republicans rather than being neutral.](image4)  \n\nIn conclusion, the increase in the proportion of Independents suggests a rising number of Americans adopting a non-party label, but their underlying leanings reveal that many are still influenced by partisan perspectives, indicating a complex shift rather than a complete move away from party alignment."}

Its performance is comparable to other top hits like \"Thinking Out Loud\" by Ed Sheeran and \"Trap Queen\" by Fetty Wap, which also rank highly in streams and sales, but \"Uptown Funk!\" stands out for its dominant streaming figures and multi-platform rankings [6].\n\nIn comparison, \"Trap Queen,\" while highly popular and ranking third in streams, does not match the sheer volume and top-tier rankings of \"Uptown Funk!\" across all categories but still represents significant success for Fetty Wap in 2015. Both songs appear prominently in the top on-demand songs list, indicating their substantial digital footprint[6].\n\nFurthermore, considering attributes such as trendsetting and influence, \"Uptown Funk!\" likely contributed to setting musical trends and remained highly influential across social media and streaming platforms. The overall performance demonstrates its embodiment as a modern pop-funk phenomenon that resonated widely with audiences through multiple platforms [1][8].\n\nHere's a visual summary:  \n![](image6)  \nThe chart shows \"Uptown Funk!\" leading with the highest total streams at over 285 million, maintaining top positions across audio, video, and sales rankings (image6). Compared with \"Trap Queen,\" which also ranks well but with lower streaming numbers, \"Uptown Funk!\" clearly had a more dominant media presence in 2015.\n\nIn essence, \"Uptown Funk!\" excelled across all the major media platforms—streams, sales, radio, and video—outperforming many contemporaries including \"Trap Queen,\" marking it as one of the most influential and widely consumed tracks of 2015."}

The establishment of rural communities, churches such as Zion Lutheran, and the creation of numerous school districts further supported the population surge, reflecting a wave of rural development and ethnic settlement, including Germans, Danes, Swedes, Irish, and Russians [4][6][12].\n\n![A grain elevator in a rural area, with structures labeled \"Farmers\", indicating the agricultural development that supported population growth](image1)\n\nAfter 1890, the population gradually declined, reaching about 8,778 in 1950, a trend consistent with rural depopulation due to farm consolidation and mechanization reducing the need for labor and small farms [6]. The decline continued into the late 20th century, although there were periods of stabilization and slight increases, such as the population reaching around 9,403 by 2000—likely supported by towns like Aurora experiencing steady growth and some remaining small rural communities maintaining their populations [8][9]. Overall, major factors influencing these trends include the initial land rush facilitated by legislation and railroads, followed by agricultural modernization, mechanization, and changing transportation patterns that shifted economic centers away from small towns and rural areas.\n\n![Map showing Hamilton County and the location of key towns like Aurora, Giltner, and Kronborg, highlighting the transportation routes that influenced settlement patterns](image3)\n\nIn summary, Hamilton County's population grew rapidly with pioneer settlement and transportation infrastructure until the early 20th century, then declined due to urbanization and agricultural consolidation, but retained some growth in towns like Aurora by the 2000s."}

Specifically, roughly seven-in-ten Americans aged 50 and older favor restrictions on Chinese students studying in the U.S., whereas among those aged 18 to 29, nearly two-thirds oppose such limitations [8]. This suggests that as age increases, so does the likelihood of endorsing restrictions on Chinese students. The pattern indicates that older demographics generally view Chinese students as more problematic, aligning with their heightened concerns about China-related issues and perceptions of China as an enemy, as shown by higher percentages of older adults labeling China as an enemy and prioritizing limiting China’s influence [5][10][11]. Additionally, the survey data supports this trend by showing significant support among older Americans for policies restricting Chinese students, contrasting with the substantial opposition among younger groups [3][8].\n\n![Older Americans more likely to support restrictions on Chinese students](image1)"}

According to recent survey data, only about 53% of Americans express confidence in Biden to deal effectively with China [8], which is notably lower than the 67% confidence in his ability to improve relationships with allies, and similar or higher levels of confidence in managing threats like terrorism and global climate change. The specific figure of around 53% indicates that dealing with China is among the issues with the lowest confidence in Biden’s foreign policy portfolio [8].\n\nSupporting this, multiple sources highlight that confidence in Biden regarding the U.S.-China dynamic is comparatively weaker than his perceived ability in other areas. For example, fewer people trust him to handle the U.S.-China relationship than on issues like international trade or military decisions, where confidence levels are closer to or above 59% [12]. Moreover, confidence specific to China, as seen in the data, is further diminished by public distrust toward Chinese President Xi Jinping, with 82% expressing little or no confidence in him [10].\n\nVisually, the perceptions of distrust and the political divide are reinforced in the imagery and polls. For instance, the bar chart showing international confidence issues reveals that confidence in Biden’s capacity to effectively address China is comparatively lower than his confidence to tackle other foreign policy challenges [5]. Additionally, the image illustrating polarization (image1) indicates that partisan differences are profound, with Democrats largely confident and Republicans significantly less so. This partisan split impacts overall confidence levels, constraining a unified perception of Biden’s effectiveness on China.\n\nFurthermore, the graph demonstrating negative sentiment toward China over time shows increasing distrust, which likely influences Americans’ confidence in policymaker effectiveness [6]. The cultural and political divisions reflect a broader skepticism about U.S.-China relations during Biden’s tenure.\n\nIn conclusion, compared to other foreign policy issues where Biden enjoys higher levels of confidence, Americans’ confidence specifically regarding his ability to manage China effectively remains relatively low, around 53%, and is influenced heavily by political and public distrust towards China and its leader."}

This reflects a willingness across party lines to collaborate following Obama's election. The image bar chart confirms that in November 2008, 74% of voters thought Republican leaders should work with Obama, with 86% of Democrats supporting this [image7].\n\nContrastingly, in 2016, public opinion shifted considerably. Among all voters, only 59% supported Democratic leaders working with President Trump to get things done, with a significant 65% of Democratic voters favoring standing up to Trump instead, even if less gets done [2][7][11][Image7]. Conversely, a large majority—84%—of Republican supporters favored working with Trump, showing partisanship became more polarized.\n\nMoreover, the data shows that the partisan divide widened over this period. The gap between supporters and opponents of cooperation grew larger in 2016 compared to 2008. For example, Democratic voters' support for working with Trump is much lower than Democratic support for working with Obama in 2008. The change indicates a shift towards more partisan skepticism or reluctance to compromise with the opposing side's president.\n\nThe sentiment is also reflected in the increased perception of mudslinging and emotional reactions, highlighting a more polarized and less collaborative political atmosphere in 2016 than in 2008 [images 3][4][6].\n\nIn summary, voter opinions in 2008 largely favored bipartisan cooperation with the newly elected president, whereas in 2016, opinions were more divided and partisan, with many voters emphasizing standing up to the opposing party's leader even if it meant less legislative progress.\n\n**![A bar chart showing large support in 2008 for cooperation across parties](image7)**"}

Interestingly, Hispanics’ perceptions of fairness in promotion are comparable between STEM and non-STEM roles, suggesting nuanced views across groups.\n\nFurthermore, a large majority of Blacks in STEM (**57%**) feel their workplace pays too little attention to diversity [9], and **72%** believe discrimination in recruitment and promotion plays a role in underrepresentation [7]. Conversely, whites tend to view the workplace as fairer, with **78%** perceiving recruitment fairness, indicating a perception gap rooted in actual or perceived bias. \n\nImages illustrate these disparities vividly: the bar chart on reasons for underrepresentation shows Blacks and Hispanics citing discrimination as a major obstacle [image1], while other groups less frequently recognize discrimination as a key issue (e.g., only about 27–28% of whites and Asians see discrimination as a major reason for underrepresentation). Charts on perceived workplace diversity and fairness—such as the high percentage of Black respondents perceiving insufficient diversity attention [image5]—further confirm that minority groups experience and perceive workplace biases more acutely than their white counterparts.\n\nIn summary, racial and ethnic minorities in STEM fields generally perceive higher levels of discrimination and believe they are less fairly treated in recruitment, promotion, and workplace diversity efforts compared to whites, reflecting deeper structural disparities and perceptions of bias.\n\n![The image is a series of bar graphs showing statistics related to gender discrimination and sexual harassment in STEM workplaces](image4)"}

Currently, the baseline scenario (today) requires 25 train cars during peak hours with a service of 5 trains per hour, 5 cars each [1][4]. If Caltrain increases frequency or lengthens trains, the car requirements grow accordingly. For example, when the service is expanded to 6 trains per hour with 5 cars each, the peak car requirement increases to 30 [2][4], highlighting a 20% rise in cars.\n\nFurther enhancements such as extending platforms to accommodate 8-car trains or increasing train frequency in conjunction with high-speed rail (HSR) could push the peak hour train cars up to 64, as shown in the scenario \"Increase frequency (w/HSR)\" which utilizes 8 trains per hour with 8 cars each [4]. Electrification and longer platforms are intermediate steps that also boost capacity, with 36 and 48 cars respectively [4].\n\nThe significance of these increments is rooted in the need to serve growing ridership efficiently; for example, the goal to double Caltrain ridership from 60,000 to 120,000 daily trips by the next decade requires substantial capacity increases [3]. As ridership and mode share increase, more cars per train and more frequent service become necessary to avoid congestion and roadway expansion, such as adding lanes on highways that would otherwise be needed if trains were shut down [9].\n\nThe accompanying maps and images further illustrate the scale and infrastructure that support this capacity expansion, such as expanded rail lines, longer trains, and potential station developments [image1][image4]. The table showing different service scenarios confirms that augmenting train length and frequency directly correlates with higher peak-hour train car requirements, with the highest scenario needing 64 cars [4].\n\nIn summary, as Caltrain aims to improve service, the peak hour train car requirement can escalate from about 25 cars today to as many as 64, depending on service frequency and train length enhancements."}

Overall, about 41% of Americans believe the GOP has high ethical standards, and a similar percentage (42%) feel the same about the Democratic Party [9]. When examining education levels, nearly a third of college graduates (31%) think that neither party has high ethical standards, indicating a more critical view among more educated individuals [11]. Conversely, those with some college experience (26%) or a high school degree or less (20%) are somewhat less likely to believe neither party meets high ethical standards.\n\nDemographic differences in following campaign news also reflect engagement that may influence perceptions. Blacks are significantly more likely than whites or Hispanics to follow campaign news very closely (30% vs. 18% and 13%) [2, 3], which could correlate with their perceptiveness of political ethics. Education seems to influence trust further; individuals with postgraduate degrees are more likely to see one party as ethically superior to the other—43% believe only one party has high standards, while 17% see both as high standards [5].\n\nRegarding political affiliation, partisans generally have more positive views of their own party’s ethics. Majorities of Republicans (66%) and Democrats (64%) describe their party as having high ethical standards [3]. Meanwhile, independents are more skeptical, with about 34% believing that neither party has high standards [1, 7]. Additionally, ideological lines within Democrats show that 93% of liberal Democrats are critical of Trump's ethics, highlighting intra-party divisions based on ideology [10].\n\nThese findings illustrate that higher education tends to lead to more critical assessments of party ethics, and party affiliation strongly influences whether individuals see their parties as ethically high. In summary, perceptions of ethical standards vary significantly based on both educational level and political alignment—with higher education often correlating with more skepticism, especially among independents and those not aligned with a major party.\n\n![The table presents data from a survey outlining sample sizes for different political groups, indicating the scale and margins of error that support these findings](image1)\n\n![Approval ratings of U.S. presidents over various years, contextualizing the ongoing public evaluation of political figures](image2)"}

The concern about privacy is especially prominent, as the collection and sharing of personal financial data can compromise individual confidentiality. Additionally, many worry that these scores do not accurately represent individuals, which could lead to unfair credit evaluations or discrimination [1], [5], [12].\n\nThe visual data reinforces these concerns: a bar chart shows that 33% of respondents see the personal finance score as \"not fair at all,\" and 33% see it as \"not very fair\" [image6]. People also fear that such scores remove the human element from decision-making processes, which could overlook personal circumstances and nuances [5], [12]. This is echoed in the public's general skepticism about algorithmic fairness and bias, with over half believing that computer programs will inherently reflect some bias [3].\n\nSome respondents recognize potential efficiencies but remain cautious. For example, a woman describes credit scores as \"not very fair\" but acceptable because they are efficient and help streamline processes [7]. Still, the prevailing attitude is that the risks to privacy and fairness outweigh the potential benefits, leading to widespread skepticism and rejection of automated financial scoring by the majority of U.S. adults.\n\nIn summary, the primary concerns are privacy violations, unfairness and discrimination, lack of accurate individual representation, and the loss of human judgment in evaluating personal financial data."}

This indicates a long-term trend of decreasing confidence and increasing dissatisfaction among the American public regarding the nation's conditions. \n\n![The line graph shows dissatisfaction rising from 54% in 1990 to 70% in 2019, while satisfaction fell from 41% to 26%, reflecting growing public discontent over time.](image5)\n\nThis trend is further reinforced by the overall political climate; as shown in the political affiliation trends in image7, the support for or affiliation with one political party shifts over time, potentially influencing perceptions of national well-being. During presidential terms, especially under Obama and Trump, satisfaction levels have generally remained low compared to earlier years, although specific peaks and dips correspond to economic and political events. \n\n![The political affiliation trends from 1990 to 2019 show oscillations, with Democratic support rising during Clinton and Obama years, and Republican support peaking under G.W.

Conversely, a substantial portion of Democrats, especially liberals, are more cautious; roughly 50% of liberal Democrats agree that problems would be worse without U.S. efforts, whereas many Democrats (including moderates and conservatives) also see U.S. involvement as crucial [11].\n\nLooking at specific attitudes, a large majority of Republicans (62%) think that U.S. efforts to solve global problems usually make things worse [12]. In contrast, about 56% of Democrats believe the opposite—that U.S. actions prevent worsening scenarios [4], reflecting a more optimistic view of intervention.

Specifically, older adults facing physical or health challenges are more likely to encounter barriers that limit their engagement with digital tools. For instance, the data indicates that **23% of older adults** report having a physical or health condition that makes reading difficult or challenging, and **29%** have a disability, handicap, or chronic disease that prevents full participation in activities [8][9]. \n\nThis increased prevalence of physical challenges correlates with reduced technology adoption within this group. According to the data, only **49% of seniors with physical or health conditions** go online, compared to **66% of seniors without such challenges** [3][6]. They are also less likely to have broadband at home—**38% vs. 53%**—and to own most digital devices like cell phones, smartphones, or tablets. For example, smartphone ownership among seniors with health issues is at **13%**, versus **22%** in healthier seniors [6][3].\n\nIn contrast, the broader adult population has lower rates of physical challenges impacting their daily activities. While about **16% of all adults** report reading difficulties due to health issues, the proportion rises to **23% among seniors** [10][9]. This disparity highlights how physical health conditions disproportionately hinder older adults' ability to engage with digital technology, further contributing to their digital divide.\n\nThe images support these findings: the comparison bar charts show that **fewer older adults with health challenges agree that digital technology benefits them**, which can further discourage adoption [1][4]. Additionally, demographic data tables reveal that the likelihood of technology use sharply declines with age and physical limitations [2][7].\n\n**In summary:** Physical health conditions significantly decrease technology use among older adults, making them less connected digitally compared to both their healthier peers and the general adult population."}

According to Pew Research Center data, **57%** of Hispanic voters in August consider abortion a very important issue when deciding whom to vote for in the 2022 midterms, up from **42%** in March [4]. This marked rise reflects a growing concern about abortion, especially following the Supreme Court’s decision to end the federal guarantee of a right to legal abortion. The shift is further illustrated by the fact that nearly six-in-ten Hispanic voters now see abortion as very important, highlighting its emerging prominence in their electoral considerations.\n\nThis change is consistent with broader trends observed in the general U.S. population, where abortion has also risen in importance leading up to the elections [4]. The increased emphasis on abortion among Hispanic voters is particularly notable given that other issues like the economy remain top concerns, with 80% highlighting the economy's importance [10]. Nonetheless, the data underscores that abortion has gained prominence within Latino communities as a key voting issue during this period of evolving legal and political debates.\n\n![The bar chart showing increased importance of gun control and abortion among various groups](image1)\n\nIn conclusion, between March and August, Latino registered voters' concern over abortion grew markedly, reflecting its rising significance in their electoral decision-making process."}

Evidence from the quotes and images indicates that pre-training helps models better capture rare vocabulary, produce more grammatically correct sentences, and leverage additional language data effectively. \n\nFor example, according to [2], pre-training yields approximately 3 BLEU point improvements in higher-resource language pairs, but the gains are even more significant for extremely low-resource languages, reaching up to 11 BLEU points in some cases. The analysis suggests that pre-trained embeddings bootstrap models that are near the threshold of producing reasonable translations, especially when training data is limited. \n\n![The table presents data related to translation datasets from various source languages to Portuguese (PT), categorized by language family. It shows improvements in BLEU scores after pre-training, with notable gains especially in languages with less data or more linguistic distance from Portuguese](image2) \n\nImages and tables further support this conclusion. For instance, Figure 2 highlights that pre-training improves the translation accuracy, particularly for low-frequency words, across the entire vocabulary [7]. Meanwhile, the graphs in the last image illustrate that pre-trained models consistently outperform standard models, with the advantage being most prominent when less training data is available [7]. Specifically, the graphs show higher BLEU scores when pre-training is used, and the gains (bottom graph) diminish as the training set size increases.\n\nAdditionally, experiments with different language resource sizes ([3], [6], [11]) demonstrate that pre-training is most effective when the available training data is small or moderate. Importantly, pre-training combined with alignment of embeddings between source and target languages (as explained in [10]) further enhances BLEU scores, especially in multilingual systems sharing encoders or decoders, as detailed in [5].\n\nIn summary, pre-training generally improves BLEU scores for diverse language pairs, with the most substantial gains occurring in low-resource conditions, and alignment techniques can amplify this benefit further. \n\n![The image shows how pre-trained models outperform standard models in BLEU scores consistently, particularly at smaller dataset sizes, emphasizing the importance of pre-training for low-resource languages](image7)"}

From the interleaved visual and textual evidence, it is clear that increasing demonstration samples generally boosts the performance in both datasets. For instance, as shown in **image1**, with the left graph, the Micro-F1 score rises notably when moving from 1 to 5 demonstration samples for models without logical constraints (w/o. lc) and with logical constraints (w. lc). Specifically, adding more demonstrations improves the model results, but the gains tend to plateau around 10 samples, indicating diminishing returns with higher numbers of demonstrations [4].\n\nFurthermore, the incorporation of logical constraints consistently offers a performance advantage over models without such constraints, especially at lower demonstration counts. The right graph in **image1** illustrates that iterative reasoning, combined with logical constraints, reduces logical inconsistency and stabilizes gains in Micro-F1 scores over multiple iterations. The decreasing trend in logical inconsistency with more rounds of reasoning underscores the benefits of logical constraints in refining predictions over increasing demonstrations, as discussed [4].\n\nAdditionally, as shown in **image4**, the tables compare models across various configurations. Notably, models with logical constraints, especially when complemented with retrieval-based methods or post-processing, tend to achieve higher Micro-F1 scores than those relying solely on demonstrations without constraints. For example, with 5 demonstrations, models using logical constraints can surpass those with 10 demonstrations without constraints, emphasizing their efficiency [4].\n\nIn sum, increasing the number of demonstration samples improves Micro-F1 performance on MAVEN-ERE and CTB datasets. The addition of logical constraints amplifies this effect, particularly at smaller demonstration counts, leading to more accurate and logically consistent predictions. However, beyond a certain point (~10 samples), further gains are limited, highlighting the importance of strategic data efficiency and the significant role of logical constraints in optimizing performance."}

According to the detailed error analysis [4], these types account for most mistakes during the reasoning process. Specifically, the errors are primarily focused on the reasoning step, as more than 90% of all errors occur there, with reasoning and math errors being the major contributors [6], [12].\n\nTo illustrate, the breakdown shows that reasoning errors account for over half of the mistakes, often stemming from failure in the intermediate reasoning steps or deep comprehension challenges. Factual errors also occur when the model recites incorrect factual knowledge, and principle errors happen during the abstraction step, although these are less frequent [5], [6], [12].\n\nComparing the impact of these errors, the error analysis presented in figure 6 (right) highlights that reasoning errors are the most dominant, with a rate of 55%, overshadowing other types like factual or principle errors. This dominance indicates that deep reasoning remains the bottleneck for the model's accuracy on TimeQA, despite the abstraction step being relatively less problematic.\n\nTo visualize the overall picture, the pie chart in figure 6 (left) summarizes that approximately 40% of predictions are correct when both the baseline and Step-Back are right, but the primary issue is the high frequency of reasoning errors when mistakes do happen. The bar chart on the right further emphasizes that reasoning errors constitute the largest proportion of mistakes made during reasoning [6], [12].\n\nOverall, these analyses underscore that in Step-Back Prompting on TimeQA, the main error types are:\n\n- **Reasoning Errors** (~55%) – dominant, occurring during the reasoning process\n- **Factual Errors** – due to incorrect recall of facts\n- **Principle Errors** – errors at the abstraction stage\n- **Context Loss** and **Math Errors** – less frequent but still noteworthy\n\nCompared to other error types, reasoning errors are the most prominent and present the key challenge to improving model performance.\n\n![Summary of primary error types and their prevalence](image6)"}

It illustrates how the model performs multiple rounds (iterations) of coreference and relation propagation, refining the span representations and relationship predictions after each cycle. The process begins with initial span detection, followed by iterative updates through coreference and relation propagation, which progressively enhance the overall extraction performance.\n\nThe graphs in [image5] specifically depict the effect of the number of iterations (N for coreference, M for relation) on the F1 scores. For both entity and relation extraction, the F1 scores tend to improve as the number of iterations increases, reaching an optimal point around the second iteration (N=2 for coreference, M=2 for relations). After this point, further iterations show diminishing or even decreasing returns, indicating that the model's performance stabilizes or slightly declines with excessive propagation.\n\nSupporting this, in [image3], the entity F1 score peaks at the second iteration of coreference propagation (N=2), confirming that a moderate number of iterations yields the best entity recognition performance. Similarly, in [image7], relation F1 scores are highest at two iterations for relation propagation, reinforcing the idea that iterative refinement improves the model’s accuracy up to an optimal point.\n\nFurthermore, the analysis in [text] emphasizes that the iterative propagation of coreference and relation information helps in capturing broader context, especially in sentences with many entities, which is statistically supported by [image4]. This indicates that multiple iterations enable the model to leverage broader contextual information, improving detection accuracy in complex cases with many entities or relations.\n\nIn summary, increasing the number of iterations improves the F1 scores for entity and relation extraction up to a certain point—most notably around two iterations—after which additional iterations provide minimal or negative gains due to potential over-propagation or noise introduction.\n\n**In conclusion,** iterative inference enhances extraction performance, with optimal results typically achieved after two iterations for both entity and relation extraction tasks."}

In contrast, the SL + RL model (red pentagons) shows a gradual increase, reaching just above 0.5 after 10,000 sessions, which indicates moderate enhancement due to RL alone [image8].\n\nModels that combine supervised learning, interactive learning (IL), and RL perform even better. The SL + IL 500 + RL model (yellow triangles) initially rises more sharply—surpassing approximately 0.55—and plateaus around that level, while the SL + IL 1000 + RL model (blue stars) exhibits the most rapid and substantial increase, reaching and stabilizing around 0.65. Notably, the SL + IL 1000 + RL model overtakes the SL + RL model around the early stages (approximately 200 sessions) and maintains a higher success rate throughout [image8]. The larger circles on the graph highlight the points where the success rate of this model surpasses that of the models trained solely with RL, emphasizing its superior performance over time [image8].\n\nThe \"interactive learning curves\" depicted in the graph demonstrate that the inclusion of more interactive learning sessions (1000 in this case) alongside RL markedly enhances the task success rate more effectively than RL alone or fewer IL sessions.

This indicates that embedding enhanced lexical semantics does not compromise overall language understanding, maintaining parity across diverse linguistic phenomena.\n\nIn the **SemEval supersense disambiguation task** (see [2], [3], and depicted in image1), SenseBERT\\(_{\\text{BASE}}\\) significantly outperforms BERT\\(_{\\text{BASE}}\\) in both frozen and fine-tuning settings. The enhancements are particularly striking in the frozen setting where lexical semantics are directly extracted from embeddings—SenseBERT's semantic signal yields embeddings richer in sense-awareness, facilitating easier downstream classification without additional training.\n\nThe **Word in Context (WiC) task** results, displayed in [3], [6], and the corresponding images, corroborate this trend: SenseBERT\\(_{\\text{BASE}}\\) surpasses BERT\\(_{\\text{BASE}}\\) by 4.4 points (72.14 vs. 67.7), indicating superior capacity for contextually nuanced word meaning.

The similar overall scores in GLUE imply a balanced model enhancing lexical semantics while maintaining general language understanding.\n\nFinally, the **trend across different model sizes** indicates that larger SenseBERT models further improve performance (see [6], [8]), achieving state-of-the-art results in tasks like WiC and supersense disambiguation, evidencing the benefits of explicit lexical semantic signals.\n\n**In summary**, SenseBERT\\(_{\\text{BASE}}\\) demonstrates a marked improvement over BERT\\(_{\\text{BASE}}\\) in tasks requiring fine-grained semantic discrimination, especially in situations where lexical sense information is critical, such as supersense disambiguation and the Word in Context task.

This method processes each layer sequentially, narrowing the search scope as it descends, which allows for precise, stepwise refinement of the retrieved information [9]. \n\nOn the other hand, Collapsed Tree Retrieval simplifies this process by flattening the entire multi-layered tree into a single layer, evaluating all nodes collectively at once [10].

These clusters are well-separated, indicating that DAE effectively encodes style information into discrete, distinguishable regions within its latent space.

When the model employs repetition control alone (labeled as WD), it helps reduce internal bigram repetitions that often cause parroting and unengaging responses. This control improves overall conversational quality and allows the model to ask questions more fluidly. \n\nAs depicted in the right plot of **image2**, varying the question-asking control level (denoted as z in the models) directly influences the question frequency. When no additional repetition control is used, increasing the question control setting from 0 to 10 raises the question-asking rate from approximately 1.4% up to nearly 97.7%, demonstrating that control mechanisms effectively modulate question frequency. However, introducing repetition control (e.g., weighted decoding that blocks repetition) tends to lower the maximum achievable question rate; for instance, with repetition control, the model reaches about 79.7% questions at the highest setting, instead of close to 100%. \n\nFurthermore, the **table in image5** illustrates how response parameters influence output. When using weighted decoding with higher weights (like 10.0), the model produces responses with more diverse vocabulary (higher NIDF) and more questions (“?” presence). Without repetition control, the model can generate questions at higher rates. Conversely, models with built-in repetition controls tend to restrict the diversity of questions, decreasing their frequency but improving coherence and engagement.\n\nAdditionally, as shown in **image4**, applying a boost to question control settings increases the percentage of utterances containing questions, affirming the positive correlation between question control and question-asking frequency. However, when combined with repetition controls, the maximum questions asked are somewhat curtailed, indicating a balancing act between preventing repetitive patterns and encouraging inquisitiveness.\n\nIn summary, incorporating repetition control in dialogue models helps prevent parroting and overused n-grams, which can otherwise suppress question-asking. When effectively combined with explicit question-asking controls, this leads to a nuanced modulation where question frequency can be raised significantly, but is often slightly reduced when designed to prioritize coherence and diversity. \n\n![The line graph in image4 demonstrates how different question control methods influence question-asking rates, with increased control levels raising the percentage of questions in generated responses](image4)."}

This means that the long-term preference vector influences the starting point of the GRU's sequential encoding of recent user interactions, effectively giving the short-term model a long-term context at the beginning of its encoding.

The interleaved diagrams and descriptions provide a clear visualization of these distinctions.\n\nThe **Iterative Retrieval** process involves alternating between retrieval and generation steps repeatedly to progressively refine the context provided to the language model. Starting with an initial query, the system retrieves relevant information, generates a response, then judges its quality before deciding whether to repeat the cycle to gather more targeted or comprehensive context. This loop aims to produce more accurate and detailed answers through multiple iterations [2, 12].\n\n![Iterative Retrieval creates a loop between retrieval and generation, aiming for richer context with each cycle](image2).\n\nThe **Recursive Retrieval** process focuses on progressively refining the user’s original query or decomposing complex problems into sub-problems. Here, the retrieval process is used iteratively to handle nuances and deepen understanding, often by transforming the query into more specific or manageable sub-queries, and then retrieving relevant information at each step. This method is particularly suited for complex reasoning tasks where layered, step-by-step clarification or decomposition leads to better results [2, 11].\n\n![Recursive Retrieval refines the query or problem into sub-components and iteratively retrieves relevant data for each](image2).\n\nIn contrast, the **Adaptive Retrieval** system dynamically decides when to perform retrieval based on the current context or confidence level. It involves a control mechanism—often a judge or decision module—that assesses whether external knowledge is needed at each stage. If so, retrieval is triggered; otherwise, the system proceeds to generate an answer without additional external input. This approach emphasizes efficiency and flexibility by preventing unnecessary retrieval, making the process more autonomous [2, 10].\n\n![Adaptive Retrieval selectively triggers retrieval only when needed, based on system judgment](image2).\n\n**Summarizing the differences**:  \n- **Iterative Retrieval** actively cycles between retrieval and generation multiple times to refine output gradually.  \n- **Recursive Retrieval** repeatedly decomposes or refines problems or queries to handle complexity better.  \n- **Adaptive Retrieval** intelligently and selectively triggers retrieval only when the system determines it is necessary, optimizing resource use and response relevance.\n\nIn essence, all three methods seek to improve the quality and relevance of generated responses but differ in their control strategies and how they manage the interaction between retrieval and generation."}

When gold paragraphs—relevant, correctly identified evidence—are provided, models tend to achieve higher F1 scores, indicating better performance. For instance, as shown in the table summarized in [4], adding gold paragraphs to an open-domain setting raises the F1 score from around 39.12 (without golds) to approximately 53.12, highlighting the model's improved ability to retrieve and reason over pertinent information.

In the same table ([4]), with only distractors, the model's F1 score drops substantially, reflecting the difficulty in filtering out noise and locating the correct evidence for reasoning. For example, in the scenario with distractor sets, the F1 score can be as low as 38.40 in open-domain settings without golds, and even with 500 distractors, the F1 score is only about 39.12, indicating that a large number of distractors hampers effective retrieval and comprehension.\n\nThe impact of distractors on model performance is further emphasized when comparing results with and without adversarial training on distractors ([2], [3]). Re-training models on distractors can recover a notable portion of accuracy (e.g., increasing from 46.84 to 60.10 F1), yet the scores still highlight the inherent difficulty caused by distractor ambiguity. Additionally, the analysis suggests that increasing distractor sets—such as using all of Wikipedia or the web—introduces computational challenges and may still be insufficient without better retrieval strategies.\n\n**Implications**: These observations imply that for multi-hop QA models, high performance hinges on effective retrieval of relevant evidence, especially in the presence of numerous distractors.

First, as described, it receives four segments: the source sentence, the reference translation, a “better” hypothesis, and a “worse” hypothesis. These segments are encoded independently using a pretrained cross-lingual encoder, specifically a model like XLM-RoBERTa, which converts each segment into a dense vector representation [4].\n\nNext, these individual encodings are passed through a pooling layer to generate fixed-size sentence embeddings for each segment [4], [6]. The embeddings for the source, reference, and hypotheses are then combined to form a unified representation. This is achieved by concatenating or integrating these embeddings into a single vector, preparing them for the optimization process [4].\n\nThe core of the model employs a triplet margin loss function, which aims to minimize the distance between the “better” hypothesis and the source/reference embeddings, effectively ranking hypotheses by their relevance to the source and reference [4], [7], [12]. The model is trained with this loss to learn an embedding space where higher-quality hypotheses are closer to the reference and source, facilitating accurate ranking of translation hypotheses.\n\nIn summary, the process involves encoding each segment with a cross-lingual pretrained encoder, pooling to produce fixed representations, combining these into a comprehensive vector, and optimizing the model using triplet margin loss to effectively rank hypotheses based on translation quality."}

Initially, BERT achieved a peak accuracy of 77% on the original Argument Reasoning Comprehension Task (ARCT), which was just three points below the average untrained human baseline [10]. However, as shown in the table comparing models’ performances, BERT's performance notably drops when evaluated on the adversarial dataset designed to eliminate these cues, reducing its maximum test accuracy to around 53% [5], [8], [11]. \n\nThis drop indicates that BERT was largely relying on inadvertent statistical signals rather than genuine argument understanding. Examining the model architecture, the diagram illustrates how models like BERT process input claims, reasons, and warrants independently, relying on distributional cues rather than contextual comprehension [2], [4], [5], [6], [8], [9]. The data shows that when trained on the original data, models—including BERT—perform well, but on the adversarial set, their scores plummet, demonstrating the effectiveness of the transformation in removing exploitable cues and exposing true reasoning capabilities [1], [3], [5], [8].\n\nFurthermore, the performance metrics from the various experiments suggest that BERT's apparent superior performance on the original dataset does not translate into a genuine understanding of argument structure. Instead, after the adversarial transformation, BERT's ability to correctly interpret arguments diminishes to levels comparable to random guessing, which is around 50%. This is confirmed by the comparison of BERT’s performance on original vs. adversarial datasets, where the accuracy drops from about 77% to roughly 53%, aligning with the performance of simpler models like BoV and BiLSTM in the adversarial condition [5], [9], [11].\n\nIn summary, the adversarial transformation exposes that BERT's high scores on the original task predominantly stem from exploiting dataset biases. Once these cues are mitigated through the adversarial approach, BERT's performance diminishes to near chance levels, indicating it has learned little about actual argument comprehension beyond statistical shortcuts. Therefore, the transformation reveals that BERT’s initial performance was not indicative of real reasoning ability, emphasizing the importance of robust evaluation methods to genuinely assess model understanding."}

In the plots from image 5, the red line representing 'Hard-to-Contrast' often lies above others, demonstrating superior performance during early training stages. Additionally, the table in image 6 confirms that 'Ours' (referring to the hard-to-contrast approach in this context) reaches near-perfect or optimal accuracy more quickly than other strategies, particularly at very low sampling percentages like 0.5% or 1%. \n\nThis strategy's effectiveness stems from its ability to identify data points that are challenging for the model to discriminate, which are highly informative for improving model robustness early on. It actively addresses the cold start problem by selecting diverse and difficult samples without requiring prior labels or model predictions, leading to better initial dataset quality and subsequent performance gains. \n\nIn summary, by focusing on hard-to-contrast data, active learning starts with a more representative and informative sample set, accelerating the learning process and resulting in higher AUC scores across various datasets and sample sizes."}

However, the primary backbone models explicitly mentioned involve LLMs such as InstructGPT, GPT-4, and similar models.\n\nBased on this, the modules implemented with an LLM backbone are mainly:\n\n- Claim verifier\n- Question generator\n- Question-answering module (GPT Reciter–Reader)\n\nThus, **three modules are implemented with a Large Language Models backbone** in the current system setup."}

According to the description associated with **image8**, for both models, **the AUC improves as \\( p \\) increases from 0**, indicating that a moderate masking of long-term user representations helps the models learn more effectively without overfitting.  \n\nHowever, the performance peaks at an optimal \\( p \\) around 0.5 for both models, beyond which the AUC begins to decline, showing that too much masking negatively impacts their ability to accurately model user preferences. The description notes that **LSTUR-ini and LSTUR-con exhibit similar patterns** across the range of \\( p \\), with both achieving their best AUC scores at moderate values of \\( p \\).  \n\nFrom **image5**, we see that the optimal balance achieved around \\( p \\approx 0.5 \\) results in the most improved AUC scores, illustrating that both models benefit from a similar proportion of masking but do not necessarily outperform each other significantly.

This step ensures a consistent embedding space for potential slot values. ![The fixed BERT encodes candidate slot values into static representations](image8)\n\nSimultaneously, a **fine-tuned BERT** processes the current dialogue context along with each domain-slot pair (e.g., \"hotel, price range\" or \"taxi, arrive by\") (also depicted in **image8**). This component outputs contextualized representations (`r_cls`, `r1`, ..., `rK`) that capture the nuanced semantic features of the current conversation relevant to each slot.\n\nThe core of the matching mechanism relies on **cosine similarity** between these two sets of representations, as described in quote [1]. By calculating the cosine similarity between the dialogue context's representation of a specific slot and each candidate value's embedding, the model assesses how relevant each candidate is to the current user input and dialogue state. The highest similarity score indicates the most likely match for that slot value.\n\nThis process is facilitated by the **deep interaction** between dialog context representations and candidate embeddings, enabling the model to effectively identify whether a candidate value is being expressed or referenced in the ongoing conversation. Additionally, for non-categorical slots, the model can find spans directly in the text (\"span matching\"), whereas for categorical ones, it selects from the pre-defined picklists based on similarity scores (see **image8** and quotes [6], [7]).\n\nIn summary, the DS-DST uses a combination of static value embeddings and contextual dialogue representations, matching them through cosine similarity to determine the best candidate-value fit for each slot, relying on strong interaction mechanisms to accurately interpret user intents within the dialogue.\n\n---\n**Note:** The schematic in **image8** visually illustrates how separate BERT models process candidate value lists and dialogue history, with their output vectors being compared via cosine similarity to establish the best matching slot values within the dialogue context."}

Initially, as shown in the diagram outlining the architecture (see **![structure of LOGIC-LM](image5)**), the **Problem Formulator** uses large language models (LLMs) with in-context learning to translate the natural language problem into an appropriate symbolic representation. This step involves identifying key entities, facts, and logical rules relevant to the problem, ensuring a formal and precise encoding.\n\nOnce the problem is symbolically formulated, the **Symbolic Reasoner** takes over. This module performs logical inference using deterministic solvers tailored to the problem type—such as logic programming for deductive reasoning, first-order theorem provers for FOL-based problems, or constraint solvers for CSPs—as detailed in the component overview for different problem formulations (**![problem types and solvers](image6)**). Here, the symbolic solver executes inference procedures reliably and faithfully, grounded in the formal constraints defined during formulation.\n\nFinally, the **Result Interpreter** interprets the output of the symbolic reasoning process and maps it back into natural language, providing an understandable answer to the original question. This interpretation incorporates feedback mechanisms, such as self-refinement, which allows the problem formulation to be iteratively improved based on error messages or inconsistencies from the symbolic solver (see **[8]** and **[12]** for the refinement process). \n\nThis modular, stepwise reasoning framework is illustrated in the overall system diagram, where natural language input is systematically transformed (via **Problem Formulation**), logically processed (via **Symbolic Reasoning**), and finally translated into an answer (**Result Interpretation**).

The absence of R-GCN hinders the model's capacity to update mention representations based on context, leading to less accurate predictions in both scenarios [9].\n\nThe histograms and bar charts presented in the images showcase that as the complexity or size of the candidate set and relational graph increases, performance generally degrades, but models with R-GCN handle these challenges better than those without. The performance gap underscores the impact of R-GCN in capturing multi-hop and relational information crucial for the task at hand [5], [6].\n\nIn sum, removing R-GCN from the architecture results in approximately a 6-8% decrease in accuracy across unmasked and masked settings, demonstrating that the relational graph convolutional component is vital for maintaining high performance levels [3], [11]."}

For example, as shown in **image2**, BiDAF achieves **49.7** on the standard \"test*\" condition of WIKIHOP when evaluated with the \"gold chain\" setup, whereas on MEDHOP, it reaches **61.2**. However, under similar conditions, BiDAF's performance on MEDHOP (86.4 in \"standard\") is significantly higher, especially in the \"gold chain\" state, reaching over 89%, demonstrating that the model excels when the relevant document chain is provided [5].\n\nFurthermore, the introduction of masking (\"mask\" variants) substantially improves performance on WIKIHOP: BiDAF masked scores go from **49.7** to **59.8**, and the \"gold chain\" accuracy jumps from about **57.9** to **85.7**, approaching near-perfect performance, which suggests that when the models can focus only on relevant documents, their accuracy improves significantly [5], [10].\n\nComparatively, FastQA shows lower scores in all conditions. For instance, in **image2**, FastQA's \"gold chain\" scores are **53.5** (standard) and **70.0** (mask), but these are still weaker than BiDAF's corresponding scores, indicating that BiDAF's more complex iterative attention mechanism enables better integration of information across documents, especially in multi-hop reasoning [4], [6].\n\nLooking at **image6**, the trend persists: BiDAF consistently outperforms FastQA across datasets and test conditions. For example, on WIKIHOP, in the \"gold\" condition, BiDAF masks achieve **81.2** and **85.7**, outperforming FastQA's **65.3** and **70.0**. On MEDHOP, BiDAF scores are also higher, with **99.3** and **100.0** in the masked gold chain setting, whereas FastQA scores are about half that, roughly **51.8** and **55.1** [5].\n\nThe underlying reason relates to the architecture: as **image6** notes, BiDAF employs iterative conditioning and attention mechanisms that are advantageous for multi-document, multi-hop reasoning tasks in WIKIHOP, whereas FastQA, with fewer latent interactions, faces challenges in integrating cross-document information, leading to comparatively lower accuracies [6], [10].\n\nIn summary:\n- **BiDAF** consistently outperforms **FastQA** across both datasets.\n- Performance is substantially higher on WIKIHOP when the relevant document chain is provided (\"gold chain\") [8], [10].\n- Masked document experiments further boost scores, especially for BiDAF, indicating its strength in leveraging focused relevant information.\n- The complex architecture of BiDAF, designed for multi-hop reasoning, makes it better suited for the cross-document inference challenges in both datasets, especially WIKIHOP.\n\n**In conclusion**, while both models perform better on WIKIHOP due to the dataset's structure and size, BiDAF significantly outperforms FastQA, especially in scenarios where relevant documents are highlighted or provided."}

Starting in 2010, the introduction of the \"Time tensor with Random Indexing\" (image1) laid an early foundation for representing semantic change over time through tensor structures, enabling more dynamic analyses [image1]. In 2011, researchers widely explored the use of the \"Google Ngrams corpus\" to examine linguistic evolution across decades, which helped establish large-scale, quantitative diachronic studies [12]. The subsequent milestone in 2012 involved work focused on \"Word epoch disambiguation,\" addressing the challenge of pinpointing when semantic shifts occur within temporal data [3].\n\nMoving into 2013, substantial progress was made with \"Prediction-based models\" such as neural embeddings, which offered more refined representations of word semantics [10]. In 2014, the deployment of \"Word embeddings,\" exemplified by models like \"word2vec,\" revolutionized the field by providing dense, continuous representations that could be updated incrementally and used to detect subtle semantic changes [10][11]. The milestone in 2015 saw the development of \"Models alignment,\" improving the comparability of embeddings across different time periods to better identify shifts [2].\n\nBetween 2016 and 2017, researchers analyzed data from various corpora such as NYT and COHA, further refining methods to capture semantic changes tied to cultural and historical contexts [8]. The 2017 milestones include insights into the \"Laws of semantic change,\" the recognition that \"Local measures are better for cultural shifts,\" and the integration of \"Gigaword corpus\" data—highlighting the importance of dataset diversity in diachronic studies. Additionally, there was critical reflection on \"Diachronic relations\" and the limitations of assumed \"laws of semantic change,\" alongside efforts toward \"Joint learning across time spans\" to model continuous semantic evolution [image1].\n\nIn summary, from 2010 to 2017, the field progressed through foundational tensor models, large-scale corpus usage like Google Ngrams, the advent of neural embedding techniques, improved alignment and comparison methods, and nuanced understanding of cultural versus linguistic semantic shifts.\n\n![The timeline chart illustrating key methodological and dataset milestones in semantic change research from 2010 to 2017.](image1)"}

When key textual and metadata inputs are altered, the model's effectiveness varies, highlighting the importance of carefully selecting these features.\n\nFor instance, removing the abstract from the input leads to a substantial decline in performance, emphasizing that abstracts contribute vital contextual information for understanding and representing scientific papers (see [8]). Conversely, adding author information, which is often sparse and noisy due to tokenization issues, actually hurts performance. This is partly because many author names are out-of-vocabulary for SciBERT, leading to fragmented representations that do not aid in capturing document-level relatedness. Similarly, incorporating venue information slightly decreases performance, although it may improve specific tasks like document classification where venue may hold stronger correlation.\n\nThe performance metrics depicted in the performance table (image1) reinforce that the core input features—namely title and abstract—are crucial for the model's high accuracy across classification, citation prediction, and recommendation tasks. When these key features are omitted, the scores drop notably, illustrating their importance. Additionally, the inclusion of metadata like authors and venues introduces noise or sparse signals that can counterproductively affect the embeddings' quality, as seen through decreased metrics in some configurations ([8], [10]).\n\nThe comprehensive ablation study underscores that judicious selection of features—favoring those that provide dense, meaningful information such as titles and abstracts—optimizes SPECTER’s ability to generate high-quality document embeddings. On the other hand, adding features that are sparse or noisy, such as author names, can impair performance, especially in models that rely heavily on semantic coherence.\n\nIn essence, the impact of feature inclusion or exclusion is task-dependent but clearly pivotal: robust, relevant textual features (title and abstract) are fundamental, while extraneous or noisy metadata can diminish the quality of the representations, affecting tasks like classification, recommendation, and citation prediction.\n\n---\n\n![This table presents performance metrics for different model configurations, highlighting how feature inclusion (like venue or author information) affects SPECTER's performance.](image1)"}

The analysis indicates that when the ontology is accessible, DS-Picklist, which leverages candidate lists, significantly reduces errors for these time-related slots.\n\nMoreover, in [9], Table 4 shows that DS-Span struggles with such slots because their values often do not match spans in the dialogue, leading to lower accuracy.

According to the data presented in Table 5, the standard BERT model achieves a mean test accuracy of approximately 50.4% with a small standard deviation (±0.01), and a median accuracy of 0.505, with a maximum observed score of 0.533 [11, 12]. When modifications such as focusing solely on warrants (W), reasons and warrants (R, W), or claims and warrants (C, W) are applied, the performance slightly decreases, with mean scores hovering around 50%, median scores close to 0.500, and maximum scores just above 0.502 [11, 12].

For instance, in the \"Citation Eval.\" metrics from the comparison table (image6), GPT-4 scores higher on alignment (around 90.9 in general and 92.0 in specific) and correctness (97.6 in both settings), while ChatGPT's scores are somewhat lower (around 82.7-84.5 in alignment, and 94.5-94.8 in correctness). Similarly, for text quality (image4), GPT-4 attains higher scores on coherence, fluency, and relevance, indicating more consistent and higher-quality responses.\n\nFurthermore, the \"Text-Citation Alignment\" scores from the evaluation results (quote [11]) show that larger models with more parameters, like GPT-4's trillion-level, produce answers with better alignment scores (~92), while smaller models like LLaMA-7B lag behind (~40) — implying that model size and training influence the capacity for accurate citation and detailed text generation.\n\nWhen considering the \"general\" versus \"specific\" question settings, models generally perform better in the \"specific\" context, which provides clearer instructions to incorporate relevant knowledge explicitly. In image6, the improved scores in the \"specific\" setting (e.g., citation F1 from ~35.6 to ~39.4 for GPT-4) suggest that both GPT-4 and ChatGPT are more effective when questions specify precise knowledge cues, thus enhancing their citation accuracy and response relevance.\n\nThe implications for use are that GPT-4, with its higher performance metrics across citation alignment, correctness, and text quality, is more reliable for tasks requiring accurate attribution and detailed responses, especially when questions are explicit. ChatGPT, while slightly less precise, still performs well but shows potential biases, such as overestimating its text quality as highlighted in the bias concern (quote [6]) where ChatGPT's evaluation scores surpass GPT-4, possibly reflecting self-assessment bias.\n\nIn summary, GPT-4's superior metrics across both evaluation contexts suggest it is better suited for citation accuracy and high-quality text generation, especially in specific, well-defined queries, whereas ChatGPT's performance is adequate but may need cautious validation, particularly in nuanced or complex attribution tasks."}

According to the analysis, this similarity in slot value distributions facilitates effective knowledge transfer from the other domains during zero-shot learning, enabling the model to better predict unseen slot values in Taxi without in-domain training data[2].\n\nFurthermore, the knowledge transfer capability is supported by the model’s ability to leverage shared slot values across related domains, such as departure and arrival slots, which often have overlapping or similar values, making zero-shot generalization more feasible in Taxi.\n\n**In summary**, the Taxi domain achieved the highest zero-shot joint accuracy because its slot value distributions closely resemble those in other domains, thus enabling better knowledge transfer with less domain-specific training data[2].\n\n![The table presents data comparing \"Trained Single\" and \"Zero-Shot\" performance across five categories, highlighting Taxi's relatively high zero-shot joint accuracy of 60.58%](image2)"}

According to the data presented in the corresponding figure, the **collapsed tree** consistently outperforms **tree traversal** across different context sizes. \n\nSpecifically, the **collapsed tree** approach, represented by the green line, achieves its peak F1 score at a context length of around 2000 tokens, reaching approximately 63.5%. Its performance remains relatively stable and slightly declines beyond this point, indicating optimal retrieval at this context size. On the other hand, the **tree traversal** method, shown by the blue line, demonstrates a gradual increase in F1 score as the context length grows but consistently lags behind the collapsed tree, reaching a maximum of about 60% at 2500 tokens.\n\nThis difference is attributable to the inherent flexibility of the collapsed tree method, which evaluates all nodes collectively across multiple layers simultaneously. This comprehensive search enables it to retrieve information at the appropriate level of detail quickly and effectively, which is especially beneficial when dealing with larger context sizes. Conversely, tree traversal navigates the tree layer-by-layer, which can limit its ability to capture the most relevant information at each step, particularly for complex, multi-hop questions that require a broader or more integrated retrieval.\n\nIn summary, the **collapsed tree** method tends to yield higher F1 scores across different context lengths, especially around 2000 tokens, due to its holistic and flexible search strategy, whereas **tree traversal** shows a steady, but lower, improvement as context size increases.\n\n![The graph compares F1 scores of the two methods across context lengths, showing the collapsed tree achieving higher scores especially around 2000 tokens](image8)"}

As the levels ascend, activities involve identifying specific issues, determining necessary actions, and eventually forecasting future trends and optimizing decisions.\n\nInterplay with the quotes emphasizes that these activities are not isolated; instead, they form a structured process where data collection, analysis, and action are crucial. Quotes like [1] and [5] indicate that data-driven cultures rely on these activities to extract insights and support decision-making. The diagram (image4) explicitly shows the stages from Standard Reports to Predictive Modeling, which clearly delineate the four main analytical activities:\n\n- Descriptive Analysis (e.g., standard, ad-hoc reports)\n- Diagnostics (e.g., drill-downs, statistical analyses)\n- Predictive Analytics (e.g., forecasting, predictive modeling)\n- Prescriptive Analytics (e.g., optimization)\n\nThus, the four business analytics activities are **Descriptive, Diagnostic, Predictive, and Prescriptive analytics**.\n\n![The diagram illustrates the hierarchy of analytics, starting from basic reports to advanced predictive and prescriptive activities](image4)"}

The framework emphasizes levels of detail, various view types, modeling strategies, work item management, and handling non-functional requirements to tailor the scope exploration process to the development context.\n\nFor example, the framework suggests employing goals-driven approaches and requirements envisioning as light specifications to avoid overcommitting early in the process [5]. Different view types such as usage modeling, domain modeling, and process modeling help clarify what the solution will encompass, considering both functional and non-functional aspects [5]. Modeling strategies vary from informal sessions and interviews to formal modeling, depending on the complexity and needs of the project [5].\n\nWork item management strategies, like using a requirements backlog or work item pool, facilitate organized handling of scope, with options to incorporate change management techniques to adapt to evolving understanding [5]. Additionally, non-functional requirements—such as acceptance criteria—are explicitly listed or modeled to define scope boundaries clearly [5].\n\nThe visual diagram related to exploring initial scope further illustrates considerations like the level of detail (from light requirements to detailed specifications), view types, and modeling strategies, highlighting the importance of flexibility and tailoring in scope exploration [image5]. This approach allows teams to establish a clear and manageable initial scope while remaining adaptable to change as the project progresses.\n\n![A diagram showing various strategies like goals-driven, requirements envisioning, and modeling options to guide initial scope exploration](image5)\n\nTherefore, the Disciplined Agile framework advocates for a combination of goal orientation, tailored modeling, and organized work management strategies to effectively explore and define initial scope."}

A central feature of this stage is the attachment of spindle fibers to the kinetochores of each homologous chromosome, ensuring that each pair is oriented properly for segregation [2]. \n\nA critical process occurring here is **the crossing over** that took place earlier in Prophase I, where non-sister chromatids exchange genetic material, increasing genetic diversity. This results in chromatids that contain mixed genetic information, contributing to variation among gametes. The pairing of homologous chromosomes facilitates this exchange and ensures that during Anaphase I, homologs are pulled to opposite poles, reducing the chromosome number by half [1].\n\n![Stages of meiosis showing homologous chromosome alignment during metaphase I](image2)  \n*This diagram illustrates the alignment of homologous chromosome pairs at the metaphase plate during Metaphase I.*\n\nAdditionally, the chromosome pairs are held together tightly in tetrads, with each homolog comprising two sister chromatids. The spindle microtubules attach to kinetochores, ensuring correct orientation and subsequent separation. The orientation of each homolog is random, which introduces genetic variation in the resulting gametes. This stage is crucial in ensuring accurate reductional division in meiosis.\n\nIn summary, during Metaphase I, homologous chromosomes align at the metaphase plate, attached to spindle fibers, with crossover events having already increased genetic diversity, underpinning the reduction of chromosome number and genetic variation in gametes."}

In telophase, as shown in [8], the nuclear membranes re-form around the separated sets of chromosomes at opposite poles of the cell. This re-establishment of nuclear envelopes allows the newly formed nuclei to become distinct, and the chromosomes begin to de-condense, returning to their less visible, chromatin state. The mitotic spindle disassembles, marking the end of chromosome separation. \n\nSimultaneously, cytokinesis, which often overlaps with telophase, involves the physical division of the cytoplasm. The diagram in [6] illustrates this process through a contracting ring of microfilaments that constricts the cell at its center (the cleavage furrow), ultimately dividing the cell into two separate daughter cells. The formation of a new cell wall material in plant cells, as depicted in [10], leads to the development of a new cell plate that grows outward, effectively partitioning the cytoplasm.\n\nIn the microscopic image [8], the reformation of the nuclear membrane and the cleavage furrow are visible, confirming these structural changes. The chromosomes have moved to opposite ends, and the cell is dividing into two daughter cells, each with its own nucleus and cytoplasm, marking the completion of cell division.\n\n![The image depicts a cell undergoing telophase and cytokinesis, showing nuclear reformation and cytoplasmic division](image8)"}

In essence, Mendelian inheritance explains that the segregation of alleles during meiosis results in the characteristic 3:1 phenotypic and 1:2:1 genotypic ratios observed in the F₂ generation of pea plants."}

Based on the diagram illustrating the crossing of homozygous purple flower plants (PP) with white flower plants (pp), we see that all F₁ offspring are heterozygous (Pp) and display the dominant purple phenotype. When these F₁ plants self-cross, the F₂ genotypic ratio becomes 1 PP : 2 Pp : 1 pp, reflecting the segregation of alleles during meiosis [3]. This genotypic distribution results in a phenotypic ratio of approximately 3 purple to 1 white flowers, as the dominant purple trait masks the presence of the recessive white allele in heterozygotes [3]. \n\nVisualizing this, the diagram with flowers clearly demonstrates the 3:1 phenotypic ratio, with three plants showing purple flowers and one showing white, stemming from the Mendelian inheritance pattern [3].\n\n![This diagram shows a classic Mendelian genetic cross of pea plants, illustrating how the dominant purple trait appears in three-quarters of the offspring and the white trait in one-quarter, with genotypes reflecting the segregation of alleles](image3)\n\nTherefore, in the F₂ generation of this plant cross, the **phenotypic ratio is 3 purple: 1 white**, and the **genotypic ratio is 1 PP : 2 Pp : 1 pp**."}

These objectives are visually summarized in diagrams and instructional resources that emphasize a structured learning path. \n\nInitially, in **Module 1, basic**, learners are expected to understand the fundamental steps involved in making flat and layered maps within Wikidata. This includes working with geo-referenced items (P625) and utilizing SPARQL queries to generate simple maps that visualize geographic data [3][10][11]. For example, students will learn how to display public libraries in the Netherlands, with maps showing their locations and boundaries [1][3], as illustrated in images depicting basic maps with markers and heatmaps [2][7][8].\n\nMoving to **Module 2, intermediate**, the focus shifts to embedding these maps into other Wikimedia projects such as Wikipedia and Wikimedia Commons. This module teaches how to integrate Wikidata-driven maps seamlessly into web pages, enhancing accessibility and sharing of geographic information [3][8][10]. An example is embedding a map showing public libraries or geographic regions into Wikimedia articles, which is reinforced by screenshots of maps embedded in Wikimedia pages [3][6].\n\nFinally, in **Module 3, advanced**, learners delve into creating interactive, layered maps that can be used outside Wikimedia platforms, often via HTML pages or off-Wiki applications [3][4][10]. This involves using Python, Jupyter notebooks, and tools like GeoJSON and OpenStreetMap to develop dynamic maps that users can manipulate and explore individually. An illustrative example includes a step-by-step guide in a GitHub repository, alongside maps with various data overlays, including a specific map highlighted with markers in the Netherlands [4][6][8][11].\n\nIn essence, the structured approach takes learners from understanding basic map creation with Wikidata and SPARQL, to embedding these maps within Wikimedia projects, and finally to developing sophisticated interactive maps for broader applications, supported by hands-on tools, resources, and tutorials. \n\n![The background map showing the Netherlands and surrounding regions, with markers representing data points, illustrating overall map creation and layering techniques](image8)"}

These errors hinder search engines from accurately parsing page content, potentially leading to missed rich snippets and diminished visibility in search results, which can reduce click-through rates. \n\nSimultaneously, the \"Meta Description and Title Tag\" table (image3) indicates that a large number of pages have duplicate meta descriptions (2,215) and duplicate title tags (621), with others suffering from either too long or missing descriptions and titles. Such issues can cause search engines to mismatch content with search queries or display less appealing snippets, impairing ranking signals and user attraction. \n\nThe graphs provide further context: the \"Meta Description and Title Tag\" graph demonstrates a considerable prevalence of duplicate meta descriptions and missing titles, which can dilute the relevancy signals that impact rankings [3]. The \"Referring domains discovery\" graph shows a sharp increase in backlinks around early 2013 [4], emphasizing the importance of accurate structured data and meta tags to capitalize on backlink profiles effectively. Moreover, the \"Page Load Time\" graph highlights that slow-loading pages (over 1,600 ms) might lose user engagement, compounded by markup errors that can inflate page sizes and load times (see image2). \n\nIn conclusion, unresolved structured errors and meta description issues diminish search engine comprehension and user engagement, directly impairing SEO performance by lowering rankings, reducing visibility, and hampering click-through rates.

For the 8751H operating at 12 MHz, the minimum and maximum timing values are expressed in nanoseconds (ns), e.g., **TLLWL**, **TAVWL**, and **TQVWX**, which are critical for ensuring proper external memory interfacing.\n- Compared to devices like 8751H-8, which operates only up to 8 MHz, the 8751H can handle faster clock speeds, requiring shorter timing intervals for address and data access, resulting in more stringent timing requirements.\n- Some timing parameters, such as **ALE pulse width** and **PSEN low to valid instruction**, tend to be optimized for higher clock speeds in the 8751H, implying improved performance but potentially more critical timing constraints relative to other devices with lower maximum clock frequencies.\n\n**In summary:**\n\n- The **power supply current** for the 8751H is higher (up to **250 mA**) compared to other models like the 8031AH/8051AH (**125 mA**) and 8751BH/8752BH (**~175 mA**).\n- **Timing parameters** for the 8751H are specified for higher clock speeds (up to 12 MHz), with shorter and more rigorous timing intervals to support faster operation, whereas some other models operate at lower maximum frequencies with correspondingly relaxed timing requirements.\n\nThis indicates that the 8751H is designed for applications demanding higher performance, at the cost of increased power consumption and more precise timing control."}

The objectives are structured across three modules, each building on the previous in complexity and scope. \n\nIn **Module 1: Basic maps**, participants learn how to create flat, layered maps using geo-referenced items (P625) in Wikidata, primarily leveraging SPARQL queries to visualize data points on a map [2][7]. The focus here is on understanding the fundamental steps of map creation, including generating basic visualizations of geographic data [1][3].\n\nMoving to **Module 2: Embedding maps**, the workshop introduces techniques for integrating these Wikidata-driven maps into Wikimedia projects like Wikipedia and Wikimedia Commons. Participants explore embedding tools and resources, such as OpenStreetMap, GeoJSON, and extensions like MediaWiki Kartographer, to enrich Wikimedia content with interactive maps [2][7][8][12].\n\nFinally, **Module 3: Off-Wiki maps** is more advanced, guiding attendees through creating fully interactive, layered maps suitable for use outside Wikimedia platforms, such as in standalone HTML pages. This involves a combination of Python, Jupyter notebooks, and additional technical skills to produce maps that are dynamic and embed-able elsewhere [7][9].\n\nThe visual aids reinforce these objectives: \n\n- **Image1** emphasizes basic map creation with geo-referenced items and SPARQL queries, aligning with Module 1's learning goals [image1].\n- **Image2 and Image3** depict the progression through modules, with clear distinctions between basic, intermediate, and advanced map-making techniques, highlighting embedding processes and off-Wiki map creation [images2, 3].\n- **Image4** provides context with resources such as GitHub repositories for map code, supporting the technical mastery developed in Modules 2 and 3 [image4].\n- **Images 5-8** illustrate examples of maps and data visualizations, corresponding to different modules' skills.\n\nIn summary, the modules differ in scope and technical complexity:  \n- **Module 1** focuses on creating simple static maps using Wikidata’s geographic data and SPARQL.  \n- **Module 2** expands to embedding these maps within Wikimedia projects, requiring familiarity with WMF tools.  \n- **Module 3** culminates in generating interactive, off-platform maps using programming languages and open data formats.\n\n**Short answer:**  \nThe workshop's key objectives are to teach participants (1) how to create basic flat and layered maps from Wikidata data, (2) how to embed these maps into Wikimedia projects, and (3) how to develop interactive, off-Wiki maps using advanced tools.

According to the provided quotes and images, the throttle valve can be located either upstream (before) or within the throttle body, with placement variations depending on the system design.\n\nFrom the images, particularly image2, which depicts a typical fuel injection setup, it is shown that the **throttle valve is housed within the throttle body**, regulating incoming air. The **injector is positioned in the intake manifold**, injecting fuel into the airflow after it passes through the throttle valve. Similarly, image6 details a Single Point Fuel Injection (TBI) system where the throttle valve is located in the throttle body above the injector, meaning the throttle valve sits **above or in front of** the injector.\n\nHowever, in some fuel injection configurations, notably certain **port fuel injection systems**, the **throttle valve is placed beneath the fuel injector** in the system's layout. In these setups, the fuel injector sprays into the intake port, which is downstream of the throttle valve, but in some design variants, the throttle valve is situated **below the injector** itself, controlling airflow after fuel has been injected or mixing less prominently.\n\nThe key evidence pointing toward such placement is the description of **injectors spray fuel into the intake port** (quotes [4], [5], [10]) and the diagrams illustrating the position of the injectors **above or in the intake manifold**.

For example, the funnel shows that approximately 52% of leads convert from initial contact to MQLs, 83% of MQLs to SALs, and 6.67% of SALs to sales opportunities [10]. These figures directly correspond to the stages of the funnel, highlighting how many prospects advance over each step.\n\nIn contrast, the marketing diagnostics provide industry-wide averages and benchmarks at various stages, such as a 2-5% conversion rate from inquiries to names, 4-8% from contacts to MQLs, and a 45-75% conversion rate from SALs to opportunities [7][7][7]. These metrics serve as benchmarks to evaluate whether a company's conversion performance aligns with or deviates from industry standards.\n\nBy comparing the funnel-specific conversion rates (e.g., 52% from leads to MQLs, 83% from MQLs to SALs, and 6.67% from SALs to opportunities) with the industry averages, organizations can identify strengths and gaps in their lead progression. For instance, a lower than average conversion from SALs to opportunities might suggest inefficiencies in qualification processes that require improvement, while higher rates indicate effective nurturing.\n\nFurthermore, understanding these relationships helps in setting realistic targets and developing tailored strategies to optimize each stage of the funnel, ensuring better alignment with best practices reflected in the diagnostic benchmarks.

As described in [4] and [9], reporting helps organize data into accessible formats, offering backward-looking insights without necessarily explaining why or what stakeholders should do. For example, the table comparing reporting and analysis highlights that reporting focuses on descriptive, backward-looking information without much context, acting as a starting point for understanding operational status.\n\nTransitioning from reporting, **analysis** deepens this understanding by answering “why?” and “what’s next?”—it is prescriptive and forward-looking, aimed at uncovering insights, generating recommendations, and enabling proactive decision-making [4], [6], [8]. As illustrated in the diagrams in images 4 and 7, analysis transforms data and information into insights through techniques such as statistical modeling, forecasting, and predictive analytics, moving along the spectrum toward predictive and prescriptive analytics.\n\nIn the **progression from business intelligence to business analytics** (see image 7), reporting (stages 1-4) supports understanding historical events and operational facts, laying the groundwork for sophisticated analytics (stages 5-8) such as statistical analysis, forecasting, and optimization, which provide predictive insights and strategic guidance.

According to the detailed descriptions, the key components include the noise canceling microphones, touch sensor control panel, CUSTOM button, indicator lights, power and charging ports, headphone cable input, voice pickup microphones, and proximity sensor. \n\nFor example, the internal noise canceling microphones are located on the left and right sides, designated as (left, right), and are responsible for picking up ambient noise to facilitate noise cancellation [1][9]. The external noise canceling microphones, similarly located on the left and right, enhance this function by detecting external sounds [9]. The touch sensor control panel, situated on the right unit, allows remote management of music playback and other operations via touch [1]. The CUSTOM button enables switching between noise canceling modes and Ambient Sound Mode, providing user control over active features [1]. Indicator lights (red/blue) are used for displaying power and communication status [1], while the USB Type-C port and headphone jack support charging and wired audio connection respectively [1].\n\nAdditional parts include the tactile dot on the left unit, which aids in physically distinguishing the left side from the right, and the built-in antenna for Bluetooth connectivity, located within the headset's structure [9]. The proximity sensor detects whether the headset is being worn, automatically controlling functions like power and music playback based on ear contact [5][9]. The voice pickup microphones handle voice communication in phone calls or Speak-to-Chat mode [1].\n\nTo visualize, the diagram of the over-ear headphones labels these components, such as the headband, ear cups, buttons, and connectors, illustrating their physical positions [2].

It receives input signals from multiple sensors, such as the engine temperature sensor, intake air temperature sensor, mass air flow sensor, throttle position sensor, and crankshaft sensor, which provide real-time data about the engine's operating conditions [1][2]. \n\nIn the diagram shown in image1, the ECU is positioned at the core, acting as the hub that processes these sensor inputs—represented by arrows indicating the flow of information—and uses this data to make decisions about fuel injection, ignition timing, and idle speed control [1][11]. For example, it controls the opening of fuel injectors (injecting the right amount of fuel based on parameters like air flow and engine temperature) and adjusts ignition timing for better power and economy [3][4][5]. \n\nIn the fuel system diagram (image2), the ECU receives signals from the detecting system and sends control signals to the fuel metering system, ensuring the right mixture of fuel and air enters the engine [9][12]. It essentially acts as the brain of the engine management system, continuously monitoring engine conditions and adjusting parameters to maintain optimal operation.\n\nThe PCB in image3 highlights the electronic components that likely support the ECU's functions, while the other images show how the ECU interfaces with components like fuel injectors, sensors, and the intake system [10]. \n\nOverall, the ECU's role is to monitor engine status, process sensor data, and optimally control fuel injection, ignition timing, and idle speed to ensure efficient, stable, and responsive engine performance. \n\n![The ECU is at the heart of the engine management system, processing sensor inputs and controlling fuel injection and ignition timing](image1)"}

Initially, as shown in [8], the bacterial cell begins the process with the duplication of its single circular chromosome, which is highlighted in the diagram of the bacterial cell's genetic material (image4). During this stage, the chromosome duplicates, and the copies start to separate [9], ensuring each new cell will inherit an identical set of genetic information.\n\nNext, the elongation of the cell occurs, as described in [2], where the cell lengthens, and copies of the genetic material move apart within the cell. This physical growth prepares the cell for division, as seen in the diagram of the bacterial cell elongation process. The duplicated chromosomes are pulled toward opposite poles, facilitated by cellular mechanisms.\n\nFinally, the process culminates in cytokinesis, where the cell membrane pinches inward at the midpoint, forming a septum, and divides into two genetically identical daughter cells, depicted in the diagram with two separate entities (image8). Each new cell contains a complete, single copy of the original chromosome, completing the binary fission process.\n\nIn summary, the three steps are:  \n1. Duplication of the chromosome  \n2. Cell elongation and movement of copies  \n3. Division into two daughter cells  \n\n![The bacterial cell dividing into two daughter cells during binary fission](image8)"}

This reflects a natural fatigue or boredom, suggesting that overconsumption can lead to decreased enjoyment or negative outcomes [2]. The table illustrating hot dog consumption clearly demonstrates diminishing marginal utility, where initial hot dogs increase satisfaction, but beyond a point, utility declines, discouraging further consumption.\n\n![The diminishing utility of hot dogs as more are consumed shows decreasing satisfaction and negative utility at high levels](image8)\n\nHowever, in competitive contexts—such as contests or mastery pursuits—the importance of focus and accumulated effort can override the basic principle of diminishing returns. For example, extensive deliberate practice and sustained focus can lead to skill mastery, as illustrated by violinists diverging early in practice hours [6, 12] and the importance of targeted focus improving outcomes. The line graph displays how increased dedicated practice correlates with higher skill levels over time, suggesting that effort and focus can produce cumulative benefits despite potential diminishing returns in casual settings [6].\n\n![Graph showing early divergence in practice hours among violinists indicates cumulative benefits of focused effort](image6)\n\nFurthermore, in competitive environments like hot dog eating contests, the occasional jump in utility at high consumption levels shows that surpassing a certain threshold can lead to extraordinary outcomes, such as winning, which has a huge positive utility—much larger than the negative utility experienced after overconsumption [1]. The image of a hot dog tie implies that focus, strategic effort, and perhaps breaking past diminishing returns can result in a competitive edge [7].\n\n![Image of a hot dog competitor tying for the championship depicts how focus can lead to exceptional outcomes](image1)\n\nThus, while diminishing marginal utility warns against overconsumption in regular use, in competitive or mastery contexts, dedicated effort and strategic focus can lead to surpassing initial diminishing returns, resulting in extraordinary rewards. Essentially, the key difference lies in the setting: ordinary consumption is limited by decreasing satisfaction, whereas competition and mastery can involve leveraging focused effort to achieve superior results despite initial diminishing gains.\n\n**In summary,** diminishing marginal utility describes decreasing satisfaction with increased consumption in normal contexts, but in competitive or mastery pursuits, sustained focus and effort can lead to cumulative benefits, often overcoming initial diminishing returns."}

Lower ratios (e.g., below 10%) generally imply that many marketing-qualified leads are not meeting the sales team’s expectations or needs, possibly indicating overly broad qualification criteria or poor lead nurturing. Higher ratios (above 50%) suggest a strong alignment, better targeting, and qualification procedures.\n\n**Implications of these differences** include:\n- A low conversion rate from MQL to SAL signifies potential leakage in the funnel, leading to wasted marketing efforts and reduced sales opportunities.\n- Improving lead qualification criteria, aligning definitions between marketing and sales, or enhancing lead nurturing can increase this ratio.\n- High conversion rates mean more efficient use of sales resources, shorter sales cycles, and potentially higher revenue from marketing efforts.\n- Recognizing these variances helps organizations identify areas for process improvement and optimize their marketing-sales handoff to maximize revenue generation.\n\n![A performance dashboard showing high industry averages of 45-75% conversion from MQL to SAL](image7)"}
