The majority of voters viewed the 2016 contest as extraordinarily negative, with 92% stating there was more mudslinging than in past elections [7]. This negative atmosphere is further emphasized by the emotional responses of Clinton voters, who often described their feelings as \"shocked,\" \"disappointed,\" and \"disgusted\" [8]. The table also highlights the emotional landscape, showing that Trump voters were more likely to feel positive emotions like \"happy\" and \"surprised,\" while Clinton voters were more likely to feel \"shocked\" and \"disappointed\" [3]. ![{The table shows the emotional reactions of Trump and Clinton voters}](image3) \n\nThe correlation between these emotional reactions and the perception of Trump's performance is evident, as the overall sentiment towards Trump and the campaign actors was largely negative, with the Democratic and Republican parties receiving failing grades from a significant portion of voters [3]. The emotional responses of voters thus reflect not only their personal feelings about Trump's victory but also their broader assessment of the election's conduct and the political climate. ![{The bar chart shows the distribution of emotions among voters}](image5) \n\nIn summary, the emotional reactions of Trump and Clinton voters following the 2016 election differ significantly, with Trump supporters expressing hope and pride, while Clinton supporters reported feelings of unease, sadness, and fear. These emotions correlate with the overall perception of Trump's performance and the intense mudslinging observed throughout the campaign."}

This reflects a broader ideological divide between the two parties on the role of government in addressing job displacement caused by automation.\n\n![{partisan views on government responsibility for displaced workers}](image3)  \nThis image breaks down public opinion on whether the government or individuals should be responsible for displaced workers, clearly showing a stark partisan split.\n\nQuote [6] reveals that despite these divisions, there is notable alignment on the question of whether businesses should be limited in how many human jobs they can replace with machines. Over half of both Republicans (54%) and Democrats (60%) support such limits, indicating a shared concern about the impact of automation on employment.\n\n![{support for limiting job replacement by businesses}](image4)  \nThe image highlights the support among Democrats and Republicans for imposing limits on how many human jobs businesses can replace with machines, demonstrating a surprising degree of consensus.\n\nFinally, quote [5] mentions educational divisions alongside partisan ones, suggesting that factors beyond political affiliation also influence opinions on automation-related policies.

About half (47%) of Americans think Trump will be an unsuccessful president, which is much higher than the shares who held similar views about his three most recent predecessors at comparable points in their first terms [9]. This reflects a broader shift in public sentiment, where **Republicans’ views of Trump’s long-term outlook** are more optimistic than those of Democrats, even when considering historical comparisons [6].\n\nIn addition to these partisan differences, there has been a noticeable **polarization in economic policy views** since 2017. Nearly 80% of Republicans and Republican leaners believe Trump’s economic policies have improved conditions, up from 63% in October 2017, while Democrats have grown increasingly negative toward these policies [8]. This polarization underscores how public opinion on Trump’s policies has become more divided over time.\n\n![{Opinions on whether Trump's policies made things better or worse}](image2)\n\nOverall, the data suggests that **public opinion on Trump’s presidency is deeply polarized**, with strong partisan divisions shaping perceptions of his success and impact.

This divergence highlights how political alignment influences perceptions of socialism among Hispanics.\n\nWhen it comes to capitalism, the pattern is somewhat different. A larger share of Hispanics have a negative than positive impression of socialism, with 53% negative and 41% positive [5]. However, Hispanics generally have a more positive view of capitalism, with 54% holding a positive impression compared to 41% negative [5]. This positive sentiment toward capitalism is consistent across various groups, including U.S. adults, who also show a similar trend [10].\n\n![{Hispanic views on socialism and capitalism by political affiliation}](image1)  \nThe bar chart in image1 illustrates the net attitudes of different groups toward socialism and capitalism. It shows that \"All Hispanics\" have a net positive of 54 and negative of 41, while \"Dem/Lean Dem\" have a net positive of 50 and negative of 47. On the other hand, \"Rep/Lean Rep\" have a net positive of 68 and negative of 29, indicating a stronger positive perception of capitalism among Republicans and Republican leaners.\n\nAdditionally, image3 provides further insight into these views, showing that \"All Hispanics\" have a negative perception of being Hispanic, with 53% negative and 41% positive. Democrats/Lean Dem show a more balanced view, with 48% negative and 50% positive, whereas Republicans/Lean Rep have a significantly more negative perception, with 72% negative and 24% positive. These findings reinforce the idea that political affiliation plays a crucial role in shaping opinions on both socialism and capitalism among Hispanics.\n\nIn summary, Hispanic views on socialism and capitalism differ significantly based on political affiliation, with Democrats and Democratic leaners generally having more positive or balanced views, while Republicans and Republican leaners tend to hold more negative perspectives."}

As noted in the text, label diversity is a crucial factor in improving the performance and robustness of active querying strategies [2]. \n\n![{label diversity comparison}](image3)  \nThe image above illustrates the impact of label diversity on the performance of different active querying strategies across three MedMNIST datasets: PathMNIST, OrganMNIST, and BloodMNIST. The red dots represent the performance with label diversity, while the gray dots show the performance without it. Most strategies, such as BALD, Margin, VAAL, and Uncertainty, demonstrate improved performance when label diversity is enforced. However, some strategies like VAAL are observed to have lower performance and less robustness in certain scenarios, particularly when label diversity is not considered.\n\n[8] Furthermore, the text highlights that biased querying strategies, such as Entropy, Margin, VAAL, and others, tend to select data that is skewed towards specific classes, leading to unbalanced class distributions in the selected queries. This bias can exacerbate the cold start problem, especially in imbalanced datasets like CIFAR-10-LT and medical imaging datasets [9].\n\n![{data map comparison}](image2)  \nThis image provides a visual analysis of two medical imaging datasets, PathMNIST and OrganAMNIST, focusing on an active querying approach using Dataset Maps. It compares methods that rely on ground truth versus those using pseudo-labels. For instance, in OrganAMNIST, VAAL is shown to prefer selecting data from the femur-right and platelet classes while largely ignoring data from the lung, liver, and monocyte classes. In contrast, the proposed querying strategy selects more data from minority classes like femur-left and basophil while maintaining the distribution of major classes [6].\n\n[4] Table 7 further supports this observation, showing that enforcing label diversity significantly improves the AUC scores of most querying strategies in low budget regimes. Strategies that do not incorporate label diversity, such as VAAL, often fail to sample at least one data point for each class, indicating poor label diversity.\n\nIn conclusion, the querying strategy that yields the worst label diversity generally on all the datasets is VAAL."}

This encoding is then combined with the embedding of the previous system action to update the dialogue state within a dialogue-level LSTM [4].\n\nOnce the dialogue state is updated, it is used by the dialogue state tracker to identify and track relevant goal slots, such as \"date\" or \"time,\" which are essential for understanding the user's intent [7].

This suggests that the benefit of alignment is not uniform and depends on the specific language pair and their inherent linguistic relationships.\n\nIn contrast, **image4** illustrates how pre-training improves BLEU scores, particularly when training data is limited. The graphs indicate that pre-trained models outperform standard models, with the gain being more pronounced at smaller training set sizes. This implies that pre-training is most beneficial when the baseline system is not already highly effective, which aligns with findings from **text [2]**, where BLEU gains are highest when the baseline system is moderately effective but not overly poor.\n\nMoreover, **text [7]** highlights that aligning embeddings helps increase BLEU scores for all three tasks, as it allows the model to learn correspondences more efficiently. However, **image2** shows that the alignment of word embeddings was not consistently beneficial across all languages, with gains or losses being largely insignificant in some cases. This suggests that while alignment can be helpful, its impact is context-dependent and may not always lead to improvements.\n\nIn summary, the alignment of word embeddings can positively affect BLEU scores, especially when the source and target languages are linguistically distant, but its effectiveness varies based on the specific language pair and the quality of the baseline system.  \n**The alignment of word embeddings can enhance BLEU scores, but its impact varies depending on the linguistic similarity of the languages and the baseline performance of the translation system.**"}

Similarly, the absence of relation types leads to marginal improvements but still indicates that more informative graph construction is needed [9].\n\n![{Performance comparison without R-GCN and relation types}](image1)  \nThe table illustrates the impact of removing R-GCN and relation types on model performance. For example, \"No R-GCN\" achieves 62.4 (unmasked) and 63.2 (masked), while \"No relation types\" scores 62.7 (unmasked) and 63.9 (masked), showing a slight drop in performance when these components are omitted.\n\n[3] The removal of DOC-BASED connections, which are crucial for connecting mentions within the same document, leads to a significant drop in performance, as noted in the text. This highlights the importance of document-based connections in maintaining contextual information necessary for accurate predictions [1]. In contrast, the removal of MATCH and COREF connections has a less severe impact, though coreference links and complement edges play a marginal role [1].\n\n![{Performance comparison without specific relations}](image1)  \nThe table further demonstrates the effect of removing specific relations.

In the **masked setting**, coreference links are more effectively utilized because all mentions of an entity are labeled with the same unique surface form (e.g., \"MASK1\"), making it easier for the model to recognize and leverage these relationships. This is reflected in the results where the model performs better when coreference information is included in the masked condition, as the model can directly access the coreference links without ambiguity [10].\n\nHowever, in the **unmasked setting**, coreference information appears to have a less significant impact. This is likely due to the variability in surface forms of entity mentions (e.g., \"US\" vs \"United States\") and the limitations of the coreference system employed, which may not reliably resolve all instances. As noted in the analysis, removing coreference features (No COREF) only slightly affects performance, suggesting that other relation types, such as DOC-BASED connections, play a more critical role in the unmasked setting [6].\n\n![{coreference impact on performance}(image2)]  \nThe table in image2 provides a direct comparison of model performance with and without coreference information.

GEM outperforms naive fine-tuning and EWC in preventing catastrophic forgetting, as evidenced by its higher joint accuracy on both the original four domains and the new domain. For instance, GEM achieves $34.73\\%$ joint accuracy on the attraction domain, surpassing the $29.39\\%$ of naive fine-tuning [1]. Furthermore, when expanding the TRADE model from four domains to a new one, GEM maintains higher performance on the original domains, dropping joint accuracy from $58.98\\%$ to $53.54\\%$, while naive fine-tuning drops significantly to $36.08\\%$ [5].\n\n![{GEM outperforms naive and EWC in maintaining performance across domains}](image3)  \n[6] The comparison of fine-tuning strategies is further supported by Table 3, which shows that GEM consistently outperforms both Naive and EWC in terms of overcoming catastrophic forgetting. This suggests that GEM's approach of constraining gradients during fine-tuning helps preserve knowledge from previously learned domains [9].\n\n[7] Slot similarities play a crucial role in performance, as demonstrated by the zero-shot analysis in Fig. 5. Knowledge about slots like people, area, price range, and day is successfully transferred from other domains, indicating that similar slots benefit from shared representations. However, for unseen slots that appear only in one domain, such as parking, stars, and internet in the hotel domain, or food in the restaurant domain, tracking accuracy is lower due to the lack of prior knowledge [7].\n\n![{Knowledge transfer between domains based on slot similarity}](image2)  \n[7] The heatmap in image5 visualizes the cosine similarity between embeddings for different slots, revealing that slots with related attributes (e.g., \"price range\" and \"stars\") exhibit high similarity, suggesting they share learned representations. This supports the idea that slot similarities contribute to better performance in zero-shot settings, as models can leverage shared features across domains.\n\nIn conclusion, GEM outperforms EWC and naive fine-tuning in adapting to new domain data by preserving performance on previously learned domains and transferring knowledge effectively to new ones, with slot similarities playing a key role in this adaptation process."}

For example, in Spanish, the accuracy for stereotypical translations reaches 67%, while non-stereotypical translations only achieve 46%. This trend is observed across multiple languages, as illustrated by the performance metrics in Table 2 [4].\n\nMoreover, the study emphasizes that even in languages like German, where some systems perform relatively better, the overall accuracy remains suboptimal, often not surpassing random guessing. This suggests a systemic issue in how MT systems handle gender-related content.\n\nIn summary, translation accuracy and gender bias are closely linked, with most systems showing a preference for stereotypical gender roles over more neutral or anti-stereotypical ones, especially in languages like French, Hebrew, and Arabic."}

This suggests that incorporating such signals can mitigate the influence of gender stereotypes in translations.\n\n![{Stereotype-based adjustments reduce gender bias in Spanish, Russian, and Ukrainian}](image2)\n\nIn addition, the bar chart in Figure 1 highlights the consistent performance difference between stereotypical and non-stereotypical gender role assignments across all tested languages. For example, in Spanish, the accuracy for stereotypical roles is 67%, while it drops to 46% for non-stereotypical roles [1]. This disparity indicates that translation systems are more prone to gender bias when dealing with non-stereotypical assignments.\n\n![{Performance comparison of Google Translate on stereotypical vs. non-stereotypical translations}](image1)\n\nFurthermore, the table in image3 provides concrete examples of how adding stereotypical adjectives can correct biased translations. In one instance, the adjective \"pretty\" was added to the noun \"baker,\" resulting in a more accurate feminine translation in Spanish [3]. This demonstrates that explicit signals can help align translations with context, thereby reducing gender bias.\n\nOverall, stereotype-based adjustments have a measurable impact on reducing gender bias in machine translation, particularly in languages like Spanish, Russian, and Ukrainian.

However, when a \"Gold Paragraph\" is added to the \"Open-domain 500 Paragraphs\" setting, the F1 score increases to 53.12, highlighting the importance of retrieving relevant information for accurate answers.\n\nIn the context of training strategies, image4 illustrates the impact of using original versus adversarial distractors during training. When evaluated on original data, the model trained on original distractors achieves a score of 67.08, while the model trained on adversarial distractors scores 59.12. However, when evaluated on adversarial data, the model trained on adversarial distractors performs better, achieving a score of 60.10 compared to 46.84 for the model trained on original distractors. This indicates that adversarial training can improve the model's ability to handle challenging questions.\n\nAdditionally, image1 provides a comprehensive comparison of F1 scores across multiple models under different settings. Models like BERT Plus and DecompRC show high performance in the \"Distractor\" setting, with scores reaching up to 69.76, while other models such as MultiQA and Cognitive Graph demonstrate varying degrees of success in the \"Open\" setting.

This decrease can be attributed to strategic (gains) charges, such as the net pre-tax strategic gains of $268 million, or $0.26 per share, related to the sale of McDonald's Japan stock, as mentioned in [2]. These gains reduced the Company's ownership by about 6%.\n\nIn addition, the increase in selling, general, and administrative expenses, including support for marketing initiatives and higher restaurant closing costs, contributed to the overall reduction in earnings per share, as detailed in [7].\n\n![{Revenue Breakdown by Segment}](image4)  \nThe pie charts illustrate the revenue distribution across segments, showing that the U.S. and International Operated Markets were the largest contributors, with the latter experiencing a more pronounced decline.

The company emphasizes stability, growth, and efficiency as the three pillars of its financial strategy [7], which supports its long-term goals of sustainable growth and competitiveness. This strategic framework enables Toyota to allocate resources effectively toward initiatives that address climate-related risks and opportunities.\n\nIn terms of shareholder returns, Toyota maintains a consistent dividend policy, aiming to ensure stable and continuous payments while improving the consolidated payout ratio [10]. Financial data from 2017 to 2021 shows fluctuations in the payout ratio, but the overall trend reflects Toyota’s commitment to returning value to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases [5]. These actions are part of Toyota's broader effort to enhance corporate value and achieve sustainable growth, aligning with its financial strategy.\n\nRegarding electrification measures, Toyota is actively investing in advanced technologies and cost reduction strategies to support the transition toward a carbon-neutral society [6]. The company also engages in strategic dialogues with shareholders to encourage sustainable growth and improve corporate value [3]. Additionally, Toyota has endorsed the recommendations of the Financial Stability Board’s Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), demonstrating its transparency and proactive approach to climate-related financial risks [9].\n\nThe **infographic** provides a comprehensive overview of how Toyota is addressing climate scenarios, including risks such as tightening regulations for fuel efficiency and zero-emission vehicles (ZEVs) and opportunities like increased sales of electrified vehicles [4].

This suggests that the goodwill was not impaired during the period.\n\nThe comparison between 2021 and 2020 was heavily influenced by the pandemic, which had a material impact on most markets where the Group operated due to lockdown measures and restricted mobility [4]. This led to significant disruptions, including up to 90% of stores being closed in the first quarter of 2020. These conditions likely affected the financial performance of acquired entities, thus influencing the goodwill valuation.\n\n![{The table provides insights into the changes in goodwill components over the periods, including acquisitions, disposals, transfers, and foreign exchange translation differences}](image4)\n\nGoodwill arising from the acquisition or termination of franchise contracts corresponds to the amount of intangible assets that did not meet the requirements established in IFRS 3 for separate recognition, primarily based on their capacity to generate future cash flows [9].

This increase in Credit Risk RWA would have contributed to a higher total RWA, which in turn affects the capital ratios and regulatory compliance requirements.\n\n![{Credit Risk RWA and Total RWA Changes}(image2)]  \nThe table in image2 illustrates that the final balance of Credit Risk RWA at December 31, 2020, was $387,066 million under the Standardized approach and $284,930 million under the Advanced approach, indicating a substantial increase compared to the initial balances in 2019. This growth in Credit Risk RWA likely required the institution to maintain higher levels of capital to meet regulatory requirements, thereby influencing its capital composition and allocation.\n\nRegarding External TLAC as a percentage of RWA, the data from image5 shows that this ratio increased from 49.9% in 2019 to 47.7% in 2020. While this represents a slight decrease in percentage terms, the absolute value of External TLAC rose from $196,888 million to $216,129 million. This suggests that the institution maintained a strong capacity to absorb losses relative to its RWA, which is crucial for regulatory compliance and financial resilience.\n\nThe combination of increased Credit Risk RWA and the stable or slightly improved External TLAC as a percentage of RWA indicates that the institution had to manage its capital structure more carefully to ensure it met all regulatory requirements.

This decline was attributed to lower income from short-term investments and fixed maturity securities, as noted in [6]. Despite this, dividend income increased by 3.5% in 2021, reflecting continued returns from preferred stock investments, as mentioned in [4]. The overall effective income tax rate also declined slightly, indicating improved tax efficiency.  \n\nIn terms of asset composition, the insurance business maintained a substantial portion of its assets in equity securities, which grew from $269.5 billion in 2020 to $334.9 billion in 2021, as shown in [image1]. This increase in equity holdings contributed to higher volatility in earnings due to market price fluctuations, as highlighted in [9]. Additionally, the value of fixed maturity securities declined from $20.3 billion in 2020 to $16.4 billion in 2021, further impacting investment income.  \n\nThe implications of these changes include heightened earnings volatility due to the large equity portfolio and reduced returns from fixed-income assets, which may affect long-term profitability and stability. However, the emphasis on maintaining liquidity through cash and short-term U.S. Treasury Bills suggests a strategic focus on safety over yield, as noted in [6].  \n\nThe combination of rising equity holdings and falling fixed-income returns underscores the need for careful risk management in the insurance sector, particularly given the sensitivity of these assets to market conditions and interest rate fluctuations."}

Share-based compensation, as noted in [5], contributes to changes in equity through the issuance of restricted share units and adjustments to additional paid-in capital. Specifically, the compensation expense increased restricted share units by 1,118,284 and added $79,522 to additional paid-in capital, resulting in a net increase of $1,197,806 to shareholders' equity. This reflects the company's investment in its employees through equity incentives, which can enhance long-term employee retention and alignment with company performance.\n\nCash flow from operating activities, detailed in image2, provides insight into the company’s ability to generate cash from its core business operations. The net income for 2020 was $5,185,313, and after adjustments for non-cash items such as depreciation, amortization, and share-based compensation, the operating cash flow would reflect the actual cash generated by the company's operations. This cash is crucial for sustaining operations, funding growth, and maintaining financial flexibility. Additionally, the cash flow from operating activities would influence the overall cash position, as it directly impacts the company's liquidity.\n\n![{Share-based compensation and its effect on shareholders' equity}(image5)]  \n![{Cash flows from operating activities for 2020}(image2)]  \n\nIn summary, share-based compensation enhances shareholders' equity by increasing restricted share units and additional paid-in capital, while cash flow from operating activities supports the company's financial stability and liquidity."}

Total assets decreased from $191,367 million in 2020 to $188,548 million in 2021, reflecting a reduction of approximately $2,819 million. This decrease is primarily attributed to a decline in cash and cash equivalents, which fell from $32,965 million in 2020 to $22,028 million in 2021. Additionally, there was a notable reduction in interest-bearing deposits in other banks, which dropped from $29,824 million to $20,548 million during the same period.\n\n![{Total assets and liabilities comparison](image3)]  \n\nOn the liabilities side, total liabilities also decreased slightly from $168,383 million in 2020 to $166,371 million in 2021, indicating a reduction of about $2,012 million.

The net loss of $Z1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, as mentioned in text quote [1], indicates a negative impact on comprehensive income. This loss is partially offset by the net gains recognized in Other, net expenses, which include a gain of $S3 million related to a change in the fair value of an embedded derivative in 2019. \n\nThe cash flow statement in image2 provides further insight into these changes. The net cash provided by operating activities decreased from $13,632 million in 2019 to $5,591 million in 2020 and $14,645 million in 2021, reflecting fluctuations in the entity's operational performance. The significant decrease in cash and cash equivalents from $54.6 billion in 2020 to $24.6 billion in 2021, as noted in text quote [10], underscores the impact of various financial activities such as increases in Card Member loans and receivables, debt maturities, share repurchases, and reductions in customer deposits.\n\nIn summary, the significant changes in total assets and total liabilities from 2020 to 2021 are closely tied to the entity's comprehensive income and cash flows, with a notable decrease in cash and cash equivalents impacting both financial position and operational performance."}

In WPB, revenue also reduced from lower unsecured lending, a fall in credit card spending and lower sales in insurance. This implies that the Wealth and Personal Banking segment, being part of WPB, experienced a reduction in revenue.\n\n[9] Reported revenue down 10% to $\\S50.4$ bn, impact of lower interest rates across our global businesses, in part offset by higher revenue in Global Markets.

These figures further support the notion of declining revenue due to interest rate impacts.\n\n[10] Reported profit before tax of $\\S8.8\\mathsf{b n}$ was $\\S4.6\\mathsf{b n}$ or 34% lower due to a rise in reported ECL, primarily reflecting the impact of the Covid-19 outbreak on the forward economic outlook, and a fall in reported revenue, mainly from lower global interest rates. These factors indicate a significant decline in profitability, likely affecting the Wealth and Personal Banking segment.\n\n![{Reported revenue and operating expenses for the Wealth and Personal Banking segment in 2018}](image5)\n\n[5] The reported revenue for the group in 2020 was $\\S50.4$ bn, which was 10% lower than in 2019, suggesting a decline in revenue for the Wealth and Personal Banking segment. Additionally, the reported profit before tax was down 34% to $\\S8.8\\mathsf{b n}$, indicating a significant drop in profitability.\n\n[10] The fall in reported profit was due to an increase in our expected credit losses and other credit impairment charges (‘ECL’) and a reduction in reported revenue. These factors were partly mitigated by lower reported operating expenses. This suggests that the Wealth and Personal Banking segment may have experienced a decrease in both revenue and profitability between 2018 and 2019.\n\nIn summary, the reported revenue and operating expenses for the Wealth and Personal Banking segment declined between 2018 and 2019, influenced by lower global interest rates and the impact of the Covid-19 outbreak."}

The significant decrease in interest income outpaced the decrease in interest expenses, leading to a notable downturn in net interest income. This suggests that the net interest spread was negatively affected by the reduction in interest rates and the structural shifts in the composition of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities.\n\nThe main contributing factors to these changes included lower interest rates, which reduced both the yield on earning assets and the cost of interest-bearing liabilities.

During the year ended 28 June 2020, additional lease liabilities were recognized for new stores and re-measured due to changes in existing lease terms, resulting in an increase of $50,245. The total lease liability at the end of the period was $167,154, with a current portion of $36,019 and a non-current portion of $131,135.\n\nAdditionally, the adoption of AASB 16 changed how certain costs related to lease obligations were accounted for. For instance, site restoration costs are now capitalized as part of the lease right-of-use asset and depreciated over the lease term, whereas previously they were treated as provisions for future restoration costs. ![{Lease accounting changes}](image4) This shift affects the recognition and measurement of lease-related expenses and assets on the balance sheet.\n\nRegarding employee benefit liabilities, the financial impact was more modest. ![{Employee benefit liabilities}](image3) The table shows that the total employee benefit liabilities remained relatively stable between 2019 and 2020, with a slight increase from $4,054 thousand in 2019 to $4,092 thousand in 2020.

As shown in image1, a decrease in the discount rate by half a percentage point led to an increase in the DBO by approximately €271 million as of September 30, 2021, compared to €266 million in 2020. Similarly, changes in compensation increase and pension progression also influenced the DBO, with increases in these assumptions leading to higher obligations.\n\nPlan assets, which are crucial for funding the pension obligations, were managed through a liability-driven investment approach. The composition of plan assets is detailed in image2, showing that fixed income securities, particularly corporate bonds, formed a significant portion of the portfolio. The total plan assets increased from €2,813 million in 2020 to €3,259 million in 2021, reflecting strategic adjustments to mitigate risks associated with the DBO.\n\nActuarial gains and losses, as depicted in image3, further illustrate the impact of changing assumptions. In 2021, there was a net actuarial loss of €22 million, primarily due to changes in financial assumptions, while in 2020, there was a net gain of €67 million. These fluctuations underscore the sensitivity of the DBO to actuarial assumptions and the importance of ongoing risk management strategies.\n\nIn summary, changes in actuarial assumptions had a substantial impact on both the defined benefit obligation and plan assets, necessitating careful monitoring and strategic adjustments to ensure long-term financial stability."}

This decline was partially offset by positive sales performance in the U.S., which was supported by marketing efforts such as the free Thank You Meals served to first responders and healthcare workers [1]. Additionally, the Company's strategic marketing investments and promotional activities, along with growth in delivery, had a positive impact on comparable sales in the second half of 2020 [4].\n\n![{U.S. and International Operated Markets revenue changes](image2)]  \nThe table highlights that the U.S. segment had a 0% change in 2020 compared to 2019, while the International Operated Markets segment saw a significant decline of 15.0% in 2020, primarily due to the temporary restaurant closures and limited operations caused by the pandemic [3]. The decline was most pronounced in markets such as France, the U.K., Germany, Italy, and Spain [3].\n\n![{Revenue data for U.S. and International Operated Markets](image3)]  \nThe revenue data further illustrates that company-operated sales in the U.S. decreased by 4% in 2020, while franchised revenues decreased by 2%. In contrast, the International Operated Markets segment experienced more severe declines, with company-operated sales dropping by 19% and franchised revenues falling by 14% [3].\n\nThe decline in the International Operated Markets segment was largely driven by the impact of the pandemic, which led to temporary closures and reduced operations in several key markets [3]. However, the U.S. segment managed to maintain some level of stability through targeted marketing efforts and support for franchisees, including incentives to accelerate recovery and drive growth [1].\n\nThe overall revenue composition also reflects the broader trend of declining margins in both segments. The bar chart in image1 shows that franchised margins decreased from $9,455 million in 2019 to $8,519 million in 2020, while company-operated margins fell from $1,660 million to $1,158 million [1]. These decreases were influenced by higher depreciation costs related to investments in the \"Experience of the Future\" initiative and incremental COVID-19 expenses such as employee-related costs and personal protective equipment [6].\n\nThe U.S. segment's resilience was partly due to its strong franchised model, which accounted for 93% of McDonald's restaurants worldwide [9]. This model is designed to generate stable and predictable revenue, largely based on franchisee sales and resulting cash flow streams. However, government regulations related to public health measures continued to pose challenges, particularly in international markets [9].\n\nIn summary, the U.S. segment showed relative stability, supported by strategic marketing and franchisee incentives, while the International Operated Markets segment faced significant declines due to the ongoing effects of the pandemic. The changes in revenue composition and growth rates were influenced by both external factors such as the pandemic and internal strategies aimed at recovery and growth."}

For coal, the underlying EBITDA decreased by US$1.3 billion to US$288 million in FY2021, influenced by lower price impacts, net of price-linked costs, of US$0.7 billion, and lower volumes decreasing EBITDA by US$168 million [2]. Additionally, Queensland Coal unit costs are expected to be between US$80 and US$90 per tonne in FY2022 due to higher diesel prices, though efficiency improvements aim to offset increased stripping requirements [6]. The average realised sales price for FY2021 was US$16,250 per tonne, reflecting a strong rebound in end-use demand and supply disruptions [10].\n\n![{The table shows the financial impact of changes in commodity prices on profit after taxation from continuing operations and on underlying EBITDA, expressed in US$ million.}](image1)\n\nFor nickel, underlying EBITDA increased by US$296 million to US$259 million in FY2021, driven by higher prices and volumes, along with lower maintenance and contractor costs following major shutdowns and transitions [1]. However, unfavourable exchange rate movements and the adverse impacts of stronger nickel prices on third-party concentrate purchase costs partially offset these gains [1]. The report also notes that a US$1 per ton increase in the nickel price impacts both profit after taxation and underlying EBITDA by US$1 million [image1].\n\nThe key drivers behind these impacts include market price fluctuations, which are a primary value driver for BHP [5], as well as operational factors such as maintenance costs, exchange rates, and production efficiencies [1][6]. These factors collectively influence the financial outcomes for both coal and nickel segments. \n\nThe overall impact of commodity price changes on BHP's financial results is significant, with variations affecting the feasibility of projects, expansion plans, and the continuation of existing assets [4]."}

In contrast, self-identified non-Hispanics are predominantly of the third or higher generation, with 96% falling into this category [4]. This suggests that non-Hispanics are more likely to have lost direct ties to Hispanic ancestry, contributing to a fading Hispanic identity across generations.\n\n![{Non-Hispanic heritage more common among higher generations of those with Hispanic ancestry}](image4)  \nThis image highlights the generational distribution of self-identified Hispanics and non-Hispanics, showing that non-Hispanics are overwhelmingly from the third or higher generation, reinforcing the idea of a weakened connection to Hispanic heritage.\n\nAs generations advance, the likelihood of identifying with ancestral national origins decreases. For instance, only 44% of third-generation Hispanics feel very or somewhat connected to their family’s country of origin, compared to 82% of immigrants and 69% of second-generation Hispanics [4]. This decline is further reflected in cultural practices, such as participation in Hispanic celebrations, where only 35% of third-generation Hispanics report such experiences during childhood, compared to 49% of second-generation Hispanics [5].\n\nMoreover, intermarriage rates among Hispanics remain relatively high, but they vary by generation. While 78% of all married Hispanics have a Hispanic spouse, this share drops significantly among third-generation Hispanics, with only 35% having a Hispanic spouse [6]. This pattern underscores a broader shift away from maintaining strong Hispanic cultural ties over time.\n\nIn terms of language and cultural markers, third-generation Hispanics are far less likely to speak Spanish or have a Spanish last name, with 92% not speaking Spanish and 92% not having a Spanish last name [5]. These findings illustrate how the connection to Hispanic heritage becomes increasingly tenuous as generations move further from the immigrant experience.\n\nThe generational breakdown thus reveals that heritage identification among self-identified Hispanics diminishes over time, while non-Hispanics, who are largely of later generations, show even greater disconnection from Hispanic ancestry."}

This dramatic increase was largely driven by the impact of the Transcontinental Railroad Act and the Homestead Act of 1862, which transformed Nebraska into a hub for agricultural expansion and settlement [9]. These acts encouraged migration and land development, leading to a significant influx of settlers and the establishment of communities like Aurora, Kronborg, and Hordville [8].\n\nHowever, after peaking in 1890, the population began a slow decline, with numbers fluctuating between 13,330 in 1900 and 9,982 in 1940. By 2000, the population had stabilized at 9,403, showing a slight increase from earlier decades [3]. This trend reflects broader patterns of rural depopulation and consolidation seen across the Midwest and Great Plains, where many small towns struggled to maintain their populations due to factors such as farm consolidation and economic shifts [2].\n\nThe decline in farm numbers and the rise in average farm size, due to mechanization and increased operational costs, also played a crucial role in shaping these demographic changes [4]. As farms became larger and more efficient, smaller family farms were unable to compete, leading to the abandonment of rural areas and the eventual consolidation of school districts and other community institutions [6].\n\n![Population Trends in Hamilton County](image3)  \nThe data illustrates the population fluctuations from 1870 to 2000, highlighting the initial surge and subsequent decline.\n\nAdditionally, the cultural and religious diversity of the region, including the establishment of churches like St. John’s Lutheran Church in Kronborg, contributed to the social fabric of these communities [7].

It creates and stores multimodal embeddings for visual images and text descriptions, enabling efficient retrieval of similar results. As shown in Fig. 3, this component uses an index system based on the HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World) algorithm [35] to facilitate fast and accurate retrieval.

Tree Traversal Retrieval processes the tree layer-by-layer, starting from the root and selecting the top-k most relevant nodes at each level based on cosine similarity to the query vector. This method progressively narrows down the search, focusing on finer details as it moves through the tree layers [7]. In contrast, Collapsed Tree Retrieval evaluates all nodes simultaneously across all layers, flattening the multi-layered tree into a single layer for comparison. This allows the retrieval process to consider information at various levels of granularity simultaneously, which can better match the required detail level for a given question [3].\n\n![{Tree Traversal and Collapsed Tree Retrieval methods}](image2)  \n\nAs illustrated in the image, both methods begin with encoding the query into a vector, but they diverge in how they handle the tree structure. Tree Traversal follows a sequential path through the tree, while Collapsed Tree collapses the structure into one layer, enabling a more flexible and comprehensive search [8]. The collapsed tree approach is noted for its ability to retrieve information that aligns with the correct level of granularity for the question, offering greater flexibility compared to the fixed ratio of node levels seen in tree traversal [1].\n\nIn terms of performance, the collapsed tree method has been shown to consistently outperform tree traversal in controlled experiments, particularly in tasks requiring complex reasoning and multi-hop question answering [1]. The effectiveness of these methods is further supported by empirical results, such as the significant improvements observed when using RAPTOR with collapsed tree retrieval on the QuALITY benchmark, where performance increased by 20% in absolute accuracy [6].\n\nThe difference in their approaches directly impacts the quality and relevance of the retrieved context, making the choice between them dependent on the specific requirements of the task."}

Specifically, the SWEM- concat model even outperforms a 29-layer deep CNN model (Conneau et al., 2016) when predicting topics. However, this statement refers to topic categorization rather than sentiment analysis.\n\n[2] The text also mentions that on the Yelp Polarity dataset, SWEM shows significantly higher accuracy than CNN for a large range of low subspace dimension, indicating that SWEM is more parameter-efficient to get a decent solution. This suggests that SWEM performs well on sentiment analysis tasks, including Yelp Polarity.\n\n[4] In the context of sentiment analysis datasets, SWEM yields inferior accuracies compared to CNN/LSTM compositional functions. This indicates that SWEM may not be as effective at extracting representations from short sentences as it is from long documents. However, it still exhibits comparable performance on other tasks with much fewer parameters and faster training.\n\n[5] The SWEM- hier variant greatly outperforms the other three SWEM variants, and the corresponding accuracies are comparable to the results of CNN or LSTM (Table 2). This indicates that the hierarchical pooling operation manages to abstract spatial (word-order) information from the input sequence, which is beneficial for performance in sentiment analysis tasks.\n\n[7] Surprisingly, on most of the datasets considered (except WikiQA), SWEM demonstrates the best results compared with those with CNN or the LSTM encoder. Notably, on the SNLI dataset, we observe that SWEM- max performs the best among all SWEM variants, consistent with the findings in Nie and Bansal (2017); Conneau et al. (2017), that max-pooling over BiLSTM hidden units outperforms average pooling operation on SNLI dataset. As a result, with only 120K parameters, our SWEM- max achieves a test accuracy of 83.8%, which is very competitive among state-of-the-art sentence encoding-based models (in terms of both performance and number of parameters).\n\n[8] For the sentiment analysis tasks, both CNN and LSTM compositional functions perform better than SWEM, suggesting that word-order information may be required for analyzing sentiment orientations. This finding is consistent with Pang et al. (2002), where they hypothesize that the positional information of a word in text sequences may be beneficial to predict sentiment. This is intuitively reasonable since, for instance, the phrase “not really good” and “really not good” convey different levels of negative sentiment, while being different only by their word orderings. Contrary to SWEM, CNN and LSTM models can both capture this type of information via convolutional filters or recurrent transition functions.\n\n[9] We have also tried our SWEM-concat and SWEM-hier models on Sogou news corpus (with the same experimental setup as (Zhang et al., 2015b)), which is a Chinese dataset represented by Pinyin (a phonetic romanization of Chinese). SWEM-concat yields an accuracy of 91.3%, while SWEM-hier (with a local window size of 5) obtains an accuracy of 96.2% on the test set. Notably, the performance of SWEM-hier is comparable to the best accuracies of CNN (95.6%) and LSTM (95.2%), as reported in (Zhang et al., 2015b). This indicates that hierarchical pooling is more suitable than average/max pooling for Chinese text classification, by taking spatial information into account. It also implies that Chinese is more sensitive to local word-order features than English.\n\n![{SWEM outperforms CNN and LSTM in efficiency and accuracy}](image1)"}

We validate the effectiveness of fine-tuning the MLLM or just in-context learning (training-free) for ranking. The results are illustrated in Tab. 6. We select two distinct groups for comparison. The first group (top and fourth rows) involves models that are fine-tuned using the FGVC-Aircraft dataset, while the second group (third and bottom rows) consists of models with in-context learning prompts for ranking. The results show a consistent improvement in accuracy for the fine-tuned model across almost all datasets for both QWen-VL and InternLM-XC2. The notable enhancement in performance across a diverse range of datasets highlights the efficacy of our fine-tuning strategy. The results substantiate that fine-tuning the MLLM with target datasets like FGVC-Aircraft significantly bolsters the model’s ranking capabilities. \n\n![{RAR outperforms in-context learning on InternLM-XC2}](image4)  \nThe table shows that fine-tuning the RAR method with InternLM-XC2 consistently achieves higher performance compared to in-context learning strategies across various datasets. The green-highlighted values indicate superior results for the fine-tuned approach, demonstrating its reliability and effectiveness.\n\n[7] In-Context Learning for Ranking. In-context learning presents a valuable alternative to fine-tuning with ranking examples, particularly due to its flexibility and lower requirement for specialized data preparation. While fine-tuning with ranking examples has proven to be highly effective, it necessitates a substantial amount of curated data and computational resources for training. In contrast, in-context learning uses the model’s existing knowledge by providing it with specific examples directly within the input prompt, guiding the model to understand and execute the task of ranking without the need for explicit re-training. Here we elaborate on the application of in-context learning with MLLMs to rank the retrieved results. To effectively guide the MLLMs in comprehending the ranking task, we use the prompt format similar to Fig. 4 and integrate a specific ranking example into the prompts. Please refer to the Appendix B for our structured in-context learning prompt. Please refer to Sec. 4.5 for the ablation studies of discussing the difference between using fine-tuning or in-context learning for ranking.\n\n[8] To create our fine-tuning data, we use the CLIP image encoder $\\varPhi_{\\mathrm{img}}$ to extract the embeddings of two disjoint subsets of images $\\mathcal{D}_{a}$ and $\\mathcal{D}_{b}$, both drawn from the FGVC-Aircraft dataset. We provide the ablation studies in Sec. 4.5 about using different datasets to construct the fine-tuning data. Our observation reveals that the MLLM demonstrates robustness to the choice of fine-tuning datasets, with only marginal differences in performance outcomes.\n\n[5] Tab. 6 presents the results. We observe that RAR is not sensitive to changes in the fine-tuning dataset for ranking, thereby confirming its viability as a generalizable and reliable method for enhancing the performance of MLLMs. The consistency in results, irrespective of the fine-tuning data source, underlines the robustness of our fine-tuning strategy. Despite these minor variations, the overall performance of using FGVC-Aircrafts (82.7 % , top row) is higher than using Stanford Cars (82.0 % , second row) for QWen-VL, and we observe the same trend.\n\n[9] Comparison with Rare Classes Results ($\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{P_{r}}$). We find an interesting observation from the experimental results presented in Tab. 3. For the CLIP model, we observe a progressive increase in performance from $\\mathrm{AP_{r}}$ through AP $\\mathrm{c}$ to AP $^\\dag$, which indicates a gradation in precision across varying class frequencies. However, employing our method yields a different trend, where the peak performance is achieved on $A P_{r}$, surpassing the CLIP model by as much as 19.6 percentage points. This significant leap in performance suggests a substantial advantage of our method when it comes to rare categories. The integration of our RAR to MLLMs plays a pivotal role here, as it demonstrates a heightened ability to discriminate among the rare classes. Our observation could be attributed to the fact that our retrieving and reranking mechanism effectively pools relevant information from the external memory, providing the MLLMs with a richer context for rare class identification. Moreover, the ranking capability of MLLMs ensures that even the lesser-represented classes receive adequate attention during the classification process. Our RAR achieves a robust enhancement in the model’s ability to discern and accurately classify objects that are infrequently encountered, addressing one of the significant challenges in long-tailed distribution datasets.\n\nFine-tuning the RAR method with the InternLM-XC2 model consistently outperforms in-context learning across different datasets, as evidenced by the higher accuracy and robustness observed in the experimental results."}

As noted in the text, when repetition control is introduced, question-asking is reduced—specifically, the $z=10$ setting, which should produce $100\\%$ questions, only produces $79.67\\%$ questions. This reduction is primarily due to the weighted decoding feature `extrep bigram`, which discourages bigrams that have appeared in previous utterances, thereby preventing the model from producing common question-starting bigrams like \"do you\" and \"what is\" [3]. To address this issue, an additional setting $z=10 (boost)$ was introduced, where the model does not use the `extrep bigram` during beam search but uses it to rerank candidates after beam search, resulting in a $99.54\\%$ question-asking rate [3].\n\n![{reduction in question-asking with repetition control}](image4)  \nThe image illustrates how different methods control the frequency of question-asking in generated text. The **Question-controlled CT with repetition control** (purple line with squares) shows a more gradual increase in the percentage of questions compared to **Question-controlled CT** (blue line with circles), which approaches near 100% at higher control levels. This visual representation highlights the dampening effect of repetition control on question-asking frequency.\n\n[2] Furthermore, the study found that conditional training is preferable to weighted decoding for controlling question-asking because it allows precise control over the proportion of questions without introducing degenerate outputs. This method enables the model to achieve a wide range of question-asking rates, from $0\\%$ to $100\\%$, depending on the control variable $z$ [10].\n\n[3] In summary, the presence of repetition control reduces the frequency of question-asking in generated text by discouraging the use of common question-starting bigrams. However, this effect can be mitigated through adjustments in the decoding process, such as the $z=10 (boost)$ setting, which allows the model to maintain high question-asking rates while still applying repetition control [3]."}

While this is specific to English, it indicates that the annotation process is consistent and reliable, which indirectly supports the validity of F1 scores across different languages.\n\nQuote [6] discusses how performance varies by question type and language, noting that questions that are \"easy\" in English also seem to be easier in the target languages, but the drop in performance for the \"hard\" subset is not as dramatic as one might expect.

The relative strength of this and other baselines proves to be an important issue when designing multi-hop datasets, which we addressed through the measures described in Section 3.2. In Table 4 we compare the two relevant baselines on WIKI HOP before and after applying filtering measures. The absolute strength of these baselines before filtering shows how vital addressing this issue is: $74.6\\%$ accuracy could be reached through exploiting the cooccurrence $(d,c)$ statistic alone. This underlines the paramount importance of investigating and addressing dataset biases that otherwise would confound seemingly strong RC model performance. The relative drop demonstrates that ![{The table shows the performance comparison of different models on WIKIHOP before and after filtering, with the document-cue model achieving 74.6% accuracy before filtering and a reduced score after filtering.}](image2) \n\n[9] The TF-IDF retrieval baseline clearly performs better than random for WIKI HOP, but is not very strong overall. That is, the question tokens are helpful to detect relevant documents, but exploiting only this information compares poorly to the other baselines. On the other hand, as no co-mention of an interacting drug pair occurs within any single document in MED HOP, the TF-IDF baseline performs worse than random. We conclude that lexical matching with a single support document is not enough to build a strong predictive model for both datasets.\n\n[3] Most Reading Comprehension methods limit themselves to queries which can be answered using a single sentence, paragraph, or document. Enabling models to combine disjoint pieces of textual evidence would extend the scope of machine comprehension methods, but currently no resources exist to train and test this capability. We propose a novel task to encourage the development of models for text understanding across multiple documents and to investigate the limits of existing methods. In our task, a model learns to seek and combine evidence – effectively performing multi-hop, alias multi-step, inference. We devise a methodology to produce datasets for this task, given a collection of query-answer pairs and thematically linked documents. Two datasets from different domains are induced, and we identify potential pitfalls and devise circumvention strategies. We evaluate two previously proposed competitive models and find that one can integrate information across documents. However, both models struggle to select relevant information; and providing documents guaranteed to be relevant greatly improves their performance. While the models outperform several strong baselines, their best accuracy reaches $54.5\\%$ on an annotated test set, compared to human performance at $85.0\\%$, leaving ample room for improvement.\n\n[7] We conducted further experiments to examine the RC models when presented with only the relevant documents in $S_{q}$, i.e., the chain of documents leading to the correct answer. This allows us to investigate the hypothetical performance of the models if they were able to select and read only relevant documents: Table 6 summarizes these results. Models improve greatly in this gold chain setup, with up to $81.2\\%~/~85.7\\%$ on WIKI HOP in the masked setting for BiDAF. This demonstrates that RC models are capable of identifying the answer when few or no plausible false candidates are mentioned, which is particularly evident for MED HOP, where documents tend to discuss only single drug candidates. In the masked gold chain setup, models can then pick up on what the masking template looks like and achieve almost perfect scores. Conversely, these results also show that the models’ answer selection process is not robust to the introduction of unrelated documents with type-consistent candidates. This indicates that learning to intelligently select relevant documents before RC may be among the most promising directions for future model development.\n\nThe document-cue model's accuracy on WIKIHOP was significantly higher before filtering, reaching $74.6\\%$, but dropped considerably after filtering measures were applied, highlighting the importance of addressing dataset biases."}

This aligns with the hypothesis that positional information of words in text sequences is beneficial for predicting sentiment. ![{LSTM outperforms SWEM in sentiment analysis due to word-order sensitivity}](image1)\n\n[6] When word-order information is disrupted by shuffling the training set, the accuracy on sentiment analysis tasks, such as Yelp polarity, drops significantly.

In contrast, FastQA scores lower, with results of 35.8% (test) and 38.0% (test*).

In contrast, FastQA has fewer latent interactions, which may hinder its capacity to handle complex multi-hop reasoning tasks effectively.\n\n[4] Furthermore, the performance of these models varies when certain conditions are altered, such as masking or the presence of irrelevant documents.

The results are shown in Figure 4 and indicate that program-guided reasoning is particularly effective when the model size is small. As smaller models have less capacity for complex reasoning, the performance of the end-to-end **FLAN-T5** model decreases significantly with decreasing model size. However, this trend is less notable for **PROGRAM FC**. The high-level reasoning plan offered by reasoning programs substantially alleviates the demands on the subsequent sub-task solvers.

According to the text, this approach consistently achieves an average F1 gain of $2.4\\%$ across various IE tasks, including TACREV, with minimal additional latency and cost. This improvement is attributed to the strategic use of SLMs as filters to identify hard samples, which are then reranked by LLMs using appropriate prompting strategies.\n\n![{The filter-then-rerank paradigm effectively combines the strengths of SLMs and LLMs to improve performance on few-shot IE tasks, particularly on challenging datasets like TACREV.}](image2)\n\n[3] A key component of the filter-then-rerank framework is the identification of hard samples, which are reranked by LLMs to enhance overall performance. While the current method uses a simple unsupervised metric (maximum probabilities from SLMs) to assess sample difficulty, future work could explore more advanced difficulty metrics or calibrated SLMs to further improve results.\n\n[6] The filter-then-rerank paradigm involves using SLMs as filters to determine sample difficulty and LLMs as rerankers for hard samples. For the TACREV dataset, the threshold $\\tau$ to determine sample difficulty is optimized on the valid set. Hard samples are reranked by LLMs using ICL with 4-shot demos, which significantly improves performance on these challenging cases.\n\n[8] The selective reranking of hard samples in the filter-then-rerank approach leads to substantial performance gains, even though only a minor fraction (0.5%–10%) of samples are deemed hard. On the TACREV dataset, reranking these hard samples results in a significant absolute F1 gain (10%–25%), demonstrating the effectiveness of this strategy.\n\n[9] The filter-then-rerank framework leverages the strengths of both SLMs and LLMs by using SLMs for initial predictions and filtering, while LLMs handle reranking for hard samples. This approach minimizes the extra latency and budget costs associated with calling LLMs, while still achieving consistent F1 improvements. On the TACREV dataset, the method yields an average F1 gain of $2.4\\%$, showcasing its effectiveness in enhancing few-shot IE tasks.\n\n![{Performance comparison of different methods on the TACREV dataset, showing that the filter-then-rerank approach outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods.}](image3)\n\n[10] The filter-then-rerank paradigm reframes prompts as multiple-choice questions (MCQ), making it easier for LLMs to process and rerank candidate labels. This format reduces the label scope significantly, allowing LLMs to focus on sample-level decisions rather than sentence-level entity/event identification. As a result, the method is more likely to elicit the full potential of LLMs, leading to improved performance on few-shot IE tasks like TACREV.\n\n[4] The filter-then-rerank paradigm converts few-shot IE tasks into multiple-choice questions, as demonstrated in examples for the FewNERD, TACREV, and ACE05 datasets. These examples highlight how the method structures prompts and utilizes demonstrations to guide LLMs during reranking, ensuring accurate and efficient processing of hard samples.\n\n[5] Table 3 shows that the filter-then-rerank method consistently improves performance across three datasets and nine settings. For instance, with InstructGPT, reranking provides an average F1 gain of $2.4\\%$ without SLM ensemble. This confirms the effectiveness of LLM reranking and highlights its gains being different and almost orthogonal to the SLM ensemble, further validating the success of the approach on the TACREV dataset.\n\n![{Financial and time cost comparison of different approaches on the TACREV dataset, showing that the filter-then-rerank method offers a balance between performance and efficiency.}](image4)\n\nIn conclusion, the filter-then-rerank method (w.o. ensemble) achieves a performance improvement on the 50-shot TACREV dataset with an average F1 gain of $2.4\\%$."}

The graph also emphasizes their shared Italian citizenship and connects these elements to their occupations and places of birth, showing how Orazio's role as both a mentor and a father shaped Artemisia's development as a painter.\n\n![{Orazio Gentileschi's influence on Artemisia Gentileschi's career}](image1)  \n\nAdditionally, the graph underscores the transmission of artistic techniques and styles from Orazio to Artemisia, particularly through his role as her teacher. This connection is crucial in understanding how Orazio’s Mannerist background informed Artemisia’s naturalistic portrayal of figures and use of chiaroscuro, as described in the text [1]. His guidance helped Artemisia refine her skills and establish herself as a significant figure in the Baroque movement, despite the challenges she faced as a female artist in a male-dominated field.  \n\nArtemisia’s association with the Caravaggio movement, which emphasized dramatic realism and intense emotional expression, further demonstrates how her father's influence merged with broader artistic trends of her time. The interplay between Orazio’s Mannerist roots and Artemisia’s Baroque innovations reflects a dynamic evolution in her artistic identity, deeply rooted in her familial and cultural context.  \n\nOrazio’s influence on Artemisia’s life and career is thus not only evident in her technical mastery but also in her ability to navigate and contribute to the evolving art world, ultimately shaping her legacy as a pioneering Baroque painter."}

As described in the text, during the pre-processing phase, images are cropped and blurred to focus the model's attention on relevant objects while reducing distractions from non-target areas. This is particularly important in object detection datasets where multiple objects of varying sizes and positions exist within a single image [4]. \n\n![{Pre-processing enhances zero-shot recognition by focusing on relevant objects}](image2)\n\nBy applying these techniques, the system ensures that the multimodal retriever can more effectively align the visual features with textual descriptions, thereby improving the accuracy of zero-shot recognition. The cropping step isolates individual objects based on bounding box coordinates, allowing for focused feature extraction, while blurring helps direct the MLLMs' attention toward the target objects, facilitating better identification in the subsequent ranking process.\n\nIn addition, the pre-processed embeddings are indexed using an approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) algorithm like HNSW, which accelerates the retrieval speed and improves the efficiency of the system [9]. This combination of preprocessing and indexing enables the system to handle the complexity of large-scale datasets with high precision and flexibility, ultimately contributing to the robustness of the zero-shot recognition framework. \n\nThe pre-processing step thus serves as a foundational component that enhances both the efficiency and accuracy of the zero-shot recognition system."}

The **Models** listed include SPECTER, which shows the best or nearly the best performance across almost all tasks and metrics, especially excelling in classification tasks and citation prediction. ![{SPECTER outperforms other models across tasks}](image3)\n\n[9] An ablation study reveals that adding or removing metadata fields from the input to SPECTER affects performance. The results are shown in the top four rows of Table 2, where removing the abstract from the textual input and relying only on the title results in a substantial decrease in performance. Adding authors as an input (along with title and abstract) hurts performance, possibly due to sparse author names and suboptimal tokenization for author names. Adding venues slightly decreases performance, except on document classification, which makes sense as venues are expected to have high correlation with classification tasks.\n\n[6] Without any additional final task-specific fine-tuning, SPECTER still outperforms a SciBERT model fine-tuned on the end tasks as well as their multitask combination, further demonstrating the effectiveness and versatility of SPECTER embeddings.\n\n[5] For document classification, we report macro F1, a standard classification metric. We observe that the classifier performance when trained on our representations is better than when trained on any other baseline. Particularly, on the MeSH (MAG) dataset, we obtain an 86.4 (82.0) F1 score which is about a $\\Delta{=}+2.3$ $(+1.5)$ point absolute increase over the best baseline on each dataset respectively. Our evaluation of the learned representations on predicting user activity is shown in the “User activ- ity” columns of Table 1.

We observe similar trends for the “citation” and “co-citation” tasks, with our model outperforming virtually all other baselines except for SGC, which has access to the citation graph at training and test time. Note that methods like SGC cannot be used in real-world settings to embed new papers that are not cited yet. On the other hand, on co-citation data our method is able to achieve the best results with nDCG of 94.8, improving over SGC with 2.3 points.

This initial phase sets the foundation for all subsequent steps. As we move through the analytics value chain, data is transformed into insights through analysis, which is a critical step emphasized by Ken Rudin on Facebook [5]. The value chain progresses from data collection to analysis, then to decision-making, and finally to impact, with the key message that halfway through the chain does not count [6].\n\nThis progression aligns with the levels of analytics, where the journey starts with descriptive analytics, focusing on what has happened, and moves toward predictive and prescriptive analytics, which address why something happened and what will happen next. This is clearly depicted in image2, showing the evolution from Standard Reports to Predictive Modelling, reflecting an increase in both business value and intelligence [2].\n\nFurthermore, the distinction between reporting and analysis is highlighted in image3, where reporting is described as descriptive and backward-looking, while analysis is prescriptive and forward-looking, aiming to answer \"why\" and provide actionable insights [3]. This contrast underscores the importance of moving beyond mere data presentation to deeper analytical understanding.\n\nTo ensure that data insights lead to tangible outcomes, it is essential to have strong data leadership that supports the analytics organization, providing a clear career path and fostering a culture where data is deeply embedded in decision-making processes [2]. This includes mentoring analysts, improving their skills in statistics and SQL, and promoting a testing mindset that is fact-based and anti-HiPPO [7].\n\nUltimately, the transformation of data into business value requires a collaborative and inclusive approach, with a focus on embedding analytics across the organization and aligning actions with strategic objectives. As noted by a former Zynga employee, analytics is about impact—brilliant insights are only valuable if they lead to real change [8].\n\nThe process of transforming data into business value progresses through structured levels of analytics and the analytics value chain, ensuring that insights are not just generated but also acted upon to drive meaningful outcomes."}

This process, as described in the text, involves several key stages: **data collection**, **analysis**, **decision making**, and **action**. The flowchart in **image1** visually represents this transformation, starting with \"Data\" as the foundation, which is then used to generate reports, analyze insights, and drive informed decisions that lead to tangible outcomes or value.\n\n![{The process of transforming data into value through the Analytics Value Chain}](image1)\n\nThe journey begins with **data collection**, where relevant data is gathered from various sources. This data is then processed and transformed into **reports** and **analyses**, which provide insights into current performance and trends. These insights are used to make **informed decisions**, which are then implemented through **actions** that aim to improve business outcomes. As highlighted in [2], the value is realized only when these actions lead to measurable impact, rather than stopping at analysis alone.\n\nThe role of **data leadership** is also crucial in this process, as emphasized in [4] and [8]. Effective data leaders ensure that data is treated as a strategic asset, fostering a culture where data-driven decisions are not only encouraged but embedded into the organization's operations. This includes training analysts, promoting a testing mindset, and ensuring that data is accessible and usable across all levels of the organization.\n\nMoreover, the distinction between **reporting** and **analysis** is important. While reporting provides a descriptive view of what has happened, analysis goes further by answering why it happened and what should be done next. This is clearly outlined in **image4**, which contrasts the nature and function of reporting and analysis, highlighting how analysis leads to forward-looking insights and recommendations.\n\nIn summary, the Analytics Value Chain transforms data into value by systematically moving through data collection, analysis, decision-making, and action, with strong data leadership and cultural support ensuring its success."}

In the P generation, plants with homozygous alleles for flower color—purple (PP) and white (pp)—are crossed. All offspring in the F₁ generation inherit one allele from each parent, resulting in a heterozygous genotype (Pp) and the dominant purple phenotype [5]. \n\nIn the F₂ generation, the heterozygous F₁ plants (Pp) produce gametes with a 1:1 ratio of P and p alleles. When these gametes combine, the possible genotypes are PP, Pp, and pp, leading to a genotypic ratio of 1:2:1. Phenotypically, the dominant allele (P) masks the recessive allele (p), resulting in a 3:1 ratio of purple to white flowers [4]. This pattern is clearly illustrated in the genetic cross diagram, which shows the segregation of alleles and the resulting phenotypic outcomes [![{genetic cross diagram}](image4)].\n\nThe dominance of the purple allele over the white allele ensures that only individuals with the recessive genotype (pp) display the white phenotype, while all others exhibit the dominant trait [6].

Reporting is primarily descriptive, focusing on what has occurred, while analysis is prescriptive, aiming to understand why something happened and what actions should be taken. This distinction is clearly outlined in image1, which compares \"Reporting\" and \"Analysis\" across several dimensions, emphasizing their differing functions and outputs [1].\n\nIn the progression from business intelligence to business analytics, reporting forms the foundation, providing essential information through standard reports, ad-hoc queries, and alerts. These activities help organizations understand past performance and identify areas requiring attention. As the process evolves, analysis becomes increasingly important, incorporating statistical methods, forecasting, and predictive modeling to explore deeper insights and guide future decisions. This progression is visually represented in image3, which illustrates the hierarchy from Business Intelligence to Business Analytics, showing how each stage contributes to greater business value and intelligence [3].\n\nThe analytics value chain, as depicted in image4, emphasizes the importance of moving beyond mere reporting to enable informed decision-making through analysis. This chain begins with data collection, moves through reporting and analysis, and culminates in taking action that drives business value. The role of data leadership is critical in this process, as highlighted in text quote [7], where strong data leadership ensures that analytics are deeply embedded in organizational processes and decisions, supporting both the analytics organization and the broader business objectives.\n\n![{Data-Driven Process}](image4)  \nThe flowchart in image4 illustrates the transformation of data into value, highlighting the roles of reporting and analysis within the analytics value chain.  \n\nReporting provides the necessary context and historical insights, while analysis enables organizations to move from understanding past events to predicting future outcomes and optimizing strategies.

Additionally, **MF (manual)** allows you to touch the subject of interest to focus, such as the subject's face, providing precise control [image1].  \n\nIn low-light environments, adjusting the ISO sensitivity and using the flash can enhance photo quality by compensating for insufficient light [4]. Furthermore, setting the white balance ensures accurate color representation under different lighting conditions [image2].  \n\nBy fine-tuning these metering and focus modes in Pro Mode, photographers can achieve greater control over their shots, resulting in improved image quality and more creative flexibility under various scenarios."}

{"q_id": 1997, "model": "qwen3-8b", "in_tok": 2254, "out_tok": 435, "total_tok": 2689, "response": "The conversion rate from Marketing Qualified Leads (MQL) to Sales Accepted Leads (SAL) is a critical metric in the sales funnel, indicating how effectively marketing-qualified leads are being passed to the sales team. According to [1], lead scoring and customised marketing communications help determine when a lead is deemed sales-ready and transferred to the sales team. This process ensures that only the most promising leads move forward in the funnel.\n\nIn the context of specific datasets, the conversion rate from MQL to SAL is reported as **1.50%** in the dataset described in [4], which outlines the progression through the lead funnel. Additionally, image4 provides a visual representation of this conversion rate, showing that out of 10,061 MQLs, only 668 were converted into SALs, resulting in a **1.50%** conversion rate. This low rate suggests that while many leads are being qualified by marketing, a significant portion may not meet the criteria for sales acceptance, potentially due to insufficient engagement or readiness.\n\n![{conversion rate from MQL to SAL}(image4)]  \nThis low conversion rate highlights the importance of refining lead qualification criteria and ensuring that marketing efforts are aligned with the sales team's expectations. It also underscores the need for continuous optimization of lead scoring models to improve the efficiency of the sales funnel.\n\nIn contrast, cross-industry average conversion rates from MQLs to SALs are reported as **4-8%** in image5, indicating that the observed rate of **1.50%** is significantly lower than industry benchmarks. This discrepancy could imply that the organization's lead qualification process is either too stringent or not adequately capturing the right leads. The implications of this difference suggest a potential bottleneck in the sales funnel, where marketing-qualified leads are not being effectively transitioned to the sales team, possibly leading to missed opportunities and reduced overall conversion efficiency. \n\nThe low conversion rate from MQL to SAL indicates a need for closer alignment between marketing and sales teams, refinement of lead scoring methodologies, and enhanced tracking of lead behavior to ensure that only the most viable leads are passed to sales."}
