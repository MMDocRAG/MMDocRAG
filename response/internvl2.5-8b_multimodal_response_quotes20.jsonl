The unemployment rate for Hispanics has been higher than that of non-Hispanics, with a peak of 12.8% in the first quarter of 2010, compared to 5.6% for non-Hispanics. However, the unemployment rate for Hispanics has been declining since then, reaching 6.4% in the last quarter of 2015, while the rate for non-Hispanics was 4.8% in the same period.\n\nIn terms of economic perceptions, Hispanics have generally been more optimistic about their financial situation compared to non-Hispanics. For example, in 2015, 72% of Hispanics expected their children to be better off financially than they themselves are now, compared to 61% of non-Hispanics. This optimism is reflected in their higher expectations for economic conditions, with 35% of Hispanics saying conditions are good or excellent, compared to 25% of non-Hispanics.\n\nThese differences in economic perceptions and unemployment rates have significant impacts on income and wealth disparities. Despite the declining unemployment rate, the median household income for Hispanics has stagnated since the Great Recession, with a level of $42,491 in 2014, which is essentially unchanged since the Great Recession. The Hispanic poverty rate, at 23.6% in 2014, is less than the peak of 26.5% in 2010 but remains above pre-recession levels. Furthermore, Hispanic households had the largest percentage decline in their net worth through 2009 of any major racial or ethnic group, and unlike white households, their net worth continued to fall after the recession.\n\nIn summary, while Hispanics have shown optimism about their economic future, the reality of their economic situation, including higher unemployment rates and stagnant median household income, highlights the ongoing income and wealth disparities between Hispanic and non-Hispanic populations."}

According to the data, about half of Latinos aged 18 to 29 reported being in excellent or good financial shape in 2015, a 27 percentage point increase from 2008. This improvement is more than double the share who had a similarly positive view of their finances that year.

For example, ratings of personal finances rose by 17 percentage points among U.S.-born Hispanics and by 18 points among those born in another country. Positive views of economic well-being rose by 16 percentage points among Latino men and by 18 points among Latina women. These rosy assessments also increased by double digits among those with less than a high school education (+12 points) and high school graduates (+16 points) as well as those who had attended college (+17 points). \n\nIn 2015, about half of Latinos said their family income is not keeping up with the cost of living.

Men are slightly more likely than women to encounter any sort of harassing or abusive behavior online, with 29% of men and 19% of women reporting frequent exposure to such behavior. Men are also more likely to see people being mean or bullying content, with 29% of men reporting frequent exposure compared to 19% of women.

Here's a detailed breakdown:\n\n1. **Rising COVID-19 Cases:**\n   - **Republicans:** Roughly two-thirds of conservative Republicans (62%) attribute the rise in cases primarily to more testing. Moderate and liberal Republicans are more divided, with 53% saying increased testing is the main reason and 45% citing increased infections.\n   - **Democrats:** A smaller majority of Republicans (62%) say the primary reason is more people being tested. In contrast, Democrats overwhelmingly attribute the rise to more infections, with 80% saying this.\n\n2. **Lifting of Restrictions:**\n   - **Republicans:** There is a significant partisan gap in views on lifting restrictions. About 53% of Republicans are more concerned that restrictions have not been lifted quickly enough, while 45% are more concerned that they have been lifted too quickly. This divide is more pronounced among conservative Republicans (60% vs. 37%).\n   - **Democrats:** Both liberal Democrats (93%) and conservative/moderate Democrats (88%) are more concerned that state restrictions on public activity have been lifted too quickly.\n\n3. **Demographic Differences:**\n   - **Race and Ethnicity:** About eight-in-ten Black adults (84%) and seven-in-ten Hispanic adults (72%) are more concerned that states have been lifting restrictions too quickly.

According to the text and image data:\n\n- **Democrats** overwhelmingly attribute the rise in confirmed coronavirus cases to more infections, with 82% saying this is the primary reason. This aligns with their concern that state restrictions have been lifted too quickly, as 93% of Democrats believe this is a major reason for the outbreak continuing [2].\n- **Republicans**, on the other hand, are more divided. 62% of Republicans say the increase in confirmed cases is primarily due to more people being tested, while 36% believe it is because of more new infections. This reflects their concern that restrictions have not been lifted quickly enough, with 45% of Republicans expressing this view [9].\n- **Education level** also plays a role, with 78% of adults with a postgraduate degree concerned that restrictions are being eased too quickly, compared to 64% of those with a high school diploma or less [3].\n- **Age** is another factor, with 70% of adults aged 50-64 and 67% of those aged 65+ concerned that restrictions have been lifted too quickly [2].\n- **Race** is significant, with 84% of Black adults and 72% of Hispanic adults more concerned that restrictions have been lifted too quickly [10].\n- **Political affiliation** is the most significant factor, with 82% of Democrats and 31% of Republicans viewing lifting COVID-19 restrictions as a major reason for the outbreak continuing [11].\n\nIn summary, Democrats are more likely to attribute the rise in cases to increased infections, while Republicans are more likely to attribute it to more testing.

Here's a detailed analysis:\n\n1. **Party Differences:**\n   - **Overall Perception:** About half of Hispanics (45%) do not see a great deal of difference between the Democratic and Republican parties. This perception is relatively stable, with 45% of Hispanics saying there is a great deal of difference and 36% saying there is a fair amount of difference, while 16% say there is hardly any difference at all.\n   - **Democratic vs. Republican:** Among Hispanic Democrats and Democratic leaners, 47% say there is a great deal of difference, compared to 48% of Hispanic Republicans and Republican leaners. This indicates a slight difference in perception between the two groups.\n\n2. **Support for Political Parties:**\n   - **Democratic Party:** Majorities of Latino adults express positive views of the Democratic Party. About 71% say the Democratic Party works hard for Latinos’ votes, 63% say it “really cares about Latinos,” and 60% say the Democratic Party represents the interests of people like themselves. These views are significantly higher than those for the Republican Party.\n   - **Republican Party:** Fewer than half of Hispanics (45%) say the GOP “works hard to earn the votes of Latinos.” This is a notable difference compared to the Democratic Party’s support among Latinos.\n\n3. **Party Affiliation:**\n   - **Party Identification:** Latino registered voters identify with or lean toward the Democratic Party over the Republican Party by a nearly two-to-one margin (64% vs. 33%). This trend has remained relatively stable over the years, with minor shifts in party identification.\n\n4. **Economic and Social Issues:**\n   - **Economic Concerns:** In August 2022, 80% of Hispanics were concerned about the economy, with 71% saying it is a very important issue. This concern is higher than in March 2022"}

According to the Pew Research Center surveys, experiences with discrimination are less frequent among higher generations of adults with Hispanic ancestry. For instance, 39% of self-identified Hispanics report feeling discriminated against due to their Hispanic or Latino background, with this share decreasing to 30% for third or higher generation Latinos [2]. Additionally, the share of self-identified non-Hispanics with Hispanic ancestry who say they are seen as white is 73%, which is higher than the 59% among self-identified Hispanics [3]. The perception of racial identity also varies, with 59% of self-identified non-Hispanics with Hispanic ancestry seeing themselves as white, compared to 69% of self-identified Hispanics [3]. These findings suggest that generational differences in discrimination experiences and racial identity perceptions are notable among Hispanics."}

According to the data, the majority of self-identified Hispanics consider themselves to be a typical American, with this sentiment increasing from 36% among immigrants to 73% among third or higher generation Hispanics. This trend reflects their growing U.S. national identity and lifetime experiences in the U.S. [1][8].\n\nIn terms of language use, the proficiency in Spanish decreases with each generation. Among immigrants, 82% feel very or somewhat connected to their country of origin, while this connection drops to 44% among third or higher generation Hispanics. This decline in connection to their ancestral roots is mirrored in their language use, with 17% of self-identified Hispanics being Spanish dominant, a figure that drops to 6% among the second generation and essentially none among the third generation. [11][9].\n\nMoreover, the perception of what constitutes Latino identity varies across generations. Seven-in-ten Latino adults say speaking Spanish is not required to be considered Latino, and this view is held by a majority of immigrant Latinos (58%) and U.S.-born Latinos (92%). This suggests that language is not a strict criterion for Latino identity, and other factors like cultural practices and family ties may play a more significant role. [3][4].\n\nIn summary, generational differences lead to a shift from strong ties to ancestral roots and language use to a more American identity, with language proficiency decreasing with each generation. This reflects broader trends in assimilation and the integration of Hispanic communities into American society."}

This growth is reflected in the data, where the ridership numbers for Palo Alto University and Mountain View have increased by 38% and 16% respectively from 2012 to 2014. However, this increase in ridership has also led to capacity issues on the trains, as evidenced by the high load factors and high season capacity percentages listed in image6.

The image and text evidence suggest that the market is evolving from a stage dominated by cash on delivery (COD) to a more digital and diverse payment landscape. The image1 indicates that there are great entrepreneurial opportunities in making the ecosystem robust, which includes increasing logistics efficiency and analytics. This aligns with the text evidence that highlights the shift from COD to digital payments, with a significant increase in EMI payments and the rise of third-party wallets.\n\nThe dominant age group, as shown in image2, plays a crucial role in this development. The majority of the population, particularly those aged 18-35 years, are driving the growth. This age group is more likely to adopt new technologies and payment methods, contributing to the evolution of the eCommerce market. The image2 shows that 55% of the population falls within this age range, indicating a significant demographic driver for the market's growth.\n\nThe image3 and image4 provide further context by showing the rapid growth in eCommerce transactions, with a 45% increase in the number of transactions from 2014 to 2016. This growth is likely driven by the younger demographic, who are more tech-savvy and comfortable with online shopping and digital payments.\n\nIn summary, the drivers of growth in eCommerce sales are closely tied to the stages of evolution in the market, with the dominant age group of 18-35 years playing a pivotal role in this development. The shift towards digital payments and the increasing adoption of new technologies by this age group are key factors in the market's evolution.\n\n![Drivers of growth in eCommerce sales](image1)"}

This distribution can significantly impact the gross margin contributions, as different categories have varying profitability levels. For instance, categories with higher transaction volumes but lower margins might not contribute as much to the overall gross margin as categories with lower transaction volumes but higher margins. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for optimizing the supply chain and demand model in e-commerce. A well-balanced approach can help in managing inventory, logistics, and pricing strategies to maximize profitability and customer satisfaction.\n\nThe implications for the e-commerce supply and demand model are multifaceted. For supply, it requires efficient inventory management to ensure that high-demand categories are adequately stocked, while low-demand categories are not overstocked. For demand, it involves tailoring marketing and promotional strategies to attract customers to high-margin categories, thus enhancing overall profitability. Additionally, the model must be flexible to adapt to changing consumer preferences and market trends, ensuring that the supply chain remains responsive to demand fluctuations."}

According to the data from Venture Consulting Analysis, Telkomsel's subscriber base increased from 139.3 million in 2013 to 132.7 million in 2014, indicating a slight decline in subscribers. However, the ARPU (Average Revenue Per User) for Telkomsel also decreased from 38 to 30 during the same period. This decline in ARPU can be attributed to several factors:\n\n1. **Shift to Data-Based Services:** The rise in data usage, as evidenced by the increasing number of data users and the popularity of data-based IM and VoIP services, likely contributed to the decline in SMS and voice ARPU. Users are increasingly opting for data services over traditional voice and SMS, which are cheaper in the long run.\n\n2. **Price Wars:** The text quotes mention that CDMA operators managed to force GSM operators to reduce their tariffs, which could have led to a decrease in ARPU as operators competed for subscribers by lowering prices.\n\n3. **Government Initiatives:** The initial reduction in ARPU was due to a massive price war initiated by the government, which aimed to make mobile services more affordable for the general population.\n\n4. **Technological Advancements:** The increasing adoption of smartphones, which are typically associated with higher data consumption, also played a role in the decline of voice and SMS ARPU. Smartphones offer a range of data-based services that are more attractive to users than traditional voice and SMS.\n\n5. **Market Dynamics:** The overall market dynamics, including the shift towards more data-intensive services and the competition among operators, likely influenced the changes in ARPU and subscriber base.\n\nIn summary, the decline in Telkomsel's ARPU and slight decrease in subscribers from 2013 to 2014 can be attributed to a combination of technological advancements, government initiatives, and market competition, particularly the shift towards data-based services."}

These slots have different expressions and cannot be extracted from the dialog context, which decreases the performance of the span-based methods. In contrast, their values can be predicted directly from the candidate-value lists. Compared with other slots, these slots still have space for improvements. The key is a deep interaction between the domain-slot and context information. When evaluated on noisy (MultiWOZ 2.0) and cleaner (MultiWOZ 2.1) settings, DS-DST performs competitively and robustly across the two different settings. DS-DST sets the new state of the art in the noisy setting, while performing more robustly than the best model in the cleaner setting."}

This indicates that SWEM can capture important features from word embeddings effectively, even with fewer parameters.\n   - **CNN**: CNN models, such as the 29-layer deep CNN, are often outperformed by SWEM models, especially in tasks like topic prediction and ontology classification. This suggests that SWEM's pooling strategies, such as max-pooling and hierarchical pooling, can be more effective in capturing the essence of the text data.\n\n2. **Subspace Dimensions:**\n   - **SWEM**: The performance of SWEM models tends to improve as the subspace dimension increases, as seen in the graphs in Figure 5. This indicates that SWEM can benefit from a larger subspace, potentially capturing more nuanced features of the data.\n   - **CNN**: CNN models also show an improvement in performance with increasing subspace dimensions, but the rate of improvement is not as steep as for SWEM. This suggests that CNNs might require a larger subspace to achieve optimal performance, possibly due to their reliance on convolutional operations.\n\n3. **Dataset Sensitivity:**\n   - **SWEM**: SWEM models, particularly SWEM- max, perform well on datasets like SNLI, where max-pooling is beneficial. This highlights the adaptability of SWEM to different types of NLP tasks.\n   - **CNN**: CNN models, while effective, might struggle with shorter text sequences, as noted in the discussion of short sentence classification and tagging tasks. This could be due to the importance of word-order features in these tasks, which SWEM might handle better.\n\n4. **Parameter Efficiency:**\n   - **SWEM**: SWEM models are parameter-free, making them more efficient in terms of computational resources. This is particularly advantageous for tasks where the number of parameters is a concern.\n   - **CNN**: CNN models, especially deep CNNs, require a substantial number of parameters, which can be a draw"}

For example, on D1, the accuracy increases from 72.08% to 79.11% when the percentage of document-level training examples is increased from 0 to 1.0.\n- **Image 3**: The graphs illustrate that both accuracy and macro-F1 scores increase with the percentage of document-level training examples. The macro-F1 scores show a more significant increase, especially for D3 and D4.\n- **Image 4**: The table indicates that the inclusion of different components (LSTM, embeddings, output layer) affects the performance.

Novo Nordisk uses financial instruments to reduce the impact of foreign exchange on financial results. The financial contracts are expected to impact the income statement within the next 12 months, with deferred gains and losses on cash flow hedges then being transferred to financial income or financial expenses.

The operating income decreased from $546 million in 2019 to $556 million in 2020, while cash from investing activities increased from $597 million in 2019 to $650 million in 2020. The reasons for these changes include:\n\n- **Operating Income:** The decrease in operating income can be attributed to the ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, which negatively impacted the crude and refined products operating environment and related prices. Additionally, lower rates on the Zydeco committed contracts in 2020 compared to 2019, as well as higher impact from planned turnaround activities, storms, and related shut-ins of production, contributed to the decrease. However, the increase in new volumes brought online at NaKika and Odyssey, as well as achieving regulatory approval for an increase in tariffs on Delta in 2020, partially offset these decreases.\n\n- **Cash from Investing Activities:** The increase in cash from investing activities is primarily driven by an increase in equity investment income related to the acquisition of additional interests in Explorer and Colonial in June 2019, as well as the acquisition of an interest in Mattox in April 2020. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in dividend income from other investments due to the change in accounting for Explorer and Colonial as equity method investments in 2020 rather than other investments in 2019 following the acquisition of additional interests in these entities in June 2019.

The decline in the pension plans' funded status due to adverse developments in plan assets or the defined benefit obligation is considered a significant risk, and the management of these risks is based on a defined risk measure (Value at Risk, VaR), which considers both plan assets and the defined benefit obligation. The investment strategy is aligned with the defined benefit obligation, and the risks and asset developments are monitored on an ongoing basis, with adjustments made to the investment strategy as necessary. Independent asset managers are selected based on quantitative and qualitative analyses, including their performance and risk preference, and derivatives are used to reduce risks as part of risk management."}

According to the text quotes:\n\n- **Net Operating Income:** The net operating income decreased from $15,056 million in 2019 to $15,303 million in 2020, a change of $247 million, which is a 1.6% increase. This is attributed to higher volatility levels and increased client activity, particularly in Foreign Exchange and Credit, as well as strong performance in Rates due to increased trading activity in government bonds. However, the overall impact of lower global interest rates and adverse movements in credit and funding valuation adjustments offset these gains.\n\n- **Profit Before Tax:** The profit before tax fell from $5,774 million in 2019 to $5,172 million in 2020, a decrease of $602 million, which is a 10.4% drop. This decline was primarily due to higher expected credit losses and other credit impairment charges (ECL), as well as lower revenue, partly offset by a fall in operating expenses.\n\nThe image quotes provide a visual representation of the changes in net operating income and profit before tax from 2019 to 2020, showing a decrease in both metrics. The contributing factors highlighted in the text quotes align with the visual data, emphasizing the impact of lower global interest rates, adverse movements in credit and funding valuation adjustments, and higher expected credit losses."}

The company's domestic insurance and HMO subsidiaries paid their parent companies dividends of $5.6 billion in 2019 and $8.3 billion in 2020, including $1.3 billion and $4.2 billion of extraordinary dividends, respectively. These dividends reduced the company's cash and increased its shareholder value. Additionally, the company's share repurchase program, which was renewed in June 2018, allowed the company to optimize its capital structure and cost of capital, thereby improving returns to shareholders. The company repurchased up to 100 million shares of its common stock in 2018 and 2019, which further increased the value of its shares and reduced the number of outstanding shares."}

This reduction was primarily due to the sale of WFAM, which included equity, alternative, balanced, fixed income, money market, and stable value assets.\n\nThe sale also had broader effects on the company's income and balance sheet. The sale generated net gains of $674 million and $269 million, respectively, from the sale of the Corporate Trust Services business and WFAM, which are subject to certain post-closing adjustments and earn-out provisions. However, these gains were partially offset by lower gains on the sales of certain residential mortgage loans, higher valuation losses related to retained litigation risk, and lower income from investments accounted for under the equity method.\n\nThe sale also led to a decrease in total assets, as evidenced by the reduction in total assets from $235,262 million in 2020 to $209,696 million in 2021. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in equity securities related to the company's affiliated venture capital business. The sale also resulted in a decrease in total loans from $887,637 million in 2020 to $895,394 million in 2021, and a decrease in total deposits from $235,262 million in 2020 to $209,696 million in 2021.\n\nOverall, the sale of WFAM had a significant impact on the company's financials, leading to a decrease in assets under management, total assets, total loans, and total deposits.

The timing of the contractual cash flows for the lease liabilities is disclosed in note C4(b). The Group has adopted AASB 16 Leases from 1 July 2019 using the modified retrospective approach, as detailed in note D8. Lease liabilities have been re-measured due to changes to existing lease terms, including extensions to existing lease terms, as noted in note B7. The lease incentive liability in relation to non-cancellable operating leases are offset against lease rental expense on a straight line basis over the lease term, generally three to ten years, as per note B8.\n\n- **Employee Benefit Liabilities**: The Group's net obligation in respect of long-term service benefits is the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods. The obligation is calculated using expected future increases in wage and salary rates including related on-costs and expected settlement dates, and is discounted using high-quality Australian corporate bond rates at the balance sheet date which have maturity dates approximating to the terms of the Group’s obligations. The Group has applied the practical expedient whereby lease liabilities have not been re-measured for rent concessions that are a direct consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic, as noted in note B4.\n\n- **Transition Adjustments**: The Group no longer recognizes provisions for operating leases that it assesses to be onerous. Instead, the Group will include the payments due under the lease in its lease liability. The Group will include the sub-lease party to undertake rental in line with agreements, and the expenditure to settle the lease at the end of the lease term is based on the lease term. The Group has applied the practical expedient whereby lease liabilities have not been re-measured for rent concessions that are a direct consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic, as noted in note B4.\n\n- **Onerous Leases**: Onerous leases arise when the cost of exiting an existing lease is greater than the loss on the sub-lease arrangement. In these circumstances, the best estimate is made of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation"}

This indicates a slight improvement in cash flow from operations.\n- **Investing Activities**: Net cash used in investing activities decreased by $0.7 billion from 2019, primarily due to the reduction of cash in 2019 resulting from the deconsolidation of RBH and lower capital expenditures, partially offset by higher cash collateral posted to secure derivatives designated as net investment hedges.\n- **Financing Activities**: Net cash used in financing activities increased by $0.4 billion from 2019, primarily due to higher payments to noncontrolling interests and higher dividends paid, partially offset by debt activity.\n\nOverall, the net cash provided by operating activities was positively impacted by the amount of trade receivables sold and derecognized, which remained outstanding with unaffiliated financial institutions. The net proceeds received are included in cash provided by operating activities. The deconsolidation of RBH and the reduction of cash in 2019 resulted in lower cash used in investing activities.

Here's a detailed analysis:\n\n**Noncurrent Assets:**\n- **Increase:** The noncurrent assets increased by $3,039 million, primarily due to the increase in deferred taxes ($4,060 million) and prepaid pension assets ($745 million). These increases were partially offset by decreases in long-term financing receivables ($1,626 million) and net intangible assets and goodwill ($44 million).\n- **Impact on Financial Standing:** The increase in deferred taxes and prepaid pension assets suggests a higher return on investments and better pension plan performance, which positively impacts financial stability. However, the decrease in long-term financing receivables and intangible assets indicates a reduction in long-term revenue streams and asset value, respectively.\n\n**Long-term Debt:**\n- **Decrease:** Total debt decreased by $1,361 million, primarily due to early retirements and debt maturities ($11,267 million) and issuances of new debt ($8,982 million). This reduction in debt, combined with the increase in cash and cash equivalents, improved IBM's debt-to-equity ratio to 9 to 1.\n- **Impact on Financial Standing:** The decrease in long-term debt reduces financial leverage and interest expenses, enhancing financial flexibility and reducing the risk of default. The increase in cash and cash equivalents further strengthens liquidity.\n\n**Cash Flows:**\n- **Net Change in Cash:** The net change in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash increased by $5,361 million, driven by operating activities ($18,197 million) and a net increase in cash and cash equivalents ($5,361 million).\n- **Impact on Financial Standing:** The substantial increase in cash flows indicates strong operational performance and effective cash management, which bolsters financial resilience and provides resources for future investments and debt repayment.\n\n**Equity:**\n- **Decrease:** Total equity decreased by $258 million, primarily due to dividends paid ($5,797 million) and a decline in accumulated other comprehensive income ($740 million). However, net income ($5,590 million) and common stock ($661 million) contributed positively.\n- **Impact on Financial Standing:** The decrease in equity, while"}

A net increase in cash payments for income taxes of $162 million was also noted, primarily driven by withholding tax on intercompany dividends in the second quarter. Performance-related declines within net income impacted the cash flow.\n\n2. **Investing Activities:**\n   - **Net Cash Used in Investing Activities:** Decreased by $23,908 million in 2020 compared to 2019. This was driven by a decrease of $32,294 million in cash provided by net non-operating finance receivables due to the wind down of the OEM IT commercial financing operations, a decrease of $6,245 million in cash used for net purchases of marketable securities and other investments, and an increase of $896 million in cash used for net acquisitions.\n\n3. **Financing Activities:**\n   - **Net Cash Used in Financing Activities:** Increased by $9,721 million in 2020 compared to 2019.

According to a 2021 Pew Research Center study, a substantial share of Latino voters identified as either a Democrat or Republican, with one-in-ten voters having soft ties to the political parties. This indicates that while there is a clear preference for one party, there is also a significant group of voters who are not strongly aligned with either party.\n\nIn terms of perceptions of differences between the parties, Latino registered voters have mixed views. A 2022 survey found that 35% of Latino voters believe the Democratic Party really cares about Latinos, while 25% of Latino voters believe the Republican Party really cares about Latinos. This suggests that there is a perception of some level of care from both parties, but the Democratic Party is perceived to care more.\n\nFurthermore, Latino registered voters have mixed views on whether the Democratic Party works hard to earn their votes. 63% of Latino voters believe the Democratic Party works hard to earn their votes, while 31% believe the Republican Party works hard to earn their votes. This indicates that while there is a perception of effort from both parties, the Democratic Party is perceived to be more effective in earning the votes of Latino registered voters.\n\nOverall, the alignment of Latino registered voters with the Democratic and Republican parties has remained relatively stable, and their perceptions of differences between the parties are mixed, with a slight preference for the Democratic Party in terms of caring about Latinos and working hard to earn their votes."}

Blacks in STEM jobs are also more likely than those in non-STEM occupations to think discrimination is a major reason behind the under representation of blacks and Hispanics (72% vs. 58%). Views among Hispanics on this tend to be similar across those working in STEM and non-STEM jobs. And, blacks working in STEM jobs are less convinced than white STEM workers that black employees where they work are treated fairly when it comes to hiring and promotions. In all, 43% of blacks in STEM jobs believe that blacks where they work are usually treated fairly during recruitment; 37% say this is"}

It creates and stores multimodal embeddings, optimizing retrieval speed through index construction techniques.\n\n2. **Retrieving & Ranking**: After the retrieval phase, the retrieved category labels alongside image embeddings are integrated and sent to the MLLMs through a ranking prompt. The MLLMs then rank the retrieved information and make the final prediction of the image category.\n\n3. **MLLMs**: These are used to rank the retrieved results and enhance the performance in few-shot/zero-shot perception tasks. They combine internal knowledge with the retrieved information to make accurate predictions.\n\n4. **Prompt**: The prompt primarily serves to merge the input image with the category information retrieved from memory. It guides MLLMs to rank the retrieved candidate object categories based on similarity.\n\n5. **Index System**: To enhance retrieval speed, an index system using the HNSW algorithm is implemented. This reduces dimensionality, facilitating a more condensed index and improving retrieval efficiency.\n\n6. **Memory M**: This stores the retrieved information, which is then used by the MLLMs to make predictions.\n\n7. **Pre-processing**: For object detection datasets, additional pre-processing steps like cropping and blurring are applied to help the MLLMs understand the objects to be detected.\n\n8. **Ranking Prompt**: This guides the MLLMs to rank the retrieved results, ensuring a more accurate and contextually aware classification prediction.\n\n9. **Fine-tuning**: The MLLMs can be fine-tuned with ranking format data or in-context learning examples without training, enhancing their performance on downstream tasks.\n\n10. **Integration**: The retrieval-augmented design bridges the gap between the broad generalization capabilities of MLLMs and the need for precise, fine-grained categorization, significantly boosting their performance on downstream tasks.\n\nIn summary, the RAR pipeline integrates multimodal retrieval and ranking with MLLMs to enhance fine-grained recognition tasks, demonstrating significant improvements in performance across various datasets."}

It selects the top-k most relevant nodes at each layer based on their cosine similarity to the query embedding. This process is repeated until the leaf nodes are reached, and the text from all selected nodes is concatenated to form the retrieved context. This approach offers control over the specificity and breadth of the information retrieved, starting with a broad outlook and progressively focusing on finer details as it descends through the lower layers.\n\n- **Collapsed Tree Retrieval**: This method evaluates nodes collectively across all layers by considering all nodes in the tree simultaneously. It flattens the multi-layered tree into a single layer, essentially bringing all the nodes onto the same level for comparison. This approach allows for a more flexible search, retrieving information that is at the correct level of granularity for a given question, as it considers all nodes at once rather than layer-by-layer.\n\nThe collapsed tree approach is believed to offer greater flexibility and better performance in retrieving information, as it can retrieve information that is at the correct level of granularity for a given question, unlike the tree traversal method which may not adjust the ratio of higher-order thematic information to granular details regardless of the question."}

Specifically, the question-asking rate decreases from 100% to 79.67% when the repetition control level is increased from 0 to 10. This reduction in question-asking is due to the weighted decoding feature, which discourages bigrams that have appeared in previous utterances, preventing the model from producing common question bigrams like \"do you\" and \"what is.\" To address this issue, an additional setting (z = 10 (boost)) was introduced, which allows the model to produce necessary question-asking bigrams, resulting in a question-asking rate of 99.54%.

As shown in Table 4, BERT's peak performance drops to 53% on the adversarial test set, which is much lower than its performance on the original test set (77%). This indicates that the adversarial dataset eliminates the spurious statistical cues that BERT exploited, leading to a more robust evaluation of argument comprehension. In contrast, other models also perform randomly on the adversarial dataset, demonstrating that the transformation is effective in eliminating cues that all models exploit. This suggests that the adversarial dataset provides a more accurate assessment of argument comprehension and should be adopted as the standard in future work."}

The example annotation shows how entities and their relationships are identified and annotated in the text. The model uses a knowledge graph language model (KGLM) to generate tokens based on the entities and their relationships. The model selects a reference to an existing entity, which requires picking a fact to render. The parent entity of this fact is \"Super Mario Land,\" and the relation is \"Publisher,\" which selects \"Nintendo\" as the entity to render. When rendering \"Nintendo\" as a token, the model has an expanded vocabulary available, containing the standard vocabulary along with all word types in any of the aliases of \"Nintendo.\"\n\n![Example Annotation](image1)\n\nIn the example annotation, the model identifies the entity \"Super Mario Land\" and its related entities, such as \"Nintendo\" and \"Game Boy.\" The model also identifies the relationships between these entities, such as \"Publisher\" and \"Platform.\" The model uses these entities and relationships to generate tokens, such as \"Super Mario Land\" and \"Nintendo,\" and to render the fact that \"Nintendo\" is the publisher of \"Super Mario Land.\"\n\nThe illustration in Figure 1 shows how the KGLM works. Initially, the graph is empty, and the model uses the entity \"Super Mario Land\" to render the first three tokens, thus adding it and its relations to the local knowledge graph. After generating the next two tokens using the standard language model, the model selects \"Super Mario Land\" as the parent entity, \"Publication Date\" as the relation to render, and copies one of the tokens of the date entity as the token (\"1989\" in this case).\n\n![KGLM](image3)\n\nIn summary, entities and their relationships are represented in the example annotation by identifying the entities and their related entities, such as \"Super Mario Land\" and \"Nintendo,\" and the relationships between these entities, such as \"Publisher\" and \"Platform.\" The model uses these entities and relationships to generate tokens and render facts, such as \"Super Mario Land\" and \"Nintendo,\" and to add these entities and relationships to the local knowledge graph."}

Secondly, the cropped image is resized to a fixed proportion, which ensures that the image dimensions are consistent and suitable for the model's input requirements. This step is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the object's features and preventing distortion. Finally, a blurring technique is applied to the non-target areas surrounding the objects of interest. This blurring strategy directs the model's focus towards the relevant objects, thereby facilitating their identification in object detection tasks. By combining these pre-processing steps, the system is able to effectively extract relevant features from the image, which in turn enhances the model's ability to recognize objects in a zero-shot setting."}

In the general setting, GPT-4 outperforms ChatGPT across all metrics, with higher alignment, correlation, precision, recall, and F1 scores. This indicates that GPT-4 is more effective in generating aligned and accurate responses compared to ChatGPT. However, in the specific setting, the performance gap narrows, with GPT-4 still leading but with slightly lower scores in alignment and correlation.\n\nFor citation evaluation, GPT-4 achieves higher scores in precision, recall, and F1, indicating better citation quality. In text evaluation, GPT-4 also performs better, with higher scores in coherence, consistency, fluency, and relevance. This suggests that GPT-4 is more capable of generating coherent and relevant text compared to ChatGPT.\n\nThe implications for their use in citation and text evaluation are that GPT-4 is generally more reliable and effective, especially in generating high-quality citations and coherent text. However, the specific setting shows that ChatGPT can still perform well, making it a viable option for certain applications where specificity is crucial. The \"Conscious Incompetence\" setting, which enables LLMs to identify the knowledge required to support answers, is particularly beneficial for GPT-4, as it can generate more accurate and relevant responses."}

Mendel's experiments with pea plants demonstrated that traits are inherited as discrete units, now known as genes. In the F2 generation, the phenotypic ratio of 3:1 (purple: white flowers) and the genotypic ratio of 1:2:1 (PP: Pp: pp) are observed. This is due to the segregation of alleles during gamete formation and the random combination of alleles during fertilization. The F2 generation shows a 3:1 ratio of dominant to recessive phenotypes because the dominant allele is expressed when present, while the recessive allele is masked. The genotypic ratio of 1:2:1 reflects the possible combinations of alleles from the parents, with one homozygous dominant, two heterozygous, and one homozygous recessive genotypes. These ratios are consistent with Mendel's laws of inheritance, which describe how traits are passed from parents to offspring."}

They differ in their approach and focus:\n\n- **Needs Exploration**: This strategy involves actively engaging stakeholders to understand their needs and expectations. It emphasizes active stakeholder participation, where stakeholders are involved in the process of defining requirements through techniques like split (A/B) testing, detailed requirements, and acceptance test-driven development. This approach ensures that the requirements are well-defined and meet the stakeholders' expectations.\n\n- **Elicitation Methods**: This strategy focuses on gathering requirements from stakeholders through various methods, such as interviews, workshops, and surveys. It aims to capture the stakeholders' needs and expectations in a structured manner. Elicitation methods are often used to gather detailed requirements and ensure that the project aligns with the stakeholders' vision.\n\nIn summary, Needs Exploration is more interactive and involves stakeholders in the requirement definition process, while Elicitation Methods are more structured and systematic in gathering requirements. Both strategies are essential in agile management to ensure that the project meets the stakeholders' needs and expectations."}

These rates are crucial for understanding the efficiency of the lead generation and conversion processes. The image illustrates the transition from total leads to marketing-qualified leads (MQLs), sales-accepted leads (SALs), sales-qualified leads (SQLs), and finally, sales-won opportunities (SWOs). Each stage has a specific conversion rate, which indicates the percentage of leads that successfully move from one stage to the next.\n\nFor instance, the conversion rate from total leads to MQLs is 52.07%, meaning that 52.07% of all leads become marketing-qualified. This rate is then further broken down into the conversion rate from MQLs to SALs (1.50%), and from SALs to SQLs (83.08%), and finally from SQLs to SWOs (6.67%). These rates are essential for identifying bottlenecks and areas for improvement in the lead generation and conversion process.\n\nIn contrast, the average conversion rates provided in marketing diagnostics, as shown in the image, offer a broader perspective on the overall effectiveness of marketing efforts. These rates are typically lower than the conversion rates in the lead funnel progression, as they encompass a wider range of marketing activities and channels. The image shows that the average conversion rate from website to MQLs is 47.77%, which is higher than the conversion rate from total leads to MQLs in the lead funnel progression.\n\nIn summary, the conversion rates in the lead funnel progression provide a detailed view of the efficiency of the lead generation and conversion process, while the average conversion rates in marketing diagnostics offer a broader perspective on the overall effectiveness of marketing efforts. By analyzing both sets of data, marketers can gain a comprehensive understanding of their marketing performance and identify areas for improvement."}

In 2005, the largest portion of time was spent with family and friends (35%), followed by watching TV (20%), and reading (10%). By 2010, the distribution shifted, with watching TV (21%) becoming the most popular activity, followed by with family and friends (17%), and reading (10%). This change suggests a shift in leisure activities towards more social and screen-based activities.\n\nThe global educational participation trends, as reflected in the training program statistics, show a significant increase in the number of participants from 2005 to 2010. The number of registered participants grew from 425,000 in 2005 to 1,000,000 in 2010, indicating a substantial increase in educational engagement. The number of lectures delivered also increased from 33 in 2005 to 98 in 2010, showing a significant expansion in educational outreach.\n\nThese changes in weekend activities and educational participation can be linked by the increasing importance of digital and social engagement. As people spend more time on activities like watching TV and with family and friends, they may also be more likely to engage in online learning and educational programs, which are increasingly accessible and convenient. The rise in educational participation may reflect a broader trend towards digital literacy and the integration of technology into daily life, including leisure activities."}

It showcases the development of the local community and the transformation of wool into clothes. The museum provides insights into the industrialization of Western Norway, highlighting the importance of the textile industry in the region's history.\n\n**Osterøy Museum:**\n- The Osterøy Museum, situated on the island of Radøy, is an authentic prairie village that was built by Norwegian-Americans in the USA and later moved to Norway. It chronicles the history of Norwegian emigrants and draws parallels to migration today. The museum features permanent and changing exhibitions, guided tours, and experiences that link objects and the living cultural heritage of textiles, costumes, weaving, and local building customs.\n\n**Comparison:**\n- The Textile Industry Museum emphasizes the industrial and economic aspects of the textile industry, providing a detailed look at the transformation of raw materials into finished products. It is a testament to the industrialization of the region and the role of textiles in the local economy.\n- The Osterøy Museum, on the other hand, focuses on the cultural and social aspects of emigration and the preservation of traditional practices. It highlights the cultural heritage of textiles, costumes, and building customs, offering a more holistic view of the cultural identity of the Norwegian people.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- Both museums are significant in their own right, but they approach the topic of textiles from different angles. The Textile Industry Museum is more industrial and economic, while the Osterøy Museum is more cultural and social. The Bergen Guide 2022 likely recognizes the importance of both museums in understanding the history and culture of Bergen and its people.\n\n![Osterøy Museum](image8)"}
