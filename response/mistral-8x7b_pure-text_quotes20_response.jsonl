The division in views is also evident in a graph showing that [confidence in China's President Xi has significantly decreased](http://www.pewglobal.org/2020/09/15/u-s- Image1 - confidence in President Xi is tied to concerns over how China has handled the coronavirus pandemic; Americans who say the Chinese government has done a bad job dealing with the coronavirus outbreak are significantly more likely to have no confidence in Xi (64%) than those who say it has done a good job (39%).\n\n![Confidence in China's President Xi has significantly decreased, particularly among those who believe China has handled the coronavirus outbreak poorly.](image1)\n\nIn summary, while a majority of Americans have negative views on China's handling of the COVID-19 outbreak, there is a divide when it comes to U.S.-China relations. This divide is more pronounced among different political affiliations, with Republicans more likely to hold China accountable for its role in the pandemic. Despite these differences, it's clear that confidence in China's leadership has been significantly impacted by the pandemic."}

This rising negativity also extends to how Americans perceive China's handling of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\n![Americans' unfavorable views of China reach a record 73%](image8)\n\nIn the context of the pandemic, a majority (64%) of Americans think that China has handled the COVID-19 outbreak poorly (image1). A substantial portion (78%) of respondents even places a great deal or fair amount of the blame for the global spread of the coronavirus on the Chinese government's initial handling of the outbreak in Wuhan (image5). As a result of China's handling, those who think China has done a poor job dealing with the outbreak or who blame China for the virus's global spread tend to have negative views of the country (image7).\n\n![64% of Americans think China has dealt poorly with the outbreak](image1)\n![78% place a great deal or fair amount of blame on China](image5)\n\nIn terms of economic ties, while 52% of Americans regard the U.S. as the world's leading economy (compared to only 32% who see China in this position), views of U.S. economic superiority have declined over the past four months (image2). There is a divide in opinion over whether to prioritize a strong economic relationship or holding China responsible for its role in the outbreak. Overall, 51% of Americans prefer pursuing a strong economic relationship, while a slight majority (50%) thinks the U.S. should hold China responsible for its role in the pandemic (image2 and image6).

This shift is also present in public sentiment, where half of Americans in 2019 thought defense spending should remain the same compared to 37% who favored increased spending in 2017 [3](image1). A partisan divide exists within the U.S., as Republicans and Republican-leaning independents are more likely than Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents to favor increased defense spending in Europe. However, there has been a decline in the number of Republicans supporting increased spending between 2017 and 2019 [9].\n\n![Support for U.S. defense spending in Europe has decreased since 2017](image1)\n\nGermans, on the other hand, have maintained a steady level of support for increased national defense spending, with a slight increase from 32% in 2017 to 40% in 2019 [1](image1). However, a larger portion of Germans (41%) is in favor of maintaining the current level of defense spending [8](image1).

Meanwhile, Germans, by contrast, are not as convinced of the importance of American military bases for their national security, with 45% disagreeing and only about half of Germans (49%) seeing U.S. military bases as important [7](image7).\n\nIn summary, American support for increased defense spending in Europe has decreased since 2017, with a significant partisan divide among supporters. Conversely, German sentiment on defense spending remains steady, though the public is divided on the issue.

In contrast, 62% of Democrats believe the WHO has handled the pandemic well. These differences highlight the partisan divide in evaluating the U.S.'s and international organizations' responses to the crisis.\n\nFurthermore, the perception of China's handling of the pandemic also varies greatly along party lines. While half or more of people on both sides of the aisle say China has not done a good job dealing with the outbreak, conservative Republicans are much more likely to hold this view, with 80% saying China has not handled the crisis well.\n\nIn summary, political affiliations significantly influence the perception of the U.S. and China's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, with Republicans generally holding more negative views of both the U.S. and China's responses compared to Democrats.

While half or more of people on both sides of the aisle say China has not done a good job dealing with the virus, Republicans are much more likely to hold this view than Democrats. Conservative Republicans are particularly likely to say China has not handled the crisis well: Eight-in-ten hold this view.  \n\nAnd for the U.S.'s perception:\n\n- [7] Americans’ views of how well the WHO has dealt with the coronavirus outbreak also fall along partisan lines. Whereas 62% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents say the organization has done at least a good job in handling the global pandemic, only 28% of Republicans and GOP leaners say the same. Conservative Republicans are less likely to applaud the organization’s handling of the virus than moderate or liberal Republicans.  \n\n- [1] are especially likely to say other countries are handling the outbreak well.

And the same pattern is found among Democrats.  \n\n- [11] Whereas evaluations of both the United States’ and China’s handling of the coronavirus outbreak are quite partisan, this is less the case when it comes to the other four countries asked about in the survey. Democrats are somewhat more likely than Republicans to say Italy, South Korea and Germany have handled the outbreak well. But, in each of these instances, the difference is less than 10 percentage points. In the case of the UK, 54% of Republicans say the country has done an excellent or good job, compared with 45% of Democrats.  \n\n- [10] Wide partisan gap on how U.S. has dealt with coronavirus; smaller differences in views of other countries’ responses  \n\n- [4] When it comes to assessments of how well the U.S. is dealing with the outbreak, those who think the U.S. can learn from foreign countries tend to evaluate its current handling of the pandemic less positively. Fewer than half $(44%)$ of those who think the U.S. can glean information from abroad say the country is doing an excellent or good job handling the outbreak, compared with $63%$ of those who say the U.S. can’t learn much from overseas.  \n\n- [5] As nations around the world grapple with how to respond to the COVID-19 outbreak, most Americans think the U.S. can learn from other countries about how to limit the spread of the coronavirus.  \n\n- [6] With stunning speed, the COVID-19 pandemic has swept across borders, claiming victims and shutting down economies in nations across the globe. The crisis has generated a variety of policy responses from governments, with varying degrees of success. When asked how well different countries have responded to the outbreak, Americans give high marks to South Korea and Germany. In contrast, most believe China – where the pandemic is believed to have originated – has done an only fair or poor job.  \n\n- [8] Education plays little role in how people feel about China’s handling of the virus. Rather, majorities of people in all educational groups say China has not handled the pandemic well.  \n\n- [12] The American public is largely split on how they think U.S. influence will be affected by the pandemic. Roughly three-in-ten believe the U.S.’s international clout will be bolstered after the outbreak, while the same share thinks it will be weakened.

According to a survey, about half of the Republicans believe that increased tariffs on Chinese and other foreign products were good for the U.S., especially conservative Republicans [5][12]. In contrast, the majority of Democrats hold the opinion that these tariffs were bad for their country [5]. This partisan disagreement extends to the assessment of how tariffs influence the country as a whole [3][4][5]. \n\nWhen taking a closer look at public sentiment, more people in the U.S. believe that the overall effects of the tariffs were bad (44%) rather than good (30%).

According to a survey, a majority of Republicans (51%) believe that increased tariffs on foreign goods have been good for the U.S., while only 14% of Democrats share this sentiment [3][4]. This partisan divide is also evident when looking at the opinion of specific groups within each party. For instance, conservative Republicans are more likely to view tariffs positively (61%) compared to moderate or liberal Republicans (37%), and Democrats consistently view tariffs negatively, with liberal Democrats being the most critical (63%) [4].\n\nRegarding the impression of international students, the majority of Americans (80%) think it is good for U.S. colleges and universities to accept them [11]. However, there is a split in opinion when it comes to Chinese students. While 55% of Americans support limiting the number of Chinese students studying in the U.S., a slightly higher percentage (43%) oppose such limitations [8].\n\nPolitical affiliations play a role in these opinions as well.

This trend also extends to those with lower levels of education, with 50% of those without a college degree favoring restrictions compared to 49% of college graduates who oppose it [6].\n\nPolitical affiliations play a substantial role in shaping these opinions as well.

Again, in 2014, the poverty rate of Hispanic households was substantially higher than the rate for all U.S. households, which indicates another significant economic disparity.\n\nLastly, the right graph in [image5](image5 “Comparison of financial metrics for Hispanic households vs all U.S. households from 2000 to 2014”) shows the median household wealth of Hispanic families in comparison to all U.S. households. The data illustrates that the wealth disparity has been increasing steadily over this period, with Hispanic households having significantly lower wealth levels in 2013 compared to all U.S. households.\n\nIn summary, Hispanic households face considerable economic challenges compared to all U.S. households in terms of unemployment, income, poverty rate, and wealth between 2000 and 2015. The data presented in the selected images and texts underscores these issues and serves as a call to action for identifying solutions to address these disparities."}

This indicates that while there is a gap between the tech adoption rates of all adults and seniors, the difference is significant in terms of internet and broadband usage.\n\nThe chart in image1 reveals the breakdown of online activities among seniors. It can be observed that **41% of older adults do not go online**, **32% go online but do not use Social Networking Services (SNS)**, and **27% use SNS**[1]. This shows a substantial percentage of seniors not utilizing the internet at all.\n\nTrends over time, as shown in image3, reveal that both all adults and seniors have seen an increase in technology adoption from 2000 to 2013[3]. Specifically, among seniors, there has been a considerable growth in cell phone ownership (from around 14% in 2000 to 77% in 2013), internet usage (from about 14% in 2000 to 59% in 2013), and broadband adoption (from virtually 0% in 2000 to 47% in 2013)[3].\n\nIn terms of daily internet usage, **71% of seniors who go online do so every day or almost every day**, with an additional **11%** going online three to five times a week[1].

On the other hand, a similarly large share of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents (68%) believe that individuals should be responsible for their own financial well-beings even if jobs are automated on a wide scale [4].

Americans with varying levels of educational attainment respond in broadly comparable ways on the question of whether the government has an obligation to take care of workers who are displaced by widespread automation of jobs. But those with lower levels of educational attainment are far more supportive of limiting the number of jobs that businesses can replace with machines. Among those with high school diplomas or less, fully 70% say there should be limits on the number of human jobs that businesses can automate, compared to only 41% among those with four-year college degrees [6].\n\nIn conclusion, while both political affiliations and education levels affect opinions on government obligations and automation limits related to job displacement, they do so in different ways.

As of January 2019, only 39% of the public approves of Trump's job performance, which is close to the lowest of any president at this point in their term [(image1)(1)]. Moreover, views of the ethical standards of top Trump administration officials remain at record lows [(image10)(10)]. This is in stark contrast to previous administrations, as the chart demonstrates, where approval ratings for other presidents at similar points in their terms were significantly higher.\n\nEconomic Impact [(image11)(11), (image4)(4)](#image11)\nDespite negative views regarding the ethical standards of Trump's administration, the public generally sees Trump's impact on the economy in a positive light. 40% of the public believe that Trump's policies have made economic conditions better since taking office [(image11)(11)]. Interestingly, the support for Trump's economic policies is highly polarized along party lines. Almost eight-in-ten Republicans and Republican leaners (79%) say that Trump's economic policies have improved conditions, as of December 2018, compared to just 13% of Democrats and Democratic leaners [(image4)(4)]. This contrast is evident in (image11)(11) as well, which highlights how opinions differ significantly between political parties.\n\nLong-term Success [(image3)(3), (image8)(8)](#image3)\nRegarding the long-term success of the Trump presidency, opinions are also deeply divided along political lines. Among Republicans and Republican leaners, 65% think that Trump will be a successful president in the long run as of January 2019 [(image3)(3)]. Conversely, among Democrats and Democratic leaners, an overwhelming 80% believe that Trump will be unsuccessful in the long run [(image8)(8)]. These differences are consistent with the partisan divide in other aspects of Trump's presidency.\n\nComparing Trump's Presidency with Previous Presidents [(image3)(3), (image8)(8)](#image3)\nComparing image3(3) and image8(8), one can see that there are substantial disparities in how supporters and opponents of a president view their success during their terms. For instance, only 3% of Democrats and Democratic leaners think that Trump will be successful, compared to 65% of Republicans and Republican leaners. Meanwhile, 80% of Democrats and Democratic leaners perceive Trump's tenure as unsuccessful, while only 6% of Republicans and Republican leaners share that view. This contrasts heavily with how different party affiliations viewed previous presidents such as Obama, Bush, and Clinton.\n\nTo summarize, the public sees Trump's economic impact positively, but his administration faces low approval ratings and negative perceptions regarding trust and ethical standards. Additionally, perceptions of his long-term success as president are widely divided along party lines. When compared to previous administrations, it is clear that political affiliations play a significant role in evaluating and shaping opinions of a president's tenure."}

When comparing this to previous presidents, like Obama, Bush, and Clinton at similar points in their administrations, the partisan divide is much more pronounced for Trump.\n\n![Polarized views of Trump's success among party affiliates](image2)\n\nAs for the trend in public opinion over time, trust in Trump compared to other presidents has increased since April 2017, when 51% of Americans said they trusted what Trump says less than previous presidents [12]. Moreover, a chart comparing opinions from January 2019 and October 2017 on whether something made things better, had not much effect, or made things worse reveals a stark contrast between party views [1]. In January 2019, 79% of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents reported that Trump's actions made things better, while only 10% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents shared this view.\n\n![Change in public opinion on Trump's actions](image1)\n\nIn conclusion, public perceptions of Trump's presidency are more polarized compared to his predecessors, with Trump having a significantly higher percentage of supporters among his party affiliates.

This divergence in opinions correlates with their respective levels of confidence in Mueller's investigation.\n\nWhile a majority of Democrats (80%) express a lack of confidence in Trump's ability to handle the special counsel's investigation appropriately, three-quarters of Republicans say they are confident in Trump [5]. Moreover, the public's confidence in Mueller's fairness investigation has remained stable over time, with about two-thirds of Republicans and similar proportions of Democrats holding consistent opinions [6, 10]. \n\n![Public opinion on Trump's potential success, with 65% of Republicans and 3% of Democrats believing Trump will be successful.](image6)\n\nIt is also worth noting that partisan views on presidential success are not a new development. For example, in January 2011, 47% of Republicans thought President Obama would be unsuccessful, whereas only 43% of Democrats held the same opinion [8]. Partisan divides are indicative of political polarization, which extends beyond views on Trump and Mueller's investigation.\n\nIn conclusion, Republican and Democratic respondents have significantly different perceptions regarding Trump's potential success as a president.

This partisan gap has persisted over time, as evidenced by [9], where the public's view of job availability has become more positive, especially among Republicans.\n\nQuotes such as [3] and [7] emphasize the positive outlook of the economy among Republicans, as they feel more optimistic about their personal financial situations and future finances compared to Democrats.\n\nMoreover, the image quotes also provide valuable insights. For example, image2 demonstrates shifts in political affiliations since 2001. From 2001 to 2019, support for Republicans/Lean Republican increased from 46% to 71%, while support for Democrats/Lean Democrat saw a more subtle increase from 42% to 53%.\n\nImage3 further strengthens the argument by displaying trends from 2000 to 2019 that highlight the growing divergence between Republicans/Lean Republican and Democrats/Lean Democrat, particularly around 2016. Such shifts in political leaning may significantly impact perceptions of economic conditions and job availability.\n\nLastly, image7 clearly shows fluctuations in job market perceptions over time. Between 2001 and 2019, the number of people who believed \"jobs are difficult to find\" declined, while more indicated \"plenty of jobs available,\" which coincides with the positive economic trends.\n\nIn conclusion, perceptions of economic conditions and job availability significantly differ between political affiliations, with a noticeable partisan gap persisting over time. This difference is influenced by shifts in political affiliations seen in the provided image quotes and direct quotes emphasizing the contrasting views and opinions between Republicans and Democrats. Both text and image quotes suggest that a majority of Americans, particularly Republicans, view local job opportunities as widely available, while acknowledging that there's a difference in perception between \"jobs\" and \"good jobs.\" **Considering all the evidence, it's safe to say that due to positive trends in the economy and a shift in political leanings, Republicans generally view local job opportunities and their personal finances more optimistically than Democrats.**"}

This trend is observed across both major political parties, albeit with a larger proportion of Republicans (71%) than Democrats (53%) holding this view [4][5]. This indicates that, relatively speaking, Republicans are more likely to believe that jobs are widely available in their communities. This sentiment has increased since 2017, especially among Republicans [5][6].\n\nThe chart regarding political affiliation trends shows that while there has been a shift toward the Republican party in terms of political affiliation from 2001 to 2019, the proportion of Democrats has also increased since 2016 [![From 2001 to 2019, there has been a shift toward the Republican party in terms of political affiliation, with an increase in the proportion of Democrats since 2016](image1)][12].\n\nHowever, it is important to note that public satisfaction with the state of the nation has not risen in tandem with positive views of the local job market. Currently, only 26% of Americans are satisfied with the way things are going in the country, marking a decline from the 33% observed in September 2018 [10]. This discrepancy demonstrates that although job market perceptions are generally positive, other factors continue to influence the public's overall -satisfaction with the nation's progress.\n\nIn conclusion, perceptions of job availability have become more positive over time and display a notable partisan gap, with Republicans being more likely to believe that jobs are available locally. However, higher satisfaction with the job market has not led to increased overall satisfaction with the country's state of affairs.\n\n[Positive views of the availability of jobs locally have risen since the question was last asked in October 2017, tracking with more positive views of the economy over this period](image11).\n[A sizable partisan gap in perceptions of job availability exists, with 71% of Republicans and only 53% of Democrats inclined to believe that jobs are widely available locally](image6).\n[Despite positive views of the availability of jobs, public satisfaction with national conditions has not increased](image3)."}

Political affiliations have also shifted over time, with support swaying between Republicans and Democrats during different presidencies [4].

While a similar proportion of Democrats (46%) and Republicans (55%) believe that Wall Street helps the economy more than it hurts, a larger share of Democrats (46%) compared to Republicans (31%) think Wall Street has a negative impact [8].\n\nIn summary, public satisfaction levels have declined since 1990, and political affiliations have continuously shifted.

This corresponds to the fact that 62% of them believe that lifting restrictions has been too slow; however, the sentiment is more divided, with only 31% agreeing that restrictions have not been lifted quickly enough and a similarly substantial 36% believing that increased infections, not just more tests, are the primary cause of the escalation in cases.\n\nFurthermore, image3 highlights this disparity in perceptions among political groups, with the vast majority of Democrats seeing more new infections as the primary cause for increasing cases. Simultaneously, more Republicans attribute the increase to rising testing—a difference primarily driven by opposing views among conservative and moderate Republicans within [9]. Additionally, image8 depicts this significant divergence between political affiliations on reasons for the spread and lifting restrictions too quickly.\n\nIn conclusion, among Democrats, there is a clear concern about lifting restrictions too quickly, which they predominantly relate to the rise in COVID-19 cases resulting from more infections.

Among White adults, 54% favor this policy, while larger shares of Black (65%), Hispanic (72%), and Asian (71%) Democrats support it [3]. This suggests that non-White racial groups and Democrats, in general, are more supportive of voter ID requirements than their White counterparts within the Democratic party.\n\nOn the other hand, the data shows that Republicans are more likely to strongly favor photo identification requirements for voting (81%) compared to Democrats (30%) [11]. This wide gap in favorability indicates a strong partisan division on this issue.\n\nWhen comparing racial groups, Black adults show among the lowest levels of support for more restrictive policies like removing people from registration lists if they haven't recently voted or confirmed their registration and requiring voters to show government-issued photo identification [10].\n\nIn summary, while a majority of Americans support voter ID requirements, there are variations in support across racial groups and political affiliations.

However, when it comes to showing government-issued photo identification to vote, White Democrats are less likely to strongly favor this requirement compared to Black, Hispanic, and Asian Democrats [3, 7]. These trends are illustrated in image1, which displays the total percentage support for various voting-related policies, including requiring electronic voting machines to print a paper backup of the ballot, making early, in-person voting available for at least two weeks prior to Election Day, and requiring all voters to show government-issued photo identification to vote.\n\nWhite Republicans, on the other hand, are more likely than Democrats to strongly favor photo identification requirements for voting, even as majorities in both partisan groups favor this policy [7]. The strong support for photo identification requirements among Republicans, regardless of race and ethnicity, is evident in both textual and visual data, and it is showcased in image1 and mentioned in [7].\n\nIn summary, while both White Democrats and Republicans have distinct perspectives on voting policies compared to their respective racial and ethnic counterparts within their parties, the overall trend indicates that Democrats, regardless of race, are more supportive of voting accessibility policies compared to Republicans.

Around 19% of Republicans disapprove of these non-legislative commissions, while 8% of Democrats disapprove. Nevertheless, Republicans are more likely than Democrats to say they are not sure either way (42% vs. 32%).\n\nLastly, the data shows that there was a significant disparity between how Republicans and Democrats voted in the presidential election.

Yet, 77% of these voters are dissatisfied with the way things are going in the country, and 54% disapprove of the way Joe Biden is handling his job as president [5].\n\nThe 2022 National Survey of Latinos by Pew Research Center highlights some interesting perceptions amongst Latino registered voters. For instance, 71% believe that the Democratic Party works hard to earn their votes, while only 45% think the Republican Party does the same [1][6]. Moreover, 63% of Latino registered voters think that the Democratic Party really cares about Latinos, whereas only 34% think the Republican Party does [6][image6]. The chart [image3] illustrating the preferences of different voter demographic groups towards Democratic or Republican candidates further underscores these points, with a clear majority of Latino registered voters favoring Democratic candidates.\n\nWhile fewer than half of Hispanics say there is a great deal of difference between the parties [6][image8], the survey shows that equal shares of Latino Democrats and Democratic-leaning registered voters and Latino Republicans and Republican-leaning registered voters believe that it really matters who wins control of Congress [5]. This suggests that despite the perceived similarities between the parties, Hispanic voters are closely monitoring political developments and actively engaged in the electoral process.\n\nIn conclusion, although the views of Latino voters regarding the differences between Democratic and Republican parties have not evolved significantly in recent years, the data shows a clear preference for Democratic candidates amongst Latino registered voters. The impact of these perceptions on party affiliations in recent years is a more nuanced issue, with dissatisfaction towards the current state of the country and political leadership existing alongside partisan leanings.\n\n![A substantial share of Latino voters have soft ties to the political parties, but 64% identify with or lean toward the Democratic Party.](image4) ![Latino voters show a clear preference for Democratic candidates over Republican ones.](image3)"}

This perception is consistent across genders. Regarding job characteristics, both men and women in STEM value having the flexibility to balance work and family needs to a similar extent (71% of men and 76% of women). However, some disparities arise when examining other characteristics:\n\n- **Opportunities for Promotion:** Men in STEM value having opportunities for promotion more than women in STEM fields (57% of men vs. 46% of women).\n- **High-Paying Jobs:** A similar pattern is observed in perceptions of high-paying jobs, with 59% of men and 48% of women in STEM jobs valuing this characteristic.\n- **Meaningful Contribution to Society:** Women in STEM are more likely to consider contributing to society as important compared to men in STEM jobs (60% of women vs. 51% of men).\n- **Helping Others:** This difference between men and women in STEM jobs is even more pronounced when considering jobs focused on helping others (59% of women vs. 31% of men).\n\nThese findings suggest that while both genders acknowledge the potential for better compensation in STEM jobs to a similar degree, their priorities in terms of job characteristics vary.

Meanwhile, the percentages for blacks and Hispanics show that limited access to quality education contributes more significantly to their underrepresentation than discrimination. Additionally, fewer blacks and Hispanics report being encouraged to pursue STEM from an early age and facing discrimination in recruitment, hiring, and promotion. This suggests that while discrimination plays a role for all three groups, disparities in education opportunity have a more substantial impact on underrepresentation for blacks and Hispanics, whereas a lack of encouragement and work-family balance issues have more impact on women in STEM.\n\nHere's the direct answer to summarize the main reasons and differences:\n\n- Underrepresentation of women is mainly due to discrimination, lack of encouragement, and work-family balance issues.\n- Underrepresentation of blacks and Hispanics is mostly due to limited access to quality education, lack of encouragement, and discrimination.\n- The impact of education disparity is more significant for blacks and Hispanics, while the impact of discouragement and work-family balance issues is more pronounced for women in STEM."}

Additionally, 48% of women in male-dominated workplaces believe their gender has made it harder for them to succeed, while only 12% of women in STEM jobs who work in majority-female workplaces share this perception [11].\n\nA study also shows that 50% of women in STEM have faced gender discrimination, compared to 19% of men, and 20% of women in STEM feel their gender has made it harder for them to succeed [2].

One significant factor is language. According to [image1], among self-identified Hispanics, 71% do not speak Spanish, while 28% do. This pattern varies across generations, with a higher proportion of foreign-born Hispanics speaking Spanish (41%) compared to only 7% of third or higher generation Hispanics. Furthermore, having a Spanish last name is not a universal indicator of self-identified Hispanic status; 84% of self-identified Hispanics do not have a Spanish last name, as shown in [image1].\n\nAnother essential factor is upbringing, as detailed in [image3]. Among those who do not identify as Hispanic, 16% cite their upbringing and lack of contact with Hispanic relatives as the reason. This factor may contribute to the variations in self-identification across generations. For instance, those in the third or higher generation might have less contact with their Hispanic roots due to their U.S. upbringing, as suggested in [5] and [6].\n\nLastly, ancestry and its ties to American identity also impact self-identification ([4], [9], and [10]). Among U.S. adults with Hispanic ancestry, 11% do not identify as Hispanic. As revealed in [10], by the third generation, only 77% self-identify as Hispanic. It is worth noting that there is a growing trend of U.S.-born Hispanics of Hispanic and non-Hispanic heritage, causing variations in the connection to Hispanic identity and culture based on family immigrant experiences ([11]).\n\nIn conclusion, language, upbringing, and ancestry all contribute to the self-identification of Hispanics in the U.S., and these factors express different influences depending on the generational background. A significant percentage of self-identified Hispanics do not speak Spanish, have a diverse background, and may not tie their identity to their Hispanic ancestry.\n\n![Language and last name factors among self-identified Hispanics](image1)\n\n![Frequency of experience or engagement in an unspecified action for Hispanics and non-Hispanics](image2)\n\n![Reasons why individuals may not identify as Hispanic](image3)\n\n![Frequency of self-identification as Hispanic by origin and generation](image4)\n\n![Preferred self-identification terms among self-identified Hispanics](image5)"}

This sentiment is strong among all generations: 58% of immigrant Latinos, 84% of second-generation Latinos, and 92% of third or higher generation Latinos agree [4].\n\nIn terms of self-identification, the data suggests that being foreign-born increases the likelihood of often self-identifying as Hispanic (57%) compared to second (50%) and third or higher generation individuals (33) [2]. However, for non-Hispanics, the majority (53%) never identify as Hispanic [2]. Different reasons contribute to not identifying as Hispanic, including mixed background, no contact with Hispanic relatives, not speaking Spanish, identifying with another race, or being born in the U.S. [3].\n\nRegarding language use, more than 90% of third or higher generation Hispanics do not speak Spanish [4]. Connections with ancestral national origins also decline as immigrant roots become more distant [9]. The share of immigrants who feel very or somewhat connected with their country of origin is 82%, compared to 69% for second-generation Hispanics, and only 44% for third or higher generation Hispanics [9]. In contrast, the share of third or higher generation Latinos who most often call themselves American is 56%, reflecting their strong ties to their U.S. national identity [7].\n\nIn conclusion, generational differences among Hispanics significantly impact self-identification preferences and language use. With each subsequent generation, the tendency to self-identify as Hispanic decreases, the ties to U.S. national identity increase, and the likelihood of speaking Spanish significantly drops.\n\n![Foreign-born Hispanics tend to often self-identify as Hispanic (57%), while a majority (53%) of non-Hispanics never identify as Hispanic.](image2)\n![More than 90% of third or higher generation Hispanics do not speak Spanish. ](image4)\n![Third or higher generation Hispanics (56%) tend to most often call themselves American, reflecting strong U.S. national identity ties.](image7)"}

However, a significant portion of the population still holds onto traditional values, as noted by sentiments such as *\"Traditional values mean a lot tome,andought to be preserved for generations to come\"* [8, 12].\n\nImage1 provides a comparative perspective on these attitudes across various countries and regions. It's a bar chart from 2014, showing the distribution of opinions on values (traditional vs modern) in different regions. The red segments represent the percentage of people who value tradition, while the orange segments show those leaning towards modernity. For example, in Egypt, about 70% of the population still clings to traditional values, while only 30% are embracing modernity [1].\n\nOn the other hand, some countries like the UAE have a higher percentage of people leaning towards modern values (47%) compared to those preserving traditional values (53%). Interestingly, GCC countries have a more balanced view, with 50% leaning towards each side [1]. \n\nIn conclusion, while there is a clear movement towards embracing modern values [11, 2, 11], traditional values continue to hold significance for many [8, 12].

It reveals that from 2011 to 2014, the GCC countries' concern about the rising cost of living remained at 63%. This stability suggests that, despite any economic fluctuations, the cost of living remains a persistent challenge.\n\nIn comparison, **Non-GCC countries have shown a similar level of concern**, with data from [image8] indicating their concern at 55% in 2014. It is interesting to note that although the GCC and Non-GCC countries have comparable levels of concern about the rising cost of living, the GCC countries exhibit a slightly higher level of worry.\n\nRegarding unemployment, the differences are more nuanced. [Image3] illustrates that the majority of respondents from Egypt, Jordan, Kuwait, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE are \"Very concerned\" about unemployment, even surpassing the level of concern for the rising cost of living in [image8]. For the rest of the Non-GCC countries (Oman, Lebanon, Bahrain, Iraq, Tunisia, Libya, Algeria, Morocco, Yemen, and Palestine), [image4] indicates that their concern about unemployment still constitutes a significant portion of their worries.\n\nHowever, when directly comparing GCC and Non-GCC countries, the difference in unemployment concern is less pronounced in [image8]. Here, both GCC and Non-GCC countries express concern about unemployment; albeit slightly higher in the Non-GCC nations.\n\nIn summary, GCC and Non-GCC countries display a comparable level of concern regarding the rising cost of living, with the GCC countries appearing to have slightly higher anxiety about this issue. As for unemployment, both sets of countries exhibit generally high concern levels, but the differences between the regions are minimal when comparing the data directly. These findings highlight that, despite some regional differences, the concerns about the rising cost of living and unemployment are prevalent throughout the Middle Eastern region."}

We can see this impact through the lens of several aspects, including the increasing digital payments penetration, the rise of e-commerce platforms, and the shift in advertising spends.\n\nFirstly, the shift towards electronic payment methods in online retail has been substantial. [Image1](image1 - \"By 2016, Cash on Delivery is projected to decrease to 50%, as other electronic payment methods, such as debit cards, net banking, EMI, and 3rd party wallets increase.\") shows a clear trend of increasing adoption for various electronic payment methods during this period, with a significant decrease in the Cash on Delivery (COD) method from 60% in 2013 to a projected 50% in 2016. This shift highlights the growing trust of Indian consumers in electronic transactions and is indicative of a positive change in the digital commerce landscape.\n\nSecondly, [image4](image4 - \"A visual representation of the growth in smartphone users, with 120 million users in 2014 and 380 million users in 2016.\") demonstrates the rapid growth of smartphone users in India between 2014 and 2016—a surge from 120 million users to 380 million users. This massive increase in smartphone users has created a fertile ground for e-commerce platforms, making it easier for customers to access and make purchases online.\n\nMoreover, the evolution of e-commerce, as shown in [image3](image3 - \"A hockey stick diagram depicting the expansion of e-commerce, highlighting multiple growth phases and elements.\")—from inventory-led marketplaces to acquisitions and the addition of various product categories like furniture, jewelry, and homes—suggests that e-commerce players have been proactive in expanding their offerings and infrastructure to cater to the increasing demand.\n\nLastly, in terms of digital advertising, as shown in [image2](image2 - \"A Facebook profile of a politician, featuring social media following data and a graph of user numbers from 110 million in 2014 to 175 million in 2016.\") and [image5](image5 - \"Table comparing the values of different media categories, including Digital, from 2012 to 2016.\"), digital has experienced the fastest growth compared to traditional media, with a CAGR of 29.9% between 2012 and 2016. This indicates that advertisers' focus has shifted towards digital channels due to better targeting, personalization, and overall effectiveness.\n\nTo sum up, the growth in digital media and e-commerce between 2014 and 2018 has created significant opportunities for businesses and advertisers, making it crucial for them to adapt and capitalize on the evolving trends. The boom in digital payments, the rapid growth of smartphone users, and the surge in digital advertising prove this impact. This shift in consumer behavior has allowed more players to enter the digital ecosystem, increasing retention, improving logistics efficiency, and driving customer-centric offerings."}

It's worth noting that downloading games/apps is by far the most popular downloaded content, indicating a strong preference for entertainment and gaming among Indonesian mobile internet users.\n\nText quote [7] supports this trend, stating that there are plenty of BB M Group \"online shops\" especially for fashion and apparels, in addition to Instagram and Facebook \"shops\" or F-commerce. E-commerce users prefer to shop online through conventional e-commerce sites (20%), social media (26%), IM group like BB M Group (27%), and forum and classifieds like Kaskus and OL X (27%).\n\nIn conclusion, social media and entertainment-related mobile internet activities significantly influence the shopping behaviors of users in Indonesia. Users often engage in these activities and subsequently make purchases related to them, such as shopping for fashion items and downloading games or apps. The high percentage of downloads related to entertainment reflects the strong preference of Indonesian mobile internet users for such content. ![Indonesian mobile internet users prefer social media and entertainment-related activities, which influence their shopping behaviors](image2)"}

This is evident in image1, which shows a downward trend for Voice ARPU and SMS ARPU during the period. In 2013 and 2014, Telkomsel had 35.4 million smartphone users, while XL had 15 million smartphone users [3][image3].\n\nThe decline in ARPU might be attributed to a few factors. First, as mentioned in quotes [2] and [4], tariffs have hit rock-bottom, leading to reduced revenues, as there is no longer a price war. Moreover, the increasing use of data-based IM, VoIP, and similar services has resulted in even less usage of SMS and voice calls, further impacting the ARPU [4][7].\n\nFor smartphone users, we notice a growth in the number of users during this period [3]. As indicated in quote [9], the e-commerce industry saw rapid growth in mobile adoption during this time. This surge in mobile usage could eventually lead to an increase in Data ARPU in the latter part of the period (2015 onwards) as users consume more data for their online activities [5].\n\nIn summary, the number of smartphone users for Telkomsel and XL increased between 2013 and 2014. However, ARPU declined due to factors like reduced tariffs and the shift towards data-based communication services. The growing e-commerce sector could eventually contribute to an increase in Data ARPU in the future.\n\nConclusion: The number of smartphone users for Telkomsel and XL increased between 2013 and 2014, while ARPU declined due to factors like reduced tariffs and the shift towards data-based communication services. The growing e-commerce sector could eventually contribute to an increase in Data ARPU in the future.\n![Data](image1)\n![Telkomsel and XL Smartphone Users and ARPU Trends](image3)"}

This input is processed through a bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) encoder, which creates an encoding of the user's utterance (text quote [2]). This encoding, along with the system's dialogue act embedding from the previous turn (image6), is then input into an LSTM Dialogue State to update the current state.\n\nThe updated LSTM Dialogue State is then used in dialogue state tracking, where slots or variables are identified, like the \"date\" being set to \"Thursday\" (image6).

According to [3], training a common NLP model can emit 1,924 pounds of CO₂e, which is roughly equivalent to the emissions produced by a trans-American flight between New York and San Francisco and back [5]. This demonstrates that training NLP models contributes significantly to greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nWhen considering the emissions from an average human life over one year, which is around 11,023 pounds of CO₂e [5], we can see that training certain NLP models can produce emissions equivalent to or even greater than an individual's annual carbon footprint.\n\nAdditionally, the average American life over one year results in approximately 36,156 pounds of CO₂e emissions [5]. This highlights the considerable environmental impact of training NLP models, which, if unchecked, could contribute significantly to the escalating rates of natural disasters.\n\nLastly, the average emissions from a car, including fuel, over its lifetime reach about 126,000 pounds of CO₂e [5]. Although this figure is significantly higher than the emissions produced by training NLP models, it is essential to remember that the environmental consequences of training these models are still a concern, given the increasing reliance on them for various applications.\n\nTo put things into perspective, [4] reveals that training BERT on GPU is roughly equivalent to a trans-American flight. Training advanced models like GPT-2 or performing NAS (Neural Architecture Search) can lead to even higher emissions. It is crucial to adopt more energy-efficient practices in training NLP models and allocate energy resources wisely to minimize their environmental impact.\n\nIn conclusion, the CO₂e emissions produced by training NLP models can be comparable to, and in some cases, even greater than, everyday activities such as air travel, an average human life's annual emissions, and the average American life's annual emissions.

This type of reasoning is used in 12.1% of the cases in the SciTAB dataset.\n\nAnother important aspect is numerical reasoning, which includes simple lookup, comparison, subtraction, division, and other arithmetic operations. These operations are used to compare values in the table and draw conclusions. For instance, in the example provided, the claim is supported because the productivity of 57.5% appears 7.5% more often than expected by random chance.\n\nHowever, there are also several challenges that arise when verifying claims in the SciTAB dataset.

Conversely, when 'refuted' claims are inaccurately predicted as 'supported', models often overlook the presence of negation, demonstrating a lack of numerical reasoning capabilities.\n\nAdditionally, the model tends to default to the 'NEI' (uncertain) choice when faced with complex cases that demand extensive reasoning and a deep understanding of research findings.\n\n![InstructGPT and GPT-4 struggle in accurately predicting the NEI class in SCI TAB's zero-shot 3-class classification](image7)\n\nSources:\n[7] Instruct GP T and GPT-4\n[3] Refuted and NEI claim types and their reasons in ScITaB\n[8] Model performance impacted by reason distribution in ScITaB reasoning steps"}

InstructGPT displays a pattern of being \"less confident,\" frequently classifying supported and refuted claims as NEI. On the other hand, GPT-4 exhibits overconfidence, incorrectly categorizing NEI claims as either supported or refuted. This reveals the challenge of distinguishing whether a claim is verifiable in the context of S CI T AB.\n\nLooking at the types of errors contributing to the performance differences, we can examine the distribution of errors in the S CI T AB dataset. Image2 shows the reasons for refuted claims and NEI classifications. The major refuted reasons include wrong calculation results (41.7%), wrong approximation words (33.3%), and claims being partially right (10.0%). Meanwhile, the primary NEI reasons include a lack of matching evidence (33.3%), lack of open-domain knowledge (25.0%), and lack of closed-domain knowledge (15.0%).\n\nMoreover, image3 highlights the estimated proportions of different types of errors, with grounding errors making up 50% and ambiguity errors accounting for 22%. These error types may contribute to the performance differences between the models, as InstructGPT and GPT-4 might handle grounding and ambiguity errors differently.\n\nLastly, it is important to note that both models perform significantly worse than human annotators. According to text quote [2], the best result achieved by an open source LLM is 63.62 for the 2-class setting and 38.05 for the 3-class setting, which are only moderately better than random guessing. A well-trained human annotator, however, can achieve 92.46 and 84.73 F1 scores in the 2-class and 3-class settings, respectively. This reinforces the challenging nature of S CI T AB and its potential to be the future benchmark for scientific fact-checking.\n\nIn conclusion, despite both InstructGPT and GPT-4 facing challenges in accurately classifying the NEI category in the zero-shot 3-class task, GPT-4 shows more confidence in its predictions, which sometimes leads to incorrect categorizations. Grounding and ambiguity errors, as well as the lack of matching evidence and open-domain knowledge, may contribute to the performance differences between these models. Human annotators, however, significantly outperform both models, pointing to the dataset's challenging nature and its potential as a future benchmark for scientific fact-checking.\n\nComparing the performance of InstructGPT and GPT-4 on the zero-shot 3-class classification task:\n![Comparing the performance of InstructGPT and GPT-4 on the zero-shot 3-class classification task](image8)\n\nThe challenges of grounding and ambiguity errors in S CI T AB:\n![Grounding and ambiguity errors in S CI T AB](image3)\n\nHuman annotators' superior performance:\n![Human annotators' superior performance](image1)"}

This difference in behavior highlights the challenge of distinguishing between refuted and NEI claims, which is inherently difficult and something human annotators struggle with as well (Jiang et al., 2020).\n\nThe lower performance in the 3-class setting compared to the 2-class setting reveals struggles in distinguishing between 'refuted' and 'NEI' claims. The inclusion of the NEI class tends to diminish the models' confidence and shift their predictions from 'supported/refuted' to 'NEI', resulting in poorer results ([6]). Furthermore, image7 shows that GPT-4 has a much higher tendency to predict Supported or Refuted when the true label is NEI, indicating a struggle to identify claims with insufficient information.\n\nIn conclusion, the main challenges faced by InstructGPT and GPT-4 in accurately classifying NEI claims in the zero-shot 3-class classification task are distinguishing between 'refuted' and 'NEI' claims and maintaining confidence in predictions where domain knowledge or the availability of information is limited.\n\n![InstructGPT and GPT-4 struggle with NEI classification in the zero-shot 3-class setting, especially discriminating between refuted and NEI claims and maintaining confidence in predictions where domain knowledge or information availability is limited.](image7)"}

This concept is explored in the context of retrieval analysis through an experiment that removes an increasing number of knowledge elements.\n\nThe line graph in image1, titled \"Experiment Result on Conscious Incompetence,\" illustrates the impact of removed knowledge elements on precision, recall, and F1-Score. As more knowledge is removed, we can observe the following trends:\n\n- **Precision** (blue line with circle markers) significantly increases, starting around 14 and reaching approximately 26. This increase in precision suggests that the model becomes more confident in its responses as more knowledge is removed, as there is less information to contradict its generated outputs.\n- **Recall** (orange line with diamond markers) remains relatively stable, starting around 14 and ending slightly below 15. Despite the model's increased confidence, its ability to identify and utilize all the relevant available knowledge remains consistent, which is crucial for maintaining good recall.\n- **F1-Score** (green line with triangle markers) exhibits a moderate increase, starting around 14 and ending around 18. The F1-Score is a harmonic mean of precision and recall, offering a balanced perspective on how the model is performing in the context of increased removed knowledge elements.\n\nTo further understand the consequences of the model's performance in the context of Conscious Incompetence, let's examine image2. This table (image2) displays the performance metrics of two models (possibly GPT-4 and ChatGPT) as knowledge is progressively removed. The columns \"Removed,\" \"Corr.,\" \"Prec.,\" \"Rec.,\" and \"F1\" likely represent the measured metrics for each model under different settings of removed knowledge elements. The rows, labelled from \"0 (gold)\" to \"3,\" show the deterioration in performance as knowledge is removed. As the number of removed knowledge elements increases, there is a discernible decline in the model's performance, illustrating the challenges of Conscious Incompetence.\n\nThe image3 diagram offers visual guidance on evaluating precision and recall for generated citations, allowing us to assess the model output in the context of Conscious Incompetence.\n\nFrom the experimental evidence, it can be concluded that the removal of knowledge elements adversely impacts precision, recall, and F1-Score in the context of Conscious Incompetence and retrieval analysis. Models like GPT-4 and ChatGPT experience a quantifiable drop in their performance as knowledge is removed, highlighting the significance of incorporating diverse attribution sources and addressing coverage problems in future language attribution works.\n\nIn summary, the removal of knowledge elements results in models becoming more confident in their generated outputs, as seen by an increase in precision, while their ability to effectively recall and identify all relevant knowledge remains consistent. This trade-off between confidence and recall highlights the challenges of Conscious Incompetence, manifesting in reduced precision, recall, and F1-Score as more knowledge is removed during retrieval analysis.\n\nConclusion: The removal of knowledge elements negatively affects precision, recall, and F1-Score in the context of Conscious Incompetence and retrieval analysis. As more knowledge is removed, there is a decline in the model's performance Pinpointing the Need for Incorporating Diverse Attribution Sources and Addressing Coverage Issues in Future Language Attribution Works."}

[1](image1) shows an ablation study of ChatGPT for demonstrations and iterative retrieval, focusing on the impact of logical constraints on performance and consistency. As the number of demonstration samples increases, models with logical constraints generally perform better than those without them. This trend is consistent across both the MAVEN-ERE and CTB datasets.\n\nMoreover, [2](image2) illustrates three methods for incorporating logical constraints into large language models (LLMs)—generative, retrieval, and pre-training. These methods enable models to derive answers more accurately based on refined logical constraints, leading to improved performance and consistency in capturing relationships between events.\n\n[3](image3) highlights the performance of two models, Vicuna-13B-PT and Llama2-13B-PT, on the MAVEN-ERE and Causal-TimeBank datasets given various conditions, including vanilla ICL, vanilla ICL with CoT, and CoT with logical constraints. Different configurations, such as using all logical constraints, retrieved logical constraints, and post-processing, yield better Micro-F1 scores and lower logical inconsistency percentages.\n\nThe [4](image4) case study demonstrates that pre-training techniques can increase the logical consistency of generated outputs, as shown by comparing the Llama-2-13B and Llama-2-13B-PT models.\n\nOverall, logical constraints and demonstration samples can positively impact model performance on tasks requiring deductive reasoning and event-related information extraction. The challenge lies in obtaining relevant logic and utility constraints for LLMs, but combining methods like pre-training, generative, and retrieval-based approaches can yield improved and consistent results across various models and datasets."}

These improvements are particularly notable for rare categories. For example, as shown in [5], the RAR method achieves a peak performance on APr (Average Precision for rare classes), surpassing the CLIP model by up to 19.6 percentage points. This indicates a substantial advantage of the RAR method in handling rare categories, demonstrating the method's enhanced ability to discriminate among infrequently encountered objects.\n\nThe RAR's integration with MLLMs (Multimodal Large Language Models) plays a crucial role in this enhancement. The retrieving and reranking mechanism effectively pools relevant information from the external memory, providing the MLLMs with a richer context for rare class identification. This mechanism ensures that even lesser-represented classes receive adequate attention during the classification process, addressing one of the significant challenges in long-tailed distribution datasets.\n\nTo visualize these improvements, consider the following image:\n\n![The RAR models show significant improvements in zero-shot object recognition, particularly for rare categories, over the baseline models.](image8)\n\nThis image is from the LVIS validation set, where the CLIP & K-NN approach provides an extensive list of object predictions, but the most accurate label might not always emerge as the top-1 choice.

Similar to the FL enhancement, the DL variant doesn't show significant improvements over the baseline BERT model for the MRPC and QQP datasets (image2).\n\n3. **BERT-MRC+DSC**: Among all the enhancements, DSC outperforms other models in terms of F1-score improvement. In the English OntoNotes 5.0 dataset, it shows an improvement of +0.96 (image1), the highest among all the enhancements. For the MRPC and QQP datasets (image2), this variant achieves the highest F1-scores, with an improvement of +2.36 seen in the OntoNotes4.0 dataset, resulting in a new SOTA performance (image11).\n\nIn summary, the DSC enhancement consistently brings a substantial improvement to the BERT-MRC models in terms of F1-score, making BERT-MRC+DSC outperform other enhancements on multiple datasets. In contrast, FL and DL show inconsistent results, with minimal improvements or weakness in handling certain datasets.\n\nHowever, when dealing with less imbalanced datasets such as the MRPC and QQP datasets (image2), the improvements brought by FL, DL, and DSC enhancements are negligible, and the baseline BERT models often achieve similar or better results.\n\n![BERT-MRC Different Enhancements on Datasets](image11)\n\nThe highest F1 score on OntoNotes4.0 is 84.67 when $\\alpha$ is set to 0.6 (image7).\n\nWith the DSC enhancement, the BERT-MRC model outperforms BERT-MRC(Li et al., 2019) by +0.29, +0.96, +0.97, and +2.36 for the CoNLL2003, OntoNotes5.0, MSRA, and OntoNotes4.0 datasets, respectively (image11). These results verify a new SOTA performance for NER on all four datasets.\n\nIt's worth noting that the effectiveness of these enhancements varies based on the dataset and task configurations, meaning that certain enhancements may be more suitable for specific tasks and imbalanced datasets. This was explained in quote [2] and verified in images 1, 2, and 11 and quotes [7] and [11] regarding F1-score performance enhancements with Tversky index and DSC."}

Similarly, the p-value for co-reference is 0.016, also suggesting a statistically significant difference in goal prediction error between instances where co-reference is present versus absent.\n\nRegarding the comparison to human performance in executing instructions, [2] presents a histogram (image2) comparing human performance to our approach in executing L ANI instructions. From this histogram, we can observe that the human ratings and the ratings for our approach are both highest at the 5-star level, with the \"Our Approach\" ratings slightly higher than the human ratings. However, the human ratings have a noticeably higher percentage at the 4-star level compared to the \"Our Approach\" ratings. This suggests that while the \"Our Approach\" performs well overall, it may still have slightly higher goal prediction errors compared to human performance in certain cases.\n\nTo summarize, the presence of certain linguistic categories, such as temporal coordination and co-reference, can significantly affect goal prediction error. Compared to human performance, our approach has similar or slightly lower performance in executing instructions, particularly for the L ANI dataset, as shown in image2. This indicates that while our approach improves upon baseline models, there is still room for further improvement in reducing goal prediction error.\n\nLink to the interleaved text and image response:\n\n- The presence of [temporal coordination](image8) and [co-reference](image8) significantly affects goal prediction error.\n- Human and our approach both perform well in L ANI instruction execution, but [human performance shows a higher percentage at the 4-star level](image2).\n- Our approach still has room for improvement in reducing [goal prediction error](image2), particularly in reducing the gap with human performance in instruction execution.\n\n![Temporal coordination and co-reference categories have a statistically significant impact on goal prediction error (image8)][1]\n![Our approach and human performance for L ANI instruction execution (image2)][2]\n\n[1]: image8 \"Temporal coordination and co-reference categories have a statistically significant impact on goal prediction error\"\n[2]: image2 \"Our approach and human performance for L ANI instruction execution\""}

For instance, when the source and target languages are more similar, the gain from pre-training of embeddings may be larger, as semantically similar words will be closer together in the embedding space.

This is evident in image2, where pre-training results in higher BLEU scores for Portuguese (Pt), Turkish (Tr), and Russian (Ru) to English (En) translations, particularly when the training data is limited.\n\nLanguage similarity also plays a role in the effectiveness of pre-trained embeddings. When the two languages in the translation pair are more linguistically similar, the semantic neighborhoods will be more similar between the two languages, leading to a larger gain from pre-training [3]. This hypothesis was supported by observing the behavior of pre-training when Portuguese, a Western Romance and West-Iberian language, was selected as the target language [3].\n\nTable 5 from the text quotes and image1 provide evidence of the effect of pre-training on multilingual translation into English for various language pairs. The table shows that for all three languages, the gain in BLEU score demonstrates a similar trend: the gain is highest when the baseline system is poor but not too poor, usually with a baseline BLEU score in the range of 3-4 [4]. \n\nIn summary, pre-training can significantly improve the translation accuracy across different language pairs, particularly when the training set size is small and the languages are more similar. The effect of pre-training on multilingual translation systems that share an encoder or decoder between multiple languages is another promising way to use additional data to improve NMT [10][11]. Here's the direct and concise answer to the question:\n\nPre-training can improve translation accuracy across different language pairs, especially at smaller training set sizes. Language similarity also plays a role, with larger gains observed in more linguistically similar language pairs."}

However, if we then remove R-GCN, we lose 8.0 points, indicating a considerable performance drop [4]. This highlights the impact of the R-GCN component.\n\nRegarding relation types, when no relation types are distinguished in the entity graph, the model's effectiveness is only marginally improved. This suggests that a GCN operating over a naive entity graph would not add much to the task without a more informative graph construction and sophisticated parameterization [1].\n\nSpecific relation types like MATCH and COREF also play a role. The model makes better use of DOC-BASED connections than MATCH or COREF connections. This is because the majority of the connections are indeed between mentions in the same document, and removing mentions within the same document removes important information [7]. Coreference links and complement edges seem to play a more marginal role, but modeling all these different relations together gives the Entity-GCN a clear advantage [7].\n\nIn summary, the removal of components like R-GCN, specific relation types, and relation types can significantly impact model performance under unmasked and masked conditions, with the R-GCN component showing the most substantial impact.

This performance is attained using a significantly lower number of parameters, signifying a more efficient and simpler approach for these specific tasks [8].\n\nIn conclusion, SWEM models exhibit a strong performance in document classification tasks, subspace dimensions, and various NLP tasks involving sentence matching and text sequence matching. While the CNN model provides competitive accuracy in some cases, SWEM generally shows better parameter efficiency and strong performance across a variety of tasks and datasets.\n\nHere are the citations for the images:\n\n- Image 2: [1] SWEM model performance comparison on five datasets, showing the best performance of SWEM-concat on three of them.\n- Image 3: [3] Performance table of SWEM-aver and SWEM-max variations on various NLP tasks.\n- Image 8 (left): [8] Comparison of SWEM and CNN models over different subspace dimensions, showing better performance of SWEM for higher dimensions.\n- Image 8 (right): [8] Another comparison of both models across different subspace dimensions, demonstrating their varying accuracy and similar patterns.\n\n![SWEM obtains the best performance on three datasets, while CNN and LSTM are top performers on two other datasets](image2)\n![Performance of SWEM-aver and SWEM-max on various NLP tasks](image3)\n![Comparison of SWEM with CNN and LSTM models over different subspace dimensions, with SWEM showing better performance in high dimensions](image8)\n![Comparison of SWEM with CNN and LSTM models over different subspace dimensions, with SWEM showing better performance in medium dimensions](image8)"}

On the other hand, when using only the embeddings component, the model performs well on D3 and D4, but not as well on D1 and D2. The output layer only setting performs poorly on all datasets. When all components except the LSTM are used, the model performs well on D4, but not as well on the other datasets. Lastly, when all components except the embeddings are used, the model performs well on D1, D3, and D4, but not as well on D2.\n\nWhen varying the percentage of document-level training examples, we observe that the accuracy and Macro-F1 scores tend to improve as the percentage increases for all four models (D1, D2, D3, D4). Model D4 consistently achieves the highest accuracy and Macro-F1 scores across all percentages. This trend is illustrated in the two line graphs, with each model represented using a different color and marker.\n\nIn conclusion, the inclusion of different components in the model significantly affects its performance across different datasets.

It achieves the highest joint goal accuracy of 48.62% and slot accuracy of 96.92% on the full dataset, surpassing current state-of-the-art models like GCE, MDBT, GLAD, and SpanPtr [11]. This performance gap is particularly evident in the restaurant domain, where TRADE's joint and slot accuracies outperform other models [11].\n\nWhen examining the model's performance on the restaurant domain specifically, TRADE maintains its superiority with a joint accuracy of 65.35%, higher than its performance on the full dataset [4][11]. This indicates that the TRADE model can effectively capture and apply domain-specific patterns within multi-domain datasets.\n\nThe TRADE model's ability to transfer knowledge across domains is further supported by the evaluation of zero-shot dialogue state tracking (DST) error analysis in the hotel and restaurant domains [2]. As illustrated in image2, the model successfully tracks slots related to parking, stars, name, people, area, price range, type, day, stay, and internet in the hotel domain, and book time, book people, book day, price range, food, name, and area in the restaurant domain. This success indicates that TRADE can effectively leverage learned knowledge from one domain to perform well in zero-shot settings in another domain.\n\nMoreover, image7 highlights the TRADE model's superiority in terms of joint and slot accuracy in various domains, when compared to zero-shot performance. The TRADE model significantly outperforms the zero-shot performance in all categories, which further strengthens its effectiveness in handling multi-domain dialogue state tracking tasks.\n\nIn summary, the TRADE model exhibits strong performance in multi-domain dialogue state tracking tasks, as demonstrated by its high joint and slot accuracies across various domains in the MultiWOZ dataset.

When comparing it to other models specifically on the restaurant subset of the MultiWOZ dataset, TRADE also outperforms other models such as MDBT, GLAD, GCE, and SpanPtr in terms of both joint and slot accuracy [7, 10].\n\nWhen considering domain adaptation scenarios, fine-tuning TRADE with GEM maintains higher performance on the original four domains [9]. For example, in the hotel domain, the performance on joint accuracy only drops from 58.98% to 53.54% (-5.44%) after fine-tuning with GEM, while naive fine-tuning deteriorates the tracking ability, dropping joint goal accuracy to 36.08% (-22.9%) [9].\n\nIn addition, transfer learning with TRADE is advantageous for expanding the model to a new domain, achieving better performance compared to training from scratch on the new domain. For example, TRADE achieves 59.83% joint accuracy after fine-tuning using only 1% of Train domain data, outperforming training Train domain from scratch, which only achieves 44.24% using the same amount of new-domain data [3].\n\nLastly, the TRADE model is designed to learn tracking across domains and slots without any predefined domain ontology, making it more adaptable to various dialogue domains [11].\n\n![Highest Joint and Slot Accuracy on MultiWOZ Dataset](image10)\n![Maintaining Performance on Original Domains after Fine-tuning with GEM](image9)\n![Better Performance than Training from Scratch on New Domain](image3)"}

On the other hand, EWC uses the diagonal of the Fisher information matrix as a regularizer for adapting to the target domain data, approximated using samples from the source domain.\n\nWhen comparing GEM and EWC to a naive fine-tuning approach, GEM outperforms both in terms of overcoming catastrophic forgetting and retaining performance across existing and new domains. A transferable dialogue state generator like TRADE shares all of its parameters across multiple domains, achieving state-of-the-art joint goal accuracy and slot accuracy on the MultiWOZ dataset for five different domains.\n\nSlots with high cosine similarity in their embeddings might affect performance, as similar slot embeddings could indicate shared or correlated values. This similarity might result in confusion when predicting slot values during the fine-tuning process, requiring careful consideration of the domain-slot combinations.\n\nIn summary, GEM is a more effective fine-tuning strategy compared to EWC and naive fine-tuning in adapting the model to new domain data for multi-domain dialogue state tracking. Slot similarities may affect performance, making it essential to consider these similarities during fine-tuning.\n\n`![GEM outperforms EWC and naive fine-tuning in adapting the model to new domain data](image3)` `![Slots with high cosine similarity in their embeddings might affect performance](image8)`"}

The results showed that this method improved performance in some languages, significantly reducing bias in Spanish, Russian, and Ukrainian.\n\nFrom the image quotes, we have image4 which directly compares stereotypical and non-stereotypical translations by Google Translate across different languages.

The same effect is mirrored in [1], which demonstrates how filtering the initial list of 50 paragraphs based on entity type matching can maintain the model's accuracy on single-hop and multi-hop question answering. \n\nMoreover, evidence selection plays a critical role, as revealed in [6]. Many compositionality-based (multi-hop) questions could be solved with a single-hop model due to insufficient evidence provision or redundancies, making it challenging to construct large multi-hop RC datasets.

Initially, BERT achieved a peak performance of 77% on the ARCT, just three points below the average untrained human baseline [1][10]. However, this result was due to exploiting spurious statistical cues in the dataset [1]. When evaluated on the adversarial set, BERT's performance dropped to 53% [6][8].\n\nThe adversarial dataset, obtained by negating claims and inverting labels for each data point, eliminates the problem of statistical cues over labels in the ARCT [8][9]. This transformation mirrors the distribution of cues around both labels, providing a more robust evaluation of argument comprehension [9]. The authors suggest that this adversarial dataset should be adopted as the standard in future work on this dataset [3][8][9].\n\nTable 1 (image1) shows the performance of various models on the original and adversarial ARCT dataset.

The table presents the performance of different models on a development and test set, with metrics such as mean, median, and maximum scores.

COMET frequently produces novel commonsense knowledge that human evaluators deem to be correct.

We can observe that as the edit distance increases, the percentage of novel tuples generally decreases, and the classifier's accuracy remains high, close to 100%. This suggests that the model generates novel tuples with high accuracy.\n\nLastly, let's examine image quote 5:\n\nThis table compares various models, including several COMET variants, on different evaluation metrics. It shows that the COMET model with no specific variant label has the highest performance across most metrics, including the lowest perplexity, highest score, and the closest approximation to human performance.\n\nGiven this evidence, we can conclude that **the COMET model is effective in generating novel and accurate information on the ConceptNet dataset**.

As seen in image6, the Pass-Through variant of these models has significantly higher sensitivity (39.6) and WER (30.3) compared to the word-only models.\n\nThe difference in sensitivity and WER between closed and open vocabulary models is mainly due to how the models handle unknown or out-of-vocabulary (OOV) inputs. In closed vocabulary models, OOV inputs typically result in a higher word error rate, while open vocabulary models, being able to process individual characters, can handle OOV inputs more effectively, albeit with increased sensitivity.\n\nTo counteract this, various backoff strategies can be employed.

According to image1, foreign exchange risk is classified as high, while credit, interest rate, and liquidity risks are considered low. This high foreign exchange risk was particularly relevant in 2020, as Novo Nordisk faced changes in exchange rates for different currencies.\n\nimage3 shows the exchange rate information in Danish Kroner (DKK) per 100 units of foreign currency for the years 2018, 2019, and 2020. The table demonstrates fluctuations in exchange rates for currencies like USD, CNY, JPY, CAD, and GBP. \n\nFor instance, the average exchange rate for the USD against the DKK increased by approximately 1.6% in 2020 compared to 2019, and the year-end change showed a growth of about 1% from 2019 to 2020 [image3]. These variations in exchange rates might have impacted the financial results of Novo Nordisk in 2020.\n\nimage2 highlights the derivative financial instruments in DKK million for the years 2020 and 2019, which illustrates how Novo Nordisk utilizes financial instruments to manage foreign exchange risks. The company uses forward contracts as cash flow hedges and fair value hedges, with a total of DKK 12,120 million in 2020 and DKK 7,284 million in 2019.\n\nIn addition to these financial instruments, an increase or decrease in exchange rates would directly impact comprehensive income, specifically the cash flow hedges. image6 depicts the impact on other comprehensive income and the income statement if there were an immediate 5% increase or decrease of exchange rates. In 2020, a 5% increase in exchange rates had a negative impact of DKK -1,893 on other comprehensive income and a positive impact of DKK 299 on the income statement. In contrast, a 5% decrease in exchange rates would positively affect other comprehensive income by DKK 1,893 and negatively impact the income statement by DKK -299.\n\nIn conclusion, the changes in exchange rates and financial risks significantly affected Novo Nordisk's comprehensive income and cash flow hedges in 2020. The fluctuation in exchange rates for currencies such as USD, CNY, JPY, CAD, and GBP impacted the financial results. Furthermore, financial instruments like cash flow hedges and fair value hedges were essential for managing the foreign exchange risks.

This growth is primarily attributed to higher paydown rates driven by the continued liquidity and financial strength of the customer base. Provisions for credit losses decreased by $2.5 billion, resulting in a net benefit. The reserve release in the current year was driven by improved portfolio quality and macroeconomic outlook.\n\nCard Member Receivables also saw growth, increasing by 24% to a total of $53.6 billion. This growth was due to an increase in both U.S. and non-U.S. receivables, after accounting for a net write-off related to a corporate client bankruptcy in the GCS segment. Credit Loss Reserves for Card Member Receivables increased in 2020, driven by the deterioration of the global macroeconomic outlook as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, they decreased in 2021 as portfolio quality improved and the macroeconomic outlook became more favorable.\n\nNow let's compare these changes with the trends in network volumes and card member spending. Network volumes increased by 24% in 2021, showing a strong rebound after a 18% decrease in 2020. Total billed business also increased significantly in 2021, rising by 25%. These growth rates are similar to the increases seen in card member loans and receivables.\n\nCard member spending saw a substantial increase in 2021, with billed business growing by $1.09 trillion (≥5%), led by strength in Goods and Services spending globally. This increase in spending is consistent with the observed growth in card member loans and receivables.\n\nIn conclusion, during the period from 2020 to 2021, there was a significant increase in card member loans and receivables, which was largely driven by a stronger macroeconomic outlook and higher card member spending. This growth aligns with the trend in network volumes and card member spending, as all categories saw substantial increases in 2021 compared to 2020.\n\nKey changes in card member loans and receivables from 2020 to 2021:\n- Card Member Loans: Increased by 21% to $88.6 billion\n- Card Member Receivables: Increased by 24% to $53.6 billion\n- Provisions for Credit Losses: Decreased by $2.5 billion, resulting in a net benefit\n\nComparing these changes with network volumes and card member spending from 2020 to 2021:\n- Network volumes: Increased by 24%\n- Total billed business: Increased by 25%\n- Card member spending: Increased by $1.09 trillion (≥5%)"}

Here is an interleaved answer with text and image quotes, comparing these elements for the years 2020 and 2019.\n\nIn 2020, the company held derivative financial instruments amounting to 1,365 DKK million in the financial liabilities category [image3]. These instruments mainly consisted of cash flow hedges and fair value hedges. In comparison, the value in 2019 was lower, at 734 DKK million [image3]. Derivative financial instruments are employed to hedge against risks such as foreign exchange rate fluctuations, which can impact the financial statements.\n\n According to image6, changes in derivative financial instruments might be recorded in either the income statement or other comprehensive income. The table in image6 presents the year-end contract amounts, fair values, and changes for various forward contracts denominated in different currencies, such as USD, CNH, JPY, GBP, CAD, and EUR.\n\nNow, let's compare cash flow changes in 2020 and 2019:\n\nimage4 provides the \"Cash Flow Change in Working Capital\" components for 2020 and 2019, which are as follows:\n- 2020: (4,353) DKK million\n- 2019: (3,388) DKK million\n\nThese figures represent total changes in working capital, considering fluctuations in inventories, trade receivables, other receivables and prepayments, trade payables, other liabilities, and cash flow adjustments. In general, a negative change signifies a net outflow of cash in the given year.\n\nimage1 displays the \"Reversals of non-cash income statement items\" in detail:\n- Net gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of financial assets:\n  - 2020: 195 DKK million\n  - 2019: 145 DKK million\n\nThese changes in financial assets' fair value are reported as financial income or expenses in the income statement, affecting the reported profits for each year [quotes 8, 10].\n\nTo directly answer the user's question, derivative financial instruments and cash flow changes significantly affect the company's financial statements. These elements represent essential aspects of the company's risk management strategies and impact earnings. In 2020, compared to 2019, the company experienced higher financial liabilities related to derivative financial instruments and faced greater discrepancies in cash flow changes and reversals of non-cash income statement items. These factors have direct implications for the company's profitability and overall financial health.\n\n![Financial liabilities in DKK million for the years 2020 and 2019, divided into different categories, highlighting derivative financial instruments](image3)\n\n![Derivative financial instruments for 2020 and 2019, reported in DKK million, including various forward contracts and hedges](image6)\n\n![Change in working capital (DKK million) for 2020 and 2019, highlighting the net change due to various components](image4)\n\n![Reversals of non-cash income statement items (DKK million) for 2020 and 2019, focusing on net gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of financial assets](image1)"}

[Other Comprehensive Income for FY2018, 2019, and 2020](image5) provides a detailed breakdown of these components. Between 2018 and 2020, foreign currency translation had a positive impact on other comprehensive income, while defined benefit plans and cash flow hedges exhibited some volatility. Over these years, investments had minimal impact.\n\nThese trends in comprehensive and other comprehensive income directly affected changes in Accenture's equity. By analyzing the changes in shareholders' equity in [Shareholders' Equity for FY2020](image2) and [Summary of Shareholders' Equity for FY2018 and 2019](image3), we observe that net income, other comprehensive income, and these components' attribution to Accenture PLC or noncontrolling interests all contribute to total shareholders' equity.\n\nIn conclusion, Accenture's comprehensive income increased over the fiscal years 2018 to 2020, driven mainly by a steady growth in net income. The fluctuations in other comprehensive income components, in particular the foreign currency translation adjustments and defined benefit plans, also contributed to the overall trend in comprehensive income. These trends have a direct correspondence with changes in shareholders' equity during this period."}

This suggests a stronger financial position for the company as both assets and liabilities have grown.\n\nNow, let's examine the relationship between these changes and the net earnings and comprehensive income over the same period.\n\nFrom the financial data provided in [2], we can see that the net earnings were $90,807 in 2021 and $43,253 in 2020. This increase in net earnings, directly linked to the operating activities of the company, contributed to the growth in both total liabilities and shareholders' equity.\n\nIn addition, the other comprehensive income shows various components. Changes in these components might not necessarily have a direct relationship with the changes in net earnings, but they contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the company's financial performance.\n\nFor instance, defined benefit pension plans and other net saw increases in 2021, while unrealized appreciation of fixed maturity securities, foreign currency translation, and defined benefit pension plans (applicable income taxes) experienced decreases. Nevertheless, the overall other comprehensive income for 2021 was $234, significantly contributing to the $443,854 total liabilities as those are reported under shareholders' equity (image2).\n\nAs a result, the combined effect of net earnings and other comprehensive income contributed to the increase in total liabilities and shareholders' equity from 2020 to 2021."}

In the context of climate scenarios, Toyota has identified various risks and opportunities related to environmental issues. Among these, climate change requires significant measures, including the adoption of new technologies and response to tighter government regulations [10].\n\nIn terms of stakeholder returns, Toyota focuses on both dividends and share repurchases. The table in image1 shows a relatively stable dividend per share over the five-year period, with an increase in the latest fiscal year [1]. The same table indicates that the total amount of dividend payments, share repurchases, and total return ratios have also increased [1]. This suggests that Toyota has been prioritizing shareholder returns while managing climate-related risks and opportunities.\n\nMoreover, Toyota is investing in electrification measures, which are particularly relevant in addressing climate change scenarios. According to the infographic in image5, Toyota sees opportunities in increased sales of electrified vehicles in response to tightening fuel efficiency and ZEV regulations [5]. In turn, these measures contribute to reducing CO2 emissions throughout the entire vehicle life cycle, addressing Toyota's Environmental Challenge 2050 [4].\n\nIn summary, Toyota's financial strategy is correlated with its response to climate scenarios, with the company prioritizing both shareholder returns and electrification measures as significant aspects of its financial foundation.

These changes are detailed in quote [7]. \n\n[Here's the revenue contribution breakdown by segment from 2020 to 2021](image6)(image6):\n- Cable Communications Segment: $7,753 million to $7,811 million (an increase of $4,277 million)\n- NBCUniversal Segments: $2,307 million to $2,466 million (an increase of $7,108 million)\n- Sky Segment: $3,034 million to $3,379 million (an increase of $1,691 million)\n- Corporate, Other and Eliminations: $5,817 million to $5,572 million (a decrease of $255 million)\n- Total Comcast Consolidated: $103,564 million to $116,385 million (an increase of $12,821 million)\n\nThis reflects the significant growth in consolidated revenue for Comcast from 2020 to 2021, with notable contributions from the NBCUniversal and Sky segments.\n\nIn summary, substantial increases in the Cable Communications, NBCUniversal, and Sky segments primarily drove the change in Comcast's consolidated revenue from 2020 to 2021. The Corporate and Other activities segment showed a decrease during this period. The operating expenses increased mainly due to the segments' increases and a decrease in Corporate and Other activities expenses."}

However, in 2022, the total expenses decreased to $528 million [5][10]. This decline in expenses might indicate a more contained use of stock-based compensation in 2022. It's worth noting that stock option expenses decreased from $249 million in 2020 to $271 million in 2022, while RSUs and PSUs expenses declined from $309 million in 2020 to $257 million in 2022 [5]. These trends suggest a more managed approach to employee compensation and retention costs.\n\nNow let's examine the net earnings per share (EPS). From 2020 to 2022, P&G's diluted EPS showed a steady increase, going from $4.96 to $5.81, representing a growth of $0.85 or approximately 17.1% [9][7]. This rise in EPS may result from various factors, such as improved operational efficiency, lower taxes, and interest expense, as well as stronger net earnings [9][7][1]. A lower number of diluted shares due to share buybacks might have also contributed to the growth in EPS, as indicated in the financial tables [7][8].\n\nIn summary, Procter & Gamble's financial trends from 2020 to 2022 show a decline in stock-based compensation expenses and a steady increase in net earnings per share. These trends suggest a more contained compensation expense strategy, accompanied by improved financial performance and a reduction in shares outstanding that drove the EPS growth.\n\n![Stock-based compensation expenses decreased from 2020 to 2022 while net earnings per share increased by approximately 17% in the same period](image5) ![Procter & Gamble stock prices from June 2020 to July 2022, showing a generally upward trend](image1)"}

On the other hand, the Securities Services, Global Liquidity and Cash Management, Global Trade and Receivables Finance, and Principal Investments segments experienced decreases in revenue, resulting in lower net operating income.\n\nNow, let's consider the Profit Before Tax. The figures show that the bank as a whole had a profit before tax of $4,830 million in 2020. This amount includes contributions from various segments, such as Global Markets, Global Banking, Markets Treasury, HSBC Holdings Interest Expense and Argentina Hyperinflation, and others. Among these, Global Markets contributed $7,290 million in revenue, while Markets Treasury, HSBC Holdings Interest Expense and Argentina Hyperinflation had revenue of $340 million, more than double the 2019 figure.\n\nIn summary, the Global Markets segment showed improvement in net operating income and profit before tax in 2020, while other segments experienced decreases in net operating income. The bank's profit before tax was primarily influenced by the positive performance of the Global Markets and Markets Treasury segments, offsetting negative contributions from other segments.\n\n![Net Operating Income in 2020 increased by $434 million (3%)](image1)\n![Profit Before Tax in 2020 was $4,830 million, an increase of $342 million (7%) compared to 2019](image8)\n\nThe bank's profit before tax increased by 7% compared to 2019, primarily due to the improvements seen in the Global Markets and Markets Treasury segments."}

This revenue increase was primarily due to growth in intermodal of 7.7%, as well as higher average revenue per car/unit. The volume increase was primarily due to growth in international and domestic shipments driven by increased retail sales, inventory replenishments by retailers and increased e-commerce activity.\n\nFor industrial products, operating revenues in 2021 increased by 5.0% compared to 2020.

This decrease was somewhat offset by higher revenue in the Global Markets sector, which saw a growth of 27% in 2020 compared to 2019.\n\nLooking at the overall financial performance of the bank, the financial results in 2020 included a $1.3 billion impairment of software intangibles, while 2019 results included a $7.3 billion impairment of goodwill. These factors contributed to the decrease in reported profit before tax.\n\nAs for adjusted profit before tax, it decreased by 45% from 2019 to 2020, while adjusted revenue declined by 8%. This was driven by lower revenue across various sectors, including a decrease in revenue for Global Liquidity and Cash Management, Securities Services, and Global Trade and Receivables Finance.

However, without more specific context, it is difficult to directly link this to the question.\n\n- Image 2, while not directly pertaining to the GBM division, reveals a 3% growth in net operating income from 2019 to 2020. It also shows a significant increase in charges relating to the impact of the Covid-19 outbreak on the forward economic outlook.\n\n- Image 3 highlights the significant growth in revenue for the Global Markets sector (27%) between 2019 and 2020, as well as the decrease in revenue for several other sectors. Although it does not specifically reference the GBM division, it complements the information given in the text quotes regarding the growth in Global Markets.\n\n- Image 5 has a value of 15.3 for 2020, but the relevance to the question is unclear without additional context.\n\n- Image 6, which represents a $4.8 billion contribution to group adjusted profit before tax in 2020, accounting for 40%, does not provide specific information on the GBM division and is, therefore, less relevant to the question.\n\nIn conclusion, the Global Banking and Markets (GBM) division's net operating income decreased by $1,852 million (12%) from 2019 to 2020, and profit before tax declined by $342 million (7%). The primary contributing factor to this change was a decrease in net interest income due to lower global interest rates, which was only partially offset by higher revenue in the Global Markets sector (27% growth)."}

Since there is no direct information about the \"Salesforce Platform and Other\" category, I cannot provide specifics about its impact on overall financial performance.

It is important to note that the cost of revenues, as a percentage of total revenues, decreased from 26% in 2019 to 25% in 2020. This decrease suggests that the company's revenue growth outpaced the increase in cost of revenues, ultimately resulting in improved financial performance.\n\nTo sum up, while I couldn't provide the specific revenue and cost of revenues for the \"Salesforce Platform and Other\" category, I did provide context on overall revenue growth and cost of revenues changes. The information I've presented should enable you to better understand the company's financial performance and ask further specific questions, if needed.\n\nIn conclusion, the overall revenue of the company increased by 29% from 2019 to 2020, while the cost of revenues, as a percentage of total revenues, decreased from 26% to 25%, indicating an overall improvement in financial performance."}

With factories spread across different regions, the company is exposed to various geopolitical risks which could impact its supply chain. By having continuity plans and geographic and product strategy support in place, Nestlé can quickly respond and adapt to potential disruptions in any of its factory locations.\n\nFor example, the COVID-19 pandemic has led to unprecedented challenges in global supply chains, and Nestlé has reported COVID-19-related incremental costs of CHF 420 million, including expenses for employee safety protocols, donations, and other staff and customer allowances. Additionally, the company absorbed costs of CHF 170 million related to staff and facilities made idle due to lockdown measures.\n\nIn order to better service customers, reduce operational carbon footprint, and respond quickly to changes in demand, Nestlé is stepping up its capacity to capture and share data across value chains, working with supply chain partners to pilot solutions that will better balance efficiency and resiliency.\n\nIn 2020, Nestlé increased the scope of its Transport Hub technologies to cover 50% of its global logistics network and extended the scope of its AI-powered network optimization tools to evaluate different product sourcing and delivery scenarios.\n\nIn conclusion, while supply chain disruptions pose potential impacts on Nestlé's operations, the company has implemented key strategies, such as safety and security policies, business continuity plans, and data-driven solutions, to mitigate these risks and ensure a resilient and efficient supply chain.\n\n![Supply chain disruption risks, potential impacts, and mitigation strategies (image from image6) ](image6)"}

However, the average price per share was higher in 2020 ($300.58) than in 2019 ($245.97). This meant that despite buying back fewer shares, the total cost of repurchases was higher in 2020 ($4,250 million) than in 2019 ($5,500 million).\n\nThe increase in gross unrecognized tax benefits could indicate potential future liabilities, while the decrease in common share repurchases coupled with higher average prices in 2020 could suggest a more cautious approach to share buybacks. However, the higher total cost of repurchases in 2020 would still have had a significant impact on the company's financial position.\n\n![Gross unrecognized tax benefits increased by $406 million from 2019 to 2020](image5)\n![Common share repurchases decreased in number but increased in total cost from 2019 to 2020](image1)\n\nThe company's financial position was also affected by other factors, such as changes in debt obligations, operating leases, and other liabilities.

The net operating income for WPB in 2020 was $2.959 billion, down by $2.708 billion or 48% compared to 2019.

Firstly, consolidated operating income is a significant factor in determining remuneration. This metric indicates how well the company is performing financially, and it constitutes 50% of the evaluation weight for remuneration [7,10]. The target for this evaluation is 1 trillion yen, and the current fiscal year's evaluation result stands at 150% [7]. This means that when Toyota performs better than the targeted operating income, executives are likely to receive higher remuneration.\n\nSecondly, the volatility of Toyota's share price is another essential factor in determining remuneration, representing the corporate value indicator for shareholders and investors to evaluate Toyota’s efforts [2,7]. This factor constitutes another 50% of the evaluation weight for remuneration [7]. In this case, Toyota's share price is compared with the Nikkei stock average at the end of the previous fiscal year [7]. When Toyota's share price performs well compared to the Nikkei average, it suggests a positive outlook for shareholders, and executives may receive higher remuneration.\n\nLastly, individual performance evaluation plays a role in determining executive remuneration by providing a qualitative evaluation of each director's performance [5,11]. Although not directly related to the financial performance metrics mentioned earlier, it indicates how executives contribute to Toyota's overall strategy, which may influence remuneration amounts [2].\n\nTo summarize, Toyota's executive remuneration reflects business performance primarily through the consolidated operating income and volatility of Toyota's share price indicators, ensuring a balanced evaluation system that account for both shareholders' and company's overall wellbeing.\n\n![Toyota's executive remuneration evaluation considering business performance and shareholder value](image2), ![Financial metrics and stock volatility assessment](image7)"}

However, TLAC requirements are related to RWA and leverage exposure levels.\n\nAccording to the table in image7, the External TLAC as a percentage of RWA stood at 49.9% at the end of 2019 but decreased to 47.7% in 2020, even though both RWA and External TLAC amounts increased during this period. The reason for this decrease can be attributed to the regulatory minimum and required ratios for External TLAC as a percentage of RWA, which remain constant over time.\n\nHowever, the changes in risk-weighted assets components (from image3) and leverage-based capital (from image1 and image8) do not provide explicit information on how they affect External TLAC. The relationship between these figures is indirect, and the actual impact would require a more comprehensive analysis of the financial institution's specific situation, portfolio composition, and applicable regulatory requirements.\n\nSo, the External TLAC as a percentage of RWA was affected by the changes in various RWA components through its influence on the total RWA. However, the image and text quotes provided do not offer enough information to directly quantify this impact.\n\nIn summary, the External TLAC as a percentage of RWA decreased from 2019 to 2020, partly due to the adjustments in various RWA components, which indirectly affected the amounts and ratios by changing the total RWA.

Pre-tax net investment income decreased from $5,949 million in 2020 to $5,649 million in 2021, a decrease of $5.0\\%$.\n\nOn the other hand, railroad operating earnings increased by $15.7\\%$ from 2020 to 2021, rising from $6.8 billion in 2020 to $7.9 billion in 2021. The primary factors contributing to this increase were higher freight volumes, higher average revenue per car/unit, improved productivity, and higher fuel surcharge revenue attributable to higher fuel prices.\n\nIn summary, while net investment income decreased, railroad operating earnings increased from 2020 to 2021. The decrease in net investment income can be traced back to a substantial decline in interest and other investment income, while the growth in railroad operating earnings can be associated with an improvement in freight volumes, average revenue per car/unit, productivity, and the impact of higher fuel prices on surcharge revenue.\n\n![Net Investment Income decrease and Railroad Operating Earnings increase from 2020 to 2021](image6 \"Net Investment Income decrease and Railroad Operating Earnings increase from 2020 to 2021\")"}

This remarkable change can be attributed to two main factors:\n\n1. **Increase in Savings and Demand Deposits:** Brokerage sweep deposits and savings and other deposits significantly increased, contributing to this growth. Specifically, brokerage sweep deposits rose from $121,077 million in 2019 to $232,071 million in 2020, while savings and other deposits grew from $28,388 million to $47,150 million during the same period.

It saw a decrease in earnings from $618 million in 2020 to $525 million in 2021.

This increase in income directly impacted the company’s U.S. income tax, resulting in an increase to tax expense of $3.18 billion between year-over-year periods.\n\nIn conclusion, the U.S. downstream segment saw an increase in earnings of $2.97 billion from 2020 to 2021, largely due to higher margins on refined product sales, higher earnings from CPChem, and higher sales volumes."}

Additionally, Quote [3] states that the risk-based capital ratios at MSBNA and MSPBNA are based on the Standardized Approach rules and are calculated excluding the effect of the adoption of CECL based on their elections to defer this effect over a five-year transition period.\n\nQuote [4] adds that, for the entire institution, the risk-based and leverage-based capital amounts and ratios, as well as RWA, adjusted average assets, and supplementary leverage exposure, are calculated excluding the effect of the adoption of CECL based on their election to defer this effect over a five-year transition period.\n\nQuote [7] indicates that at the end of 2020, under both the Standardized and Advanced Approaches, the differences between the actual and required ratios were lower under the Standardized Approach.\n\nQuote [11] mentions that minimum leverage-based capital requirements include a Tier 1 leverage ratio and an SLR, and the Firm is required to maintain an SLR of 5%, inclusive of an enhanced SLR capital buffer of at least 2%.\n\nQuote [12] states that credit risk RWA increased in 2020 under both the Standardized and Advanced Approaches, primarily from an increase in Derivatives exposures driven by market volatility and an increase in Investment securities due to the E* TRADE acquisition.\n\nIn summary, the leverage-based capital ratios showed an increase in tier 1 leverage ratio and SLR in 2020 compared to 2019. The risk-based capital ratios also increased due to the rise in Retained earnings, the impact of the E* TRADE acquisition, and lower differences between the actual and required ratios under the Standardized Approach. The increase in Derivatives exposures driven by market volatility and an increase in Investment securities also contributed to the growth in credit risk RWA under both approaches.\n\nHere are the changes in a more concise form:\n- **Tier 1 leverage ratio** (from Image 1 and Image 8): increased from 8.3% to 8.4%\n- **SLR** (from Image 1 and Image 8): increased from 6.4% to 7.4%\n- **Risk-based capital ratios** (from Quotes [2], [3], [4], [7], [11], [12]): increased primarily due to a net increase in Retained earnings, E* TRADE acquisition, lower differences between the actual and required ratios under the Standardized Approach, and increased Derivatives exposures and Investment securities due to market volatility and E* TRADE acquisition.\n\nAnd here is how you should cite the images:\n- Image 1: ![Leaving balance sheet data for 2019, including adjusted average assets, Tier 1 leverage ratio, supplementary leverage exposure, and SLR.](image1)\n- Image 8: ![Leaving balance sheet data for 2020, including adjusted average assets, Tier 1 leverage ratio, supplementary leverage exposure, and SLR.](image8)"}

First, Inditex has been very active in store optimization activities, which included 226 openings and 130 refurbishments in 2021 [1]. Second, the company absorbed 578 stores in 2021, mainly focusing on stores at the end of their useful life [12]. The pandemic also had a significant impact on the store distribution in 2020, with up to 90% of stores closed in the first quarter [11].\n\nIn summary, the geographical distribution of stores changed from 2021 to 2022 due to several factors, including store optimization activities, the absorption of stores, and the impact of the pandemic. However, without exact numbers for Company Managed and Franchises in 2022, we cannot provide a specific conclusion on the shift in distribution between these two categories.\n\nUnderstanding the geographical distribution change:\n\n- From 2021 to 2022, the total number of stores in Spain and the Rest of Europe remained the same, while there was an increase in the Americas and the Rest of the World.\n- The shift in distribution is likely due to a combination of store optimization activities, store absorptions, and the impact of the pandemic.\n\n![Geographical distribution changed from 2021 to 2022](image4)\n\nThis image shows various subsidiary companies under different main entities, which indicate the expansion of the Group to new markets and regions.

This growth is primarily due to the financing activities of IBM's Global Financing division. This growth in noncurrent assets might indicate an expansion in lending or leasing activities by IBM, bolstering their financing segment.\n\nLong-term debt slightly increased by $253 million ($9 million adjusted for currency) from $54,102 million in 2019 to $54,355 million in 2020 [4, 7]. This slight increase in long-term debt might be a result of the company's capital structure optimization or financing arrangements supporting their operations and investments.\n\nNoncurrent liabilities (excluding debt) exhibited an increase of $1,621 million ($251 million adjusted for currency) during the same period [1]. This growth is mainly due to higher unallocated and specific reserves in the Americas region, as per the provision for expected credit losses [12]. Such an increase in noncurrent liabilities (excluding debt) may suggest a more conservative approach to account for possible credit losses.\n\nIn summary, the company has experienced growth in noncurrent assets and noncurrent liabilities (excluding debt), while there has been a slight increase in long-term debt. The growth in noncurrent assets may indicate an expansion in financing activities, while increases in noncurrent liabilities (excluding debt) imply a more conservative approach in accounting for credit losses.

In 2020, ENBREL reported a 4% decrease in sales, generating $4,996 million compared to $5,226 million in 2019. This decrease is attributable to lower unit demand and net selling price, partially offset by favorable changes to estimated sales deductions and inventory [4][5]. The U.S. market specifically saw a 4% decrease, while Canada experienced a more significant 20% decrease in sales [1]. ENBREL has also faced the challenge of continuing to lose market share, which has been exacerbated by reduced growth in the rheumatology market due to the COVID-19 pandemic [4].\n\nOn the other hand, Prolia's sales performance has been more positive. In 2020, Prolia's sales saw a 3% increase compared to 2019, generating $2,763 million compared to $2,672 million. This increase was driven by higher unit demand and net selling price [2]. In 2020, the U.S. reported a 3% increase in Prolia sales, while the rest of the world experienced a 4% increase [2]. However, in 2020, Prolia's demand was impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, which disrupted patient visits and affected osteoporosis diagnoses in new patients. This has altered the timing of patients receiving their semiannual doses and caused a deceleration of demand [11]. Despite this, historical demand patterns for Prolia are expected to continue being impacted by the pandemic in 2021.\n\nIn conclusion, ENBREL sales experienced a 4% decrease, generating $4,996 million in 2020, while Prolia's sales increased by 3% to $2,763 million. These changes in sales performance are due to various factors such as lower unit demand, net selling price (for ENBREL), and favorable changes to estimated sales deductions and inventory, as well as the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n![ENBREL sales 4% decrease, generating $4,996 million in 2020](image1)\n![Prolia sales increased by 3% to $2,763 million in 2020](image2)"}

While I cannot provide a direct comparison for each quarter due to the unavailability of quarterly data, I can tell you that the net interest income was $43.4 billion in 2020, compared to $48.9 billion in 2019, representing a decrease of approximately $5.5 billion. This decrease is primarily attributed to lower interest rates, partially offset by reduced deposit and funding costs, the deployment of excess deposits into securities, and an additional day of interest accrual.\n\nLet's examine the changes in interest income and interest expense from 2019 to 2020 to provide further insight. In 2019 to 2020, there was a net decrease in interest income of $19,747 million and a net decrease of $5,627 million in interest expense. This decrease in interest income, which outpaced the decrease in interest expenses, led to the significant decrease in net interest income.\nKeep in mind that this information is based on annual data, and a more precise comparison of net interest income for each quarter in 2020 against the respective quarters in 2019 would require quarterly data, which is not provided in your inputs.\n\nDespite the decrease in net interest income, other aspects of the banking operations have experienced growth or remained consistent. For example, the return on average allocated capital decreased from 20% in 2019 to 8% in 2020, and the number of active digital banking users increased from 38,266 units in thousands in 2019 to 39,315 units in thousands in 2020.\n\nIn summary, while the net interest income decreased by approximately $5.5 billion from 2019 to 2020, other aspects of banking operations have shown positive trends or remained consistent.

From quote [9], we know that net revenues related to combustible products refer to the operating revenues generated from the sale of these products, including shipping and handling charges billed to customers, net of sales and promotion incentives, and excise taxes. The text quotes do not directly provide the net revenue for combustible products in the European Union for 2020.\n\nHowever, quote [12] states that PMI disaggregates its net revenue from contracts with customers by both geographic location and product category for each of PMI's six operating segments.

Retained earnings represent the portion of a company's earnings that are not distributed as dividends, while other comprehensive income includes net unrealized gains or losses on debt securities, foreign currency translation adjustments, and net unrealized pension and other postretirement benefits.\n\nFirst, let's look at retained earnings. Between 2020 and 2021, the net income increased by approximately $5,000 million, from $3,135 million to $8,060 million. This increase in net income led to a higher retained earnings balance of $11,495 million in 2021 compared to $11,881 million in 2020.\n\nAs for the other comprehensive income, the following components can be analyzed:\n\n1. Net unrealized debt securities gains (losses): There was a loss of $42 million in 2021 compared to a gain of $32 million in 2020. This decrease in net unrealized gains negatively impacted other comprehensive income in 2021.\n2. Foreign currency translation adjustments: The negative adjustment increased in 2021 to $(163) million from $(40) million in 2020. This change worsened the other comprehensive income in 2021.\n3. Net unrealized pension and other postretirement benefits: There was a gain of $155 million in 2021 compared to a loss of $(150) million in 2020. This change in net gain improved other comprehensive income in 2021 compared to 2020.\n\nIn summary, the changes in retained earnings and other comprehensive income between 2020 and 2021 partly balanced each other, but overall, there was an improvement in retained earnings and a slight decrease in other comprehensive income in 2021 compared to 2020.\n\nThis increase in net income, higher retained earnings, and mixed components of other comprehensive income signified that the company's financial position was generally strong in 2021 compared to 2020. However, the other comprehensive income experienced a slight decline due to foreign currency translation adjustments, which had an adverse impact.\n\n![Retained Earnings improved slightly between 2020 and 2021](image5)\n\n![Changes in Other Comprehensive Income with some adverse impacts between 2020 and 2021](image6)"}

This decrease is mainly due to a reduction in various components of the deferred tax assets, such as a decrease in loss and other carryforwards, pension and other retiree benefits, capitalized research and development, accrued marketing and promotion, and stock-based compensation, partially offset by an increase in other deferred tax assets. Valuation allowances also decreased, which further contributed to the decline in deferred tax assets.\n\nOn the other hand, deferred tax liabilities increased from $8,503 in 2021 to $9,288 in 2022 [image7]. The main contributors to this increase are goodwill and intangible assets, other retiree benefits, unrealized gain on financial and foreign exchange transactions, and other.\n\nThe changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities result in a net reduction of $1,413, which impacted the company's financial position. A decrease in deferred tax liabilities generally indicates lower future tax liabilities, leading to improved cash flows when taxes are paid. However, since the net reduction also includes a decrease in deferred tax assets, the overall impact may not be as significant as the $1,413 difference suggests. Additionally, specific circumstances and factors may influence the actual financial impact on the company. Given the complexity of tax rules, professional advice and judgement should be sought for a complete understanding of the consequences.\n\nIn summary, the deferred tax assets decreased by $473, and deferred tax liabilities increased by $785 between 2021 and 2022, resulting in a net reduction of $1,413, which affects the company's future tax liabilities and cash flows."}

Here's a detailed and articulate interleaved answer to the question:\n\nAccording to the [Pew Research Center](https://www.pewresearch.org/), there have been several surveys and studies conducted about the development and adoption of driverless vehicles. Specifically, in terms of the time frame for most vehicles to become driverless, [56%](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/08/03/nearly-two-thirds-of-americans-expect-most-or-all-vehicles-on-the-road-to-be-driverless-within-the-next-50-years/) of U.S. adults anticipate that this will happen in the next 10 to less than 50 years (image7).

It is not explicitly mentioned how many respondents anticipate it to take more than 100 years; however, [8%](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/08/03/nearly-two-thirds-of-americans-expect-most-or-all-vehicles-on-the-road-to-be-driverless-within-the-next-50-years/) of U.S. adults anticipate that this change will never happen.\n\nIn summary, only 5% of U.S. adults anticipate that most vehicles will be driverless in 50 to less than 100 years, as per Pew Research Center survey data in [image7]. Additionally, we found that while the Pew Research Center did ask U.S. adults about the possible time frame for the widespread adoption of driverless cars, the percentage of U.S. adults who say it will take more than 50 years is not explicitly mentioned, although it can be inferred to be 5%. It is crucial to emphasize the importance of distinguishing between the anticipation of \"never happen\" and \"50 to less than 100 years,\" as there is a significant difference between the two."}

During this period, the county experienced rapid population growth, peaking in 1890 at 14,096 residents, as shown in image2. This surge was primarily due to the influx of pioneers following the establishment of the Nebraska Territory in 1854 and the completion of the Transcontinental Railroad Act and the Homestead Act in 1862 [3][5]. \n\nThese acts transformed the Nebraska landscape, attracting a diverse range of settlers from various regions, including Missouri, Iowa, Illinois, Ohio, and the New England States. Later, immigrants arrived from Germany, Sweden, England, and Russia, settling in different parts of the county based on their ethnicity [2]. For instance, Germans primarily settled in the northeastern part, Swedes in the northwestern part, and Russian Mennonites in the southeastern part, forming close-knit communities [2][12].\n\nHowever, after the peak in 1890, the county's population steadily declined, reaching a low of 8,778 in 1950. Despite this decrease, the number of farms in Hamilton County increased from 1880 to 1900, then began to decline, indicating changes in agricultural practices and rural life. By 2002, the number of farms had dropped to 603, while the average size per farm increased to 577 acres [6].\n\nMeanwhile, the county's towns demonstrated various trends, with five of the seven rural communities peaking in population between 1900 and 1940. Despite popular notions suggesting the disappearance of small towns, some communities in Hamilton County, like Aurora, showed recent population gains. However, due to farm consolidation, these towns, excluding Aurora, might struggle to maintain their populations [8][9].\n\nIn summary, the population trends in Hamilton County, Nebraska from 1870 to 2000 were characterized by initial growth due to pioneer migration and favorable historical factors, followed by a gradual decline. The agricultural landscape also evolved during this period, with the number of farms decreasing while the average size per farm increased. Small towns in the county, excluding Aurora, could face challenges in maintaining population levels due to farm consolidation.\n\n![Population trends in Hamilton County, Nebraska from 1870 to 2000, with a peak in 1890 and a steady decline thereafter.](image2)\n![Hamilton County in Nebraska, with key locations and major routes.](image3)\n![The number of farms in the U.S. at ten-year intervals from 1880 to 1950, with gaps in data for 1850, 1860, 1870, and 1940.](image8)"}

In 2008, after Barack Obama's first victory, a majority of voters, regardless of their candidate preference, were in favor of leaders from both parties working together. Specifically, 59% of voters felt Republican leaders should work with Obama, while 36% wanted them to stand up to the new president [9]. This is in contrast to the feelings among those who voted for the losing candidate in 2016, where 63% of Clinton voters wanted Democratic leaders to stand up to Trump on important issues, as compared to 35% of Trump voters who wanted their leaders to work with Clinton [5].\n\nThe shift in public opinion is illustrated in the following image: `![Public opinion difference between 2008 and 2016 regarding political leaders working with newly elected presidents](image7)`. This bar chart displays the percentage of voters who believed that political leaders should work with the newly elected president or stand up to them based on data from a voter callback survey conducted from November 10-14 in both 2008 and 2016.\n\nIn 2016, among all voters, 59% preferred working with Trump, while 39% felt that Democratic leaders should stand up to Trump on important issues [7]. Unsurprisingly, there is a clear partisan divide when examining the opinions of Democratic and Republican voters. Among Democrats or those leaning Democratic, 65% supported standing up to Trump, while 84% of Republicans or those leaning Republican preferred working with Trump [7]. This reflects the increasing polarization of voter opinions over time.\n\nIn summary, voter opinions regarding political leaders working with newly elected presidents have shifted between 2008 and 2016. In 2008, there was a stronger consensus among voters in favor of cross-party collaboration, while in 2016, voters' opinions were more divided along party lines."}

Furthermore, 36% reported feeling proud, 41% sad, 41% scared, and 31% angry. The higher number of positive emotions may indicate a general sense of optimism, albeit tinged with uncertainty and negative sentiments. This may underscore the deeply polarizing nature of Trump's rhetoric, as shown in [9], where some Trump supporters used words like \"happy\" and \"surprised\" to describe their feelings, while others expressed \"shock\" and curiosity about the outcome.\n\nTo illustrate the contrasting emotions felt towards Trump and Obama's elections, consider image1:\n\n![Image 1 - A bar chart comparing perceived success between Trump 2016 and Obama 2008.](image1)\n\nIn this image1, the data reveals a sharp contrast in how voters perceived the two elections. Compared to Obama's 67% successful ratings and 22% unsuccessful ratings, Trump received 56% and 39%, respectively.

However, when breaking down the data by location, there is a noticeable disparity.\n\nIn rural areas, an overwhelming majority (77%) uses a radio set for listening, while 39% use a mobile phone. This trend indicates that traditional radio sets remain the primary means of accessing radio content in rural areas. On the other hand, in urban areas, 70% use a mobile phone and 49% use a radio, suggesting a more even distribution and a higher reliance on mobile phones for urban listeners.\n\nThere are also slight differences in radio usage between genders, with males showing a slightly higher preference for mobile phone usage (43%) compared to females (36%).

Unfortunately, the exact combination of losses (L1 loss and without GIoU loss) is not presented directly in the image1 table. However, we can find the corresponding AP50 value by looking at the results that come closest to this configuration:\n\nFrom text quote [5], we learn that combining both L1 and GIoU losses results in a good performance of 40.6 AP (and 60.2 APL) on the COCO validation set. Since the question asks for a configuration without GIoU loss, we should expect the performance to be inferior compared to the given results.\n\nBy looking at the image1 description, we can find the closest results in the second row of the table, where DETR uses `class` and `GIoU`:\n\n- AP: 39.9\n- Δ: -0.7\n- AP50: 61.6\n- Δ: 0\n\nIn this configuration, we observe the closest results for the desired loss combination. We see that AP is lower than the combined configuration and the ΔAP is negative, which, as intended, confirms that this configuration performs worse than a combined loss system.\n\nMoreover, we find the AP50 value in the same row, which is relevant to the user question.

Here's a more detailed breakdown:\n\n1. **Generation**: The language model generates outputs based on the given input or context.\n2. **Review**: A critic model examines the generated outputs for correctness, completeness, and relevance.\n3. **Feedback**: The critic model provides feedback on the generated outputs, identifying potential issues or areas for improvement.\n4. **Refinement**: External models or tools are employed to refine the outputs based on the feedback received.

The tree structure is then traversed starting from the root, with top nodes being retrieved at each level based on cosine similarity to the query vector. The context is retrieved from the selected nodes and combined with the query to generate an answer using a language model.\n\nOn the other hand, Collapsed Tree Retrieval (B in image3) starts similarly by encoding the query. But instead of traversing the tree layer by layer, the tree is collapsed into a single layer, and nodes are retrieved based on cosine similarity until reaching a threshold number of tokens. The retrieved context is then combined with the query to produce an answer using a language model.\n\nThe image4 further illustrates the difference in their performance, with the Collapsed Tree method peaking at 2000 tokens with the best F1 score, slightly decreasing as the context length increases. In comparison, the Tree Traversal method shows a steady increase in F1 score with context length, but it overall performs lower than the collapsed tree method. The caption of image4 also suggests using the collapsed tree with 2000 tokens for the best results in the QASPER dataset.\n\nIn conclusion, while both methods involve traversing a tree structure, the Collapsed Tree Retrieval method evaluates nodes collectively across all layers to find the most relevant ones, while the Tree Traversal method traverses the tree layer-by-layer, pruning and selecting the most relevant nodes at each level. The Collapsed Tree approach has been found to perform better in certain scenarios, but the Tree Traversal method could also be more advantageous in others, depending on the specific requirements of the task at hand."}

Our method offers competitive performance for Uyghur in unsupervised cross-lingual NER, requiring fewer resources (quotes [4] and [6]).\n\n![The \"Translation\" model outperforms other models in Spanish, Dutch, and German cross-lingual NER (image4)](image4)\n\nTo further explore the competitive nature of our method, consider that when using word embeddings to translate words not covered by the dictionary in Mayhew et al.'s (2017) paper, our method shows promising results (quote [6]). This indicates the effectiveness of the method in handling low-resource languages like Uyghur.\n\nIn this response, we analyzed the given quotes, concluded that the \"Translation\" model performs best for the cross-lingual NER task for Spanish, Dutch, and German, and presented the case for our method as a competitive choice for low-resource languages like Uyghur.

For the Image Generation category, the SFT dataset consists of highly aesthetic images, carefully selected and curated using an aesthetic classifier [6]. The Visual Chat and Interleaved Text/Image Generation categories focus on high-quality data collection following strategies recommended by recent work, ensuring that the model can handle and generate interleaved text and image content effectively [4].\n\nThe Safety category is particularly important, as it includes a collection of prompts that can potentially provoke the model to produce unsafe content. Matching these prompts with refusal responses aids in teaching the model to refrain from generating harmful or inappropriate content during inference [7].\n\nTherefore, the SFT dataset statistics are directly related to the Chameleon model's inference strategy, as careful selection and curation of relevant categories enable the model to understand and generate mixed-modal documents while maintaining safety and quality standards.\n\n![The Chameleon Mixed-Modal Auto-Regressive Language Model (LM), illustrating pre-training prompts and output generation with text and image tokens.](image1)\n\nIn summary, the supervised fine-tuning dataset statistics relate to the Chameleon model's inference strategy by providing essential categories focused on various tasks, ensuring the model's ability to generate high-quality mixed-modal documents while maintaining safety standards."}

The tables and the texts explaining the tables are extracted from the papers to create (table, description) pairs for the task of data-to-text generation. From all the table descriptions of SciGen, we first filter the check-worthy scientific claims following the criteria established by  Lee et al.  ( 2009 ) for academic writing 1 . We focus on the descriptions that serve the purpose of “highlighting and commenting on key data”, i.e. , describing research findings based on the data presented in scientific tables. Given the task’s ob- jective nature and to save the cost of human labor, we hire a graduate student majoring in computer science to manually select scientific claims based on the aforementioned criteria using the user inter- face in Appendix  A.2 . This decision was based on a pilot annotation which showed that a well-trained annotator can achieve over   $95\\%$   accuracy in filtering scientific claims. To safeguard the quality, we include an option to mark the claim as “Discard-It’s not a claim, or it’s an incomplete, or not grammat- ically correct sentence.” during the subsequent claim verification process. Using this approach, we filtered out 872 real-world scientific claims from 1,301 table descriptions in the SciGen dataset. \n[10] The NEI claims (bottom half; Table  3 ) also ex- hibit diverse reasoning patterns. The two most common features for un verifiable claims are insuf- ficient evidence in the table and the lack of back- ground knowledge. The lack of closed-domain knowledge is another reason for NEI, where ad- ditional information in the paper is necessary to verify the claim. Other reasons include the use of vague pronouns ( e.g. , “it”, “this”) brings ambiguity to the claim. These distinct refuted and NEI reason- ing types highlight the unique features of S CI T AB , making it a more comprehensive and realistic rep- resent ation of the challenges faced in real-world scientific fact-checking. \n\nTogether, these quotes provide insight into the most common reasons for refuted claims in the S CI T AB dataset, as well as the diverse reasoning patterns of the NEI claims."}

As the number of entities in the sentence increases, the performance of both systems decreases; however, DyGIE consistently outperforms DyGIE-RelProp. Although the addition of relation propagation in DyGIE-RelProp attempts to address the decline in performance as the number of entities increases, it is not as effective as DyGIE without relation propagation.\n\nUtilizing relation propagation has certain implications for model performance. While it can help mitigate the decline in relation extraction performance for sentences with more entities, as demonstrated by DyGIE-RelProp's performance relative to DyGIE, it may not be enough to completely negate the effect of an increasing number of entities. Nevertheless, incorporating relation propagation can contribute to maintaining a reasonable level of performance for relation extraction tasks in sentences with multiple entities.\n\n![DyGIE generally outperforms DyGIE-RelProp in relation extraction as the number of entities in a sentence increases, but relation propagation in DyGIE-RelProp attempts to alleviate the decline in performance](image7)\n\nReference: `![DyGIE generally outperforms DyGIE-RelProp in relation extraction as the number of entities in a sentence increases, but relation propagation in DyGIE-RelProp attempts to alleviate the decline in performance](image7)`"}

This is because repetition control often includes features that discourage bigrams (two-grams) that have appeared in previous utterances, which prevents the model from producing bigrams that commonly occur in many questions, such as \"do you\" and \"what is\". However, this can be mitigated by introducing an extra setting, where the feature that discourages bigrams is not used for weighted decoding during beam search, but is used to rerank the candidates after beam search. This allows the model to produce necessary question-asking bigrams, but may slightly increase external bigram repetition.\n\nAs shown in [image4], the Question-controlled CT with repetition control (purple line with squares) shows a more gradual increase in question percentage and reaches a lower maximum percentage near 80% as the control level increases, compared to the Question-controlled CT (blue line with circles) without repetition control. This demonstrates the effect of repetition control on reducing question-asking frequency.\n\nIn addition, the left plot of [image1] shows that the Repetition (WD) model has a lower engagingness rating compared to the Question (CT) model, indicating that controlling repetition alone may not be sufficient in improving the engagingness of generated text, and other controls such as question-asking should also be considered."}

The candidate news is also processed by a news encoder to obtain its vector representation. A dot product operation computes the score indicating the relevance of the candidate news to the user's interests. For LSTUR-ini, the long-term user representation (LTUR) is used to initialize the hidden state of the GRU network in the short-term user representation model (image2).\n\n2. **LSTUR-con**:\n   LSTUR-con processes the user's click history in a similar manner to LSTUR-ini but concatenates the user-level embedding, derived from click history, with a fixed user embedding, to form a combined user vector. This combined vector is then processed by GRU cells alongside news encoders to handle click history. The dot product between the user's combined representation and the candidate news encoding generates a score for the news recommendation fit. In LSTUR-con, the long-term user representation is concatenated with the short-term user representation as the final user representation (image2).\n\nIn summary, the main difference between LSTUR-ini and LSTUR-con is that LSTUR-ini initializes the hidden state of the GRU network in the short-term user representation model with the long-term user representation, while LSTUR-con concatenates the long-term user representation with the short-term user representation as the final user representation.

It iterates a specified number of times or until a threshold is met. The process consists of Query → Retrieve → Generate → Judge, repeating these steps until the desired output is achieved or the maximum number of iterations is reached. An example of this is ITER-RETGEN (image2, left side).\n\nThe **recursive retrieval** process gradually refines the user query and divides problems into sub-problems, continuously solving complex problems through retrieval and generation. Utilizing query transformation/decomposition, this process uses the output of each iteration as input for the next one. The process consists of Query → Retrieve → Generate → Judge → Query Transformation, and it repeats these steps until the desired output is achieved or the maximum number of iterations is reached. An example of this is IRCoT and ToC (image11).\n\nThe **adaptive retrieval** process allows the RAG system to decide when external knowledge retrieval is needed. It can autonomously determine when to stop retrieval and generation using special tokens. The process consists of Query → Judge → Retrieve (on-demand) → Generate → Query Transformation → Judge. This process adapts to the user's query, providing a more dynamic retrieval method. An example of this is Flare and Self-RAG (image12).\n\nThese different retrieval methods cater to various tasks and datasets as shown in image3. Depending on the complexity of the NLP application, iterative, recursive, or adaptive retrieval can be employed to improve the generation's accuracy and relevance.\n\nIn summary, the iterative retrieval process focuses on gathering richer and more targeted context from the knowledge base, the recursive retrieval process helps to refine complex problems, and adaptive retrieval offers a more responsive and dynamic approach to retrieval (as cited in the few provided text quotes).

For instance, when adding a gold paragraph to the open-domain 500 paragraphs setting, the F1 score improves from 39.12 to 53.12. This indicates that the availability of gold paragraphs contributes to enhanced performance in multi-hop question answering models (image4).\n\nOn the other hand, the use of distractors can affect F1 scores as well. When a single-paragraph BERT model is trained in the distractor setting, meaning it is trained on two gold paragraphs paired with eight spurious paragraphs selected using TF-IDF similarity with the question, it achieves 67.08 F1 (image7 and image8). This suggests that the majority of HotPotQA questions are answerable in the distractor setting using a single-hop model, indicating that carefully chosen distractors can help to improve model performance.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that if the distractors are insufficient or not challenging enough, the model might still struggle. For example, if 500 distractors are still insufficient for single-paragraph BERT to achieve satisfactory performance, it implies that future multi-hop RC datasets can develop improved methods for distractor collection (image11).\n\nIn summary, the inclusion of gold paragraphs enhances the F1 score in multi-hop question answering models, while carefully chosen distractors can help the model perform better.

Specifically, BERT's median and max scores on the Test set dropped substantially in comparison to image1's data, making it clear that BERT does not excel at this task when the spurious cues are minimized.\n\nIn conclusion, the adversarial transformation negatively impacts BERT's performance relative to other models, which implies that BERT has not truly learned about argument comprehension; instead, it has been relying on spurious cues within the dataset.\n\n![BERT's performance significantly declines in comparison to other models on the adversarial dataset, suggesting that it does not truly understand argument comprehension without relying on spurious cues.](image5)"}

This is because MMMU covers a broader range of image types and sources, including textbooks and the internet, and it offers open and multiple-choice answers.\n\nIn terms of depth, MMMU challenges models with complex reasoning tasks, which is evident in its position in the graph in image4 (on the left side). Additionally, MMMU features detailed questions across various subject areas involving interleaved text and images, optional answers, and different difficulty levels (see image5). This design allows MMMU to test large multimodal models' (LMMs) and large language models' (LLMs) understanding and reasoning skills more effectively.\n\nWhen using the MMMU benchmark for evaluating LMMs and LLMs, it is crucial to consider the following aspects:\n\n1. **Heterogeneous Image Types**: MMMU contains 30 image formats, such as diagrams, tables, charts, photographs, paintings, chemical structures, medical images, and sheet music. The diversity of image types helps assess a model's ability to process images from various domains.\n2. **Interleaved Text and Images**: MMMU questions often interleave text and images, requiring models to understand and reason based on both modalities. This setup allows for an assessment of a model's ability to integrate information and perform complex reasoning simultaneously.\n3. **Expert-level Skills Test**: MMMU's questions test expert-level visual perception, knowledge, and reasoning abilities. The benchmark sets a high standard for evaluating models as it assesses their potential to perform at an advanced level.\n\nIn conclusion, the MMMU benchmark offers a more comprehensive evaluation of LMMs' and LLMs' abilities compared to other benchmarks, thanks to its diversity in image types, interleaved text and image questions, and high standards for expert-level skills.\n\nComparing to other benchmarks: `![MMMU offers a more comprehensive evaluation in terms of depth and breadth than other benchmarks](image4)`\nEvaluation aspects: `![Heterogeneous image types, interleaved text and images, and expert-level skills test](image4,image5)`"}

It involves recognition of the damaged base of a nucleotide by a glycosylase enzyme and its removal, followed by addition of new normal base(s) by a specific polymerase enzyme, and regaining the phosphodiester bonds by DNA ligase [5].\n\n- **Nucleotide Excision Repair (NER)** is one of the most important DNA repair systems, as it can excise DNA lesions such as UV-induced pyrimidine dimers as well as more bulky adducts of DNA. This repair system is highly conserved among species [6].\n\n- **Direct Reversal Repair** can directly repair UV-induced pyrimidine dimer formation and alkylation adducts by DNA photolyase enzymes and alkyl-transferase proteins, respectively. Direct reversal repair mechanisms are not followed by incision of DNA strands or resynthesis of new DNA [11].\n\n- **Mismatch Repair (MMR)** recognizes and corrects mismatched or unpaired bases that result from errors of DNA polymerase during DNA replication. It involves complex reactions and interactions of many enzymes, proteins, and signal discrimination factors to recognize the mutated strand first and locate the site of the mismatched pair [12].\n\n- **Transcription-Coupled Repair (TCR)** is a DNA repair mechanism that rapidly removes bulky lesions in the template strand of actively transcribed genes, thus preventing transcription-blocking lesions and securing the normal function of genes [4].\n\n- **Recombination Repair**, such as homologous recombination repair (HR) and non-homologous end-joining repair, primarily aims at repairing double-strand breaks of DNA [7].\n\nBy integrating textual and image evidence, we can clearly observe that Figure 11 presents various essential DNA repair mechanisms, each addressing specific types of DNA damage and maintaining genome stability.\n\n[Figure 11](image4) demonstrates DNA repair mechanisms, including base excision repair (BER), nucleotide excision repair (NER), direct reversal repair, mismatch repair (MMR), transcription-coupled repair (TCR), and recombination repair."}

Given a logical reasoning problem, it breaks down the problem into a set of rules, facts, and queries. Each problem can result in a distinct set of symbolic representations, as illustrated in image5.\n\n2. **Symbolic Reasoner**: This component performs logical inference on the formulated problem using various methods such as Logic Programming, First-order Logic Prover, and Constraint Optimization. Based on the nature of the problem, different methods are chosen. For instance, Logic Programming is suitable for problems that involve rules and relationships between entities, while First-order Logic Provers are ideal for entailment problems where determining whether new statements can be inferred based on existing knowledge. Constraint Optimization is selected for problems that deal with constraints and finding optimal solutions.\n\n3. **Result Interpreter**: The final module interprets the symbolic answer derived by the Symbolic Reasoner to provide a comprehensible answer to the original problem posed. It bridges the gap between formal logic and natural language, ensuring that the final answer aligns with the input question and is formulated accordingly. An example of this process is described in image3, where the reasoning problem, symbolic logic formulation, and predicates/premises are used to derive the conclusion in natural language.\n\nThis modular framework allows LOGIC-LM to effectively solve a wide range of logical reasoning problems by leveraging the power of LLMs for problem formulation, utilizing the strength of symbolic reasoners for precise and logical reasoning, and finally translating the results back to natural language using the result interpreter. This combination of language processing models, logic-based reasoning, and natural language processing aligns with the components presented in image5 and the process illustrated in image6."}

In contrast, the formal rewrites have a peak slightly to the right of zero, showing a shift towards increased formality.\n\n![The formal rewrites have a higher mean formality score than the original informal sentences](image4)\n\nThis observation aligns with text quote [10], which mentions that humans tend to make lexical/character-level edits when rewriting sentences more formally, causing a shift in the formality score distribution. Furthermore, quote [2] states that there is a general increase in mean formality score from informal (-1.06) to formal rewrites (0.12) in the train set.\n\nIn short, the mean formality score of formal rewrites is higher than that of the original informal sentences by approximately 1.18 points. This change suggests that the rewriting process effectively increases formality, as can be visualized in the figure 2 and supported by the provided text quotes."}

The Recursive Retrieval process gradually refines the user query and divides problems into sub-problems, continuously solving complex problems through retrieval and generation. The Adaptive Retrieval process enables the RAG system to decide when external knowledge retrieval is needed, determining when to stop retrieval and generation autonomously.\n\nEach of these retrieval processes plays a crucial role in the RAG system, and the appropriate use of these methods will largely depend on the specific context and requirements of the task at hand.

If we consider the text quotes, [1], [2], [6], [7], and [12], they mention various aspects of Assurance services, including financial advisory and risk management, across different industries and regions. Complementing this, image2 and image6 provide further insights into the Assurance division's global presence, indicating that it operates in 12 and 7 countries, respectively. As for employees, image2 cites 1914 Assurance employees, while image6 mentions 500 employees in the Assurance division.\n\nAs for the Consulting division, its focus lies in shaping the digital and IT market, process optimization, and transformation for public and private sectors ([3], [4], [10], [11], and [12]).

It also refers the reader to the Intel Packaging Handbook for detailed information.\n\nImage 5 provides detailed thermal resistance information for various electronic parts, including the 8051AH and 8751BH.\n\n![Approximate thermal resistance comparison between 8051AH and 8751BH](image5)\n\nFrom the image, we can observe the following thermal resistance values for each part:\n\n- For 8051AH:\n  - θja (Junction-to-ambient thermal resistance) values are approximately 45-46°C/W.\n  - θjc (Junction-to-case thermal resistance) values are approximately 15-16°C/W, but note that this might vary depending on the part prefix (P, D, or N).\n- For 8751BH:\n  - θja values are around 36°C/W.\n  - θjc values are approximately 12°C/W.\n\nIt's important to note that thermal impedance values might also depend on other factors such as the package type, pin count, and operating conditions.\n\nIn conclusion, the 8751BH has a lower junction-to-ambient thermal resistance (θja) at around 36°C/W compared to the 8051AH's 45-46°C/W. The 8751BH also has a lower junction-to-case thermal resistance (θjc) than most 8051AH variants, at approximately 12°C/W compared to the 8051AH's 15-16°C/W. These differences in thermal resistance can impact the cooling requirements and overall thermal performance of the microcontrollers in various applications."}

This tool generates tables that show the occurrence probabilities of disease and injury types typically sustained in a contingency by a population at risk [6]. PCOF tables exist within casualty categories of wounded in action, nonbattle injuries, disease, and outpatient visits for a given combat or noncombat scenario throughout the range of military operations (ROMO) [6].\n\nThe military medical planning community has lacked a functional and accurate means of estimating PCOFs, which are necessary to develop the patient streams used in health care simulations [6]. The PCOF tool, once accredited, will be approved as the Joint patient occurrence generating application [9]. This tool enables planners to employ baselined, mission-centric PCOF data and tailor it to more precisely fit the anticipated mission, helping inform decision-makers on the types of patient conditions to expect [7].\n\nHere's how the PCOF tool impacts various military operations:\n\n- **Combat Operations**: PCOF tables help in estimating probabilities of injuries and diseases during combat scenarios. This information is essential for health care simulation and preparing medical personnel for potential patient conditions [6].\n- **Noncombat Scenarios**: The PCOF tool also accounts for nonbattle injuries and diseases in noncombat situations, providing a comprehensive view of potential casualties throughout various military operations [6].\n- **Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief**: PCOF tables for humanitarian assistance and disaster relief have been developed using patient encounter data from Operations Continuing Promise, Pacific Partnership, and various natural disasters like earthquakes, tsunamis, hurricanes, and floods [12]. This demonstrates the application of the PCOF tool in humanitarian contexts where the military might provide support.\n\nIn summary, the Patient Condition Occurrence Frequency (PCOF) tool is a crucial estimation tool in military operations, providing vital information on the probabilities of injuries and diseases in both combat and noncombat scenarios. This tool also contributes to the preparation and planning of health care simulations, ensuring that military medical personnel are well-equipped to handle various patient conditions.\n\n![The PCOF tool generates tables that show the occurrence probabilities of disease and injury types typically sustained in a contingency by a population at risk.](image5)"}

This process corresponds to the Levels of Analytics, which builds upon the value chain by providing a hierarchy of analytical techniques that organizations can use to extract insights from their data.\n\nThe Levels of Analytics, as depicted in [image7](image7), shows how organizations can move from basic reporting to sophisticated predictive modeling and optimization. These techniques become increasingly intelligent and valuable as one moves up the hierarchy, and they align with the various stages of the Analytics Value Chain.\n\nFor example, basic reporting (Level 1) corresponds to the reporting phase of the Analytics Value Chain, where organizations generate reports and dashboards to better understand \"what happened.\" Meanwhile, predictive modeling (Level 6) aligns with the analysis phase of the Analytics Value Chain, where organizations use statistical models to answer questions like \"why is this happening?\" and \"what will happen next?\"\n\nBy combining these two concepts, organizations can create a comprehensive framework for transforming data into valuable insights and actions.

In the F1 generation, when a homozygous dominant (PP) and a homozygous recessive (pp) pea plant are crossed, all offspring will be heterozygous (Pp) and display the dominant trait (purple flowers) [1, 2, 4, 8].\n\nWhen these F1 hybrid plants are self-crossed, their gametes have an equal chance of containing either the dominant (P) or recessive (p) allele [3]. Consequently, the F2 generation offspring will have a phenotypic ratio of 3 purple flowers to 1 white flower (3:1) since purple is the dominant trait. The genotypic ratios will be 1 homozygous dominant (PP): 2 heterozygous (Pp): 1 homozygous recessive (pp) [11].\n\nThe image provided further illustrates this concept [12]:\n![The image is a genetic cross diagram of the F1 and F2 generations of a Mendelian inheritance experiment with pea plants. It shows a 3:1 phenotypic ratio of purple flowers to white flowers in the F2 generation, reflecting Mendel's law.](image1)\n\nIn summary, Mendelian inheritance explains the phenotypic and genotypic ratios observed in the F2 generation of pea plants by demonstrating that when a heterozygous individual with one dominant and one recessive allele produces gametes, both types of alleles have an equal chance of being passed on to the offspring. This results in a higher proportion of offspring expressing the dominant trait, which aligns with the 3:1 phenotypic ratio typically observed in the F2 generation."}

This is likely due to the limited capacity of our short-term memory, which can only hold up to four chunks of information at a time [9, 10].\n\nTherefore, when presenting information, it is crucial to leverage visuals whenever possible, as this will maximize audience comprehension and retention, whether it be in a corporate setting or even in a TED talk, which typically lasts for nearly 20 minutes [11], or in smaller increments, as people learn best in 20-minute intervals [12].\n\nIn conclusion, after three days, people remember 65% of what they see [image3], whereas they only remember 10% of what they hear [image8]. Utilizing visual aids in presentations can greatly enhance the audience's ability to comprehend and recall the presented information.\n\n![People remember 65% of what they visually perceive after three days as opposed to only 10% of what they hear](image3)\n![Memory retention chart indicating 65% of visual information and 10% of auditory information is retained after three days](image8)"}

According to the table, the equation to calculate the separation distance for this frequency range (80 MHz to 800 MHz) is:\n\nd = [3.5/E1] * sqrt(P)\n\nIn this case, E1 is 800 MHz (since the frequency is within this range) and P is 10 W. However, the table provides example values in terms of watts, not in volts. To use the table's example values, we need to convert the rated maximum output power from watts to volts. To do this, we can use the formula:\n\nP(W) = V²/R\n\nWe can rearrange this formula to solve for V:\n\nV(V) = sqrt(P(W) * R(Ω))\n\nAssuming the resistance (R) is 50 Ω (a typical value for RF transmitters), we can calculate the voltage (V) as:\n\nV(V) = sqrt(10 W * 50 Ω) = sqrt(500 WΩ) = 22.36 volts\n\nUsing the table's example values for a power of 10 W and voltage of 22.36 V, we can calculate the separation distance (d) as:\n\nd = [3.5/800 MHz] * sqrt(10 W) = 0.0035 km * sqrt(10) = 0.035 km = 35 m\n\nTherefore, the minimum separation distance required for this transmitter is 35 meters.\n\n![Minimum separation distance required for a transmitter with a frequency of 500 MHz and a rated maximum output power of 10 W is 35 meters.](image2)"}

In the case of public libraries, maps mainly focus on the Netherlands (images1, 3, 6, and 7), while the volcanoes map covers a global scale (image4). However, this geographical difference is expected due to the distinct subjects being presented.\n\nTo summarize the answer to the user question, both geographical distributions of volcanoes and public libraries in the Netherlands are visually represented using maps with red dots and a table-based data presentation for public libraries. The primary difference is the geographical scope and context – the volcanoes map is global in scale, whereas public libraries are mainly presented in the context of the Netherlands."}

Image5 specifically points out the USB-C charging and data port with power delivery and Thunderbolt 3 support.\n\nOn the other side of the laptop, as shown in image1 and image5, the user can find an audio jack, USB-C charging and data port with power delivery and Thunderbolt 3 support (image5), a power button with fingerprint reader (image5), and a security-lock slot (image7). The latter allows users to attach their computer to a desk or other fixture through a security cable lock to prevent theft.\n\nFor network connectivity, an Ethernet connector is available. As stated in [6], when the green indicator is on, the computer is connected to a LAN, and when the yellow indicator blinks, data is being transmitted. According to [7], if the computer is connected to a docking station, users should use the Ethernet connector on the docking station instead of the one on the computer.\n\nLastly, image8 indicates the presence of a USB-C connector, a USB-C connector (Thunderbolt 3 compatible), a docking-station connector, fan louvers, a smart-card slot, and a security-lock slot. The user can refer to [3], [9], [12], and [8] for more information about these connectors and their functions.\n\nIn summary, the Lenovo ThinkPad laptop has multiple connectors and slots on both sides, including USB-C ports, USB ports, HDMI and Mini DisplayPort, Ethernet, SD card slots, audio jacks, security-lock slots, and fingerprint readers, which all serve different purposes for data transfer, charging, connectivity, and security."}

It shows the esophagus in relation to surrounding structures such as the aorta, trachea, and various arteries.\n\nHowever, the specific level of the esophagus relative to the cardioesophageal junction is not directly indicated in this image. The cardioesophageal junction is mentioned in image4, which is a detailed anatomical diagram showing the esophagus in relation to the human spine and thoracic structure. This image includes the different sections of the esophagus - cervical, upper thoracic, mid thoracic, and lower thoracic esophagus - as measured from the incisors (teeth). The vertebral levels are marked alongside the diagram to indicate the corresponding anatomy of the spine.\n\nBased on the text quotes, we know that the cervical esophagus extends from the pharyngeal junction to the supra sternal notch, which is approximately at the level of T1 in the spine. The thoracic esophagus extends from the supra sternal notch to the diaphragmatic hiatus, which is approximately at the level of T10 in the spine. The cardioesophageal junction is located at the lower end of the esophagus, so the upper saculation seen in image3, which extends superiorly just above the level of the aortic arch, is likely located in the upper or mid thoracic esophagus, several vertebral levels above the cardioesophageal junction.\n\nTo summarize, based on the information provided, the upper saculation seen in image3 is located in the upper or mid thoracic esophagus, several vertebral levels above the cardioesophageal junction.

However, there is a decrease in consumer health information and patient access to medical records, which is a concerning trend considering the increasing emphasis on patient empowerment and engagement. \n\nFor intranet functions, there is a significant projected reduction in organizations without an intranet, indicating a shift towards internal digitalization. Functions such as posting policies and procedures and staff communication are expected to see a decrease in use, while access to patient clinical information and physician access for clinical orders are projected to see an increase.\n\nThese trends suggest that healthcare organizations will need to focus on enhancing their digital capabilities, both externally and internally. This will likely require a shift in staffing needs, with a greater emphasis on roles related to digital transformation, network support, clinical informatics, process/workflow design, and application support. The bar chart in image5, which shows the percentage distribution of different roles or functions, further supports this, with roles such as Network Support, Clinical Informaticists, and Process/Workflow Design featuring prominently.\n\nMoreover, the chart in image6 indicates a significant increase in the use of Intranet for Access to Patient Clinical Information and Physician Access for Clinical Orders, which suggests the need for a robust Intranet system and skilled professionals to manage and maintain it.\n\nIn conclusion, the trends in web and intranet functions projected in the coming years suggest a need for healthcare organizations to focus on enhancing their digital capabilities and shifting their staffing needs accordingly. This will likely involve investing in roles related to digital transformation, network support, clinical informatics, process/workflow design, and application support.\n\n![A shift in staffing needs towards roles related to digital transformation, network support, clinical informatics, process/workflow design, and application support due to the trends in web and intranet functions projected in the coming years](image6)"}

Therefore, I'm unable to provide an answer to this question based on the provided quotes.\n\nRegarding the text quotes, there are several interesting points. For instance, the diminishing marginal utility concept is illustrated in image1, which shows that as more hot dogs are consumed, the utility decreases. This concept is related to the idea of focused practice resulting in increased utility due to improved activity outcome (text quote [5]).\n\nMoreover, text quote [2] highlights the benefits of large school athletes having more focused, directed practice hours, which could potentially lead to better performance. This idea is supported by image4 and image5, which show that experts and the best violinists, respectively, accumulate significantly more practice hours than amateurs and other groups, leading to superior outcomes.\n\nLastly, the concept of focus being crucial for mastery is raised in text quote [4] and image8.

This is depicted in image2, which shows a table illustrating the diminishing marginal utility of hot dog consumption.\n\nAs more hot dogs are consumed, the utility value decreases. For example, consuming the first hot dog results in a utility of +6, while consuming the 66th hot dog results in a decrease of utility by 50 points (achieving a utility of -50 for the 66th hot dog). This trend continues until the 64th hot dog, at which point the utility dramatically jumps from -50 to +5000. This jump could indicate a separate factor influencing the utility derived from hot dog consumption, such as a competitive drive to surpass a personal best or a rivaling competitor (seen in the center of image2).\n\nImage4 offers a more detailed representation of the diminishing marginal utility of hot dog consumption, showing a table with the number of hot dogs consumed on the left side and the utility derived from each hot dog on the right side.

Long bladed knives stored in an upright position can be a potential hazard. Hollow items like cups, glasses, pans should be loaded with the opening facing downwards to prevent water from collecting inside. Delicate dishware should be placed in the upper basket, while larger and heavier items should go in the lower basket. Ensure that all items are stacked securely and can't tip over, and that the spray arms can rotate freely during washing.\n\n![Proper cutlery arrangement in the upper basket](image3)\n\n- For dishes, scrape off any large amounts of leftover food before loading. It's not necessary to rinse the dishes under running water. Large items and the most difficult to clean items should be placed in the lower basket, such as pots, pans, lids, serving dishes, and bowls. The maximum diameter advised for plates in front of the detergent dispenser is of $19\\,\\mathsf{c m}$. Plastic items should only be washed if they are marked \"dishwasher safe\".\n\n![Proper arrangement of dishes in the lower basket](image8)\n\nThe potential consequences of improper loading include poor washing quality, energy inefficiency, and damage to the dishes or the dishwasher itself.\n\n![Warning about the consequences of improper loading](image5)\n\nTo summarize, when loading a dishwasher, always pay attention to how cutlery and dishes are arranged to ensure proper washing performance, energy efficiency, and the longevity of your dishes and dishwasher."}

During the period from 1960 to 2007, the gestalt principle of \"good gestalt\" (text quote [7]) can be applied, meaning that there was a tendency to prioritize a global regularity over spatial relations in terms of how healthcare spending was perceived in the U.S. Furthermore, the general increase in healthcare spending over time showcases a \"law of good gestalt\" (text quote [10]) as it aimed for conciseness, since the data was moving in a single direction.\n\n![U.S. Space Travel: A Timeline of Manned NASA Flights (1961-2011)](image3)\n_{U.S. Space Travel: A Timeline of Manned NASA Flights (1961-2011) - The law of continuity may be applied here, as the timeline shows a continuous development of U.S. space travel missions.}\n\nSo, although no direct relationship has been established, it's clear that U.S. healthcare spending as a percentage of GDP increased significantly from 1960 to 2007, while the Space Race took place as part of a broader investment in scientific and technological developments in the United States.\n\nTo summarize:\n\n- The U.S. healthcare spending as a percentage of GDP increased from 1960 to 2007 (indirectly related to Space Race).\n- The Space Race indirectly influenced U.S. spending in various sectors, such as technology and science.\n- U.S. spending in those areas was perceived as having a global regularity over spatial relations.\n- The general increase in healthcare spending followed a \"law of good gestalt,\" being concise and moving consistently in one direction over time."}

In this interleaved response, I will highlight the components associated with fuel supply using both text and image quotes.\n\nThe fuel supply system is the starting point of the fuel path in an engine system. From the fuel supply, the fuel is first filtered to remove impurities, and then it is pumped under high pressure to the fuel rail by the fuel pump. The fuel rail distributes fuel to the individual fuel injectors.\n\nAs shown in the block diagram (image8), the fuel flows from the \"FUEL SUPPLY SYSTEM\" to both the \"COLD START SYSTEM\" and the \"FUEL METERING SYSTEM,\" which then supply the \"ENGINE.\"\n\nIn addition to these components, image2 depicts a fuel system using an anti-surge tank, which also plays a role in fuel supply. The low-pressure pump moves fuel from the gasoline tank to the surge tank, which ensures a constant supply of fuel to the engine.\n\nIn summary, the fuel supply system is directly connected to the fuel filter, fuel pump, fuel rail, cold start system, and fuel metering system, ultimately providing fuel to the engine. Here's the answer in a clear and simple sentence:\n\nThe fuel supply system is connected to the fuel filter, fuel pump, fuel rail, cold start system, and fuel metering system, which deliver fuel to the engine.\n\n��perp![[The fuel supply system is connected to the fuel filter, fuel pump, fuel rail, cold start system, and fuel metering system, which deliver fuel to the engine.](image8)]"}

Reporting and analysis are key components of the decision and action stages.\n\nReporting, as depicted in [image1], is the initial phase where data is transformed into information. In this stage, data is collected, stored, and organized to provide descriptive information that helps answer questions about what has happened in the past. This is the first step in the analytics value chain, created to enable better decision-making and ultimately lead to increased value.\n\nIn contrast, analysis is a more forward-looking, prescriptive approach that focuses on why something has happened. It dives deeper into the data to provide insights and findings, helping answer questions about the future. Analysis consists of several techniques along the spectrum of business intelligence to business analytics. Referring to [image7], standard reports and ad-hoc reports are more basic techniques, while statistical analysis and predictive modeling enable user to evaluate \"Why is this happening?\" and \"What will happen next?\" respectively.\n\nThe comparison of reporting and analysis in the table from [image4] helps summarize their differences:\n\n- Reporting is descriptive and backward-looking, while analysis is prescriptive and forward-looking.\n- The focus in reporting is on data-information, and in analysis it shifts to data + information-insights.\n- Reporting raises questions and analysis answers them.\n- Context plays a significant role: while reporting has no context, analysis benefits from storytelling.\n\nThese two components of the analytics value chain contribute to the progression from business intelligence to business analytics by enabling users to gain insights and improve decision-making capabilities, as described in the image [image7]:\n\n- Reporting corresponds to stages 1-4 and provides increasingly valuable information as one moves up—from standard reports, ad-hoc reports, query drilldown, and alerts.\n- Analysis corresponds to stages 5-8, where advanced techniques offer more in-depth insights, including statistical analysis, forecasting, predictive modeling, and optimization.\n\nBy effectively utilizing reporting and analysis in the analytics value chain, organizations can better understand their business, enabling them to make informed decisions and take appropriate actions—ultimately ensuring the success of their data-driven processes.\n\nIn summary, reporting and analysis are integral parts of the analytics value chain, and they significantly contribute to the progression from business intelligence (BI) to business analytics. Reporting is descriptive, backward-looking, and concerned with data-to-information transformation, while analysis is prescriptive, forward-looking, and handles data + information to produce insights that empower organizations in their decision-making processes.\n\nReporting and analysis play a significant role in the analytics value chain as depicted in `![The image illustrates a data-driven process that transforms data into value through reporting, analysis, action, and impact.](image1)`.

This is illustrated in the image quote (image1), which shows a table featuring hot dog consumption. In the context of standard consumption, marginal utility decreases as more hot dogs are consumed, starting from a high of +6 for the first hot dog and dropping to -50 for the 66th hot dog.\n\nHowever, in the competitive context, the utility jumps dramatically at 64 hot dogs, from -50 to +5000. This indicates that while the concept of diminishing marginal utility is still applicable, the utility can increase significantly under specific circumstances, such as tying a competitor for a championship (image1, center). This demonstrates that in competitive contexts, consuming more of a product can provide a substantial increase in utility despite diminishing marginal utility in standard consumption.\n\nIn conclusion, while standard consumption economics often views focusing as bad (text quote [6]), competitive contexts can transform the implications of diminishing marginal utility. Focusing on specific performance indicators, such as hot dog consumption in this case, can result in a significantly positive outcome when competing.\n\n![The image shows a table illustrating concepts of diminishing marginal utility and differential outcome related to hot dog consumption. On the left, \"Diminishing Marginal Utility\" is shown with hot dogs consumed and the utility from each. As more hot dogs are consumed, utility decreases (e.g., +6 for the first hot dog, -50 for the 66th). On the right, \"Differential Outcome\" is displayed similarly, with varying utilities. Interestingly, utility jumps dramatically at 64 hot dogs, from -50 to +5000. In the center, there's a photo of someone holding a large tray of hot dogs, labeled as the point where this person ties a competitor for a championship in 2007.](image1)\n\nIn short, diminishing marginal utility differs between standard consumption and competitive contexts as illustrated by hot dog consumption.

This includes active stakeholder participation, which ensures stakeholders are directly involved in the process, promoting a shared understanding of the project's goals. High-level and detailed requirements specifications enable stakeholders to provide input early in the project, reducing the risk of misunderstandings or misinterpretations.\n\nElicitation Methods, as shown in [image5](![Interconnected elements demonstrating agile modeling practices including various elicitation methods](image5)), are crucial for gathering and understanding stakeholder needs in a timely and efficient manner. Just-in-time (JIT) model storming allows for agile modeling sessions where stakeholder requirements can be discussed and modeled as needed, promoting flexibility and addressing changing needs. Look-ahead modeling and all-hands demos further support elicitation by enabling teams to anticipate future needs and demonstrate progress to stakeholders, promoting a shared understanding and ensuring alignment with stakeholder expectations.\n\nIn conclusion, Needs Exploration and Elicitation Methods contribute to addressing stakeholder needs in agile project management by promoting active participation, timely input, and shared understanding between stakeholders and the development team.

Each mode has its specific functionality and ideal use case. \n\nMatrix Metering Mode measures light across the entire frame, which is perfect for shooting natural landscapes [image5]. This mode ensures a balanced exposure throughout the image, capturing the subtle details in shadows and highlights.\n\nCenter Metering Mode focuses on light near the center of the screen. This mode is particularly useful when shooting portraits [image5]. By prioritizing the exposure at the center, it creates well-exposed images of your subjects, even in backlit environments.\n\nSpot Metering Mode focuses on light from a specific region, which is useful when you need to pinpoint a small area for exposure determination. This mode is particularly helpful when you want to focus on a subject's eyes or a small, bright detail in a scene [image5].\n\nPro mode also provides different focus modes to handle various subjects. AF-S (single) is ideal for stationary subjects, ensuring sharp focus when capturing still objects or scenes [image4]. On the other hand, AF-C (continuous) is made for moving subjects, maintaining focus as your subject moves through the scene [image4]. Lastly, MF (manual) allows you to manually select the subject of interest, which is great for situations like portraits where you want to ensure the subject's face is in focus [image4].\n\nIn summary, by adjusting the metering modes and focus modes in Pro mode, you can significantly enhance the quality and relevance of your photos based on the specific scenarios you are shooting in. Use these modes to capture stunning natural landscapes, well-exposed portraits, and detailed close-ups of specific subjects.\n\n$(Matrix Metering Mode)(image5), (Center Metering Mode)(image5), (and Spot Metering Mode(image5)$ can be used to optimize the exposure of landscapes, portraits, or specific regions in a frame.

This leads to few Marketing Qualified Leads progressing to the Sales Accepted Leads stage.\n\n![Low MQL to SAL conversion rate (1.50%) ](image4)\n\n2. In comparison, the conversion rate in image6 is 45-75% for Sales Accepted Leads. However, this data is from a table displaying various marketing sources and their performance metrics, not directly comparing MQL to SAL conversion rates. Still, it gives us a general idea of a reasonable conversion rate at the Sales Accepted Leads stage based on cross-industry performance.\n\n![Reasonable Sales Accepted Leads conversion rate range (45-75%) ](image6)\n\nThe sizable gap between the observed MQL to SAL conversion rates in the two images raises concerns about the marketing team's lead qualification process. This discrepancy can lead to wasted resources and missed opportunities in the sales funnel. To address this issue, the marketing and sales teams can collaborate to:\n\n- Implement a more robust lead scoring system\n- Establish a feedback loop for communication and improvement\n- Provide sales enablement content and resources\n- Regularly review conversion rates and funnel data for continuous optimization\n\nDirect Answer: The conversion rate from Marketing Qualified Leads (MQLs) to Sales Accepted Leads (SALs) varies significantly between 1.50% (image4) and 45-75% (image6). The difference implies challenges in lead qualification and communication between the marketing and sales teams, which, if not addressed, might negatively impact resource allocation and overall sales performance."}
